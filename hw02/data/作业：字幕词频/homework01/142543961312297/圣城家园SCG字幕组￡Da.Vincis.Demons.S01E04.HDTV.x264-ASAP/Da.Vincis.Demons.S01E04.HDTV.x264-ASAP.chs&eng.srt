1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,600
这里肯定以前是一块大陆 现在变成了两个大陆块
Where there are now two land masses, there once was just one.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,700
叶之书肯定就在这儿
The Book of Leaves has to be here.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,860
不惜一切手段找到探子 行动要快
Take whatever steps are necessary to find our spy. Do it quickly.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,000
摧毁洛伦佐和所有支持他的人 这是神的旨意
It is God's will to break Lorenzo and all who support him.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,710
就达芬奇的部分 我可能有些异议
With the exception of Da Vinci, I agree with you.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,540
他制造出的武器 反而可以为我们所用
Those weapons he makes, they could all be ours.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,390
罗马人多势强 天时地利
Rome has more men, and the Lord, on its side.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,000
我们有十架管风琴火炮
Well, we've got ten pipe organ muskets

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,490
一分钟可以连续发射33次
capable of firing 33 rounds a minute on ours.

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,420
十架火炮? 谢谢你告诉我
Ten guns? Good to know. Thank you for that.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,940
盖有罗马密印的信
Papers with the papal seal.

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,850
以及藏匿的地点
A list of locations to hide them.

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,580
- 你在哪儿找到的?  - 在贝奇先生的住处
- Where did you find this?  - Signor Becchi's quarters.

14
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,990
原来叛徒是你
The traitor was you.

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,870
洛伦佐 这是场误会
Lorenzo, this is a mistake.

达芬奇的恶魔 第一季 第4集

19
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,140
孩子
Boy.

20
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,000
{\an8}芬奇镇 11年前

21
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,230
我的一个猎人想装饰这盾牌
One of my huntsmen wishes this decorated.

22
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,640
你很有天赋 画一下吧 
You've a keen eye. Paint it.

23
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,860
莱昂纳多十四岁的时候
When Leonardo was 14 years old,

24
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,060
他的父亲皮耶罗发现他很有天分
his father, Piero, having found little use for the young man,

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,660
便给他一件工作
gave him a task.

26
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,130
第二天 莱昂捕捉了各种各样生物
Leo spent the next day collecting all manner of strange creatures.

27
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,430
他花了很长时间解剖它们
And so long did he labor dissecting them

28
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,830
虽然臭味令人难以忍受
that the stench was past bearing.

29
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,460
但莱昂纳多并不在意
But Leonardo didn't notice,

30
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,000
他对艺术是多么热爱啊
so great was his love for his art.

31
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,630
我完成了 父亲! 来看看吧
It's finished, Father! Come see.

32
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,330
做得不错
It will suffice.

33
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,500
瞒着那个猎人
Knowing that the hunting guide would be none the wiser,

34
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,600
皮耶罗还给他一块新盾牌
Piero presented him with a new shield,

35
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,930
把旧盾牌以一百达科特的价钱
while selling the original one to a vendor

36
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,760
卖给了小贩
for 100 ducats.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,700
后来小贩又以三百达科特的价钱
And then the vendor resold it to the Duke of Milan himself

38
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,360
卖给了米兰公爵
for 300 ducats.

39
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,930
后来皮耶罗很不情愿地
Loath to pass up such a resource,

40
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:27,600
把他的儿子交给我指导
Piero arranged for his son to be brought under my tutelage.

41
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,200
我给了中间人五十达科特
I paid a finder's fee of 50 ducats.

42
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,430
在我看来非常划算
A bargain, in my estimation.

43
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,400
他父亲卖给你一个小混蛋
His father sold you a bastard son.

44
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,430
是啊 但你知道吗?
Yes. But you know what?

45
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
要是能再有一个他这样的人
I would trade 100 of you

46
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,800
我愿意拿一百个你们这样的人来换
to have another one like him on my doorstep.

47
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,030
我觉得你喝多了 老头
I think you're drunk, old man.

48
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,800
你是嫉妒吧 波提切利
And you're jealous, Botticelli.

49
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,700
明天... 我就能醒酒
Tomorrow... I'll be sober.

50
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,360
但你还是会嫉妒
But you'll still be jealous.

51
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,230
你今天心事重重的
You're preoccupied today.  

52
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,230
作画...
Painting...

53
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,830
不只是用笔画画那样简单
is about... it's about more than just strokes.

54
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,630
还要讲究视角
There's perspective.

55
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,960
我是应该从下面的角度画你...
I mean, do I paint you from below...

56
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,230
还是应该...
or do I paint you...

57
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,630
从上面呢?
from above?

58
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,660
还要讲究象征
And then there's symbols.

59
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,600
我要不要画你抱着只狗呢?
Do I paint you with a dog in your arms?

60
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,600
狗是忠诚的象征
It's a symbol of loyalty.

61
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,200
还有颜色 用一点朱红色...
Color. How about the particular shade of vermillion...

62
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,500
画你脸颊的红润怎么样?
that I use for the blush of your cheeks?

63
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,200
还有裙子的褶皱
And the folds of your dress.

64
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,860
应该是...
Should they be...

65
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,530
雍容华贵的...
lush and sumptuous...

66
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,660
还是平整带角的?
or stiff and angular?

67
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,300
或许...
And perhaps...

68
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,330
完全不画礼服
no gown at all.

69
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,800
要是我守本分的话
If I was a dutiful servant,

70
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,160
我会考虑雇主的要求
I'd consider the needs of my patron.

71
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,560
但我不守本分 所以...
But I'm not, so that...

72
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,560
我才心事重重
That is what I struggle with.

73
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,260
你一直在看那个
You can't take your eyes off that.

74
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,430
它有什么好看的?
What's so beautiful about it?

75
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,460
它和你一样 都很神秘
It's the same thing I see in you. It's a mystery.

76
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,360
它是个迷
It's a puzzle,

77
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,100
我会不顾一切地解开它
and I will stop at nothing to figure it out.

78
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,130
弗朗西斯科
Francesco.

79
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,760
我马焦雷教堂的墙都快塌了
The walls of my Cappella Maggiore lean and crumble,

80
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,260
就像罗马城一样破败不堪
just as Rome itself is in disrepair.

81
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,130
我一定要在这建座雄伟的教堂
This place must become a grand palace of the Lord,

82
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,430
用大理石圣殿
celebrating his glory in marble

83
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,160
和世上最优秀的画作
and majestic brushstrokes

84
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,130
庆祝主的荣耀
from the most enlightened hands on earth.

85
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,700
我要建一座精美的教堂
I will build a gleaming chapel

86
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,900
在天顶画上基督和摩西的故事
with the stories of Christ and Moses frescoed on the ceiling.

87
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,160
作为礼物献给永恒仁慈的上帝
A tribute to the everlasting grace of God.

88
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,960
我保证 陛下
I can assure you, Your Holiness,

89
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,660
如果您能把您的存款从美第奇银行...
if you move your accounts from the Medici Bank...

90
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,130
转到我的银行里来 您就能获得充足的资金
to my own, you'll have all the funds you need.

91
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,560
这不只需要资金
This will require more than funds.

92
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,860
重生需要毁灭
Resurrection requires death.

93
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,730
现在
And in this case,

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,730
罗马的重生
the sacrifice for Rome's rebirth

95
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,400
需要牺牲佛罗伦萨
will be Florence.

96
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,200
可是 我们不知道能否击败美第奇家族
However, the Medici have certain capabilities we are unsure we can best.

97
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,260
我们已经尝试过一次正面进攻了
We've tried a frontal assault.

98
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,100
我们需要你进行一些
We may need you to develop

99
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,530
其它的... 暗中破坏
other... less direct contingencies.

100
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,360
美第奇家族
The Medicis are the reason

101
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,560
把佛罗伦萨变成了巫师和鸡奸者的避难所
Florence is a sanctuary for sorcerers and... sodomites.

102
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,700
他们在这城里亵渎上帝
They've turned my city away from the Lord.

103
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,700
神父 我们要一起挽救这座城
Together, Holy Father, we will turn it back.

104
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,830
召集你的部下 捷洛拉莫
Now gather your men, Girolamo.

105
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,860
你也有任务要做
You've a role to play in this as well.

106
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,800
他一生都和咱的家族在一起
He's been with our family his entire life.

107
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,400
是他教我们识的字母
He taught us our letters.

108
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,500
我不管他抱没抱过你尿尿
I don't care if he held your prick when you first took a piss.

109
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,330
贝奇无疑是间谍和叛徒
Becchi is a spy and a traitor.

110
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,600
他的姐夫欠了大笔债
His brother-in-law carries epic debts

111
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,430
只有我们查获的罗马银币才能偿还
which could only be met with the Roman scudos we found.

112
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,030
我们破解了他藏匿信件的密文
We broke the cipher in dozens of letters he hid.

113
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,260
发现一封比一封罪孽深重
Each one more incriminating than the last.

114
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,330
现在不是仁慈的时间
Now is not the time to show mercy.

115
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,300
所以我们把老朋友抓起来 和疯子达芬奇交朋友
So we're jailing old friends while making new friends with lunatics like Da Vinci.

116
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,730
我们祖父也和疯子交过朋友
Our grandfather made friends with lunatics.

117
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,630
布鲁内列斯基也是疯子 可他建造了欧洲最雄伟的教堂
Brunelleschi was one and he created the most majestic cathedral in Europe.

118
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,330
要是你相信贝奇会叛变
If you believe Becchi betrayed us,

119
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,930
那你才是疯了
it's you who's gone mad.

120
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,300
洛伦佐!
Lorenzo!

121
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,500
不要! 求求你!
No! No, please!

122
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,500
告诉我 你知道亚伯拉罕对所多玛和蛾摩拉城的祷告是什么吗?
Tell me, are you familiar with Abraham's prayer for Sodom and Gomorrah?

123
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,530
他一开始承诺能在两座罪恶之城里
How many righteous people did Abraham initially promise

124
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,000
找到多少正直的人?
he would find in those blighted cities?

125
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,330
二十个?
20?

126
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,030
很不幸
Unfortunate.

127
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,860
不! 求求你!
No! Please!

128
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,700
你说是多少?
And your answer?

129
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,800
不知道? 不知道?
No? No?

130
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,830
不知道吗?
No idea?

131
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,960
这破地方没有忠诚的人了吗
Are there no faithful in this forsaken place

132
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,130
还是所有人都被诅咒了?
or are you all damned?

133
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,160
你 站起来
You. Stand.

134
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,930
我们期望你知道答案
Let us pray you know the right reply.

135
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,830
多少?
What?

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,530
五十人! 先生
50! Signor.

137
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,900
答对了
You are correct.

138
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,930
你把这封信带给美第奇家族
You will deliver this message to the Medicis.

139
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,830
里面详细描述了
It contains, in exacting detail,

140
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,660
今天这里发生的事情
the horrors witnessed here today.

141
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,860
瑞阿里奥 我们到底来这干嘛?
Why in God's name are we here, Riario?

142
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,330
告诉我 队长 美第奇家族卖给你这件大衣多少钱?
Tell me, Captain, how much did you give the Medicis for your coat?

143
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,730
我在罗马买的 不是佛罗伦萨
I bought it in Rome, not Florence.

144
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,600
欧洲所有的布料都要用这里的明矾矿
Every dyed fabric in Europe uses alum from these mines

145
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,430
来稳固着色
to fix the dye.

146
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,760
你知道吗 教皇庇护二世
Did you know, Pope Pius II

147
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,560
把这里的矿产赐给美第奇家族
gave this mining concern to the Medicis

148
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,960
以偿还教皇的债务
in return for forgiveness of papal debt.

149
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,230
从那以后 每交易一件连衣裙 床单和衬衫
And since then, every frock, sheet and shirt

150
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,360
佛罗伦萨都会赚到一部分提成
has had a portion of its price going to Florence.

151
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,160
今天我们一举三得
Today we killed three birds with one stone.

152
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,630
我们夺回了罗马的矿产
We took back what was rightfully Rome's.

153
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,700
我们铲除了美第奇的一笔收入来源
We eliminated a lucrative source of Medici income

154
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,330
最重要的是...
and most importantly...

155
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,230
我们送出了战函
we sent a message.

156
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,960
这简直是在复制艺术品
This is an art, this pursuit.

157
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,860
我只喜欢创作
I like just making one of something.

158
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,860
你最好习惯点 我们还有好多要生产呢
Well, you'd better get used to it. We've got plenty more copies to go.

159
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,660
我要习惯什么?
What is it that I'm getting used to?

160
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,400
习惯杀人变得麻木吗?
Making each soldier's death indistinguishable from the last?

161
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,060
莱昂纳多 请到宫殿来一下
Leonardo, you're needed at the palace.

162
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,900
你当起跑差了 老爸?
You playing errand boy now, Father?

163
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,300
在国难关头 我们要听从征召
In these traitorous times, we fill any role required.

164
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,860
快点 美第奇家族可没耐心等你
Come on. The Medicis are none of them patient men.

165
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,500
你们不能来
Not you two.

166
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,630
这是国家大事 非同小可
This is state business, not a sideshow.

167
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,800
你们能坐在这里
If you are in this room,

168
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,730
是因为你们是我最信任的人
it is because you reside in my innermost circle of trust.

169
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,160
我信任你们
And if you are in my circle,

170
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,500
是因为我们对佛罗伦萨有共同的期望
it is because we share a common vision for Florence.

171
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,800
我们希望佛罗伦萨可以被世代铭记
A city that will be remembered for centuries

172
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:26,300
永为创新和艺术的焦点
as a cynosure of innovation and artistry.

173
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:31,500
我收到了托尔法镇夸特隆司令官的消息
I have received word from Tolfa, Commander Quattrone,

174
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,930
瑞阿里奥伯爵进攻了我们的明矾矿
that Count Riario has attacked our alum mine.

175
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,660
这是对我们的宣战
This is a casus belli. An act of war.

176
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,400
和平时期的佛罗伦萨很繁荣
It is easy to be for Florence in times of peace.

177
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,930
但战争时期不会
Not so in times of war.

178
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,700
有谁不能支持我们的 请离开
Those who cannot stand with us should leave.

179
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,400
现在当懦夫 总比将来叛国好
It is better to be a coward now than a traitor later.

180
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,800
我近日失去了最信任的顾问
I recently lost my most trusted advisor to treachery.

181
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,260
他现在正在狱里等待他的刑罚
He currently sits in the Bargello awaiting his fate on the wheel.

182
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,800
美第奇家族惩罚叛贼
In the Medici court, we punish treason

183
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,530
奖赏功臣
and we reward service.

184
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,830
带来这封信的年轻人 请上前来
Would the young man who brought me this scroll please come forward.

185
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,730
请告诉我们 你是从哪拿到这信的?
So tell us, please, how did you come by the scroll?

186
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,500
一个明矾矿工给我的 先生
A Tolfan miner, sir.

187
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,160
瑞阿里奥伯爵杀了所有人
Count Riario killed all but one

188
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,660
只留下他一个人送来这封信
whom he tasked with delivering the scroll.

189
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,960
你能告诉我们信的内容吗?
And would you tell us what it says?

190
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,060
瑞阿里奥有一支军队 先生
Riario has an army, sir.

191
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:35,860
他要你对罗马俯首称臣 否则将占领佛罗伦萨
He intends to occupy Florence unless you do as Rome asks.

192
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,000
这是那矿工告诉你的?
Did the miner convey this to you?

193
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,430
他是个平民 先生 我想他不认识字
He's a simple man, sir. I doubt he can read.

194
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,960
所以你私拆了信封
So you broke the seal

195
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,630
然后给其他人看了内容?
and revealed its contents to others?

196
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,230
逮捕他
Arrest him.

197
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,500
- 先拿他试试刑轮!  - 求求你 先生! 不要!
- Warm up the wheel with his bones!  - Please, sir! No!

198
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,360
对背叛美第奇家族的人我绝不留情
I will show no mercy to those who betray the Medici name.

199
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,930
在城里你们每个人都各负其责
Each of you has a responsibility to this community.

200
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,160
保护 发明和维护秩序
To protect. To invent. To maintain order.

201
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,530
支持
To support.

202
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,600
维护美第奇的神圣荣誉
To uphold the sacred honor of the Medici legacy.

203
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,330
我们都知道 这一天迟早会到来
We all knew this day would come.

204
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,560
我们不会屈服
We will not submit.

205
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,030
我们要战斗
We will fight.

206
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,860
为佛罗伦萨而战!
Alla Battaglia Firenze!

207
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,700
为佛罗伦萨而战!
Alla Battaglia Firenze!

208
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,360
我也有嫌疑
I think I have a cat in my bag.

209
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,630
你也要处决我 是吗?
Would you like to kick that, too?

210
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,900
够了
Enough.

211
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,330
一座被作为革新和艺术焦点的城市
A city that will be remembered for centuries to come,

212
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,000
将被铭记数百年
as a cynosure for innovation and artistry.

213
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,700
这是直接引用了在十九岁继承基业之前
That's a direct quote from Becchi's counsel to you,

214
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,060
贝奇给你这个吓得要死的空想家的建议
when you were a shit-scared 19-year-old poet about to ascend the throne.

215
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,500
- 现在别提  - 就要现在提
- Not now.  - Yes, now.

216
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,930
强硬和残忍是不一样的 洛伦佐
There's a difference between strength and cruelty, Lorenzo.

217
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,330
不要再用暴政了
Leave cruelty to Sixtus and his brutes,

218
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,230
不然就不是罗马...
or it won't be Rome...

219
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,030
而是我们自己的人民起来对抗我们
it'll be our own people who move against us.

220
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,600
帮我个忙 兄弟
Do me a kindness, brother.

221
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,330
等我去见瑞阿里奥伯爵的时候
When I ride out to meet Count Riario,

222
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,300
守在家里
stay home.

223
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,730
女士们先生们 我有圣阿里比诺斯破碎的脚骨
Ladies and gentlemen, I have here the shattered ankle bone of St Alibinus.

224
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,330
一块小小的碎骨可以保佑远离
A single shard of which is guaranteed to protect,

225
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,000
所有的海盗和暴徒
against all pirates and all ruffians.

226
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,430
如果再多出几个铜钱
And, for a few soldi more,

227
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,530
还可以买到受人尊敬的圣白苏烈士的手指!
the fingers of the esteemed martyr St Bessus!

228
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,930
- 是"拜苏" 你个白痴!  - 哦 得了吧
- It's Bess-us, you idiot!  - Oh, piss off.

229
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,960
- 怎么这么多人?  - 还有谁要?
- What causes this commotion?  - Who else wants some?

230
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,460
人们是来看死刑的
People have gathered for an execution.

231
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,900
金泰尔・贝奇应该等到满月才行刑的吧
Gentile Becchi wasn't meant to be brought up until the full moon.

232
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,060
不 不是贝奇 是个随从
No, not Becchi. A servant.

233
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,960
拜他所赐 瑞阿里奥的口信已经像野火一样散播开来
Thanks to him, word of Riario's incursion has spread like wildfire,

234
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,230
所以洛伦佐要杀一儆百
and Lorenzo wants to make an example.

235
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,500
看行刑的人们真是无情
The Confraternity of Death are such vultures.

236
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,030
要有人为罪犯祈祷
Someone has to pray for the condemned.

237
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,760
这不适合女士观看
This is ugly business for a lady.

238
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,260
不
No.

239
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,560
就算是女士也要支持美第奇家族对抗间谍
Even a lady must support the Medicis against spies.

240
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,300
天啊
God.

241
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,060
这要执行多久?
How long will this take?

242
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,500
可能数小时
It can last hours.

243
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,130
背叛洛伦佐的人都会受到神的庇护
God help any man who betrays Lorenzo.

244
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,060
你在看什么?
What are you reading?

245
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,730
祈祷书
A Book of Hours.

246
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,900
肯定是拉丁文原版的
In the original Latin, no doubt.

247
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,300
我一直很讨厌那种语言
I always hated that language.

248
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,730
从你的学习态度就能看出来
As was evident in your studies.

249
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,630
也许你是个糟糕的老师
Perhaps you were simply a piss-poor teacher.

250
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,560
也许吧
Perhaps.

251
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,760
弄成这样 真的很抱歉
I'm sorry it's come to this.

252
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,260
嗯
Mm.

253
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,960
你为什么不跟我们说你家需要钱
Why didn't you tell us about your family's need for money.

254
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,860
我不会以自己亲属的不幸来为你们添麻烦
I would never have troubled you with my relatives' mishaps.

255
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,930
却接受罗马的钱?
But you would take coin from Rome?

256
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,930
扪心自问 孩子
Ask yourself, my boy.

257
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,560
如果我被金钱所鼓动 为什么还不花掉?
If money had motivated me, why wouldn't it have been spent already?

258
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,130
就随便放在我的住所里 等着被发现
Instead of lying conveniently in my quarters awaiting discovery.

259
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,760
还带着罗马教皇的封印
Along with the papal seals of Rome.

260
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,460
我也想相信你
I want to believe.

261
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,830
你辅佐了我的祖父科西莫 我的父亲
You counseled my grandfather Cosimo. My father.

262
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,230
你毕生都献给了佛罗伦萨
You've given your life in service to Florence.

263
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,700
一直在尽心竭力守护美第奇家族之名
Always doing your best to protect the Medici name.

264
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,760
等我死后 朱利亚诺
But when I am gone, Giuliano,

265
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,760
我将无法再提供这种保护
I will no longer be able to provide such protection.

266
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,930
你是不是无辜的呢?
Are you innocent of these charges or not?

267
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,760
- 当然是  - 那你为什么不争辩?
- Of course I am.  - Then why don't you fight them?

268
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,100
因为你哥哥已经听不进劝告了
Because your brother is incapable of listening.

269
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,330
洛伦佐已经被怒气蒙蔽了
Lorenzo is consumed with wrath.

270
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,530
让他无法察觉身边的危险
It blinds him to the dangers circling him.

271
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,930
我们的人中有叛徒
There is a traitor in our midst.

272
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,460
等我死后 洛伦佐会放松警惕
After I am dead and Lorenzo lowers his guard,

273
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,660
而叛徒还在
the traitor will still be here.

274
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,830
人们会低估你 朱利亚诺
People underestimate you, Giuliano.

275
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,700
而这种观念使你特别适合
Yet that perceived weakness makes you uniquely suited,

276
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,160
从暗处抓出间谍
to flushing out a spy from cover.

277
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,460
照顾好你哥哥
Look after your brother.

278
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,700
他比以往更需要你
He needs you. Now more than ever.

279
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,200
瑞阿里奥会穿过瓦达诺谷
Riario will advance from the south,

280
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,330
从南面进攻
through the Valdarno Valley.

281
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,630
我们会在侧面布置武器
We'll place weapons on all sides,

282
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,360
不过大部队会在这里交手
but the majority will meet his men here.

283
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,630
我们会占人数优势 武器超越他们
We'll be outnumbered. They'll be outgunned.

284
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,360
就靠十门炮? 你确定吗?
With ten guns? Are you certain?

285
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,130
我们在铸造更多大炮
We're casting more muskets.

286
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,100
我保证 你根本用不着开炮
I promise you you'll never have to fire them.

287
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,900
有时候...
Sometimes...

288
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,560
当你的敌人只顾着杀戮的时候
when all your enemy knows is killing,

289
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,900
一个小骗局就能奏效
a simple deception can suffice.

290
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,360
瑞阿里奥比你想象的要聪明得多 达芬奇
Riario is far more clever than you think, DaVinci.

291
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,100
你的智慧无法帮我们解开这个局
Your wit won't get us out of this one.

292
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,930
不过你的武器可以
Only your weapons will.

293
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,200
而且我保证会开炮的
And I promise you they will fire.

294
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,700
- 大人!  - 指挥官
- Magnifico!  - Commander.

295
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,130
- 艺术家  - 其实是战争工程师
- Artista.  - War engineer, actually.

296
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,230
你骑的马很好啊
That's a very handsome stallion you have there.

297
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,730
- 安达卢西亚种吗?  - 是
- Andalusian, no?  - Mm.

298
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,030
卡斯提尔的伊莎贝拉女王私人赏赐给我的
Given to me personally by Queen Isabella of Castile.

299
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,900
我听说过这些安达卢西亚马
I've heard of these Andalusians.

300
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,430
我知道这马更容易得缺血性疾病
I understand the breed's prone to ischemic diseases,

301
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,630
降低血流速度 尤其是肠系统
reduced blood flow, especially to the intestines,

302
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,030
会导致肛塞
which can lead to some unfortunate anal blockage.

303
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,900
显然你已经习惯如影随形的马粪味了
Undoubtedly, you're used to the smell of shit following you wherever you go.

304
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,660
哼
Hmm.

305
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,560
为了避免更大的杀戮
In an effort to avoid further bloodshed,

306
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,800
大人提出了一些要求
his Eminence has extended a list of demands.

307
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,460
首先 佛罗伦萨必须正式接受
First, Florence will formally embrace into its bosom,

308
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,130
弗朗西斯科・萨尔维亚蒂出任比萨大主教
Francesco Salviati as Archbishop of Pisa.

309
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:52,660
其次 美第奇银行必须清空所有圣座的债务
Second, the Medici Bank will forgive the Holy See of all debts.

310
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,330
再次 还要解除
And third, you will release,

311
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,830
某些工匠的债务合约
certain artisans from their contractual obligations,

312
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,830
让他们可以把自己的才华
so that they might employ their gifts,

313
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,600
使用在圣座的新教堂上
in service of His Holiness's new chapel.

314
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,530
圣座需要哪些艺术家?
And in which artist is His Holiness interested?

315
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,600
一个叫... 彼得・佩鲁吉诺
One... Pietro Perugino.

316
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,400
一个叫桑德罗・波提切利
One Sandro Botticelli.

317
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,860
- 天啊...  - 还有
- Oh, Jesus...  - Ooh.

318
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,060
莱昂纳多・达芬奇
Leonardo DaVinci.

319
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,930
我宁愿让鳗鱼咬掉我的蛋蛋
I'd rather have my testicles gnawed off by conger eels.

320
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,130
- 这要求可以满足  - 我们要是不答应呢?
- Well, that can be arranged.  - And if we don't capitulate?

321
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,460
我的部队将会占领佛罗伦萨
My forces will occupy Florence.

322
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:37,100
我的大炮会把你的人炸成碎片
My guns will cut your men to ribbons.

323
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,800
你那些传说中的转轮炮?
Your fabled pipe organ muskets?

324
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,230
是的 可以炸死一些 不过不是全部
Well, yes, they will cut down some of them, but not all.

325
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,200
感谢朱利亚诺
Thanks to Giuliano's bumbling,

326
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,600
我得以知道你们铸造了十门炮
I was aware that you possessed ten guns,

327
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,460
通过我对它们的观察
and given that I've observed them,

328
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,300
我简单地推算了它们的循环射速
I simply deduced their cyclic rate of fire.

329
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,400
每一次装填后可以进行
Between them, they're capable of launching,

330
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:56,000
33次齐射 共333颗炮弹
33 volleys comprising 333 discharges.

331
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,700
现在... 我们假设...
Now, let's... Let's assume that...

332
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,530
其中有三分之二击中了目标
two-thirds of them hit their mark.

333
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,230
不过你们的人在重新装填的时候会怎么样呢?
But what happens while your brave militiamen are reloading?

334
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,960
我剩下的四百铁骑会进攻
My remaining 400 ride out.

335
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,930
对 是的 以你们珍贵的人民作为目标
And, yes, we will use your precious Florentines as target practice.

336
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,030
你面对的是一座坚城 瑞阿里奥
You face a walled city, Riario.

337
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,030
我们至少可以抵御你们半年
We can hold you off for six months at the least.

338
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,230
只需要一个内应就能打开坚城
It takes but one person to open the gates from the inside.

339
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,560
你真的相信在这半年间
Do you truly believe that in those months,

340
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,830
圣座的召唤
the call of the Holy Father,

341
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,530
无法感召佛罗伦萨的任何一个灵魂吗?
won't be honored by a single soul in Florence?

342
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,630
你有24小时考虑圣座的条件
You have 24 hours to ponder the Holy Father's offer.

343
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,830
祝你们愉快
Enjoy your day.

344
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,430
我们需要更多的炮 达芬奇
We need more guns, DaVinci.

345
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,130
我们的性命决定于此
Our lives depend on it.

346
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,430
我们不是应该铸造大炮
Shouldn't we be building guns,

347
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,630
或者至少准备防御进攻吗?
or at least preparing for the invasion?

348
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,860
- 我在画草图  - 不过是石榴的
- I'm sketching.  - Pomegranates.

349
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,430
没什么能逃过你的眼睛
Nothing escapes you.

350
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,600
瑞阿里奥伯爵就快进攻了
Count Riario is nearly upon us.

351
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,360
我当然知道瑞阿里奥要来了!
I know damn well where Riario is!

352
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,630
- 我们在这做什么?  - 我自己也纳闷
- What are we doing here?  - I wonder about that myself.

353
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,100
请原谅 夫人
Excuse us, Signora.

354
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,830
你对自己的草图也不认真 艺术家
You're rather careless with your sketches, Artista.

355
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,900
有一些忘在我丈夫的书房里了
You left a sheaf of them in my husband's study.

356
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,930
你不是应该为佛罗伦萨的安全服务的吗?
Shouldn't you be laboring for the security of Florence?

357
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,360
石榴上还有些问题 目前还没有解决
There's something about this pomegranate. I can't define it yet.

358
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,360
不过希腊人告诉我们任何事情都可以变化
But the Greeks teach us everything can be everything.

359
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,560
任何事物之间都可以互相转化
And everything can be turned into everything else.

360
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,860
如果我们看不到其中的结构
If we can't see the pattern in God's architecture,

361
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,730
那只是因为我们观察得还不够近
it's because we're not looking closely enough.

362
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,460
你还要你的草图吗?
Would you like your sketches back?

363
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,430
洛伦佐所有的藏品里
Of all of Lorenzo's treasures,

364
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,000
只有这个小东西吸引了你的眼球
it was this bit of carved stone that caught your eye.

365
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:07,800
你丈夫给你说过吗? 它是从何而来?
Has your husband ever mentioned it to you? Where it came from.

366
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,830
我估计是继承的遗产
I believe he inherited it.

367
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:14,500
可能就是从隔壁房间的那个人
Perhaps from a man in the next room.

368
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,260
一个魔术师
A magician.

369
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,460
这是洛伦佐的祖父科西莫
Lorenzo's grandfather. Cosimo.

370
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:23,060
他连办公室都不需要就能治理这座城市
He ruled this city without ever holding office.

371
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:26,030
哦 他确实有一套
Oh, there's something about him.

372
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,160
随时欢迎你来研究他
You're welcome to study him at any time.

373
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,300
不过现在我希望你能接着铸造大炮 好吗?
But for now I'd rather you returned to your guns. No?

374
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,930
我来佛罗伦萨不是为了屈从于罗马统治的
I didn't come to Florence to live under Roman rule.

375
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,060
达芬奇
DaVinci.

376
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,630
作为回报 请笑纳
A treat. For indulging me.

377
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,700
感谢你能与我见面
Thank you for meeting with me,

378
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,760
特别是罗马正在咄咄相逼
especially with all the concerns about Rome.

379
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:11,060
我知道这不好 可事情发展至此 我别无他法
I know this is unorthodox, but circumstances forced my hand.

380
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,860
你也知道贝奇的事了
You know what's happened to Becchi.

381
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:18,500
指控已经成立
The accusations that have been made.

382
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,860
我不相信他是叛徒
I don't believe he's a traitor.

383
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,960
你想让我怎么做?
What do you want me to do?

384
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,460
克拉丽斯已经准备好支持贝奇了
Clarice has already agreed to advocate for Becchi.

385
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,360
你掌控着我哥哥另一半的心 你也能这么做吗?
You own the other half of my brother's heart. Will you do the same?

386
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,200
你确定他是无辜的?
Are you so sure he's innocent?

387
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,360
我相信可以证明这一点
I believe we can prove it.

388
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,530
贝奇已经给了我建议
Becchi has been giving me counsel.

389
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:44,060
跟他合作 我觉得我们可以抓出真正的叛徒
Working with him, I know we can trap the real traitor.

390
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:51,060
求你 夫人
Please, Signora.

391
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,700
炉温正常
Temperature's right.

392
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,100
莱昂
Leo.

393
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,930
肾脏肿大的那个工头需要你帮助
The fat-kidneyed foreman requires your help.

394
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,860
我们对洛伦佐的祖先了解多少?
What do we know of Lorenzo's ancestors?

395
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,060
他父亲是个好人 不过不健康 伙计
His father was a good, but sickly, man.

396
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:29,330
生活在他父亲的阴影之下... 科西莫
Who lived in the shadow of his father... Cosimo.

397
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,860
喔 是吗? 这他妈的有什么关系?
Wow. Really? How in fuck does this matter?

398
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,630
罗马的佣兵已经兵临城下了
Rome's mercenaries are upon us.

399
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,060
克拉丽斯・奥尔西尼今天给我的
Clarice Orsini gave me this today.

400
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,200
她说是洛伦佐继承来的
She said Lorenzo inherited it.

401
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,830
你是累坏了 看看你
You're exhausted. Look at you.

402
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,330
在我们需要更多大炮的时候还在研究这个小玩意 简直疯了
Fixating on bric-a-brac when we need more guns. It's insane.

403
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:51,200
它手里的钥匙和犹太人那把是一样的
The keys on it are identical to the ones from the Jew.

404
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,900
天穹 叶之书
The Vault of Heaven. The Book of Leaves.

405
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,600
美第奇怎么会知道这些?
How do the Medicis figure into it all?

406
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,900
莱昂 我就是不明白一个壁炉台上的古董
Leo, I just don't see how a fucking mantelpiece antique,

407
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,430
怎么能从瑞阿里奥剑下拯救我们的脖子
keeps Riario's swords from our fucking necks.

408
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,500
天啊 琐罗 你就不能安生一会?
Christ, Zo. Can you just drop it for one minute?

409
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,500
一定要这么频繁得证明自己的无知吗?
Do you have to prove your ignorance so damn often?

410
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,160
当拜占庭帝国围攻君士坦丁堡第一次使用大炮
When the Byzantine Empire used the first cannons,

411
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:28,330
对付土耳其人的时候
against the Ottomans during the siege of Constantinople,

412
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,900
土耳其人溃退了
the Turks were forced to flee.

413
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:34,000
30年后 他们带着自己的大炮回来了
30 years later, they returned with cannons of their own.

414
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,400
更大的大炮
Bigger cannons.

415
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:40,460
经过55天的围攻之后...
And after a 55-day siege left such destruction...

416
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,460
城市已经面目全非
that the city will never be the same.

417
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,200
君士坦丁堡沦陷
Constantinople fell.

418
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:53,560
那么我们就要一直保证自己拥有更大的大炮
Then we've always got to make sure we've got the biggest cannon.

419
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,360
哦...
Oh...

420
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,330
永无止境
It never ends.

421
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:09,130
除非...
Unless...

422
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,130
除非我在这里终结它
Unless I end it here.

423
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,160
住手! 会爆炸的!
Don't! That will cause an explosion!

424
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:22,360
住手! 啊!
Don't! Aargh!

425
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,960
大师 你都做了些什么?
Maestro, what have you done?

426
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:50,930
把我们的命运锁死了
Sealed our fucking fate.

427
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,430
请宽恕我 神父 原谅我的罪恶
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

428
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,160
你上一次忏悔是多久前了?
How long has it been since your last confession?

429
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,200
我... 羞于启齿
I'm... embarrassed to say.

430
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,630
快一年了
Nearly a year.

431
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,560
哦
Oh.

432
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,960
我今晚已经跟很多忏悔者谈过了 孩子
I have spoken with many shamed penitents tonight, child.

433
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,860
刑轮让人们想到了惩罚
The wheel reminds people of the punishments,

434
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:28,060
还在等待着那些没有向圣父忏悔的灵魂
awaiting those not reconciled with Our Father.

435
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:31,200
太可怕了
It's horrid.

436
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:36,260
我恐怕亲手把别人送进了同样的酷刑
I fear I myself drive someone toward a similar agony.

437
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,500
夏娃的每位女儿都面对这同样的窘境
Every daughter of Eve faces the same dilemma.

438
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,300
我不诚实
I have been untrue.

439
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,600
现在却是别人在为此受苦
And now someone else is suffering for it.

440
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,560
而且他要承受无法想象的痛苦...
And he will endure unimaginable pain...

441
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,160
- 都是因我的错  - 请原谅
- and it's my fault.  - If I may.

442
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,930
我听说过一些关于你婚姻的传言
I have heard something of the state of your marriage.

443
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:09,160
如果你能给予 哪怕是最小的
If you can offer up, even the smallest,

444
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,360
最轻微的宽容
the tenderest bit of mercy,

445
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,360
我肯定会你会得到回报的
I have no doubt it will be taken very well.

446
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:24,660
- 宽容是要冒险的  - 却能得到报答
- Mercy has its risks.  - And rewards.

447
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,800
骗子!
Liar!

448
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:43,260
"佛罗伦萨的良民们 美第奇家族在带领你们走向死亡"
"Good people of Florence, the Medicis are leading you to death."

449
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,100
你们一定要赞扬一下瑞阿里奥
You have to give Riario some credit.

450
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,530
他知道如何恐吓他的猎物
He knows how to intimidate his prey.

451
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,460
据说瑞阿里奥带了两千人来屠城
People say Riario has 2,000 men to burn the city.

452
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,560
我听说有三千人
I heard 3,000.

453
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:58,660
城市会没事的 我来保证这一点
The city will be safe. I'll make sure of it.

454
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:04,360
骄傲是一种以命相抵的罪恶 艺术家
Pride is a deadly sin, Artista.

455
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,030
队长!
Il Capitano!

456
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,460
我没想到你还是个虔诚的教徒
I didn't take you for a religious zealot.

457
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,800
一个恃强凌弱的混蛋 没错 还虔诚?
A bully and an asshole, yes. A zealot?

458
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,200
只是...
It's...

459
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,500
我对自己的家庭虔诚
I'm zealous about my family.

460
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:21,960
我们每晚都在祈祷你不要把这座城市带往灭亡
We pray every night that you're not leading this city to destruction.

461
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,630
什么? 我有那么大的力量 真的?
What? I have that much power, do I?

462
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,700
自从你牵扯上美第奇家族 我们增加的只有麻烦
We've had nothing but trouble since you talked your way into the Medici court.

463
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,600
也许是因为就此事来说上帝站在家族这边
Perhaps God is on the Count's side in this business.

464
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,300
任何与那个空想家为伍的神明
I don't believe in any god,

465
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,430
都不值得我信仰
who would side with that pig's bladder.

466
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,360
你在亵渎神灵
You blaspheme. 

467
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:44,200
像你这样的神经艺术家正在把佛罗伦萨变成蛾摩拉(圣经中的罪恶之都)
Men like you artistic perverts are turning Florence into Gomorrah.

468
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,730
你正走在通往不灭业火的捷径
You're beating a quick path to the everlasting bonfire,

469
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,830
还拖着我们跟你一起
and dragging us all with you.

470
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:55,260
我可以更快得直接把你送进业火
I'll send you to the bonfire even sooner.

471
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,500
我知道你剑术比我高超 达芬奇
I know you're a better swordsman than I, DaVinci.

472
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:03,300
不过...
Still...

473
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,160
我戳中了你的软肋 是吧?
I've struck the bone, eh?

474
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,830
在你需要利刃对付瑞阿里奥的时候
Do you really want to blunt the edge of your blade on me

475
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,530
真的想在我身上砍钝自己的刀锋吗?
when you may need it sharp for Riario?

476
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:21,730
你喝多了 莱昂纳多
You're drunk, Leonardo.

477
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,430
来啊!
Come on!

478
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,730
天啊
Oh, my God.

479
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,560
上帝
Jesus.

480
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,530
我听说了铸造作坊的事情
I heard what happened at the metal works.

481
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:57,830
你不是这样的 达芬奇
You're better than this, Leonardo.

482
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,100
我觉得自己可以拯救佛罗伦萨 我觉得...
I thought I could save Florence. I thought...

483
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,930
我的才华已经足够 可惜不是的
my talents would be enough, but they aren't.

484
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,830
我一无所有
I've got nothing.

485
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,230
也因为我
And because of me,

486
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,060
明早洛伦佐只能被迫投降
tomorrow morning, Lorenzo will be forced to surrender.

487
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:19,330
别这么说 佛罗伦萨和罗马在你出生之前已经如此
No, please. Florence and Rome have been at it since before you were born.

488
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,930
- 这是政治  - 不 这是...
- It's politics.  - No, it's...

489
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,730
是私事
It's personal.

490
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,800
我拥有他们想要的东西
I have something they want.

491
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:30,660
对 你的才华
Yes. Your talent.

492
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,000
教皇想要我的才华
The Pope wants my talent.

493
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:39,030
瑞阿里奥想要我的钥匙
Riario wants my key.

494
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,660
- 什么钥匙?  - 那把钥匙...
- What key?  - The key from...

495
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,730
没什么
Nothing.

496
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,360
过来
Come here.

497
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,630
如果你感到负担...
If something burdens you...

498
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,960
也许放开它会更好些
maybe it's better just to let it go.

499
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,600
等等 慢点
Wait. Wait.

500
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,260
怎么了?
What?

501
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,400
洛伦佐就是这样要求我的
That's what Lorenzo requires of me.

502
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,030
你为什么要炸毁自己的大炮?
Why did you destroy your guns?

503
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,030
洛伦佐
Lorenzo.

504
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:57,300
他看着我的眼睛告诉我 我是个发明家
He looked me in the eye and told me I was an inventor.

505
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:08,360
可这不是发明 这是...
But this isn't invention. This is...

506
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,430
这是复制 我铸造五门 他们铸造五十门
It's escalation. I build five, they build 50.

507
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,500
你估计是我见过最可爱的人
You might be the loveliest man I've ever known.

508
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,960
嘿
Hey.

509
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,200
你为什么说的时候如此悲伤?
Why do you say it with such sadness?

510
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,460
也许是因为我觉得我们谁也配不上你
Maybe it's because I think none of us are worthy of you.

511
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,530
为什么研究石榴?
Why the pomegranates?

512
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,260
还不知道
I don't know yet.

513
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,800
你知道...
Do you know...

514
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:59,000
其实... 在珀尔塞福涅离开冥界时
Now... Hades tricked Persephone into eating pomegranates,

515
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:59,000
{\an8}珀尔塞福涅: 宙斯之女 被冥王劫持娶作冥后

516
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,200
是冥王骗她吃下了石榴
when she left the underworld.

517
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,660
她说是魔法迫使她回到他的身边
She said that their magic forced her to return to him.

518
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,300
是真的
It's true.

519
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,200
你走的时候应该带个走
You should take one with you when you go.

520
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,760
不是魔法让你我相遇相交的 莱昂纳多
It's not magic that binds me to you, Leonardo.

521
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,530
我希望你能杀了瑞阿里奥那个杂种
I hope you kill that bastard Riario.

522
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,530
莱昂纳多!
Leonardo!

523
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,800
莱昂纳多!
Leonardo!

524
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,260
莱昂纳多!
Leonardo!

525
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,060
你还有胆留在佛罗伦萨?
Oh, so you have the gall to remain in Florence?

526
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,060
你到底是勇敢还是傻到不透气
You're either brave or unimaginably stupid.

527
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,900
都算是吧
A bit of both.

528
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,500
你毁掉了我们的努力 为什么?
You sabotage our efforts. Why?

529
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,030
大炮无法终结这一切
The guns wouldn't have ended this.

530
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,960
就凭你这点战争的经验 你就认定这样了 是吗?
With all your experience in waging war, you decided that, did you?

531
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,800
你个...
You little...

532
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,630
该死!
Fuck!

533
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,700
真难以置信 我竟然信了你
I can't believe I trusted you.

534
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:18,230
你这个混蛋 骗子 地摊贩子!
You, a bastard. A charlatan. A peddler of knick-knacks!

535
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,730
我弟弟说得对 我相信你实在太傻了 太傻了!
My brother was right. I was a fool to believe in you. A fool!

536
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:26,360
我唯一能做的是自己去做瑞阿里奥的人质
My only recourse is to offer myself as Riario's hostage,

537
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,800
还得祈祷能得到他的宽恕
and I'll have to pray that if I put myself at his mercy,

538
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,800
让他不再劫掠佛罗伦萨
that he will forego pillaging Florence.

539
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:38,160
我还得祈祷他能保证克拉丽斯和我们孩子的安全
I'll have to pray that he'll grant Clarice and our children safe passage.

540
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:43,960
And I'll have to pray that every trace of my name and my legacy，
祈祷我的名字和家族

541
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:50,130
不会从街上被清理掉!
isn't struck from the streets!

542
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:55,960
你收拾好自己的收藏跟我去见面的地方吧
You gather what little you hold dear and you meet me in the field.

543
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:00,330
在我被迫接受罗马的条件的时候 希望你能见证
I want you by my side when I am forced to accept Rome's terms.

544
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,200
而且如果瑞阿里奥想要你...
And if Riario wants you...

545
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:11,400
就他妈的把你给他
he can fucking have you.

546
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,800
尼科 很高兴再见到你
Nico, it is good to see you again.

547
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,030
估计你的手快好了吧
I trust your hand is mending.

548
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,530
我们直接谈谈投降的条件吧
Let us go straight to the terms of surrender.

549
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,300
好
Indeed.

550
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,500
我确定...
I have certain...

551
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:57,030
需要一些保证
require certain assurances.

552
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,800
因为佛罗伦萨和这里的人民是我最关切的...
Florence and its citizens are my chief concern...

553
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:01,330
抱歉 等等
Sorry. Sorry.

554
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:09,200
呃 我们明确了是哪一方要投降对吧?
Um, we are clear whose surrender we're discussing here?

555
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,300
是你们
It's yours. 

556
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,800
达芬奇...
DaVinci...

557
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,130
尼科 给伯爵和司令看看我们的礼品吧?
Nico, would you show the Count and Captain General our gift?

558
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:22,230
看吧 既然你已经推算了我大炮的射速
Now, since you'd calculated the capacity of my guns,

559
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,600
我也试着改进了佛罗伦萨的装备
I've endeavored to improve Florence's odds.

560
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,300
只是简单的数字问题
It's a question of mathematics.

561
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,600
怎样用最节省的方式填装所有的弹丸
How to pack a group of spheres in the most economic fashion.

562
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:37,700
既然大自然总是使用最有效的方式达到目的
And since nature always employs the most efficient means to achieve her ends,

563
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,160
我就从中获得了灵感
I've taken inspiration from her.

564
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:49,400
我管这个叫集束炸弹
I call it the cluster bombard.

565
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,160
炮弹中是一包更小的炸弹
The casing houses a grouping of smaller explosives,

566
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,700
阿基米德体形态
an Archimedean solid,

567
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,230
由钢制层分离
which is separated by iron spacers.

568
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:05,560
所以当炮弹着地的时候 弹片形成一个喷泉
So when the bombard lands, it fragments into a fountain of shrapnel.

569
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:09,860
我估计每颗炸弹可以干掉你一打的人还有他们的坐骑
I estimate one bombard could take out a dozen of your men and their mounts.

570
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:13,530
我知道你在想什么
Now, I know what you're thinking.

571
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,100
你在想 "哦 还可以
You're thinking, "Well, fair enough.

572
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:19,960
炸弹只有能够装填发射才能发挥作用"
A bombard's really only as good as one's ability to lob it."

573
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,460
对 很对 你想得不错
So, fair enough. You'd be right.

574
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:27,300
不过...
However...

575
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,130
琐罗!
Zo!

576
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,060
动手
Let's go.

577
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,800
很有说服力
Impressive.

578
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,330
我怎么能相信你的发明是能用的?
But how do I know that contraption even works?

579
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,060
请允许我用一个小型的模型演示
Allow me to demonstrate on a smaller scale.

580
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:00,300
首先 我们把炮弹点燃
First, we light the bombard.

581
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:06,460
然后发射... 就这样
Then we fire it... like so.

582
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:22,430
当然真正满载的炸弹 装的不是烟火
The real, full-scale bombard doesn't carry fireworks, of course.

583
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,800
我们将用火焰和杀伤力笼罩你的军队
We will rain flame and destruction down on your men,

584
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:28,760
让他们想起圣经传说中的毁灭
recalling Biblical devastation of old.

585
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,160
你的人散落在这片土地上的骸骨碎片
The peasants will pick the bone fragments of your men

586
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,530
农民们估计要花几十年才能捡完
from these fields for decades to come.

587
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:40,960
你... 赢得的一切 将会从记忆中被清除
You... everything you've accomplished, will fade from memory.

588
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,100
反而我们的胜利将会被传承数百年
Whereas our victory will be lionized for centuries.

589
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:48,060
也许
Perhaps.

590
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,330
也许今天发生的事情不算什么
Or perhaps regardless of what happens today,

591
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:57,130
传说的会是另一个故事 或者没有故事
the opposite tale will be told, or no tale at all.

592
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:01,660
是这样 曾经有一个人告诉我...
You see, a man once told me...

593
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:09,860
历史只是谎言
History is a lie.

594
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:33,230
干得好 艺术家
Well played, Artista.

595
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:36,160
你... 虽然你记性不错
You'd... You'd do well to remember, though,

596
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:44,430
战争有很多的方面
that a war is waged on many fronts.

597
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,330
驾! 驾!
Hyah! Hyah!

598
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:49,860
解除了好大的威胁 莱昂纳多
You pulled off quite a feat, Leonardo.

599
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,060
我真想看它开炮 想象这个残杀
I would have liked to see it fire. Imagine the carnage.

600
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:58,130
罗马估计要连续办几个月的葬礼
Rome would have been holding funerals for months.

601
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,730
这个弩其实根本不能用
The crossbow it doesn't actually work.

602
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:08,100
这其实不是武器 而是一件艺术品
It's more a feat of art than weaponry.

603
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,200
这个赝品...
This sham... 

604
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,500
是宿醉艺术家的作品
is the work of drunken artists.

605
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,530
表演的意义远大于真正的武器价值
They're more skilled in stage props than armaments.

606
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:23,600
一夜之间我们怎么可能造出来真正的装备?
How on earth can we have built the real device in one night?

607
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:30,400
就算造出来了 弹射这玩意的皮筋力量也荒唐的可笑
Even if I had, the drawstring needed to fire the damn thing would have been ludicrous.

608
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:34,330
- 你看吧  - 你把我们的命运当做儿戏的赌注?
- Look at it.  - You wagered our fate on a bluff?

609
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,230
- 是  - 那你只是为我们赢得了暂时的喘息
- I did.  - You only bought us a temporary reprieve.

610
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,360
你不可能唬住罗马一辈子
You can't keep on bluffing Rome forever.

611
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,660
不能吗?
Can't we?

612
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:46,460
生命宝贵 洛伦佐
Life's precious, Lorenzo.

613
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:48,900
叛徒亦如是
Even a traitor's.

614
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:51,360
我相信...
I believe...

615
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:55,830
是你祖父科西莫...
it was your grandfather, Cosimo...

616
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,430
发表过相关的意见
who voiced a pertinent sentiment.

617
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,900
"我们知道应该原谅我们的敌人
"We read that we ought to forgive our enemies.

618
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,860
却不知道要原谅我们的朋友"
We do not read that we ought to forgive our friends."

619
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,300
抱歉 兄弟 我只是稍稍休息一下
Sorry, brother. I was just having a rest.

620
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:41,400
你是来帮囚犯做忏悔的?
Have you come to minister to the condemned?

621
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,260
好
Right.

622
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:03,500
我感谢你的来访 不过我已经接受了这一切
I appreciate the visit but I've already made peace with my maker.

623
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,930
夫人
Signora.

624
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:24,360
你
You.

625
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,360
是你把那些文件放进了我的房间
You're the one that slipped those documents into my quarters.

626
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:32,760
你变节多久了?
How long have they owned you?

627
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:36,760
几年了
A few years.

628
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,800
那他们收买你...
Then they approached you...

629
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,030
是在我与洛伦佐在一起之前
Before Lorenzo and I were involved.

630
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:48,060
不管他们承诺了什么 都不会兑现的
Whatever promise they made, they will not honor it.

631
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,230
你对我的处境
You have no idea,

632
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,360
一无所知
of my circumstances.

633
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:57,030
这不仅关乎佛罗伦萨 罗马
There's more to this than Florence or Rome,

634
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,160
还有我的性命
or my life.

635
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:02,330
你来干什么 夫人?
Why are you here, Signora?

636
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:08,860
因为我不想看到你被钉在刑轮上活活打死
Because I do not wish to see you broken on a wheel.

637
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,500
什么?
What?

638
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,180
毒芹
Hemlock.

639
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:20,668
怎么会?
How?

640
00:48:20,668 --> 00:48:24,271
从罗马教廷密室偷来的一件武器
A weapon stolen from the Secret Archives in the Vatican.

641
00:48:25,473 --> 00:48:29,276
这一件带着一针毒剂
A misericorde, modified with a single dose of poison.

642
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,812
几乎感觉不到疼痛
Its bite is almost never noticed.

643
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,215
不会有证据指向
So no evidence will arise,

644
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:38,118
洛伦佐的爱人
implicating Lorenzo's lover.

645
00:48:38,453 --> 00:48:40,254
请当做是我的慈悲
Consider it mercy.

646
00:48:41,089 --> 00:48:44,292
这是我能提供的最迅速 最没有痛苦的死法
This is the fastest and most painless death I can offer.

647
00:48:44,326 --> 00:48:45,893
我需要亲眼见证
And I will see that it takes.

648
00:48:45,928 --> 00:48:47,929
这不是慈悲
This isn't mercy.

649
00:48:47,963 --> 00:48:51,399
只是你... 在灭口
This is you... tying off loose ends.

650
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:02,243
罗马的选择是高明的
Rome chose well.

651
00:49:05,247 --> 00:49:06,881
- 卫兵!  - 抱歉
- Guard!  - I'm sorry.

652
00:49:08,818 --> 00:49:11,019
我也希望还有其他的办法
I wish there was another way.

653
00:49:22,397 --> 00:49:23,597
贝奇!
Becchi!

654
00:49:25,967 --> 00:49:27,367
卫兵!
Guards!

655
00:49:28,035 --> 00:49:30,270
卫兵 快!
Guards, quickly!

656
00:49:38,311 --> 00:49:39,812
是毒芹
Hemlock.

657
00:49:39,846 --> 00:49:43,048
- 贝奇不会自杀的  - 证据确凿
- Becchi would not have done this.  - The vial speaks for itself.

658
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:45,885
而且你也已经习惯不相信
And you have a history of not believing things,

659
00:49:45,919 --> 00:49:48,687
贝奇所做的事情
that Becchi has clearly done.

660
00:49:51,725 --> 00:49:53,726
问题在于 弟弟
Question is, brother,

661
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,061
是谁给贝奇送来了毒药?
who brought Becchi this poison?

662
00:49:56,897 --> 00:50:00,933
会不会是支持他的人?
Was it someone who sympathizes with his plight?

663
00:50:03,536 --> 00:50:07,472
如果是我的话 哥哥 我不会带着面具的
If I were to defy you, brother, I wouldn't don a mask to do it.

664
00:50:08,474 --> 00:50:09,908
你还在乎什么?
But what do you care?

665
00:50:09,942 --> 00:50:13,411
叛徒死了 佛罗伦萨安全了
The traitor is dead, Florence is secure,

666
00:50:13,446 --> 00:50:15,480
你还要给个战争工程师奖赏
and you've a war engineer to fete.

667
00:50:15,514 --> 00:50:18,716
最好是在今晚的会上
All is well in the Republic tonight.

668
00:50:21,721 --> 00:50:23,856
这份命令上写的名字和指控
The names and charges written on this paper,

669
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,726
要求我们立刻提起最高注意
require our immediate attention as Priori.

670
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,695
匿名告发信?
An anonymous denunciation?

671
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:30,564
告发人不重要
The author's unimportant.

672
00:50:30,598 --> 00:50:32,799
此事需要调查
This matter demands investigation.

673
00:50:32,834 --> 00:50:35,636
我要提醒你考虑牵涉其中的人
I'd caution you to consider who will be implicated.

674
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:38,139
作为执法者 你们有责任维护律法
As Priori, you are duty bound to uphold the law,

675
00:50:38,173 --> 00:50:40,708
不管涉及到谁
unconcerned by who whomever it may incriminate.

676
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:44,245
提审这里提到的人 队长
Interrogate the victim mentioned here, Captain.

677
00:50:44,279 --> 00:50:48,449
他只要认罪 就逮捕他
Once he confirms the charges, make your arrest.

678
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:54,000
瞧瞧你!
Wow, look at you!

679
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,260
威尼斯马裤 带天鹅绒 带锦缎
Venetian breeches, bit of velvet, bit of brocade.

680
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,700
你用美第奇的奖赏买的?
Did you buy those with your Medici vouchers?

681
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,900
你担心什么?
What concern is it of yours?

682
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,430
是谁打白条召集众人
Who traded in chits to muster the men,

683
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,530
把你的大假弩拉出城的? 忘了?
to sneak your phony crossbow out of the city? Hm?

684
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:10,960
是谁半夜冒着生命危险 把它组装起来的?
Who assembled all the pieces in the middle of the night, risking his life?

685
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,930
因为不是尼科 结果那个小屁孩子都受邀
Cos it wasn't Nico. Yet somehow that little bull's pizzle,

686
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,800
去洛伦佐的宫殿了我都没有
wins an invitation to Lorenzo's palazzo and I don't.

687
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:19,760
尼科没有因为下流行径 偷窃
Nico hasn't been arrested a dozen times for lewd behavior,

688
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,060
或者挖坟掘墓被逮捕过多次
and pickpocketing, grave robbing.

689
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:25,260
我今晚不能带你去 琐罗 抱歉
I can't have you there tonight, Zo. Sorry.

690
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,830
得体对这些人...
These people...

691
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,200
意味着一切
decorum means everything to them.

692
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,260
你的贵宾在哪里 洛伦佐?
Where is your guest of honor, Lorenzo?

693
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,160
如果是要表彰一位艺术家 那就应该是波提切利先生
If we're to praise an artist, perhaps it should be Signor Botticelli.

694
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,500
因为至少他到场了
At least he has blessed up with his presence.

695
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,300
一个已经誉满全城的人不需要其它荣誉了 哥哥
No need to honor someone who honors themselves so well, brother.

696
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,330
每次我发现自己在找达芬奇的时候 他都会...
Every time I find myself looking for DaVinci, he seems to have...

697
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,130
像烟雾一样消失
vanished like smoke.

698
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,460
你有什么原因要躲开聚会吗 大师?
Is there a reason you're avoiding the party, Maestro?

699
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:14,230
大家都等着你呢
It's being held in your honor.

700
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,560
有事情困扰着我 尼科
Something's needling me, Nico.

701
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:22,560
等我发现这...
Till I can discover what it...

702
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:25,130
哈!
Ha!

703
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:28,400
对了!
Yes!

704
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,360
老魔术师的微笑
The old magician's laughing.

705
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,830
我真是白痴
I'm an idiot.

706
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,130
提示再明显不过了
The symbols couldn't be clearer.

707
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:41,260
我是大地与星空之子
I am a son of Earth and Starry Heaven.

708
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,360
我渴了 求你了 从记忆之泉中
I am thirsty. Please give me something to drink,

709
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:46,760
取水给我喝
from the fountain of Memory.

710
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
密特拉之子的祷词 看
The invocation for the Sons of Mithras. Look.

711
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,060
牛在拉犁
A bull pulling a plow.

712
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,230
基督徒的插图 也是异教徒的大地标志
Christian iconography but it's also the pagan symbol for Earth.

713
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:58,900
布满星星的天空
A star-filled heaven.

714
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,130
圣杯 象征着喷泉
A chalice, symbolic of a fountain.

715
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:06,200
还有花朵 花名是法语的
And flowers. Ne M'oubliez Pas, in French.

716
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,460
勿忘草
Forget-me-nots.

717
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,300
记忆
Memory.

718
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,400
科西莫・美第奇...
Cosimo de Medici...

719
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:16,600
是密特拉之子
was a Son of Mithras.

720
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:19,430
看来我所有的疑问都汇聚到了一起
It's as if all my inquiries are converging.

721
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,930
就像一张撒开的网
It's as if a grand web is being spun.

722
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,930
无法想象的广阔和古老
One so incalculably wide and ancient,

723
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,130
以至于我才刚刚目及导它的范围
that I'm only now beginning to grasp its scope.

724
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,100
我已经向洛伦佐证明了自己
I have proven myself to Lorenzo.

725
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,100
赢得了他的信任
I've earned his trust.

726
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,830
是时候让他用爱心回报我了
It's time for him to repay me in kind.

727
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,330
怎样?
By doing what?

728
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,730
赞助一次探险
By funding an expedition.

729
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,560
去犹太人地图上指示的大陆
To the land indicated on the Jew's map.

730
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,960
一艘船 探险的补给
A ship, provisions for a journey.

731
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,760
天穹就在那 尼科
The Vault of Heaven is out there, Nico.

732
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:51,460
叶之书就在那里
It's harbing the Book of Leaves.

733
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,660
还有里面的知识 我能听到它在呼唤我
All the knowledge it contains, I can hear it calling to me.

734
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:57,930
魔术师在指引我的路
And the magician is leading me to it.

735
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:02,530
我的祖父科西莫有一个梦想
My grandfather, Cosimo, had a dream.

736
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,160
我们的街道和广场
That our streets and squares,

737
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,900
应该是科学 艺术和求知的天堂
would be a haven for science, art and learning.

738
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:13,160
最能代表这理想的佛罗伦萨子民
No son of Florence better represents those ideas,

739
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:14,460
就是莱昂纳多・达芬奇
than Leonardo DaVinci.

740
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:19,730
我赐你为...
I name you...

741
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:24,060
"施洗者约翰"之大师
Grand Master of the Order of St John the Baptist,

742
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:28,800
佛罗伦萨的守护者
patron saint of Florence.

743
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:33,000
请允许我向你们介绍古典智慧的真实化身
I give you the living embodiment of classical brilliance.

744
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,460
莱昂纳多・达芬奇
Leonardo DaVinci.

745
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:46,760
来吧 大师 给我们说几句吧?
Please, Maestro, won't you grant us a few words?

746
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,960
佛罗伦萨最大的产品就是灵感
Florence's greatest export has always been its ideas.

747
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:03,330
我们的共和制代表着追求的前沿
Our Republic represents the cutting edge of inquiry.

748
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:08,560
我们在发明未来
We are inventing the future.

749
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:12,830
但是只有不停追求才能保证我们一直生气勃勃
But we can only remain vital if we keep on pushing outwards,

750
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,760
所以我请求一个新的开始
so I propose a bold new step.

751
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,900
我发现了一片大陆 殿下 在西面
I have learned of a land, your Magnificence, to the west.

752
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:23,960
未曾表明过却一定蕴含着奇异
It's largely uncharted but it's certain to contain wonders.

753
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:28,900
现在 得到您的资助 我想开始一次探险
Now, with your patronage, I shall mount an expedition.

754
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:34,030
我们要驶向...
We will voyage...

755
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,930
德拉戈奈蒂队长 这么无礼是要干什么?
Captain Dragonetti, what is the meaning of this affront?

756
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,630
抱歉 阁下
My apologies, Signor.

757
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,900
有一项挖坟掘墓的罪名落到了您一位宾客的头上
A grave accusation has been levied against one of your guests.

758
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,530
我对此一无所知
I know nothing of any accusations.

759
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,100
请允许提醒你 纳扎雷诺 你是我的属下
May I remind you, Nazzareno, that you answer to me.

760
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,530
准确来说 我是法度的属下 殿下
Technically, I answer to the Signoria, your Magnificence.

761
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:55,230
您虽代表着法律 但也仅是一人之言
Of which you are but one voice.

762
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:58,860
我不能无视法度 阁下 这是规矩
I couldn't dissuade them, Signor. It's protocol.

763
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:03,100
我们只能服从
Our hands were tied.

764
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:06,800
那继续吧 队长
Go on then, Captain.

765
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,530
此事已经引起了值夜的官员注意
It has come to the attention of the Officers of the Night,

766
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,530
是通过匿名告发的方式
by means of secret denunciation,

767
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,460
有一位叫莱昂纳多・达芬奇的人
that one Leonardo di ser Piero DaVinci,

768
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,460
被认定违反了佛罗伦萨共和国的律法
has committed, in violation of the statutes of the Republic of Florence,

769
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:26,660
神赐的自然律法 还犯有鸡奸罪
and divine and natural law, the grievous act of sodomy.

770
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:29,000
此人需被立即羁押候审...
Said individual is to be immediately remanded...

771
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,860
那些是谎言 这是诽谤!
These are lies. This is slander!

772
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:32,400
所以他会被扣押
Whereupon he will remain,

773
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:36,260
直到治安官查清他有罪还是无罪
until the Magistrates ascertain his guilt or innocence.

774
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,160
若是有罪
Should he be found guilty,

775
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:41,230
他将会被游街示众到刑场
he will be led through the public squares to the Palace of Justice,

776
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:45,530
然后火刑至死...
and there be burned so that he dies...

777
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,900
直到肉体与灵魂分离
and his body is separated from his soul.

778
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:53,100
不! 你...
No! You...

779
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,860
这都是你做的 弗朗西斯科
This is your work, Francesco.

780
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:57,630
我能闻到阴谋的恶臭
I smell the Pazzi stench all over this charade.

781
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:00,500
指控是真的 洛伦佐
The denunciation is real, Lorenzo.

782
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,660
我们有污点证人
We've a victim willing to testify.

783
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:06,200
已经有五十年没有人因为这项罪名被判刑了
No-one has been sentenced for this crime for more than 50 years.

784
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,300
不过还是在律法之中
And yet it's still on the statute books.

785
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:12,630
如果你有意见 去找你先人科西莫说吧
If you've issues with it, take it up with your forebear Cosimo.

786
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:15,200
难道不是他修订了佛罗伦萨的宪法吗?
Was it not he who revised Florence's constitution?

787
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:18,500
还是你要以自己的看法凌驾于我们共和制的法律之上?
Or would you flout our fair Republic's laws as you see fit?

788
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:23,000
我认为我们还是生活在一个共和的体制之下
I was under the impression we lived in a democracy.

789
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:29,600
- 而不是独裁制  - 请伸手 先生
- Not a dictatorship.  - Your wrists, Signor.

790
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:44,590
早跟你说了走在通往业火的捷径上了 艺术家
Told you that you take the quick path to the bonfire, Artista.

1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,600
Where there are now two land masses, there once was just one.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,700
The Book of Leaves has to be here.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,860
Take whatever steps are necessary to find our spy. Do it quickly.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,000
It is God's will to break Lorenzo and all who support him.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,710
With the exception of Da Vinci, I agree with you.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,540
Those weapons he makes, they could all be ours.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,390
Rome has more men, and the Lord, on its side.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, we've got ten pipe organ muskets

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,490
capable of firing 33 rounds a minute on ours.

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,420
Ten guns? Good to know. Thank you for that.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,940
Papers with the papal seal.

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,850
A list of locations to hide them.

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,580
- Where did you find this?  - Signor Becchi's quarters.

14
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,990
The traitor was you.

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,870
Lorenzo, this is a mistake.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000


17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000


18
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:46,999


19
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,140
Boy.

20
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,000


21
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,230
One of my huntsmen wishes this decorated.

22
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,640
You've a keen eye. Paint it.

23
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,860
When Leonardo was 14 years old,

24
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,060
his father, Piero, having found little use for the young man,

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,660
gave him a task.

26
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,130
Leo spent the next day collecting all manner of strange creatures.

27
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,430
And so long did he labor dissecting them

28
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,830
that the stench was past bearing.

29
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,460
But Leonardo didn't notice,

30
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,000
so great was his love for his art.

31
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,630
It's finished, Father! Come see.

32
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,330
It will suffice.

33
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,500
Knowing that the hunting guide would be none the wiser,

34
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,600
Piero presented him with a new shield,

35
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,930
while selling the original one to a vendor

36
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,760
for 100 ducats.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,700
And then the vendor resold it to the Duke of Milan himself

38
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,360
for 300 ducats.

39
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,930
Loath to pass up such a resource,

40
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:27,600
Piero arranged for his son to be brought under my tutelage.

41
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,200
I paid a finder's fee of 50 ducats.

42
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,430
A bargain, in my estimation.

43
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,400
His father sold you a bastard son.

44
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,430
Yes. But you know what?

45
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
I would trade 100 of you

46
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,800
to have another one like him on my doorstep.

47
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,030
I think you're drunk, old man.

48
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,800
And you're jealous, Botticelli.

49
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,700
Tomorrow... I'll be sober.

50
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,360
But you'll still be jealous.

51
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,230
You're preoccupied today.  

52
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,230
Painting...

53
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,830
is about... it's about more than just strokes.

54
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,630
There's perspective.

55
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,960
I mean, do I paint you from below...

56
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,230
or do I paint you...

57
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,630
from above?

58
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,660
And then there's symbols.

59
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,600
Do I paint you with a dog in your arms?

60
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,600
It's a symbol of loyalty.

61
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,200
Color. How about the particular shade of vermillion...

62
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,500
that I use for the blush of your cheeks?

63
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,200
And the folds of your dress.

64
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,860
Should they be...

65
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,530
lush and sumptuous...

66
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,660
or stiff and angular?

67
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,300
And perhaps...

68
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,330
no gown at all.

69
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,800
If I was a dutiful servant,

70
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,160
I'd consider the needs of my patron.

71
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,560
But I'm not, so that...

72
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,560
That is what I struggle with.

73
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,260
You can't take your eyes off that.

74
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,430
What's so beautiful about it?

75
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,460
It's the same thing I see in you. It's a mystery.

76
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,360
It's a puzzle,

77
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,100
and I will stop at nothing to figure it out.

78
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,130
Francesco.

79
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,760
The walls of my Cappella Maggiore lean and crumble,

80
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,260
just as Rome itself is in disrepair.

81
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,130
This place must become a grand palace of the Lord,

82
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,430
celebrating his glory in marble

83
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,160
and majestic brushstrokes

84
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,130
from the most enlightened hands on earth.

85
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,700
I will build a gleaming chapel

86
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,900
with the stories of Christ and Moses frescoed on the ceiling.

87
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,160
A tribute to the everlasting grace of God.

88
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,960
I can assure you, Your Holiness,

89
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,660
if you move your accounts from the Medici Bank...

90
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,130
to my own, you'll have all the funds you need.

91
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,560
This will require more than funds.

92
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,860
Resurrection requires death.

93
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,730
And in this case,

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,730
the sacrifice for Rome's rebirth

95
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,400
will be Florence.

96
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,200
However, the Medici have certain capabilities we are unsure we can best.

97
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,260
We've tried a frontal assault.

98
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,100
We may need you to develop

99
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,530
other... less direct contingencies.

100
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,360
The Medicis are the reason

101
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,560
Florence is a sanctuary for sorcerers and... sodomites.

102
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,700
They've turned my city away from the Lord.

103
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,700
Together, Holy Father, we will turn it back.

104
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,830
Now gather your men, Girolamo.

105
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,860
You've a role to play in this as well.

106
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,800
He's been with our family his entire life.

107
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,400
He taught us our letters.

108
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,500
I don't care if he held your prick when you first took a piss.

109
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,330
Becchi is a spy and a traitor.

110
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,600
His brother-in-law carries epic debts

111
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,430
which could only be met with the Roman scudos we found.

112
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,030
We broke the cipher in dozens of letters he hid.

113
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,260
Each one more incriminating than the last.

114
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,330
Now is not the time to show mercy.

115
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,300
So we're jailing old friends while making new friends with lunatics like Da Vinci.

116
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,730
Our grandfather made friends with lunatics.

117
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,630
Brunelleschi was one and he created the most majestic cathedral in Europe.

118
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,330
If you believe Becchi betrayed us,

119
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,930
it's you who's gone mad.

120
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,300
Lorenzo!

121
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,500
No! No, please!

122
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,500
Tell me, are you familiar with Abraham's prayer for Sodom and Gomorrah?

123
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,530
How many righteous people did Abraham initially promise

124
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,000
he would find in those blighted cities?

125
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,330
20?

126
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,030
Unfortunate.

127
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,860
No! Please!

128
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,700
And your answer?

129
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,800
No? No?

130
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,830
No idea?

131
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,960
Are there no faithful in this forsaken place

132
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,130
or are you all damned?

133
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,160
You. Stand.

134
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,930
Let us pray you know the right reply.

135
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,830
What?

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,530
50! Signor.

137
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,900
You are correct.

138
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,930
You will deliver this message to the Medicis.

139
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,830
It contains, in exacting detail,

140
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,660
the horrors witnessed here today.

141
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,860
Why in God's name are we here, Riario?

142
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,330
Tell me, Captain, how much did you give the Medicis for your coat?

143
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,730
I bought it in Rome, not Florence.

144
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,600
Every dyed fabric in Europe uses alum from these mines

145
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,430
to fix the dye.

146
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,760
Did you know, Pope Pius II

147
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,560
gave this mining concern to the Medicis

148
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,960
in return for forgiveness of papal debt.

149
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,230
And since then, every frock, sheet and shirt

150
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,360
has had a portion of its price going to Florence.

151
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,160
Today we killed three birds with one stone.

152
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,630
We took back what was rightfully Rome's.

153
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,700
We eliminated a lucrative source of Medici income

154
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,330
and most importantly...

155
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,230
we sent a message.

156
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,960
This is an art, this pursuit.

157
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,860
I like just making one of something.

158
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,860
Well, you'd better get used to it. We've got plenty more copies to go.

159
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,660
What is it that I'm getting used to?

160
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,400
Making each soldier's death indistinguishable from the last?

161
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,060
Leonardo, you're needed at the palace.

162
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,900
You playing errand boy now, Father?

163
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,300
In these traitorous times, we fill any role required.

164
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,860
Come on. The Medicis are none of them patient men.

165
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,500
Not you two.

166
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,630
This is state business, not a sideshow.

167
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,800
If you are in this room,

168
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,730
it is because you reside in my innermost circle of trust.

169
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,160
And if you are in my circle,

170
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,500
it is because we share a common vision for Florence.

171
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,800
A city that will be remembered for centuries

172
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:26,300
as a cynosure of innovation and artistry.

173
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:31,500
I have received word from Tolfa, Commander Quattrone,

174
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,930
that Count Riario has attacked our alum mine.

175
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,660
This is a casus belli. An act of war.

176
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,400
It is easy to be for Florence in times of peace.

177
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,930
Not so in times of war.

178
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,700
Those who cannot stand with us should leave.

179
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,400
It is better to be a coward now than a traitor later.

180
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,800
I recently lost my most trusted advisor to treachery.

181
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,260
He currently sits in the Bargello awaiting his fate on the wheel.

182
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,800
In the Medici court, we punish treason

183
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,530
and we reward service.

184
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,830
Would the young man who brought me this scroll please come forward.

185
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,730
So tell us, please, how did you come by the scroll?

186
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,500
A Tolfan miner, sir.

187
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,160
Count Riario killed all but one

188
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,660
whom he tasked with delivering the scroll.

189
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,960
And would you tell us what it says?

190
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,060
Riario has an army, sir.

191
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:35,860
He intends to occupy Florence unless you do as Rome asks.

192
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,000
Did the miner convey this to you?

193
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,430
He's a simple man, sir. I doubt he can read.

194
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,960
So you broke the seal

195
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,630
and revealed its contents to others?

196
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,230
Arrest him.

197
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,500
- Warm up the wheel with his bones!  - Please, sir! No!

198
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,360
I will show no mercy to those who betray the Medici name.

199
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,930
Each of you has a responsibility to this community.

200
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,160
To protect. To invent. To maintain order.

201
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,530
To support.

202
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,600
To uphold the sacred honor of the Medici legacy.

203
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,330
We all knew this day would come.

204
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,560
We will not submit.

205
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,030
We will fight.

206
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,860
Alla Battaglia Firenze!

207
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,700
Alla Battaglia Firenze!

208
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,360
I think I have a cat in my bag.

209
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,630
Would you like to kick that, too?

210
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,900
Enough.

211
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,330
A city that will be remembered for centuries to come,

212
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,000
as a cynosure for innovation and artistry.

213
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,700
That's a direct quote from Becchi's counsel to you,

214
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,060
when you were a shit-scared 19-year-old poet about to ascend the throne.

215
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,500
- Not now.  - Yes, now.

216
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,930
There's a difference between strength and cruelty, Lorenzo.

217
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,330
Leave cruelty to Sixtus and his brutes,

218
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,230
or it won't be Rome...

219
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,030
it'll be our own people who move against us.

220
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,600
Do me a kindness, brother.

221
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,330
When I ride out to meet Count Riario,

222
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,300
stay home.

223
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,730
Ladies and gentlemen, I have here the shattered ankle bone of St Alibinus.

224
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,330
A single shard of which is guaranteed to protect,

225
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,000
against all pirates and all ruffians.

226
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,430
And, for a few soldi more,

227
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,530
the fingers of the esteemed martyr St Bessus!

228
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,930
- It's Bess-us, you idiot!  - Oh, piss off.

229
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,960
- What causes this commotion?  - Who else wants some?

230
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,460
People have gathered for an execution.

231
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,900
Gentile Becchi wasn't meant to be brought up until the full moon.

232
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,060
No, not Becchi. A servant.

233
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,960
Thanks to him, word of Riario's incursion has spread like wildfire,

234
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,230
and Lorenzo wants to make an example.

235
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,500
The Confraternity of Death are such vultures.

236
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,030
Someone has to pray for the condemned.

237
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,760
This is ugly business for a lady.

238
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,260
No.

239
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,560
Even a lady must support the Medicis against spies.

240
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,300
God.

241
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,060
How long will this take?

242
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,500
It can last hours.

243
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,130
God help any man who betrays Lorenzo.

244
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,060
What are you reading?

245
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,730
A Book of Hours.

246
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,900
In the original Latin, no doubt.

247
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,300
I always hated that language.

248
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,730
As was evident in your studies.

249
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,630
Perhaps you were simply a piss-poor teacher.

250
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,560
Perhaps.

251
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,760
I'm sorry it's come to this.

252
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,260
Mm.

253
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,960
Why didn't you tell us about your family's need for money.

254
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,860
I would never have troubled you with my relatives' mishaps.

255
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,930
But you would take coin from Rome?

256
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,930
Ask yourself, my boy.

257
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,560
If money had motivated me, why wouldn't it have been spent already?

258
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,130
Instead of lying conveniently in my quarters awaiting discovery.

259
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,760
Along with the papal seals of Rome.

260
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,460
I want to believe.

261
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,830
You counseled my grandfather Cosimo. My father.

262
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,230
You've given your life in service to Florence.

263
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,700
Always doing your best to protect the Medici name.

264
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,760
But when I am gone, Giuliano,

265
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,760
I will no longer be able to provide such protection.

266
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,930
Are you innocent of these charges or not?

267
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,760
- Of course I am.  - Then why don't you fight them?

268
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,100
Because your brother is incapable of listening.

269
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,330
Lorenzo is consumed with wrath.

270
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,530
It blinds him to the dangers circling him.

271
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,930
There is a traitor in our midst.

272
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,460
After I am dead and Lorenzo lowers his guard,

273
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,660
the traitor will still be here.

274
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,830
People underestimate you, Giuliano.

275
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,700
Yet that perceived weakness makes you uniquely suited,

276
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,160
to flushing out a spy from cover.

277
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,460
Look after your brother.

278
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,700
He needs you. Now more than ever.

279
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,200
Riario will advance from the south,

280
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,330
through the Valdarno Valley.

281
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,630
We'll place weapons on all sides,

282
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,360
but the majority will meet his men here.

283
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,630
We'll be outnumbered. They'll be outgunned.

284
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,360
With ten guns? Are you certain?

285
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,130
We're casting more muskets.

286
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,100
I promise you you'll never have to fire them.

287
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,900
Sometimes...

288
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,560
when all your enemy knows is killing,

289
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,900
a simple deception can suffice.

290
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,360
Riario is far more clever than you think, DaVinci.

291
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,100
Your wit won't get us out of this one.

292
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,930
Only your weapons will.

293
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,200
And I promise you they will fire.

294
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,700
- Magnifico!  - Commander.

295
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,130
- Artista.  - War engineer, actually.

296
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,230
That's a very handsome stallion you have there.

297
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,730
- Andalusian, no?  - Mm.

298
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,030
Given to me personally by Queen Isabella of Castile.

299
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,900
I've heard of these Andalusians.

300
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,430
I understand the breed's prone to ischemic diseases,

301
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,630
reduced blood flow, especially to the intestines,

302
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,030
which can lead to some unfortunate anal blockage.

303
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,900
Undoubtedly, you're used to the smell of shit following you wherever you go.

304
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,660
Hmm.

305
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,560
In an effort to avoid further bloodshed,

306
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,800
his Eminence has extended a list of demands.

307
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,460
First, Florence will formally embrace into its bosom,

308
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,130
Francesco Salviati as Archbishop of Pisa.

309
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:52,660
Second, the Medici Bank will forgive the Holy See of all debts.

310
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,330
And third, you will release,

311
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,830
certain artisans from their contractual obligations,

312
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,830
so that they might employ their gifts,

313
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,600
in service of His Holiness's new chapel.

314
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,530
And in which artist is His Holiness interested?

315
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,600
One... Pietro Perugino.

316
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,400
One Sandro Botticelli.

317
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,860
- Oh, Jesus...  - Ooh.

318
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,060
Leonardo DaVinci.

319
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,930
I'd rather have my testicles gnawed off by conger eels.

320
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,130
- Well, that can be arranged.  - And if we don't capitulate?

321
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,460
My forces will occupy Florence.

322
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:37,100
My guns will cut your men to ribbons.

323
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,800
Your fabled pipe organ muskets?

324
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,230
Well, yes, they will cut down some of them, but not all.

325
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,200
Thanks to Giuliano's bumbling,

326
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,600
I was aware that you possessed ten guns,

327
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,460
and given that I've observed them,

328
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,300
I simply deduced their cyclic rate of fire.

329
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,400
Between them, they're capable of launching,

330
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:56,000
33 volleys comprising 333 discharges.

331
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,700
Now, let's... Let's assume that...

332
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,530
two-thirds of them hit their mark.

333
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,230
But what happens while your brave militiamen are reloading?

334
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,960
My remaining 400 ride out.

335
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,930
And, yes, we will use your precious Florentines as target practice.

336
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,030
You face a walled city, Riario.

337
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,030
We can hold you off for six months at the least.

338
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,230
It takes but one person to open the gates from the inside.

339
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,560
Do you truly believe that in those months,

340
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,830
the call of the Holy Father,

341
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,530
won't be honored by a single soul in Florence?

342
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,630
You have 24 hours to ponder the Holy Father's offer.

343
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,830
Enjoy your day.

344
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,430
We need more guns, DaVinci.

345
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,130
Our lives depend on it.

346
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,430
Shouldn't we be building guns,

347
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,630
or at least preparing for the invasion?

348
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,860
- I'm sketching.  - Pomegranates.

349
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,430
Nothing escapes you.

350
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,600
Count Riario is nearly upon us.

351
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,360
I know damn well where Riario is!

352
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,630
- What are we doing here?  - I wonder about that myself.

353
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,100
Excuse us, Signora.

354
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,830
You're rather careless with your sketches, Artista.

355
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,900
You left a sheaf of them in my husband's study.

356
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,930
Shouldn't you be laboring for the security of Florence?

357
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,360
There's something about this pomegranate. I can't define it yet.

358
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,360
But the Greeks teach us everything can be everything.

359
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,560
And everything can be turned into everything else.

360
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,860
If we can't see the pattern in God's architecture,

361
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,730
it's because we're not looking closely enough.

362
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,460
Would you like your sketches back?

363
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,430
Of all of Lorenzo's treasures,

364
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,000
it was this bit of carved stone that caught your eye.

365
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:07,800
Has your husband ever mentioned it to you? Where it came from.

366
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,830
I believe he inherited it.

367
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:14,500
Perhaps from a man in the next room.

368
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,260
A magician.

369
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,460
Lorenzo's grandfather. Cosimo.

370
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:23,060
He ruled this city without ever holding office.

371
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:26,030
Oh, there's something about him.

372
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,160
You're welcome to study him at any time.

373
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,300
But for now I'd rather you returned to your guns. No?

374
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,930
I didn't come to Florence to live under Roman rule.

375
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,060
DaVinci.

376
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,630
A treat. For indulging me.

377
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,700
Thank you for meeting with me,

378
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,760
especially with all the concerns about Rome.

379
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:11,060
I know this is unorthodox, but circumstances forced my hand.

380
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,860
You know what's happened to Becchi.

381
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:18,500
The accusations that have been made.

382
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,860
I don't believe he's a traitor.

383
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,960
What do you want me to do?

384
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,460
Clarice has already agreed to advocate for Becchi.

385
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,360
You own the other half of my brother's heart. Will you do the same?

386
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,200
Are you so sure he's innocent?

387
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,360
I believe we can prove it.

388
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,530
Becchi has been giving me counsel.

389
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:44,060
Working with him, I know we can trap the real traitor.

390
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:51,060
Please, Signora.

391
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,700
Temperature's right.

392
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,100
Leo.

393
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,930
The fat-kidneyed foreman requires your help.

394
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,860
What do we know of Lorenzo's ancestors?

395
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,060
His father was a good, but sickly, man.

396
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:29,330
Who lived in the shadow of his father... Cosimo.

397
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,860
Wow. Really? How in fuck does this matter?

398
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,630
Rome's mercenaries are upon us.

399
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,060
Clarice Orsini gave me this today.

400
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,200
She said Lorenzo inherited it.

401
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,830
You're exhausted. Look at you.

402
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,330
Fixating on bric-a-brac when we need more guns. It's insane.

403
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:51,200
The keys on it are identical to the ones from the Jew.

404
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,900
The Vault of Heaven. The Book of Leaves.

405
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,600
How do the Medicis figure into it all?

406
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,900
Leo, I just don't see how a fucking mantelpiece antique,

407
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,430
keeps Riario's swords from our fucking necks.

408
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,500
Christ, Zo. Can you just drop it for one minute?

409
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,500
Do you have to prove your ignorance so damn often?

410
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,160
When the Byzantine Empire used the first cannons,

411
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:28,330
against the Ottomans during the siege of Constantinople,

412
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,900
the Turks were forced to flee.

413
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:34,000
30 years later, they returned with cannons of their own.

414
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,400
Bigger cannons.

415
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:40,460
And after a 55-day siege left such destruction...

416
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,460
that the city will never be the same.

417
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,200
Constantinople fell.

418
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:53,560
Then we've always got to make sure we've got the biggest cannon.

419
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,360
Oh...

420
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,330
It never ends.

421
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:09,130
Unless...

422
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,130
Unless I end it here.

423
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,160
Don't! That will cause an explosion!

424
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:22,360
Don't! Aargh!

425
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,960
Maestro, what have you done?

426
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:50,930
Sealed our fucking fate.

427
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,430
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

428
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,160
How long has it been since your last confession?

429
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,200
I'm... embarrassed to say.

430
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,630
Nearly a year.

431
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,560
Oh.

432
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,960
I have spoken with many shamed penitents tonight, child.

433
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,860
The wheel reminds people of the punishments,

434
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:28,060
awaiting those not reconciled with Our Father.

435
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:31,200
It's horrid.

436
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:36,260
I fear I myself drive someone toward a similar agony.

437
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,500
Every daughter of Eve faces the same dilemma.

438
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,300
I have been untrue.

439
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,600
And now someone else is suffering for it.

440
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,560
And he will endure unimaginable pain...

441
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,160
- and it's my fault.  - If I may.

442
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,930
I have heard something of the state of your marriage.

443
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:09,160
If you can offer up, even the smallest,

444
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,360
the tenderest bit of mercy,

445
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,360
I have no doubt it will be taken very well.

446
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:24,660
- Mercy has its risks.  - And rewards.

447
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,800
Liar!

448
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:43,260
"Good people of Florence, the Medicis are leading you to death."

449
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,100
You have to give Riario some credit.

450
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,530
He knows how to intimidate his prey.

451
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,460
People say Riario has 2,000 men to burn the city.

452
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,560
I heard 3,000.

453
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:58,660
The city will be safe. I'll make sure of it.

454
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:04,360
Pride is a deadly sin, Artista.

455
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,030
Il Capitano!

456
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,460
I didn't take you for a religious zealot.

457
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,800
A bully and an asshole, yes. A zealot?

458
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,200
It's...

459
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,500
I'm zealous about my family.

460
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:21,960
We pray every night that you're not leading this city to destruction.

461
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,630
What? I have that much power, do I?

462
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,700
We've had nothing but trouble since you talked your way into the Medici court.

463
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,600
Perhaps God is on the Count's side in this business.

464
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,300
I don't believe in any god,

465
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,430
who would side with that pig's bladder.

466
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,360
You blaspheme. 

467
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:44,200
Men like you artistic perverts are turning Florence into Gomorrah.

468
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,730
You're beating a quick path to the everlasting bonfire,

469
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,830
and dragging us all with you.

470
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:55,260
I'll send you to the bonfire even sooner.

471
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,500
I know you're a better swordsman than I, DaVinci.

472
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:03,300
Still...

473
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,160
I've struck the bone, eh?

474
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,830
Do you really want to blunt the edge of your blade on me

475
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,530
when you may need it sharp for Riario?

476
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:21,730
You're drunk, Leonardo.

477
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,430
Come on!

478
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,730
Oh, my God.

479
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,560
Jesus.

480
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,530
I heard what happened at the metal works.

481
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:57,830
You're better than this, Leonardo.

482
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,100
I thought I could save Florence. I thought...

483
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,930
my talents would be enough, but they aren't.

484
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,830
I've got nothing.

485
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,230
And because of me,

486
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,060
tomorrow morning, Lorenzo will be forced to surrender.

487
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:19,330
No, please. Florence and Rome have been at it since before you were born.

488
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,930
- It's politics.  - No, it's...

489
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,730
It's personal.

490
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,800
I have something they want.

491
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:30,660
Yes. Your talent.

492
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,000
The Pope wants my talent.

493
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:39,030
Riario wants my key.

494
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,660
- What key?  - The key from...

495
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,730
Nothing.

496
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,360
Come here.

497
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,630
If something burdens you...

498
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,960
maybe it's better just to let it go.

499
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,600
Wait. Wait.

500
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,260
What?

501
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,400
That's what Lorenzo requires of me.

502
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,030
Why did you destroy your guns?

503
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,030
Lorenzo.

504
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:57,300
He looked me in the eye and told me I was an inventor.

505
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:08,360
But this isn't invention. This is...

506
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,430
It's escalation. I build five, they build 50.

507
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,500
You might be the loveliest man I've ever known.

508
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,960
Hey.

509
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,200
Why do you say it with such sadness?

510
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,460
Maybe it's because I think none of us are worthy of you.

511
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,530
Why the pomegranates?

512
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,260
I don't know yet.

513
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,800
Do you know...

514
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:59,000
Now... Hades tricked Persephone into eating pomegranates,

515
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:59,000


516
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,200
when she left the underworld.

517
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,660
She said that their magic forced her to return to him.

518
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,300
It's true.

519
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,200
You should take one with you when you go.

520
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,760
It's not magic that binds me to you, Leonardo.

521
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,530
I hope you kill that bastard Riario.

522
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,530
Leonardo!

523
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,800
Leonardo!

524
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,260
Leonardo!

525
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,060
Oh, so you have the gall to remain in Florence?

526
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,060
You're either brave or unimaginably stupid.

527
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,900
A bit of both.

528
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,500
You sabotage our efforts. Why?

529
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,030
The guns wouldn't have ended this.

530
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,960
With all your experience in waging war, you decided that, did you?

531
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,800
You little...

532
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,630
Fuck!

533
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,700
I can't believe I trusted you.

534
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:18,230
You, a bastard. A charlatan. A peddler of knick-knacks!

535
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,730
My brother was right. I was a fool to believe in you. A fool!

536
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:26,360
My only recourse is to offer myself as Riario's hostage,

537
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,800
and I'll have to pray that if I put myself at his mercy,

538
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,800
that he will forego pillaging Florence.

539
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:38,160
I'll have to pray that he'll grant Clarice and our children safe passage.

540
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:43,960


541
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:50,130
isn't struck from the streets!

542
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:55,960
You gather what little you hold dear and you meet me in the field.

543
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:00,330
I want you by my side when I am forced to accept Rome's terms.

544
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,200
And if Riario wants you...

545
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:11,400
he can fucking have you.

546
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,800
Nico, it is good to see you again.

547
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,030
I trust your hand is mending.

548
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,530
Let us go straight to the terms of surrender.

549
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,300
Indeed.

550
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,500
I have certain...

551
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:57,030
require certain assurances.

552
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,800
Florence and its citizens are my chief concern...

553
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:01,330
Sorry. Sorry.

554
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:09,200
Um, we are clear whose surrender we're discussing here?

555
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,300
It's yours. 

556
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,800
DaVinci...

557
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,130
Nico, would you show the Count and Captain General our gift?

558
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:22,230
Now, since you'd calculated the capacity of my guns,

559
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,600
I've endeavored to improve Florence's odds.

560
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,300
It's a question of mathematics.

561
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,600
How to pack a group of spheres in the most economic fashion.

562
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:37,700
And since nature always employs the most efficient means to achieve her ends,

563
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,160
I've taken inspiration from her.

564
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:49,400
I call it the cluster bombard.

565
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,160
The casing houses a grouping of smaller explosives,

566
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,700
an Archimedean solid,

567
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,230
which is separated by iron spacers.

568
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:05,560
So when the bombard lands, it fragments into a fountain of shrapnel.

569
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:09,860
I estimate one bombard could take out a dozen of your men and their mounts.

570
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:13,530
Now, I know what you're thinking.

571
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,100
You're thinking, "Well, fair enough.

572
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:19,960
A bombard's really only as good as one's ability to lob it."

573
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,460
So, fair enough. You'd be right.

574
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:27,300
However...

575
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,130
Zo!

576
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,060
Let's go.

577
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,800
Impressive.

578
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,330
But how do I know that contraption even works?

579
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,060
Allow me to demonstrate on a smaller scale.

580
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:00,300
First, we light the bombard.

581
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:06,460
Then we fire it... like so.

582
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:22,430
The real, full-scale bombard doesn't carry fireworks, of course.

583
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,800
We will rain flame and destruction down on your men,

584
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:28,760
recalling Biblical devastation of old.

585
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,160
The peasants will pick the bone fragments of your men

586
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,530
from these fields for decades to come.

587
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:40,960
You... everything you've accomplished, will fade from memory.

588
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,100
Whereas our victory will be lionized for centuries.

589
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:48,060
Perhaps.

590
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,330
Or perhaps regardless of what happens today,

591
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:57,130
the opposite tale will be told, or no tale at all.

592
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:01,660
You see, a man once told me...

593
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:09,860
History is a lie.

594
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:33,230
Well played, Artista.

595
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:36,160
You'd... You'd do well to remember, though,

596
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:44,430
that a war is waged on many fronts.

597
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,330
Hyah! Hyah!

598
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:49,860
You pulled off quite a feat, Leonardo.

599
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,060
I would have liked to see it fire. Imagine the carnage.

600
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:58,130
Rome would have been holding funerals for months.

601
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,730
The crossbow it doesn't actually work.

602
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:08,100
It's more a feat of art than weaponry.

603
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,200
This sham... 

604
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,500
is the work of drunken artists.

605
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,530
They're more skilled in stage props than armaments.

606
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:23,600
How on earth can we have built the real device in one night?

607
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:30,400
Even if I had, the drawstring needed to fire the damn thing would have been ludicrous.

608
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:34,330
- Look at it.  - You wagered our fate on a bluff?

609
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,230
- I did.  - You only bought us a temporary reprieve.

610
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,360
You can't keep on bluffing Rome forever.

611
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,660
Can't we?

612
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:46,460
Life's precious, Lorenzo.

613
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:48,900
Even a traitor's.

614
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:51,360
I believe...

615
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:55,830
it was your grandfather, Cosimo...

616
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,430
who voiced a pertinent sentiment.

617
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,900
"We read that we ought to forgive our enemies.

618
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,860
We do not read that we ought to forgive our friends."

619
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,300
Sorry, brother. I was just having a rest.

620
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:41,400
Have you come to minister to the condemned?

621
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,260
Right.

622
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:03,500
I appreciate the visit but I've already made peace with my maker.

623
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,930
Signora.

624
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:24,360
You.

625
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,360
You're the one that slipped those documents into my quarters.

626
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:32,760
How long have they owned you?

627
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:36,760
A few years.

628
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,800
Then they approached you...

629
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,030
Before Lorenzo and I were involved.

630
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:48,060
Whatever promise they made, they will not honor it.

631
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,230
You have no idea,

632
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,360
of my circumstances.

633
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:57,030
There's more to this than Florence or Rome,

634
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,160
or my life.

635
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:02,330
Why are you here, Signora?

636
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:08,860
Because I do not wish to see you broken on a wheel.

637
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,500
What?

638
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,180
Hemlock.

639
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:20,668
How?

640
00:48:20,668 --> 00:48:24,271
A weapon stolen from the Secret Archives in the Vatican.

641
00:48:25,473 --> 00:48:29,276
A misericorde, modified with a single dose of poison.

642
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,812
Its bite is almost never noticed.

643
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,215
So no evidence will arise,

644
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:38,118
implicating Lorenzo's lover.

645
00:48:38,453 --> 00:48:40,254
Consider it mercy.

646
00:48:41,089 --> 00:48:44,292
This is the fastest and most painless death I can offer.

647
00:48:44,326 --> 00:48:45,893
And I will see that it takes.

648
00:48:45,928 --> 00:48:47,929
This isn't mercy.

649
00:48:47,963 --> 00:48:51,399
This is you... tying off loose ends.

650
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:02,243
Rome chose well.

651
00:49:05,247 --> 00:49:06,881
- Guard!  - I'm sorry.

652
00:49:08,818 --> 00:49:11,019
I wish there was another way.

653
00:49:22,397 --> 00:49:23,597
Becchi!

654
00:49:25,967 --> 00:49:27,367
Guards!

655
00:49:28,035 --> 00:49:30,270
Guards, quickly!

656
00:49:38,311 --> 00:49:39,812
Hemlock.

657
00:49:39,846 --> 00:49:43,048
- Becchi would not have done this.  - The vial speaks for itself.

658
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:45,885
And you have a history of not believing things,

659
00:49:45,919 --> 00:49:48,687
that Becchi has clearly done.

660
00:49:51,725 --> 00:49:53,726
Question is, brother,

661
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,061
who brought Becchi this poison?

662
00:49:56,897 --> 00:50:00,933
Was it someone who sympathizes with his plight?

663
00:50:03,536 --> 00:50:07,472
If I were to defy you, brother, I wouldn't don a mask to do it.

664
00:50:08,474 --> 00:50:09,908
But what do you care?

665
00:50:09,942 --> 00:50:13,411
The traitor is dead, Florence is secure,

666
00:50:13,446 --> 00:50:15,480
and you've a war engineer to fete.

667
00:50:15,514 --> 00:50:18,716
All is well in the Republic tonight.

668
00:50:21,721 --> 00:50:23,856
The names and charges written on this paper,

669
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,726
require our immediate attention as Priori.

670
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,695
An anonymous denunciation?

671
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:30,564
The author's unimportant.

672
00:50:30,598 --> 00:50:32,799
This matter demands investigation.

673
00:50:32,834 --> 00:50:35,636
I'd caution you to consider who will be implicated.

674
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:38,139
As Priori, you are duty bound to uphold the law,

675
00:50:38,173 --> 00:50:40,708
unconcerned by who whomever it may incriminate.

676
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:44,245
Interrogate the victim mentioned here, Captain.

677
00:50:44,279 --> 00:50:48,449
Once he confirms the charges, make your arrest.

678
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:54,000
Wow, look at you!

679
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,260
Venetian breeches, bit of velvet, bit of brocade.

680
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,700
Did you buy those with your Medici vouchers?

681
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,900
What concern is it of yours?

682
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,430
Who traded in chits to muster the men,

683
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,530
to sneak your phony crossbow out of the city? Hm?

684
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:10,960
Who assembled all the pieces in the middle of the night, risking his life?

685
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,930
Cos it wasn't Nico. Yet somehow that little bull's pizzle,

686
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,800
wins an invitation to Lorenzo's palazzo and I don't.

687
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:19,760
Nico hasn't been arrested a dozen times for lewd behavior,

688
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,060
and pickpocketing, grave robbing.

689
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:25,260
I can't have you there tonight, Zo. Sorry.

690
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,830
These people...

691
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,200
decorum means everything to them.

692
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,260
Where is your guest of honor, Lorenzo?

693
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,160
If we're to praise an artist, perhaps it should be Signor Botticelli.

694
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,500
At least he has blessed up with his presence.

695
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,300
No need to honor someone who honors themselves so well, brother.

696
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,330
Every time I find myself looking for DaVinci, he seems to have...

697
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,130
vanished like smoke.

698
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,460
Is there a reason you're avoiding the party, Maestro?

699
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:14,230
It's being held in your honor.

700
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,560
Something's needling me, Nico.

701
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:22,560
Till I can discover what it...

702
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:25,130
Ha!

703
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:28,400
Yes!

704
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,360
The old magician's laughing.

705
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,830
I'm an idiot.

706
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,130
The symbols couldn't be clearer.

707
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:41,260
I am a son of Earth and Starry Heaven.

708
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,360
I am thirsty. Please give me something to drink,

709
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:46,760
from the fountain of Memory.

710
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
The invocation for the Sons of Mithras. Look.

711
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,060
A bull pulling a plow.

712
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,230
Christian iconography but it's also the pagan symbol for Earth.

713
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:58,900
A star-filled heaven.

714
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,130
A chalice, symbolic of a fountain.

715
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:06,200
And flowers. Ne M'oubliez Pas, in French.

716
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,460
Forget-me-nots.

717
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,300
Memory.

718
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,400
Cosimo de Medici...

719
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:16,600
was a Son of Mithras.

720
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:19,430
It's as if all my inquiries are converging.

721
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,930
It's as if a grand web is being spun.

722
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,930
One so incalculably wide and ancient,

723
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,130
that I'm only now beginning to grasp its scope.

724
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,100
I have proven myself to Lorenzo.

725
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,100
I've earned his trust.

726
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,830
It's time for him to repay me in kind.

727
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,330
By doing what?

728
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,730
By funding an expedition.

729
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,560
To the land indicated on the Jew's map.

730
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,960
A ship, provisions for a journey.

731
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,760
The Vault of Heaven is out there, Nico.

732
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:51,460
It's harbing the Book of Leaves.

733
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,660
All the knowledge it contains, I can hear it calling to me.

734
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:57,930
And the magician is leading me to it.

735
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:02,530
My grandfather, Cosimo, had a dream.

736
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,160
That our streets and squares,

737
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,900
would be a haven for science, art and learning.

738
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:13,160
No son of Florence better represents those ideas,

739
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:14,460
than Leonardo DaVinci.

740
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:19,730
I name you...

741
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:24,060
Grand Master of the Order of St John the Baptist,

742
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:28,800
patron saint of Florence.

743
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:33,000
I give you the living embodiment of classical brilliance.

744
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,460
Leonardo DaVinci.

745
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:46,760
Please, Maestro, won't you grant us a few words?

746
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,960
Florence's greatest export has always been its ideas.

747
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:03,330
Our Republic represents the cutting edge of inquiry.

748
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:08,560
We are inventing the future.

749
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:12,830
But we can only remain vital if we keep on pushing outwards,

750
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,760
so I propose a bold new step.

751
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,900
I have learned of a land, your Magnificence, to the west.

752
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:23,960
It's largely uncharted but it's certain to contain wonders.

753
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:28,900
Now, with your patronage, I shall mount an expedition.

754
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:34,030
We will voyage...

755
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,930
Captain Dragonetti, what is the meaning of this affront?

756
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,630
My apologies, Signor.

757
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,900
A grave accusation has been levied against one of your guests.

758
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,530
I know nothing of any accusations.

759
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,100
May I remind you, Nazzareno, that you answer to me.

760
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,530
Technically, I answer to the Signoria, your Magnificence.

761
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:55,230
Of which you are but one voice.

762
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:58,860
I couldn't dissuade them, Signor. It's protocol.

763
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:03,100
Our hands were tied.

764
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:06,800
Go on then, Captain.

765
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,530
It has come to the attention of the Officers of the Night,

766
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,530
by means of secret denunciation,

767
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,460
that one Leonardo di ser Piero DaVinci,

768
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,460
has committed, in violation of the statutes of the Republic of Florence,

769
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:26,660
and divine and natural law, the grievous act of sodomy.

770
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:29,000
Said individual is to be immediately remanded...

771
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,860
These are lies. This is slander!

772
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:32,400
Whereupon he will remain,

773
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:36,260
until the Magistrates ascertain his guilt or innocence.

774
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,160
Should he be found guilty,

775
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:41,230
he will be led through the public squares to the Palace of Justice,

776
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:45,530
and there be burned so that he dies...

777
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,900
and his body is separated from his soul.

778
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:53,100
No! You...

779
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,860
This is your work, Francesco.

780
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:57,630
I smell the Pazzi stench all over this charade.

781
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:00,500
The denunciation is real, Lorenzo.

782
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,660
We've a victim willing to testify.

783
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:06,200
No-one has been sentenced for this crime for more than 50 years.

784
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,300
And yet it's still on the statute books.

785
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:12,630
If you've issues with it, take it up with your forebear Cosimo.

786
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:15,200
Was it not he who revised Florence's constitution?

787
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:18,500
Or would you flout our fair Republic's laws as you see fit?

788
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:23,000
I was under the impression we lived in a democracy.

789
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:29,600
- Not a dictatorship.  - Your wrists, Signor.

790
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:44,590
Told you that you take the quick path to the bonfire, Artista.

791
00:57:50,001 --> 00:57:54,999


792
00:57:56,001 --> 00:58:05,999

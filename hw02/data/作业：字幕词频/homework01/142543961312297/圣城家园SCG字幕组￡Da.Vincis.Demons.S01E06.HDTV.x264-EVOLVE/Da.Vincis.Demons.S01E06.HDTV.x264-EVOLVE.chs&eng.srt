1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,699
总有一天 你将饮下记忆之泉的水
One day, you will sip from the Fountain of Memory.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,130
到那一天 我们还会再见
When that day comes, we will meet again.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,930
再一次证明了你就是一堆没脑子的傻肉
Time again, you prove to be no more than dead weight.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,460
也许你应该把我
Perhaps you should mark me a traitor,

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,100
也当成叛徒宰了
and have me killed as well.

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,630
人们会低估你 朱利亚诺
People underestimate you, Giuliano,

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,000
而这种观念使你特别适合
Yet that perceived weakness makes you suited,

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,400
从暗处抓出间谍
to flushing out a spy from cover.

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,860
是你把那些文件放进了我的房间
You're the one that slipped those documents into my quarters.

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,760
你变节多久了?
How long have they owned you? 

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,430
你跟她一样惹人生气!
You are just as exasperating as she was!

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,700
- 她死了吗?  - 没什么区别 她离开了
- Is she dead?  - No difference, she's gone.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,600
所以你才不敢直视我 因为她离开你了
That's why you can't stand to look at me because she left you.

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,060
- 我看到一个人  - 他是谁 莱昂纳多?
- I saw a man.  - Who was it, Leonardo?

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,100
放开我
Free me.

16
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,900
- 你看到了什么?  - 是我自己
- What did you see?  - It was me.

达芬奇的恶魔 第一季第6集

20
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,400
这是疯了吗?
Is this madness?

21
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,400
怎么... 怎么可能?
How... how could it be?

22
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,530
在那个洞里...
In that cave...

23
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,300
放开我
Free me.

24
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,660
我还是个孩子...
How could I have seen myself...

25
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,060
怎么可能看到成年的自己?
when I was not yet myself?

26
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,200
在你出生的很久之前 密特拉之子
The sons of Mithras have been entwined with your destiny,

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,700
就与你的宿命纠缠在了一起 莱昂纳多
since long before you were born, Leonardo.

28
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,500
时间是一条河流
Time is a river,

29
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,660
而我们中有些成员已经学会了
and there are members of our fraternity who have learned,

30
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,400
顺流而下和逆流而上
to navigate it both upstream and downstream.

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,660
你可能会觉得自己还不是自己
You may think that you're not yet yourself.

32
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,200
不过在每一刻 你都既是那个曾经的顽童
But, in every moment, you are both the child you once were,

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,430
又是将会成为的圣贤
and the sage you will some day be.

34
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,730
- 这不是答案  - 我从没答应过给你答案
- That's not an answer.  - I never promised you answers.

35
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,430
找答案的话 你要找到叶之书
For those, you will need to find the book of leaves.

36
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,930
牵绊着全人类问题的答案
Answers to questions that haunt all men.

37
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,600
也有你心中问题的答案
Questions that haunt you.

38
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,400
- 我母亲的命运  - 还有更多
- The fate of my mother.  - And more.

39
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,700
我说的是你的命运
I speak of your destiny.

40
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,060
我很欣赏这表演 阁下
Much as I enjoy the entertainment, signor,

41
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,800
我们是来跟公爵讨论雇佣他的佣兵的
we came to talk to the duke about hiring his mercenaries,

42
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,860
不是来看他们毫无意义的斗殴
not to watch them beat each other senseless.

43
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,630
先生们 来点蜂蜜酒吗?
Some mead, fine sirs?

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,960
谢谢 对 好的
Thank you. Yes, indeed.

45
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,900
我们加了点蜂蜜
We mull it with a little honey.

46
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,060
乌尔比诺公爵领地的特产
The pride of the duchy of Urbino.

47
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,560
- 一点蜂蜜?  - 别废话 快喝
- A little honey?  - Just fucking drink it.

48
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,660
漂亮! 厉害!
Brilliant! Bravo!

49
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,160
- 美第奇!  - 乌尔比诺!
- Medici!  - Urbino!

50
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,700
你战斗的样子像是一个渴望战斗很久的人
You know you fight like a man who's not seen battle for far too long.

51
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,860
是啊 已经都很多年了
It's been too many years. Yes.

52
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,430
我是费德里科・达・蒙泰费尔特罗 乌尔比诺公爵
Federico Da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino.

53
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,960
这位是莱昂纳多・达芬奇
Leonardo Da Vinci.

54
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,530
居然在看书? 天啊!
Reading? My!

55
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,600
这本启蒙读物是金泰尔・贝奇给我的
This primer was given to me by Gentile Becchi.

56
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,260
你还在怀念他
You mourn him still.

57
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,600
嫂子 我有什么可以为你效劳的?
How may I serve you, sister-in-law?

58
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,730
过些日子 我们要给马尔泰迪・格拉索举行一场宴会
We are due to hold a pageant for Martedi Grasso, some days hence.

59
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,260
希望你可以陪我
I hoped you might escort me.

60
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,660
就算洛伦佐从外交活动上回来了
Even if Lorenzo returns from his diplomatic forays,

61
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,500
宴会一开始他总是要找些公事去做
he usually finds pressing business when the revels begin.

62
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,900
至少他付了宴会的钱
At least he pays for the revels.

63
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,400
可是我去又有什么用呢?
But what is a lady to do for a partner?

64
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,800
我只能感谢洛伦佐还有个弟弟
I can only thank heaven Lorenzo has a brother,

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,100
而且舞技了得
who knows his way around a dance floor.

66
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,260
嗯 请原谅 我还有计划要布置
Mm. You must forgive me, but I have a plot to unravel.

67
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,560
贝奇让我负责查出我们之中的内鬼
Becchi charged me with ferreting out the spy within our midst.

68
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,160
可是证明贝奇是内鬼的证据确凿
But the evidence against Becchi was overwhelming.

69
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,600
事实证明了内鬼的能力
Testament to the ability of our spy.

70
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,030
他是个天才
He is a kind of genius.

71
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:35,230
那么宴会的时候 我只能一个人了
I will soldier on at the revels without you, then.

72
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,230
我已经被你的奉献精神打动了
I'm touched at your dedication.

73
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,130
事实上 你机遇无限...
The fact that, for all your opportunities...

74
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,930
而却只想做正确的事
you're so intent on doing the right thing.

75
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,830
也许这就是你最有魅力的品质
Maybe your most attractive quality.

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,960
夫人 该服药了
My lady, it is time.

77
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,930
我的私刑又到了
My personal torturer has arrived.

78
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,600
- 你知道我们没得选择  - 嗯
- You know we have no choice.  - Mm.

79
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,130
经过早些年的失败 如果我想生个儿子
Twice a day, I must down this potion,

80
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,630
就要每天两次 喝这个方子
if I'm to produce a boy, after my earlier failures.

81
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,930
摩西 告诉朱利亚诺这里都有什么
Oh, Moses, tell Giuliano what's in this.

82
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,860
我自己说不出口
I cannot bring myself to say the words.

83
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,060
驴奶 鹿茸粉
Asses' milk, powdered goats' antlers,

84
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,660
公牛睾丸....
Bull's testicles...

85
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,230
朱利亚诺 你要是能生个儿子
Giuliano, you could spare me this liquid atrocity,

86
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,960
我就不用喝这个了
if you would father a son yourself.

87
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,560
如果我们再不赶紧生个儿子
If we do not produce a male heir soon,

88
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,060
或者没有直系的子嗣降生
somewhere in our line,

89
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,730
美第奇家族将会
the house of Medici will start,

90
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,430
变成不稳定的投资项目
to look like an unstable investment.

91
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,660
我们都有自己的职责 我明白
We each have our duty, I see.

92
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,500
干杯
Salut.

93
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,600
在那里
It's there.

94
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,600
从位置上看这块大陆在西方
Logic dictates that land lies due west.

95
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,530
你觉得只是需要辨别出一个简单的基本方向
You think the identification of a simple cardinal direction,

96
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,700
就可以达到目的?
is all you need to find your goal?

97
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,500
足够让我开始行动了
It's all I need to get started.

98
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,330
你可能得花上百辈子的时间一直向西
You could spend a hundred lifetimes traveling west,

99
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,200
明白吗?
could you not?

100
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,230
阿乌拉罕・本・尤瑟夫带到佛罗伦萨来的地图
The map Avraham Ben Yosef brought to Florence,

101
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,730
不是原始的 只是一张副本
is not an original, but a reproduction,

102
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,200
布满其中的标记只有一个人能够解读
riddled with notations that only one man can decipher.

103
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,900
就是复制它的绘图者
The cartographer who copied it.

104
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,430
- 又是个密特拉之子?  - 他的名字叫所罗门・奥拜
- Another son of mithras?  - His name is Solomon Ogbai.

105
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,360
我们叫他阿比西尼亚人
We call him the abyssinian.

106
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,530
对你来说幸运的是 他还没死
Lucky for you, he is not dead.

107
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,400
暂时还没有
Not yet.

108
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,130
你还可以救他
You have yet to save him.

109
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,800
他在为土耳其苏丹效力的时候
His retinue was brutally intercepted,

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,260
被粗暴地劫持了
while he was traveling under the employ of the Ottoman Sultan.

111
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,630
一个野蛮的军阀拿他当做战俘
A most savage warlord holds him captive.

112
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,030
外交手段甚至赎金 都换不回他
The abyssinian cannot be freed by simple diplomacy, or even ransom.

113
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,730
只能依靠你的奸诈和创造性了
It will take guile and inventiveness which only you possess.

114
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,660
很微妙的时刻 我跟佛罗伦萨有委任关系
These are delicate times. I have commitments to Florence.

115
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,730
你的宿命不在佛罗伦萨 莱昂纳多
Your destiny lies elsewhere, Leonardo.

116
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,300
趁阿比西亚人还活着把他救出来
Save the abyssinian while he still breathes.

117
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,130
我必须再考虑考虑 不能...
I have to think it over, I can't...

118
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,330
你已经考虑好了
You've already thought it over.

119
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,330
事实上 你的旅途已经开始
In truth, your journey has already begun.

120
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,230
时间... 是一条河流
Time... is a river.

121
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,800
你已经做出了决定
You have already made the decision.

122
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,430
你每次都会做决定
You make it every time.

123
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,560
他又拿硬币给你演示了 是吧?
He's done the coin thing, has he?

124
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,800
你就是绘图者
You're the map maker.

125
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,660
我还以为你需要解救呢?
I thought you needed rescuing?

126
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,160
- 会的  - 在将来?
- I will.  - In the future?

127
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,900
你越早脱离现在和将来这些词汇
The sooner you move beyond words like present and future,

128
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,630
就越早成为我们想要你成为的人
the sooner you become the man we need you to be.

129
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,300
密特拉之子都不会好好说话吗?
Are all the sons of Mithras unable to speak plainly?

130
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,830
我承认 有时候我们很难理解 不过你也可以
I admit, on occasion, we can be inscrutable, but so can you.

131
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,800
我要在光天化日之下
I wanted to meet the storied Da Vinci,

132
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,500
见到那个传说中的达芬奇
in the bright of day.

133
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,360
一旦鬼门关开启 我们就是不同的人了
We're different men, once hell breaks loose.

134
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,000
什么时候会开启?
And when's that happen?

135
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,460
我们自认为道高一尺
Hell happens when,

136
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,630
而当魔高一丈的时候
the evil of this world exceeds our belief,

137
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,230
灾难就要降临了
that we can conquer it.

138
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,430
你问我你什么时候才能达到那个程度
You ask me when you'll reach that point.

139
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,160
我不能说
I cannot say.

140
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,200
取决于你自己
Depends on you.

141
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,300
不管什么情况降临在我们头上 都不要退缩
Whatever befalls us, do not shirk from the task.

142
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,700
我有创造机会的能力
I have a knack of rising to the occasion,

143
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,630
只要能告诉我是什么样的机会就行...
if I might only be told what the occasion is...

144
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,200
我冒险告诉你
I venture to say it's true,

145
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,560
密特拉之子们在你身上看到的都是真的
what the sons of mithras have seen you in you,

146
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,460
而且你每天都在接近 艺术家
and you are closer every day, artista.

147
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,100
- 接近什么?  - 醒来
- Closer to what?  - Wake up.

148
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,730
你们要带我去哪?
Where are you leading me?

149
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,600
带... 带你? 大师 是你在带路
L... leading you? Maestro, you're the one leading us.

150
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,000
什么?
What?

151
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,160
你半夜叫醒我们 让我们去按照你的吩咐准备东西
You woke us in the night, gave us one of your shopping lists.

152
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,060
买更多的镁粉
Buy more magnesium,

153
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,300
买些东方产不知名的酒精饮料
obtain obscure alcoholic beverages from the east,

154
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,030
三匹马...
acquire three horses...

155
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,600
你有计划的 忘了吗?
You had some plan. Do you not remember?

156
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,100
我有 有 我想起来了
I do, I do. I remember it.

157
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,660
- 我们已经...  - 几天了
- How long have we...  - Days.

158
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,830
这一路上你都生着气
You've been a sullen fuck the entire trip,

159
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,460
就为某个被劫持的外国傻货
all for some foreign halfwit who got himself abducted.

160
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,460
- 阿比西亚人  - 好像...
- The abyssinian.  - It's like...

161
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,200
我好想刚睡醒一样
It's like I'm just waking up.

162
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,060
我在路上丢失了部分自我
I lost part of myself on the journey.

163
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,060
- 去哪里的路上?  - 不是哪里...
- Journey where?  - It's not where...

164
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,860
是何时
it's when.

165
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,830
这个世界的恶魔
The evils of this world.

166
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,200
城堡周围有些奇怪的东西
There's something odd around the castle.

167
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:40,830
- 这是什么?  - 看看就明白了
- What's this?  - You'll see what it does.

168
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,060
这是谁的领土?
Whose kingdom is this?

169
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,160
当地人叫他斯戴普斯
The locals call him Stepes.

170
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,500
我们来找的就是他?
That's the man we've come to confront?

171
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,030
抓了你要的战俘的是个该死的暴君?
The one who has your captive is the fucking impaler?

172
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,130
我在战斗中瞎了右眼
I lost my right eye in battle.

173
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:05,000
摘掉鼻梁之后 这样我还能有一些间接视力
Removed the bridge of my nose, so I'd still have peripheral vision.

174
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,200
就这样
There.

175
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,000
很聪明 对吧?
Clever, eh?

176
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,860
很是... 亮眼
That is quite... gleaming.

177
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,760
我们来解释一下来这里的原因吧
And so we should explain our reason for being here.

178
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,660
- 皮耶罗?  - 可以吗?
- Piero?  - May I?

179
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:24,200
在你我领地之间有两块教皇的土地
The two papal states flank your land and mine,

180
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,600
在我们一只眼睛盯着罗马的时候...
and while we can watch Rome with one eye...

181
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,830
总要用另一只... 呃眼睛
we must always keep another...eye,

182
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,760
盯着北方教皇的土地
always on the pope's property, to the north.

183
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,960
除非...
Unless...

184
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,960
北方领土成为我们的
the northern realm became our property.

185
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,630
要怎么实现呢?
And how would that happen?

186
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,600
哦 如果我们结盟
Well, if we allied ourselves.

187
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,700
佛罗伦萨和乌尔比诺
Florence and Urbino.

188
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:56,960
我们分割领土之间的教皇土地就成为可能了
It'd make sense if we could carve up the northern papal territory between us.

189
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,430
我可以征服博洛尼亚城和它附属的土地
I can annexe the city of bologna and its environs.

190
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,560
而你可以让自己在亚得里亚海的港口翻倍
You could double your port capacity on the adriatic.

191
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,930
果断一击 不过为什么我不能自己征服这一整片呢?
A bold stroke, but why don't I conquer it myself?

192
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,430
我出人 你出什么?
I have the army. What do you offer up?

193
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,300
当然是出钱
Money, of course,

194
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,760
从全欧洲最大的银行
from the largest banking concern in all of Europe.

195
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,830
从我们每个受到...
From each of us, as he is...

196
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,560
眷顾的人手里
blessed.

197
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,430
吓到你了 是吧?
Scared you, didn't I? 

198
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,930
别紧张 美第奇
That'll be fine, Medici.

199
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,000
我不该刺激我的教子的
I shouldn't provoke my own godson,

200
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,100
不过我喜欢考验人
but I like to test a man.

201
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,500
你证明了自己是个值得信任的盟友
You've grown to be a worthy ally.

202
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:39,230
而且我已经很久没有带人参加过战斗了
And it's been too long since I led my men into combat.

203
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,800
看来 我们的请求非常适时
Our proposal is timely, indeed.

204
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,860
你来找我的时候
I knew you had something juicy in mind,

205
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,430
我就看出你心里有鬼了
when you showed up on my doorstep.

206
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,560
你大老远跑来
There's no way you'd caravan all this distance

207
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,230
肯定不是来看我拉屎的
just to watch me take a shit. 

208
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,130
头巾被钉在头骨上
Their turbans are nailed to their skulls.

209
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,200
这都是土耳其人的尸体 显然城堡主人和土耳其打过仗
All Turkish. Clearly this warlord has an issue with the Ottomans.

210
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,700
他勇猛抗击土耳其 最后坐了十三年牢
His bravery against the Turks won him 13 years in prison.

211
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,660
既然我们都不是土耳其人
But, seeing as none of us are Turks ourselves,

212
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,030
就没有什么好担心的了
we should have nothing to fear.

213
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,430
他不会误把我当做土耳其人吧?
You don't think, with my blood, someone could take me for a Turk?

214
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,760
我怎么知道他不会看错人?
How do I know this warlord's eyes aren't failing?

215
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,230
因为我从很远就听见你了
Because I spotted you from miles away.

216
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,930
虽然我失明 但我能听到你们谈话
Though I were blind, I could hear the clattering

217
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,760
从很远就能听见你们鞑靼人在这瞎扯
and nattering of your tartar tongue from further yet.

218
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,460
- 我不是鞑靼人  - 那你是谁?
- I'm not a Tartar.  - What are you, then?

219
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,160
- 一个不同寻常的人  - 不同寻常?
- Unique.  - Unique?

220
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,130
屎壳郎也觉得自己不同寻常啊
Dung beetles think they're unique.

221
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,130
一听你就是混血的杂种
Your mongrel half-breed lineage speaks louder than your words.

222
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,860
上帝用各种手段惩罚人类
You see god, well, has many punishments for mankind.

223
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,560
地震 火山喷发 瘟疫 癌症
Earthquakes, volcanoes, plagues and cancers.

224
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,730
更糟的是 他送来了土耳其和鞑靼人
Worse than these, he sent the Turks and the Tartars

225
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,760
还有你这样的杂种
and the mongrels, like you.

226
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,330
贵安 弗拉德龙骑士之子
Ave, vladislaus Dracula filius,

227
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,800
特兰西瓦尼亚公国王子
Vaivoda partium transalpinarum.

228
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,000
特兰西瓦尼亚和瓦拉几亚公国王子
Prince of Transylvania and Wallachia,

229
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,700
弗拉德二世 名为弗拉・德拉库或弗拉德龙骑士
Son of Vlad II known as Vlad Dracul, or Vlad the Dragon,

230
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,900
您是弗拉德三世 龙骑士之子
which makes you Vlad III, Son of the Dragon.

231
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,500
在您的语言里称为 德拉库拉
Or as it is known in your language, Dracula.

232
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,000
很好 你知道我的爵号
Impressive, your command of my titles,

233
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,160
现在告诉我 你是谁 到这来干什么
but tell me who you are and what you want here.

234
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,160
我是莱昂纳多大师
My name is Maestro Leonardo.

235
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,660
这是我的同伴 尼科和琐罗亚斯德
These are my companions, Nico, Zoroaster.

236
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,600
我们是佛罗伦萨总督
We were sent by the magnificent Lorenzo De Medici

237
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,660
洛伦佐・美第奇派来的
of the Republic of Florence.

238
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,260
全意大利都想知道您是怎样打败土耳其人的
All of Italy wonders at your victories against the Ottomans,

239
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,130
我的领主希望和您交好
and my lord extends his friendship

240
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,830
并请您到佛罗伦萨和瓦拉吉亚公国
and seeks military counsel for the greater glory

241
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,730
做军事顾问
of Florence and Wallachia.

242
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,160
你知道这片土地已经被战争
You must know this land has been bedeviled by war,

243
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,260
折磨得满目疮痍
and worse than war.

244
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,600
我们可以...
We shall talk more...

245
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,700
边吃边谈
at dinner.

246
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,060
但愿他要吃的不是我们
As long as the dinner's not us.

247
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,700
教皇的浴室现在只要购票就可以进来了 是吗?
So we're selling tickets to the papal baths now, are we?

248
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,660
这是件紧急的事
An urgent matter has arisen.

249
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,930
紧急到你都可以让她进来玷污这里吗?
Urgent enough that you sully this chamber with her presence?

250
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,560
我知道在哪能找到妓女 不用你找
I know where to find whores if I want them.

251
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,930
我们觉得你最好直接听她汇报
We thought it best you hear this news directly from her lips.

252
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,230
我刚从佛罗伦萨来 陛下
I've come from Florence, your holiness.

253
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,200
你从城里跑出来...
And does your absence from the city...

254
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,830
不会引起怀疑吗?
create no suspicion?

255
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,600
我在锡耶纳的姑妈会给我找借口脱身
My aunt in Siena is providing me with an alibi.

256
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,530
佛罗伦萨没有政要会惦记我
No-one of import will miss me in Florence.

257
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,160
显然你丈夫不属于那种人
Certainly your husband doesn't fall into the category of import.

258
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,000
洛伦佐的战争工程师最近怎么样?
What of Lorenzo's war engineer,

259
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,630
洛伦佐特别赞赏的那个
in whom the count seems so fascinated?

260
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,660
达芬奇离开了城市
Da Vinci has set out from the city.

261
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,800
没人知道他去了哪里
No man knows where.

262
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,330
女的也不知道?
Nor woman?

263
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,500
我也不知道
Nor I.

264
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,400
洛伦佐本人也离开了佛罗伦萨
Lorenzo himself has left Florence.

265
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,030
现在
As we speak,

266
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,460
他正在会见乌尔比诺公爵
he makes an embassy to the duke of Urbino,

267
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,530
也刚与斐迪南和伊莎贝拉
fresh with the credit of his dealings

268
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,130
达成协议
with Ferdinand and Isabella.

269
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,830
他希望与他们建立新的军事联盟
He seeks to create a new military alliance.

270
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,360
这个深谋远虑的流氓
The calculating rogue.

271
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,000
我们试图削弱洛伦佐的势力
Far from reeling at our attempts to weaken his rule,

272
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,930
可是他却在半岛上召集起了一支
Lorenzo courts the most accomplished mercenaries

273
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,930
训练有素的军队
on the peninsula.

274
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,530
我知道他们的行动是什么
I know what the naval do with them.

275
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,900
他和乌尔比诺将会向北进军
He and Urbino will march north.

276
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,630
一起掠夺我们博洛尼亚的土地
Together, they'll sack our lands surrounding Bologna

277
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,400
然后将其瓜分
and divide them up.

278
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,760
您是怎么知道的 神父?
How do you know, holy father?

279
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,500
因为我也会这样做 你这该死的懦夫
Because it's exactly what I'd do, you fucking coward.

280
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,160
看看你们
Look at the lot of you.

281
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,830
吓得不敢把这消息告诉我
Too scared to bring me this news yourselves.

282
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:04,460
躲在这个佛罗伦萨淫妇身后
Hiding behind this Florentine slit.

283
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,100
看看我这些手下的怂样
How can I wonder Lorenzo resists me so well,

284
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,760
难怪洛伦佐能轻而易举地抵抗我
when I see the quality of my allies?

285
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,560
我们只想尽力为您效忠
We only tried to serve your glory.

286
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,330
我们没想享受您的神圣指引
We had not the benefit of your divine guidance.

287
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,630
指引? 你想要指引?
Guidance? You want guidance?

288
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,300
还记得上帝选择我的征兆吗?
Do you remember what proved I was chosen by god?

289
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,460
有很... 很多征兆 陛下
So... So many things, your holiness.

290
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,300
我小时候没有被水淹死
The way I survived drowning as a child.

291
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,060
让我看看你怎么样
Let's see how you do.

292
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:54,700
神父 无疑... 仁慈的上帝会宽恕他的
Holy father, surely... a loving god shows mercy.

293
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,160
你敢质疑我?
You dare question me?

294
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:00,100
你敢质疑上帝所说的话
The rock upon which god's words stands.

295
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,930
吻这枚戒指
Kiss this ring.

296
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,300
你们毁了我的沐浴
My bath is ruined.

297
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,630
不管你用什么手段 给我干掉美第奇家族
I don't care how, end the House of Medici,

298
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,260
不然我就干掉你
before I end you.

299
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,400
晚宴已备好
Dinner awaits.

300
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,060
我们怎么才能把那人救出来?
How are we supposed to free the captive from a place like this?

301
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,030
要是我知道 我就叫达芬奇了
If I knew that, I'd be Da Vinci.

302
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,260
你把钱扔在地上了
You've dropped some change.

303
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,460
你当然会看到这些钱
Of course, you'll have noticed the money.

304
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,200
苏丹币是东方异教徒使用的...
The sultanis is a base currency...

305
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,700
低劣货币
for the heathen ruler of the East.

306
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,730
这样我的士兵们就能向我
You see, this is how I allow my soldiers

307
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,930
证明他们的忠诚
to prove their loyalty to me.

308
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:09,830
我把这些苏丹币扔到地上 扔到他们面前
I toss these sultanis on the ground before them.

309
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,600
你知道吗? 这些硬币从未被碰过
And, do you know, the coins are never, ever touched?

310
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,330
胡乱扔这些货币的话
It's just they've fallen quite randomly,

311
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,200
你能听出哪个被捡走了?
you'd really notice if one was gone?

312
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,130
我从不遗漏
I miss nothing.

313
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,060
请坐吧
Please, now.

314
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,730
喝点托斯卡纳酒
A little Tuscan wine,

315
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,700
找找家的感觉 怎么样?
just to make you feel at home, no?

316
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,060
谢谢
Thank you.

317
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,900
您刚从狱中逃出来 却这样热情好客
I must say, I'm impressed with your hospitality,

318
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,530
很让我感动
so soon after your escape from captivity.

319
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,400
因为我习惯了狱中的生活
I am, sadly, at home in dungeons.

320
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,900
小时候 父亲把我的兄弟和我
As a child, my father sent my brother and me

321
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,730
送给土耳其苏丹做人质
to be hostages held by the Turkish sultan.

322
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,500
我的兄弟最终在狱中叛变
The prisons converted my damnable brother

323
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:03,430
他投降了土耳其 而我没有
to the cause of the Turks, but not me.

324
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,930
我学会了不相信任何人
I learned to trust nobody.

325
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,230
不相信任何人才能在痛苦 恶狗 地牢
To survive any pain, the dogs, the dungeons,

326
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,800
甚至在给我留下
even a lightning strike,

327
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,260
这疤痕的闪电中幸存
which has left me with this... web of scars.

328
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:23,600
如今我每时每刻都要反抗我的兄弟...
Now I spend every waking hour in resistance to my brother...

329
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:29,200
和该死的土耳其人
and the fucking Turks.

330
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:36,500
所有人都认可你的胜利
Well your victories against them have been recognized,

331
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,630
甚至罗马教皇
even by the pope.

332
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,460
如果要干杯
If we're going to raise a toast,

333
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,800
请敬给那个助我逃离监狱的
let's lift a glass to the one who helped me out of the prison this time,

334
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,730
光明使者
to the Bringer of Light himself.

335
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,530
是谁 殿下?
Who, my lord?

336
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,230
路西华 光明的使者
Lucifer, the Bringer of Light.

337
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,530
众天使中最美的一个
Most beautiful of all the angels.

338
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,300
撒旦怎样帮你?
And how did Lucifer help you?

339
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:05,660
和我一样 路西华反抗暴君
Like me, Lucifer rose against a tyrant.

340
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:11,100
和我一样 被他所爱的上帝抛弃和背叛
Like me, he was abandoned and betrayed by the god he loved.

341
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,530
我和路西华定下了协议 他将给我自由
I made a pact with Lucifer to win my freedom

342
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:19,360
并协我最后一次登上王座
and ascend to my throne one last time.

343
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,230
你知道吗?
Do you know?

344
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,630
没有了灵魂 我并不感到痛苦
I don't find it hard to live without a soul.

345
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,100
敬路西华
Lucifer.

346
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,930
怎么那么巧啊
And how fortuitous for Da Vinci.

347
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,230
我刚要来询问问题 这个聪明鬼就出城了
The clever devil leaves just as I arrive with questions.

348
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,860
你不觉得好奇吗?
You don't find that curious?

349
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,400
相信我 先生 这是他最不值得好奇的事
Trust me, signor, that's the least curious thing about him.

350
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,630
你和他什么关系?
What is your relationship with him?

351
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,330
我们好过...
We had our day...

352
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,730
但也就那么一天而已
but that's all it was, a day.

353
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,700
他总是专注于其它的事
And, anyway, his eye is set on another.

354
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,600
- 你怎么知道?  - 我是女人
- How do you know?  - I'm a woman.

355
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,200
我们当然只是朋友
No, of course we're friends.

356
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,300
他救过我一命 所以我很钦佩他
He saved my life and, for that, I deeply admire him.

357
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,300
这并不违法 对吧?
That hasn't become illegal, has it?

358
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,900
影响了佛罗伦萨的安全 那就是违法的
It has if it hurts Florence.

359
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,660
我想让你帮忙保卫佛罗伦萨
All I want is your help in guarding her.

360
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,560
我不知道他去哪了
I don't know where he's gone.

361
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,300
你很为他保守秘密
You keep his confidences well.

362
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,900
我可以和其他人撒谎 阁下
I'd like to lie to anyone else, excellency,

363
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,530
但我不会对你撒谎
but not you.

364
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,060
但是 要是你逼我撒谎的话
Although, if you tried to force it out of me,

365
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,130
我也就没有办法了
I'd be helpless to stop you.

366
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,800
或许我们应该到别处去谈
Perhaps we should discuss this somewhere else.

367
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,560
- 找个更安静的地方?  - 恩
- Somewhere more quiet?  - Mm.

368
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,660
在那里欢闹一下
Until we make it less so.

369
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,230
城门已经关了
The city gates are closed.

370
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,400
离宵禁还有两分钟 混蛋
Two minutes to curfew, scoundrel.

371
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,900
赶紧回家 不然就整夜待在这别走
Either you get your arses home or spend the night here.

372
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:09,530
谁宵禁后还在街上闲逛 我就把他的名字
Persons caught roaming the streets after curfew get put in my little book.

373
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,930
记到册子上 然后你就得向法官解释了
Being put in my little book means you explain your transgressions to the judge.

374
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,230
美第奇先生 抱歉
Signor Medici, forgive me.

375
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,100
我没看到你和她在一起
I hadn't seen you with a bar wench.

376
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,200
- 你的小册子?  - 我的记录本上面记满了蠢货
- Your little book?  - My ledger, full of pigs, mostly.

377
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,230
每桩违禁你都有记录?
You record every curfew violation?

378
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,830
自从禁令开始以来都有
Since the day it was declared.

379
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,300
所以如果查的话 可以查出有谁在不该出门的时候
If one were to study these, one might see who was out,

380
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,800
私自跑出去吗?
when they shouldn't have been?

381
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,430
没错 然后那个人就要挨罚了
Yes, if one were a glutton for punishment.

382
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,100
给我看看那些册子
Take me to them.

383
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,500
看这些记录可能要花几周的时间
One could speak weeks paging through these records.

384
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,700
那太好了 我兄弟说我最擅长浪费时间
Then we're in luck. According to my brother, I'm great at wasting time.

385
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,360
说说你的秘诀 先生?
Your secret, sir?

386
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,700
噢 知道要混合什么元素就好了
Oh, it's a matter of knowing which elements to blend.

387
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,930
加点镁粉 再加点铁粉之类的
Magnesium here, iron filings there, so on.

388
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,360
我觉得这很有创意
I think it's ingenious.

389
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,660
这个能应用到军事上吗?
Does it have a military application?

390
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,630
还不行
Not yet.

391
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,330
好吧 那我们以后一定还会再谈
Well, then, we must talk further.

392
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,760
自从我放弃基督上帝
Since I've renounced your christian gods,

393
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:09,530
我就只能用智慧和残暴
I've only my wits and ferocity to protect me

394
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,560
来抗击苏丹穆罕默德二世的军队了
from the forces of Sultan Mehmed II.

395
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,560
或许你给洛伦佐的这个发明
Perhaps the ingenuity you bring to Lorenzo's court

396
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,460
也可以让我受益
could benefit me as well.

397
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,400
现在...
Now...

398
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,660
既然你为我展示了这宴会节目
since you've shown me your little party piece,

399
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,600
我也要展示一下我的小消遣
I will respond in kind with a little diversion of my own.

400
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,230
你看啊 失去了沉重的灵魂
You see, without a soul weighing me down,

401
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,600
我的视线可以穿透黑暗
I can see in the dark.

402
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:40,760
我无法被杀死
I cannot be killed.

403
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:44,060
我可以享受一些几年前
I can enjoy certain entertainments

404
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,030
可能会吓得我面色惨白的娱乐节目
that may have made me blanch years ago.

405
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:54,060
这是土耳其使臣的最后一个随从
This is the last of the retinue of a Turkish ambassador

406
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,760
他愚蠢地试图接近我
who was foolish enough to approach me.

407
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,330
我要让土耳其人记住
I miss no opportunity in reminding the Turks

408
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,660
他们给我的童年
of the childhood they provided.

409
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,130
这是我们要找的那个人吗?
Is it the one we're looking for?

410
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,830
给他松镣
Unshackle him.

411
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,660
现在... 请你证明你比自己那些朋友强
Now... prove stronger than your friends.

412
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,460
打败这两只狗 我就放你自由
Defeat these dogs and you will go free.

413
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,500
别觉得我灭绝人性
And please don't think me so inhuman

414
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,660
连搏斗的机会都不给你
that I wouldn't give you a fighting chance.

415
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,000
给你这把黄油刀
Here's a butter knife.

416
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,400
求求你! 不要!
Please! Don't!

417
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,430
这...
This... 

418
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,630
这才是正义
This is justice.

419
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,530
我们可以上主菜了吗?
So... shall we send for the main course?

420
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,660
我吃不下去
I can't eat. 

421
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,500
我的口味不是人人都喜欢
My tastes are not universally shared, it's true.

422
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,730
- 我们散席吧  - 在那之前...
- Let us retire.  - Before we do...

423
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:32,800
您为我们准备了我们家乡的传统酒
you have honored us with the traditional wine of our homeland,

424
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:38,330
我们也为您准备了传统的瓦拉吉亚酒
and so do we honor you, with the traditional liquor of Wallachia.

425
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:42,200
- 你买了图伊卡酒?  - 嗯
- You've brought tuica?  - Mm-hm.

426
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:45,260
我们佛罗伦萨的总督对您表示钦佩
Well, our master in Florence would spare no expense

427
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,860
所以绝不会对您吝啬 殿下
to demonstrate his admiration for you, my lord.

428
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,560
敬弗拉德三世
To Vlad III.

429
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,900
我从没见过你们喝酒也会犹豫啊 朋友?
When have I ever known you to hesitate about a drink, my friend?

430
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,630
敬弗拉德三世
To Vlad III.

431
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,400
敬弗拉德三世
To Vlad III.

432
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,860
好
Good.

433
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,560
给你的仆人也尝一尝吧? 你的随从?
And some for your maid? Your men?

434
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,730
- 好  - 好? 恩
- Yes.  - Yes? Good.

435
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,300
好的
There you go.

436
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,500
你来一点... 你也来一点
Some for you... Some for you.

437
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,630
为这些朋友找个房间
Show the friends to a room.

438
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:42,030
- 来尝一点  - 等我的随从给客人敬酒之后
- Some for you.  - Once my guards have toasted our guests,

439
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,060
我还有话要和艺术家谈谈
The artisan and I will parley further.

440
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:50,230
给你的狗也尝尝怎么样? 今天娱乐节目很卖力
How about your dogs, who entertained us so well, this evening?

441
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,500
给你一些 最后一点给你
There's some for you, for you, the last little drop.

442
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,230
请别觉得难受
Please don't be unsettled by the vermin.

443
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,030
我欢迎老鼠
I welcome them.

444
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,000
通常在监狱里 他们是我唯一的朋友
Often, in prison, they were my only friends.

445
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:13,460
我知道被关在地窖里什么感受
Well, I know what it is to be thrown into a cell.

446
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,860
没有蝙蝠陪伴
Without the companionship of the bats,

447
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,000
我不可能活下来
I would not have survived.

448
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,930
你看
You see.

449
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,730
- 我们能相互理解  - 恩
- We understand each other.  - Hmm.

450
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,530
来吧
Come.

451
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,500
很漂亮 对吧?
Beautiful, is it not?

452
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:47,730
所以我才那么渴望回到波奈里古堡来
You see, this is why I wanted to return to castle Poenari so badly.

453
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,530
站在这高度...
From the heights...

454
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,930
我几乎可以忘却几十年来
I can almost forget the decades the Turks

455
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,030
那些被关在地牢里的土耳其人
have been living underneath the earth.

456
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,200
很遗憾 刚才那是最后一个土耳其人了
It's a shame, then, that was the last of them.

457
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,230
噢 其实还有一个
Oh, there is one more.

458
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:12,760
他们的主人所罗门・奥拜
Their master, Solomon Ogbai.

459
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,500
奥拜这个名字
The name Ogbai,

460
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,400
在阿姆哈拉语中 是"别带他走"的意思
In Amharic, it means don't take him away.

461
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,200
是啊
Yeah.

462
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,400
没错
Indeed.

463
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,600
为了报复他们让我卑躬屈膝
For stooping to serve them,

464
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,300
我在这个埃塞俄比亚人身上花了很长时间
I take my time with the Abyssinian.

465
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:38,600
为了我的兴趣爱好 我把他关了起来
I keep him ready for my personal whims.

466
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:42,030
我为他发明了新的折磨方式
I invent new ways to torture, just for him.

467
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,400
我把他关在靠窗户的地方
There is a window, near where I keep him.

468
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,500
他看不到窗外
He cannot see the view.

469
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:52,660
我说要是他能找来...
So I said I would recreate the scenery for him...

470
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:57,260
制作小模型的材料
if he would only provide me with

471
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,500
我可以为他造出那个景色来
the raw material for a suitable miniature.

472
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:10,200
这是我窗外那些塔的模型...
These are the crenulations of the towers outside my window...

473
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:14,300
是用那埃塞俄比亚人的肉刻出来的
carved in the abyssinian's own flesh.

474
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:22,300
他将永远看不到痛苦的边界
There is one frontier he shall never stop exploring.

475
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,530
痛苦
Agony.

476
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,400
我能和你说句真心话吗?
May I share a confession with you?

477
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,830
当然...
Yeah, yes...

478
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,600
请吧 殿下
if it pleases, my lord.

479
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,300
我知道...
I know...

480
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,900
我疯了
that I'm mad.

481
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:46,230
确实
Indeed. 

482
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:50,230
但请告诉我 不然我还能怎样?
But will you tell me how I could be otherwise?

483
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,200
父亲把孩子从家里带走
A father rips a child from his home,

484
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,700
夺去孩子熟识的一切
from everything he knows

485
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:57,860
然后把他扔到自己敌人的手掌中
and tosses him into the claws of his worst enemy.

486
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,860
我们...
Well, we are...

487
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,960
我们的命运通常被父亲决定了
We are too often what our fathers make us.

488
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,760
不管我们是否愿意 是好是坏
Whether we like it or not, better or for worse.

489
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,600
是的
Oh, yes.

490
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,000
我的情况肯定糟糕的
In my case, definitely for worse.

491
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,930
我父亲教给我
You see, my father, he taught me

492
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,760
残酷是全世界的通行货币
that cruelty is the only true currency of the universe,

493
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,800
如今我是基督国家最富有的人了
and now I am the richest man in all of christendom.

494
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,760
哈!
Ha!

495
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,300
- 天啊 你真在这里  - 恩?
- My god, it is true.  - Yes?

496
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,830
仆人告诉我 你抱了一大堆书回来
Servants told me you were carrying books upon books into your quarters.

497
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,630
我还以为他们喝多了
I wondered if they'd been raiding the wine cellar.

498
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,000
- 我很好取笑吗  - 只是有时而已
- I'm easy to tease.  - Only sometimes.

499
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,260
好吧 至少你有自己的爱好
Well, at least you have a hobby you love.

500
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,660
那你这个新爱好是什么?
And what is your new hobby?

501
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,530
佛罗伦萨人爱收藏记录的癖好有回报了
The Florentine obsession with record keeping is paying off.

502
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,600
这些是城里每个守卫 在每个站点的巡逻记录
These are the records to every guard at every station in the city.

503
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,860
无论什么理由 违反宵禁的人都会被记录下来
Anyone who breaks curfew even for a slight reason will be put down here.

504
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,060
包括那个真正的间谍
Including, I suppose, the true spy,

505
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,800
那个诬陷贝奇的人
whom you believe framed Becchi.

506
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:57,330
没错 可现在还有些问题
You smirk, but there are mysteries to be solved here.

507
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,930
比如 为什么里面有这么多星座的符号?
For example, why do these symbols from the zodiac keep coming up?

508
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,430
这个 我觉得是摩羯座的符号
This. That's the sign for capricorn, I think.

509
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,100
这个是水瓶座 对吧?
And this, that's aquarius, yes?

510
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,630
因为佛罗伦萨的某些贵族比较在意
With certain sensitive subjects of Florence,

511
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,500
自己的名字被列进违反宵禁的名单
their names are indicated with symbols,

512
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,430
所以就用符号代替他们的名字了
rather than list them clearly as violators of the curfew.

513
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,260
啊 这个日期我记得
Ah. This date I recall.

514
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:18,830
那天参加完整夜酒宴之后 我回家的路上被盘问了
After a long night of carousing, I was questioned on my way home,

515
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,930
所以这个符号代表我吗?
So is this the symbol for me?

516
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,660
因为您是体育冠军
Athletic champion that you are,

517
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,200
射手座的符号再适合您不过
Sagittarius is a natural code name for you.

518
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,530
那快告诉我这些符号都代表谁
Tell us the identity behind each of these symbols, then.

519
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,030
我也不知道这些符号的意思
I'm not privy to that knowledge.

520
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:32,530
- 这些都在德拉戈奈蒂队长的办公室里  - 给我拿来
- That's in captain Dragonetti's office.  - Obtain it for me.

521
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,360
贝奇会为你感到骄傲的
Becchi would be proud of you.

522
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,030
我们要救的人肯定已经死了
The man we're here to save must be dead by now.

523
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,500
不 还没死
No. No, not yet.

524
00:34:56,930 --> 00:35:01,230
但是... 但是我们必须赶快救他
But... but we must move to save him now.

525
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,900
你们两个去吧
You two can go on.

526
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,560
- 我觉得我可以睡上一周  - 我也是
- I feel like I could sleep for the next week.  - As could I.

527
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:12,300
那是因为我们中毒了
That's because we've all been poisoned.

528
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,160
什么?
What?

529
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,360
喝点解药
Drink some antidote.

530
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,660
那个混蛋
That bastard.

531
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,260
- 他在我们的酒里下毒  - 不是他
- He slipped something in our drinks.  - No.

532
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,830
是我
I did.

533
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,660
为了你那血腥的追求 你什么事都能做出来
There's nothing you won't do to us in your bloody quest.

534
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:44,530
我... 我在来之前给图伊卡酒里下了毒
I... I adulterated the Tuica before we arrived.

535
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:53,700
想让他相信酒是安全的 咱们必须先喝
That we'd all have to drink it, in order to convince him it was safe.

536
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,730
现在...
And now...

537
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:08,230
所有人 包括两条狗 都应该昏睡过去了
everyone, including the dogs, should be passing out.

538
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,330
准备好了吗?
Ready?

539
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,000
你怎么会认识路?
How do you know where we're going?

540
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,600
我做了简单的建筑结构分析
It's a simple architectural assessment.

541
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,460
那个埃塞俄比亚人用某种方式告诉了我
The Abyssinian pointed it out to me himself in a way.

542
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,530
你想告诉我们是什么方式吗?
Do we wanna know what you mean?

543
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,230
其实你们最好别问
No, actually, you don't.

544
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,460
就是这
It's here.

545
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:49,330
你确定吗 大师?
Are you sure about this, maestro?

546
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,030
不
No.

547
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,430
写的什么?
What does that say?

548
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,560
不要带我走
Don't take me away.

549
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,660
现在 这才是正义
Now, this, this is justice.

550
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,000
敬弗拉德三世
To Vlad III.

551
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,860
我这个混血的杂种向您道别
Farewell greetings from a half-breed Mongrel.

552
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,160
尼科...
Nico...

553
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:18,400
去备马 我去外面找你们
go get the horses. I'll meet you outside.

554
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,200
啊 那一根
Ah. That one.

555
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,060
小心 小心 小心
Careful. Careful. Careful.

556
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,060
这一根 然后那一根
It's that one, then that one.

557
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,030
别太快 不然会割得更深
Not too fast, he'll be cut even deeper.

558
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:57,900
没事了 可以了 都没事了
It's all over. It's OK. It's over.

559
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:00,860
没有 还没有
It's not. It's not.

560
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,760
那个不是他
It's not him.

561
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,030
不是弗拉德
It's not Vlad.

562
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,560
该死
Shit.

563
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,630
坏了
Fuck me.

564
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,230
你就是个自大的傻瓜 是吧?
You're an arrogant little fool, aren't you?

565
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,560
我免疫所有对人类有害的毒品和药剂
I've endured every drug and poison known to man.

566
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,930
我是从土耳其王国挣脱回来的
I fought off the Ottoman Empire.

567
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,330
你真的以为我会死在一个该死佛罗伦萨人
Do you really think that I would die at the hands,

568
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,760
手里吗?
of a fucking Florentine?

569
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,300
该死
Shit.

570
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,400
或者一个杂种手里吗?
Or a mongrel?

571
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,230
这东西当军事用品怎么样?
How's that for a military application?

572
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,900
琐罗 醒醒!
Zo, wake up!

573
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,460
醒醒! 琐罗!
Wake up! Zo!

574
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,160
生命...
Life...

575
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,130
生命就是个陷阱 你觉得呢?
Life is a trap, don't you think?

576
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,330
现在 我来放你自由
Well, now, I'm going to set you free.

577
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,230
有意思
Curious.

578
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,330
没有灵魂的人你是杀不掉的
You cannot kill a man without a soul.

579
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,600
你必须走
You must go.

580
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,460
不要退缩
Do not shirk from the task.

581
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:29,100
接下来的几天不要进佛罗伦萨城
Stay out of Florence for the next few days.

582
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:33,530
哦 而且不要跟洛伦佐说话 跟城里谁也别讲话
Oh, and don't speak with Lorenzo, or anyone in the city.

583
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:38,860
我觉得我可以去锡耶纳...
I suppose I could go to Siena...

584
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:43,430
编个故事解释我为什么不在 不过为什么呢?
and create a story to explain my extended absence, but why?

585
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,930
怀疑教廷计划
You've seen what happens,

586
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,700
是什么下场 你见过了吧?
when people question the plans of the Vatican, haven't you?

587
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:53,000
见过了
I have.

588
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:57,500
路上不要跟任何人讲话
Speak to nobody along the road.

589
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:00,830
也确定没人跟你讲话
And make sure no-one speaks with you.

590
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,660
这应该不难
That shouldn't be a problem.

591
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,900
我有办法
I have a strategy.

592
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,960
- 派人跟着她  - 明白
- Have some men follow her.  - Of course.

593
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,360
然后悄悄地杀了她
Then discreetly have her killed.

594
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,230
她对我们已经没有利用价值了
Her value to us has been exhausted.

595
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,130
她...
She's...

596
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,300
已经被自己对达芬奇的感情所影响了
compromised by her affections for Da Vinci.

597
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:34,100
是教皇命令这么做的吗?
Did his holiness order this?

598
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:37,430
在接近佛罗伦萨的地方动手
Do it outside the walls of Florence.

599
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,100
不要留下跟罗马有关的线索
Leave no ties to Rome.

600
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:42,200
布置成土匪杀人越货的样子
Make it look like bandits did it.

601
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:50,000
哦 还要... 刺穿她的双眼
Oh, and er... have them drive stakes through her eyes.

602
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,600
她看到的太多了
She's seen too much.

603
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,300
守卫 还有狗 就快醒过来了
The guards, the dogs, they're gonna rouse soon.

604
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,230
这伤口是哪来的?
Where did you get that wound?

605
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,730
还有比这重要的事情要解释
There are more urgent things to explain.

606
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:17,530
- 你知道会这样吗?  - 我知道有可能
- Did you know this would happen?  - I knew it might.

607
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:20,500
我不得不抓住机会 为了叶之书
I had to take that chance, for the book of leaves.

608
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:23,030
剑给我
Sword.

609
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,160
大师 我们给他处理一下伤口吗?
Maestro, shall we see to his injuries?

610
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,660
还有更要紧的事 而且我也不能死在这
They're beyond seeing to and I cannot meet my end here.

611
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,660
换句话说 离开这个鬼地方吧
In other words, fuck this place.

612
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,800
我要往弗拉德的尸体上吐口唾沫
I want to spit on Vlad's body.

613
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:38,600
是 可以 如果能找到在哪就行
Yeah. Well, you could if we knew where it was.

614
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,530
他妈的跑哪去了?
Where the fuck is he?

615
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,200
别管了! 走吧!
Just come on! Let's go!

616
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,000
也许是有什么动物给拖走吃了
Maybe some creature dragged him off.

617
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,000
咱们别管了 走吧
Let's not find out. Come on.

618
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:01,460
你一定要试试这个 卡米拉
You really must try this, Camilla.

619
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,800
你肯定比你哥哥喜欢甜食
Surely you have a sweeter tooth than your brother.

620
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,660
你的笑都比他甜
You certainly have a sweeter smile.

621
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:08,100
加点蜂蜜
Some honey.

622
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:12,460
乌尔比诺公爵领地的特产
The pride of the Duchy of Urbino.

623
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,360
我跟他们的公爵协约了
Oh, I've made arrangements with their duke.

624
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:20,030
有了他的强援 我真可怜那些妄图侵害佛罗伦萨的人
With rawn like his, I pity those who wish harm upon Florence.

625
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:22,400
这样你会赚到盆满钵满的
You'll have your hands full with that one.

626
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,430
费德里科・达・蒙泰费尔特罗是个... 很有意思的人
Federico Da Montefeltro's a... colorful character indeed.

627
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,760
- 你邀请我们来是要炫耀新的盟友的吗?  - 伯纳德!
- Did you invite us here to show off your new alliance?  - Bernardo!

628
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,230
巴龙切利先生 我都不记得邀请过你
I don't recall inviting you at all, Signor Baroncelli.

629
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:40,360
也许你是没理解我去乌尔比诺的原因
Perhaps you fail to understand why I went to Urbino.

630
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,730
你觉得罗马会照顾帕吉家族
You think Rome will look after the Pazzis.

631
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,700
不过 等一切都过去之后
But, when all is said and done,

632
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,830
罗马照顾的只有罗马自己
Rome only looks after Rome.

633
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:54,830
而你们二位都是佛罗伦萨的皇家子弟
And you both of you are loyal sons of Florence.

634
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:03,500
你们难道不认为我们自己共和制下结合的时代已经到来了...
Don't you think the time has come for union in our republic...

635
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,600
而不是吃里扒外?
not further divisions?

636
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,360
我弟弟朱利亚诺脑子很笨
My brother Giuliano has a stubborn mind,

637
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:14,330
不过心肠很好
but a good heart.

638
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:18,200
某个角度上讲 我们也想让他受到教皇的封赐
At one point, we hoped to see him in a cardinal's hat,

639
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:23,060
不过以我们目前与教廷的关系行不通了
but our current relations with the church have precluded that.

640
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:28,360
不过 一个朱利亚诺这样的年轻人 需要未来
And yet, a young man like Giuliano, needs a future.

641
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:34,530
他应该可以成为卡米拉的好丈夫...
He would make a fine husband for Camilla...

642
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,500
不是吗?
would he not?

643
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,000
还有人要加蜂蜜吗?
Honey, anyone?

644
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,100
再会
Farewell.

645
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,330
再会(意大利语)
Arrivederci.

646
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,730
不管帕吉家族同不同意这次联姻 我都要问
Whether or not the Pazzis agree to this union, I have to ask,

647
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:57,500
你问过你弟弟这件事情了吗?
did you consult your brother about this?

648
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:02,060
朱利亚诺的利益就是佛罗伦萨的利益
Giuliano's interests are the interests of Florence.

649
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,600
别担心 我跟他谈之前 会拿走房间里所有易碎品
Don't worry. I'll have breakable objects removed from the room before I broach the topic.

650
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:08,600
她可是我们敌人的孩子 阁下
She is the child of our enemy, Signor.

651
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,360
会有人认为我们把他送入虎口的
Some might argue he is being thrown to the wolves.

652
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:15,530
你低估我弟弟了 皮耶罗
You underestimate my brother, Piero.

653
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,860
我们不是割肉饲虎
We are not feeding these wolves.

654
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,160
而是驯虎
We are taming them.

655
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,000
你知道他要提这个事情吗?
Did you know he was going to propose this?

656
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:34,760
算是有吧...
I had an inkling...

657
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,300
正合我意
seeing as it was my idea.

658
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:48,330
- 你服药了吗?  - 别紧张
- You've had your elixir?  - Relax.

659
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:52,930
据说在挫折时怀上的孩子出生都会痛苦
They say children conceived in frustration are born bitter.

660
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:58,000
你会明白我们周围这些恶魔们已经让我焦虑不安了
You'll understand I'm agitated by this league of devils around us.

661
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:59,730
经过我们对帕吉家族的计划之后
After our ploy with the Pazzis,

662
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,730
你还没有准备好再一次行动
you're not ready for another master stroke.

663
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:11,100
医生说这个方子更容易让我们怀上个男孩
Our doctor said this position is more likely to conceive us a male heir.

664
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,060
男人都喜欢把女人的脸压得很低
Men would prefer a position where a woman's face,

665
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:16,460
低到甚至不能说话的姿势
is rammed down so far she can't even speak.

666
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,600
抱歉 你说什么 亲爱的?
I'm sorry, what was that, dear?

667
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,060
来吧
Please.

668
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,130
喔!
Wooo!

669
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:38,230
是铁笼
It was the cage.

670
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,830
是铁笼 铁笼割的
It was the cage. It was the cage.

671
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,330
上面写的字说不要带他走
The words written on the don't take him away.

672
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,960
不是讽刺 是警告
It wasn't a taunt, it was a warning.

673
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:54,300
如果你被救出来 弗拉德制造的这个装置...
Vlad built the device to eviscerate you if you were freed...

674
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,830
就会撕开一条暗伤
to rip an unstanchable wound.

675
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:00,860
我早该发现的
I should've realized.

676
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:03,400
- 抱歉  - 没关系
- I'm sorry.  - Never mind.

677
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,200
我必须给你讲讲你要找的钥匙
I must tell you of the key you seek.

678
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,000
打开天穹的另一把钥匙?
The other key that opens the vault of heaven?

679
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,600
对 告诉我
Yes, tell me.

680
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:20,530
在罗马 等你去拿
It's waiting in Rome, there for your taking.

681
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:25,000
而且 当你拿到两把钥匙的时候...
And, when you have both keys...

682
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,460
你母亲卡特琳娜
your mother, Caterina.

683
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:32,430
她还活着
She is alive.

684
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,860
她为我们带着叶之书
She carries the book of leaves for us,

685
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:43,960
在我地图里那块大陆上...
beneath the post of the sun in a town made of stone...

686
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,900
石头小镇的太阳之柱下
in a land on my map.

687
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,630
为什么... 我需要你给我解释地图
Why... I need you to decode the map.

688
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,030
那你就要拿走你需要的
Then you may take what you need.

689
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,060
在这
Here.

690
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:06,060
这就是能破译地图的秘密
Here is the secret to deciphering the map.

691
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:10,530
我不可能活着跟你走
I will not survive to come with you.

692
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:16,300
等我死了你必须把它割下来...
You must cut my flesh loose and take it with you...

693
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,260
带走
once I die.

694
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:25,200
那个土耳其人说我可以解救你
The turk said that I would save you.

695
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,600
而且你会的...
And so you will...

696
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:31,300
某一天...
someday...

697
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:33,800
不过不是今天
but not today.

698
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:41,630
但之前你还有很多事情要学
But there are so many things you must learn first.

699
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,500
是吗? 什么?
Yes? Yes?

700
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:49,400
你要学会一切皆有可能...
You must learn that anything is possible...

701
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,760
包括失败
including defeat.

702
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:59,100
- 你要... 学会...  - 什么? 什么?
- You must... learn...  - What? What?

703
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,300
什么?
What?

704
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:09,300
- 什么? 什么?  - 大师...
- What? What?  - Maestro...

705
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,960
- 我要学会什么?  - 大师 他死了
- I must must learn what?  - Maestro, he's gone.

706
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,930
- 大师  - 我要学会什么?
- Maestro.  - I must learn what?

707
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,730
我要学会...
I must learn...

708
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,530
该死! 该死! 该死!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

709
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,660
该死! 该死
Fuck! Fuck.

710
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:35,660
我来过这
I've been here before.

711
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:39,000
- 没有 这不是我们来的路  - 不 不是那个意思
- No, this isn't the path we came in on.  - No. No.

712
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,860
这是我跟阿比西亚人第一次见面的地方
This is where the Abyssinian and I first met.

713
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,000
他警告我...
He warned me...

714
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,030
我觉得可以解决问题...
I thought I could solve things...

715
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,400
如往常一样
like I always do.

716
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,030
我们自认为道高一尺...
Hell happens...

717
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:20,800
而当魔高一丈的时候
when the evil of the world exceeds our belief,

718
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:25,360
灾难就要降临了
that we can conquer it.

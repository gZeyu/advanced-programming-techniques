1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,699
One day, you will sip from the Fountain of Memory.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,130
When that day comes, we will meet again.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,930
Time again, you prove to be no more than dead weight.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,460
Perhaps you should mark me a traitor,

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,100
and have me killed as well.

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,630
People underestimate you, Giuliano,

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,000
Yet that perceived weakness makes you suited,

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,400
to flushing out a spy from cover.

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,860
You're the one that slipped those documents into my quarters.

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,760
How long have they owned you? 

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,430
You are just as exasperating as she was!

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,700
- Is she dead?  - No difference, she's gone.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,600
That's why you can't stand to look at me because she left you.

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,060
- I saw a man.  - Who was it, Leonardo?

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,100
Free me.

16
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,900
- What did you see?  - It was me.

17
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,300


18
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:59,300


19
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,800


20
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,400
Is this madness?

21
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,400
How... how could it be?

22
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,530
In that cave...

23
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,300
Free me.

24
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,660
How could I have seen myself...

25
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,060
when I was not yet myself?

26
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,200
The sons of Mithras have been entwined with your destiny,

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,700
since long before you were born, Leonardo.

28
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,500
Time is a river,

29
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,660
and there are members of our fraternity who have learned,

30
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,400
to navigate it both upstream and downstream.

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,660
You may think that you're not yet yourself.

32
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,200
But, in every moment, you are both the child you once were,

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,430
and the sage you will some day be.

34
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,730
- That's not an answer.  - I never promised you answers.

35
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,430
For those, you will need to find the book of leaves.

36
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,930
Answers to questions that haunt all men.

37
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,600
Questions that haunt you.

38
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,400
- The fate of my mother.  - And more.

39
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,700
I speak of your destiny.

40
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,060
Much as I enjoy the entertainment, signor,

41
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,800
we came to talk to the duke about hiring his mercenaries,

42
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,860
not to watch them beat each other senseless.

43
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,630
Some mead, fine sirs?

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,960
Thank you. Yes, indeed.

45
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,900
We mull it with a little honey.

46
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,060
The pride of the duchy of Urbino.

47
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,560
- A little honey?  - Just fucking drink it.

48
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,660
Brilliant! Bravo!

49
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,160
- Medici!  - Urbino!

50
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,700
You know you fight like a man who's not seen battle for far too long.

51
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,860
It's been too many years. Yes.

52
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,430
Federico Da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino.

53
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,960
Leonardo Da Vinci.

54
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,530
Reading? My!

55
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,600
This primer was given to me by Gentile Becchi.

56
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,260
You mourn him still.

57
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,600
How may I serve you, sister-in-law?

58
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,730
We are due to hold a pageant for Martedi Grasso, some days hence.

59
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,260
I hoped you might escort me.

60
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,660
Even if Lorenzo returns from his diplomatic forays,

61
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,500
he usually finds pressing business when the revels begin.

62
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,900
At least he pays for the revels.

63
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,400
But what is a lady to do for a partner?

64
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,800
I can only thank heaven Lorenzo has a brother,

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,100
who knows his way around a dance floor.

66
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,260
Mm. You must forgive me, but I have a plot to unravel.

67
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,560
Becchi charged me with ferreting out the spy within our midst.

68
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,160
But the evidence against Becchi was overwhelming.

69
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,600
Testament to the ability of our spy.

70
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,030
He is a kind of genius.

71
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:35,230
I will soldier on at the revels without you, then.

72
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,230
I'm touched at your dedication.

73
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,130
The fact that, for all your opportunities...

74
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,930
you're so intent on doing the right thing.

75
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,830
Maybe your most attractive quality.

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,960
My lady, it is time.

77
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,930
My personal torturer has arrived.

78
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,600
- You know we have no choice.  - Mm.

79
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,130
Twice a day, I must down this potion,

80
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,630
if I'm to produce a boy, after my earlier failures.

81
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,930
Oh, Moses, tell Giuliano what's in this.

82
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,860
I cannot bring myself to say the words.

83
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,060
Asses' milk, powdered goats' antlers,

84
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,660
Bull's testicles...

85
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,230
Giuliano, you could spare me this liquid atrocity,

86
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,960
if you would father a son yourself.

87
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,560
If we do not produce a male heir soon,

88
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,060
somewhere in our line,

89
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,730
the house of Medici will start,

90
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,430
to look like an unstable investment.

91
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,660
We each have our duty, I see.

92
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,500
Salut.

93
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,600
It's there.

94
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,600
Logic dictates that land lies due west.

95
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,530
You think the identification of a simple cardinal direction,

96
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,700
is all you need to find your goal?

97
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,500
It's all I need to get started.

98
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,330
You could spend a hundred lifetimes traveling west,

99
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,200
could you not?

100
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,230
The map Avraham Ben Yosef brought to Florence,

101
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,730
is not an original, but a reproduction,

102
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,200
riddled with notations that only one man can decipher.

103
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,900
The cartographer who copied it.

104
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,430
- Another son of mithras?  - His name is Solomon Ogbai.

105
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,360
We call him the abyssinian.

106
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,530
Lucky for you, he is not dead.

107
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,400
Not yet.

108
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,130
You have yet to save him.

109
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,800
His retinue was brutally intercepted,

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,260
while he was traveling under the employ of the Ottoman Sultan.

111
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,630
A most savage warlord holds him captive.

112
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,030
The abyssinian cannot be freed by simple diplomacy, or even ransom.

113
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,730
It will take guile and inventiveness which only you possess.

114
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,660
These are delicate times. I have commitments to Florence.

115
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,730
Your destiny lies elsewhere, Leonardo.

116
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,300
Save the abyssinian while he still breathes.

117
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,130
I have to think it over, I can't...

118
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,330
You've already thought it over.

119
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,330
In truth, your journey has already begun.

120
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,230
Time... is a river.

121
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,800
You have already made the decision.

122
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,430
You make it every time.

123
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,560
He's done the coin thing, has he?

124
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,800
You're the map maker.

125
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,660
I thought you needed rescuing?

126
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,160
- I will.  - In the future?

127
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,900
The sooner you move beyond words like present and future,

128
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,630
the sooner you become the man we need you to be.

129
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,300
Are all the sons of Mithras unable to speak plainly?

130
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,830
I admit, on occasion, we can be inscrutable, but so can you.

131
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,800
I wanted to meet the storied Da Vinci,

132
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,500
in the bright of day.

133
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,360
We're different men, once hell breaks loose.

134
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,000
And when's that happen?

135
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,460
Hell happens when,

136
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,630
the evil of this world exceeds our belief,

137
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,230
that we can conquer it.

138
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,430
You ask me when you'll reach that point.

139
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,160
I cannot say.

140
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,200
Depends on you.

141
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,300
Whatever befalls us, do not shirk from the task.

142
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,700
I have a knack of rising to the occasion,

143
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,630
if I might only be told what the occasion is...

144
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,200
I venture to say it's true,

145
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,560
what the sons of mithras have seen you in you,

146
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,460
and you are closer every day, artista.

147
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,100
- Closer to what?  - Wake up.

148
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,730
Where are you leading me?

149
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,600
L... leading you? Maestro, you're the one leading us.

150
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,000
What?

151
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,160
You woke us in the night, gave us one of your shopping lists.

152
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,060
Buy more magnesium,

153
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,300
obtain obscure alcoholic beverages from the east,

154
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,030
acquire three horses...

155
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,600
You had some plan. Do you not remember?

156
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,100
I do, I do. I remember it.

157
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,660
- How long have we...  - Days.

158
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,830
You've been a sullen fuck the entire trip,

159
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,460
all for some foreign halfwit who got himself abducted.

160
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,460
- The abyssinian.  - It's like...

161
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,200
It's like I'm just waking up.

162
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,060
I lost part of myself on the journey.

163
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,060
- Journey where?  - It's not where...

164
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,860
it's when.

165
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,830
The evils of this world.

166
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,200
There's something odd around the castle.

167
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:40,830
- What's this?  - You'll see what it does.

168
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,060
Whose kingdom is this?

169
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,160
The locals call him Stepes.

170
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,500
That's the man we've come to confront?

171
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,030
The one who has your captive is the fucking impaler?

172
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,130
I lost my right eye in battle.

173
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:05,000
Removed the bridge of my nose, so I'd still have peripheral vision.

174
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,200
There.

175
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,000
Clever, eh?

176
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,860
That is quite... gleaming.

177
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,760
And so we should explain our reason for being here.

178
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,660
- Piero?  - May I?

179
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:24,200
The two papal states flank your land and mine,

180
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,600
and while we can watch Rome with one eye...

181
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,830
we must always keep another...eye,

182
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,760
always on the pope's property, to the north.

183
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,960
Unless...

184
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,960
the northern realm became our property.

185
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,630
And how would that happen?

186
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,600
Well, if we allied ourselves.

187
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,700
Florence and Urbino.

188
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:56,960
It'd make sense if we could carve up the northern papal territory between us.

189
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,430
I can annexe the city of bologna and its environs.

190
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,560
You could double your port capacity on the adriatic.

191
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,930
A bold stroke, but why don't I conquer it myself?

192
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,430
I have the army. What do you offer up?

193
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,300
Money, of course,

194
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,760
from the largest banking concern in all of Europe.

195
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,830
From each of us, as he is...

196
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,560
blessed.

197
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,430
Scared you, didn't I? 

198
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,930
That'll be fine, Medici.

199
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,000
I shouldn't provoke my own godson,

200
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,100
but I like to test a man.

201
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,500
You've grown to be a worthy ally.

202
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:39,230
And it's been too long since I led my men into combat.

203
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,800
Our proposal is timely, indeed.

204
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,860
I knew you had something juicy in mind,

205
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,430
when you showed up on my doorstep.

206
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,560
There's no way you'd caravan all this distance

207
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,230
just to watch me take a shit. 

208
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,130
Their turbans are nailed to their skulls.

209
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,200
All Turkish. Clearly this warlord has an issue with the Ottomans.

210
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,700
His bravery against the Turks won him 13 years in prison.

211
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,660
But, seeing as none of us are Turks ourselves,

212
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,030
we should have nothing to fear.

213
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,430
You don't think, with my blood, someone could take me for a Turk?

214
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,760
How do I know this warlord's eyes aren't failing?

215
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,230
Because I spotted you from miles away.

216
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,930
Though I were blind, I could hear the clattering

217
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,760
and nattering of your tartar tongue from further yet.

218
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,460
- I'm not a Tartar.  - What are you, then?

219
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,160
- Unique.  - Unique?

220
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,130
Dung beetles think they're unique.

221
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,130
Your mongrel half-breed lineage speaks louder than your words.

222
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,860
You see god, well, has many punishments for mankind.

223
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,560
Earthquakes, volcanoes, plagues and cancers.

224
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,730
Worse than these, he sent the Turks and the Tartars

225
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,760
and the mongrels, like you.

226
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,330
Ave, vladislaus Dracula filius,

227
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,800
Vaivoda partium transalpinarum.

228
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,000
Prince of Transylvania and Wallachia,

229
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,700
Son of Vlad II known as Vlad Dracul, or Vlad the Dragon,

230
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,900
which makes you Vlad III, Son of the Dragon.

231
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,500
Or as it is known in your language, Dracula.

232
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,000
Impressive, your command of my titles,

233
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,160
but tell me who you are and what you want here.

234
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,160
My name is Maestro Leonardo.

235
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,660
These are my companions, Nico, Zoroaster.

236
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,600
We were sent by the magnificent Lorenzo De Medici

237
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,660
of the Republic of Florence.

238
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,260
All of Italy wonders at your victories against the Ottomans,

239
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,130
and my lord extends his friendship

240
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,830
and seeks military counsel for the greater glory

241
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,730
of Florence and Wallachia.

242
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,160
You must know this land has been bedeviled by war,

243
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,260
and worse than war.

244
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,600
We shall talk more...

245
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,700
at dinner.

246
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,060
As long as the dinner's not us.

247
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,700
So we're selling tickets to the papal baths now, are we?

248
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,660
An urgent matter has arisen.

249
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,930
Urgent enough that you sully this chamber with her presence?

250
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,560
I know where to find whores if I want them.

251
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,930
We thought it best you hear this news directly from her lips.

252
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,230
I've come from Florence, your holiness.

253
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,200
And does your absence from the city...

254
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,830
create no suspicion?

255
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,600
My aunt in Siena is providing me with an alibi.

256
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,530
No-one of import will miss me in Florence.

257
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,160
Certainly your husband doesn't fall into the category of import.

258
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,000
What of Lorenzo's war engineer,

259
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,630
in whom the count seems so fascinated?

260
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,660
Da Vinci has set out from the city.

261
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,800
No man knows where.

262
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,330
Nor woman?

263
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,500
Nor I.

264
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,400
Lorenzo himself has left Florence.

265
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,030
As we speak,

266
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,460
he makes an embassy to the duke of Urbino,

267
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,530
fresh with the credit of his dealings

268
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,130
with Ferdinand and Isabella.

269
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,830
He seeks to create a new military alliance.

270
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,360
The calculating rogue.

271
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,000
Far from reeling at our attempts to weaken his rule,

272
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,930
Lorenzo courts the most accomplished mercenaries

273
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,930
on the peninsula.

274
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,530
I know what the naval do with them.

275
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,900
He and Urbino will march north.

276
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,630
Together, they'll sack our lands surrounding Bologna

277
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,400
and divide them up.

278
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,760
How do you know, holy father?

279
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,500
Because it's exactly what I'd do, you fucking coward.

280
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,160
Look at the lot of you.

281
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,830
Too scared to bring me this news yourselves.

282
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:04,460
Hiding behind this Florentine slit.

283
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,100
How can I wonder Lorenzo resists me so well,

284
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,760
when I see the quality of my allies?

285
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,560
We only tried to serve your glory.

286
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,330
We had not the benefit of your divine guidance.

287
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,630
Guidance? You want guidance?

288
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,300
Do you remember what proved I was chosen by god?

289
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,460
So... So many things, your holiness.

290
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,300
The way I survived drowning as a child.

291
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,060
Let's see how you do.

292
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:54,700
Holy father, surely... a loving god shows mercy.

293
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,160
You dare question me?

294
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:00,100
The rock upon which god's words stands.

295
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,930
Kiss this ring.

296
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,300
My bath is ruined.

297
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,630
I don't care how, end the House of Medici,

298
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,260
before I end you.

299
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,400
Dinner awaits.

300
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,060
How are we supposed to free the captive from a place like this?

301
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,030
If I knew that, I'd be Da Vinci.

302
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,260
You've dropped some change.

303
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,460
Of course, you'll have noticed the money.

304
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,200
The sultanis is a base currency...

305
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,700
for the heathen ruler of the East.

306
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,730
You see, this is how I allow my soldiers

307
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,930
to prove their loyalty to me.

308
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:09,830
I toss these sultanis on the ground before them.

309
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,600
And, do you know, the coins are never, ever touched?

310
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,330
It's just they've fallen quite randomly,

311
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,200
you'd really notice if one was gone?

312
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,130
I miss nothing.

313
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,060
Please, now.

314
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,730
A little Tuscan wine,

315
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,700
just to make you feel at home, no?

316
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,060
Thank you.

317
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,900
I must say, I'm impressed with your hospitality,

318
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,530
so soon after your escape from captivity.

319
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,400
I am, sadly, at home in dungeons.

320
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,900
As a child, my father sent my brother and me

321
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,730
to be hostages held by the Turkish sultan.

322
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,500
The prisons converted my damnable brother

323
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:03,430
to the cause of the Turks, but not me.

324
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,930
I learned to trust nobody.

325
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,230
To survive any pain, the dogs, the dungeons,

326
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,800
even a lightning strike,

327
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,260
which has left me with this... web of scars.

328
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:23,600
Now I spend every waking hour in resistance to my brother...

329
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:29,200
and the fucking Turks.

330
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:36,500
Well your victories against them have been recognized,

331
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,630
even by the pope.

332
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,460
If we're going to raise a toast,

333
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,800
let's lift a glass to the one who helped me out of the prison this time,

334
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,730
to the Bringer of Light himself.

335
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,530
Who, my lord?

336
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,230
Lucifer, the Bringer of Light.

337
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,530
Most beautiful of all the angels.

338
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,300
And how did Lucifer help you?

339
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:05,660
Like me, Lucifer rose against a tyrant.

340
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:11,100
Like me, he was abandoned and betrayed by the god he loved.

341
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,530
I made a pact with Lucifer to win my freedom

342
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:19,360
and ascend to my throne one last time.

343
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,230
Do you know?

344
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,630
I don't find it hard to live without a soul.

345
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,100
Lucifer.

346
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,930
And how fortuitous for Da Vinci.

347
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,230
The clever devil leaves just as I arrive with questions.

348
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,860
You don't find that curious?

349
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,400
Trust me, signor, that's the least curious thing about him.

350
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,630
What is your relationship with him?

351
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,330
We had our day...

352
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,730
but that's all it was, a day.

353
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,700
And, anyway, his eye is set on another.

354
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,600
- How do you know?  - I'm a woman.

355
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,200
No, of course we're friends.

356
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,300
He saved my life and, for that, I deeply admire him.

357
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,300
That hasn't become illegal, has it?

358
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,900
It has if it hurts Florence.

359
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,660
All I want is your help in guarding her.

360
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,560
I don't know where he's gone.

361
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,300
You keep his confidences well.

362
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,900
I'd like to lie to anyone else, excellency,

363
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,530
but not you.

364
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,060
Although, if you tried to force it out of me,

365
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,130
I'd be helpless to stop you.

366
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,800
Perhaps we should discuss this somewhere else.

367
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,560
- Somewhere more quiet?  - Mm.

368
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,660
Until we make it less so.

369
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,230
The city gates are closed.

370
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,400
Two minutes to curfew, scoundrel.

371
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,900
Either you get your arses home or spend the night here.

372
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:09,530
Persons caught roaming the streets after curfew get put in my little book.

373
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,930
Being put in my little book means you explain your transgressions to the judge.

374
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,230
Signor Medici, forgive me.

375
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,100
I hadn't seen you with a bar wench.

376
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,200
- Your little book?  - My ledger, full of pigs, mostly.

377
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,230
You record every curfew violation?

378
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,830
Since the day it was declared.

379
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,300
If one were to study these, one might see who was out,

380
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,800
when they shouldn't have been?

381
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,430
Yes, if one were a glutton for punishment.

382
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,100
Take me to them.

383
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,500
One could speak weeks paging through these records.

384
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,700
Then we're in luck. According to my brother, I'm great at wasting time.

385
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,360
Your secret, sir?

386
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,700
Oh, it's a matter of knowing which elements to blend.

387
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,930
Magnesium here, iron filings there, so on.

388
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,360
I think it's ingenious.

389
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,660
Does it have a military application?

390
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,630
Not yet.

391
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,330
Well, then, we must talk further.

392
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,760
Since I've renounced your christian gods,

393
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:09,530
I've only my wits and ferocity to protect me

394
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,560
from the forces of Sultan Mehmed II.

395
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,560
Perhaps the ingenuity you bring to Lorenzo's court

396
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,460
could benefit me as well.

397
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,400
Now...

398
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,660
since you've shown me your little party piece,

399
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,600
I will respond in kind with a little diversion of my own.

400
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,230
You see, without a soul weighing me down,

401
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,600
I can see in the dark.

402
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:40,760
I cannot be killed.

403
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:44,060
I can enjoy certain entertainments

404
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,030
that may have made me blanch years ago.

405
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:54,060
This is the last of the retinue of a Turkish ambassador

406
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,760
who was foolish enough to approach me.

407
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,330
I miss no opportunity in reminding the Turks

408
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,660
of the childhood they provided.

409
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,130
Is it the one we're looking for?

410
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,830
Unshackle him.

411
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,660
Now... prove stronger than your friends.

412
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,460
Defeat these dogs and you will go free.

413
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,500
And please don't think me so inhuman

414
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,660
that I wouldn't give you a fighting chance.

415
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,000
Here's a butter knife.

416
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,400
Please! Don't!

417
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,430
This... 

418
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,630
This is justice.

419
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,530
So... shall we send for the main course?

420
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,660
I can't eat. 

421
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,500
My tastes are not universally shared, it's true.

422
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,730
- Let us retire.  - Before we do...

423
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:32,800
you have honored us with the traditional wine of our homeland,

424
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:38,330
and so do we honor you, with the traditional liquor of Wallachia.

425
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:42,200
- You've brought tuica?  - Mm-hm.

426
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:45,260
Well, our master in Florence would spare no expense

427
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,860
to demonstrate his admiration for you, my lord.

428
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,560
To Vlad III.

429
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,900
When have I ever known you to hesitate about a drink, my friend?

430
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,630
To Vlad III.

431
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,400
To Vlad III.

432
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,860
Good.

433
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,560
And some for your maid? Your men?

434
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,730
- Yes.  - Yes? Good.

435
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,300
There you go.

436
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,500
Some for you... Some for you.

437
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,630
Show the friends to a room.

438
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:42,030
- Some for you.  - Once my guards have toasted our guests,

439
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,060
The artisan and I will parley further.

440
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:50,230
How about your dogs, who entertained us so well, this evening?

441
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,500
There's some for you, for you, the last little drop.

442
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,230
Please don't be unsettled by the vermin.

443
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,030
I welcome them.

444
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,000
Often, in prison, they were my only friends.

445
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:13,460
Well, I know what it is to be thrown into a cell.

446
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,860
Without the companionship of the bats,

447
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,000
I would not have survived.

448
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,930
You see.

449
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,730
- We understand each other.  - Hmm.

450
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,530
Come.

451
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,500
Beautiful, is it not?

452
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:47,730
You see, this is why I wanted to return to castle Poenari so badly.

453
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,530
From the heights...

454
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,930
I can almost forget the decades the Turks

455
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,030
have been living underneath the earth.

456
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,200
It's a shame, then, that was the last of them.

457
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,230
Oh, there is one more.

458
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:12,760
Their master, Solomon Ogbai.

459
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,500
The name Ogbai,

460
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,400
In Amharic, it means don't take him away.

461
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,200
Yeah.

462
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,400
Indeed.

463
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,600
For stooping to serve them,

464
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,300
I take my time with the Abyssinian.

465
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:38,600
I keep him ready for my personal whims.

466
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:42,030
I invent new ways to torture, just for him.

467
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,400
There is a window, near where I keep him.

468
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,500
He cannot see the view.

469
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:52,660
So I said I would recreate the scenery for him...

470
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:57,260
if he would only provide me with

471
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,500
the raw material for a suitable miniature.

472
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:10,200
These are the crenulations of the towers outside my window...

473
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:14,300
carved in the abyssinian's own flesh.

474
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:22,300
There is one frontier he shall never stop exploring.

475
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,530
Agony.

476
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,400
May I share a confession with you?

477
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,830
Yeah, yes...

478
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,600
if it pleases, my lord.

479
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,300
I know...

480
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,900
that I'm mad.

481
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:46,230
Indeed. 

482
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:50,230
But will you tell me how I could be otherwise?

483
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,200
A father rips a child from his home,

484
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,700
from everything he knows

485
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:57,860
and tosses him into the claws of his worst enemy.

486
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,860
Well, we are...

487
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,960
We are too often what our fathers make us.

488
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,760
Whether we like it or not, better or for worse.

489
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,600
Oh, yes.

490
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,000
In my case, definitely for worse.

491
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,930
You see, my father, he taught me

492
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,760
that cruelty is the only true currency of the universe,

493
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,800
and now I am the richest man in all of christendom.

494
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,760
Ha!

495
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,300
- My god, it is true.  - Yes?

496
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,830
Servants told me you were carrying books upon books into your quarters.

497
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,630
I wondered if they'd been raiding the wine cellar.

498
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,000
- I'm easy to tease.  - Only sometimes.

499
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,260
Well, at least you have a hobby you love.

500
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,660
And what is your new hobby?

501
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,530
The Florentine obsession with record keeping is paying off.

502
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,600
These are the records to every guard at every station in the city.

503
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,860
Anyone who breaks curfew even for a slight reason will be put down here.

504
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,060
Including, I suppose, the true spy,

505
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,800
whom you believe framed Becchi.

506
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:57,330
You smirk, but there are mysteries to be solved here.

507
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,930
For example, why do these symbols from the zodiac keep coming up?

508
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,430
This. That's the sign for capricorn, I think.

509
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,100
And this, that's aquarius, yes?

510
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,630
With certain sensitive subjects of Florence,

511
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,500
their names are indicated with symbols,

512
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,430
rather than list them clearly as violators of the curfew.

513
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,260
Ah. This date I recall.

514
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:18,830
After a long night of carousing, I was questioned on my way home,

515
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,930
So is this the symbol for me?

516
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,660
Athletic champion that you are,

517
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,200
Sagittarius is a natural code name for you.

518
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,530
Tell us the identity behind each of these symbols, then.

519
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,030
I'm not privy to that knowledge.

520
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:32,530
- That's in captain Dragonetti's office.  - Obtain it for me.

521
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,360
Becchi would be proud of you.

522
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,030
The man we're here to save must be dead by now.

523
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,500
No. No, not yet.

524
00:34:56,930 --> 00:35:01,230
But... but we must move to save him now.

525
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,900
You two can go on.

526
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,560
- I feel like I could sleep for the next week.  - As could I.

527
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:12,300
That's because we've all been poisoned.

528
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,160
What?

529
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,360
Drink some antidote.

530
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,660
That bastard.

531
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,260
- He slipped something in our drinks.  - No.

532
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,830
I did.

533
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,660
There's nothing you won't do to us in your bloody quest.

534
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:44,530
I... I adulterated the Tuica before we arrived.

535
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:53,700
That we'd all have to drink it, in order to convince him it was safe.

536
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,730
And now...

537
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:08,230
everyone, including the dogs, should be passing out.

538
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,330
Ready?

539
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,000
How do you know where we're going?

540
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,600
It's a simple architectural assessment.

541
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,460
The Abyssinian pointed it out to me himself in a way.

542
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,530
Do we wanna know what you mean?

543
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,230
No, actually, you don't.

544
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,460
It's here.

545
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:49,330
Are you sure about this, maestro?

546
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,030
No.

547
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,430
What does that say?

548
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,560
Don't take me away.

549
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,660
Now, this, this is justice.

550
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,000
To Vlad III.

551
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,860
Farewell greetings from a half-breed Mongrel.

552
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,160
Nico...

553
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:18,400
go get the horses. I'll meet you outside.

554
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,200
Ah. That one.

555
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,060
Careful. Careful. Careful.

556
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,060
It's that one, then that one.

557
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,030
Not too fast, he'll be cut even deeper.

558
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:57,900
It's all over. It's OK. It's over.

559
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:00,860
It's not. It's not.

560
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,760
It's not him.

561
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,030
It's not Vlad.

562
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,560
Shit.

563
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,630
Fuck me.

564
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,230
You're an arrogant little fool, aren't you?

565
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,560
I've endured every drug and poison known to man.

566
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,930
I fought off the Ottoman Empire.

567
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,330
Do you really think that I would die at the hands,

568
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,760
of a fucking Florentine?

569
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,300
Shit.

570
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,400
Or a mongrel?

571
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,230
How's that for a military application?

572
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,900
Zo, wake up!

573
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,460
Wake up! Zo!

574
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,160
Life...

575
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,130
Life is a trap, don't you think?

576
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,330
Well, now, I'm going to set you free.

577
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,230
Curious.

578
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,330
You cannot kill a man without a soul.

579
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,600
You must go.

580
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,460
Do not shirk from the task.

581
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:29,100
Stay out of Florence for the next few days.

582
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:33,530
Oh, and don't speak with Lorenzo, or anyone in the city.

583
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:38,860
I suppose I could go to Siena...

584
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:43,430
and create a story to explain my extended absence, but why?

585
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,930
You've seen what happens,

586
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,700
when people question the plans of the Vatican, haven't you?

587
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:53,000
I have.

588
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:57,500
Speak to nobody along the road.

589
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:00,830
And make sure no-one speaks with you.

590
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,660
That shouldn't be a problem.

591
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,900
I have a strategy.

592
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,960
- Have some men follow her.  - Of course.

593
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,360
Then discreetly have her killed.

594
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,230
Her value to us has been exhausted.

595
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,130
She's...

596
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,300
compromised by her affections for Da Vinci.

597
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:34,100
Did his holiness order this?

598
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:37,430
Do it outside the walls of Florence.

599
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,100
Leave no ties to Rome.

600
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:42,200
Make it look like bandits did it.

601
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:50,000
Oh, and er... have them drive stakes through her eyes.

602
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,600
She's seen too much.

603
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,300
The guards, the dogs, they're gonna rouse soon.

604
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,230
Where did you get that wound?

605
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,730
There are more urgent things to explain.

606
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:17,530
- Did you know this would happen?  - I knew it might.

607
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:20,500
I had to take that chance, for the book of leaves.

608
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:23,030
Sword.

609
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,160
Maestro, shall we see to his injuries?

610
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,660
They're beyond seeing to and I cannot meet my end here.

611
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,660
In other words, fuck this place.

612
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,800
I want to spit on Vlad's body.

613
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:38,600
Yeah. Well, you could if we knew where it was.

614
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,530
Where the fuck is he?

615
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,200
Just come on! Let's go!

616
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,000
Maybe some creature dragged him off.

617
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,000
Let's not find out. Come on.

618
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:01,460
You really must try this, Camilla.

619
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,800
Surely you have a sweeter tooth than your brother.

620
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,660
You certainly have a sweeter smile.

621
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:08,100
Some honey.

622
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:12,460
The pride of the Duchy of Urbino.

623
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,360
Oh, I've made arrangements with their duke.

624
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:20,030
With rawn like his, I pity those who wish harm upon Florence.

625
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:22,400
You'll have your hands full with that one.

626
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,430
Federico Da Montefeltro's a... colorful character indeed.

627
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,760
- Did you invite us here to show off your new alliance?  - Bernardo!

628
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,230
I don't recall inviting you at all, Signor Baroncelli.

629
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:40,360
Perhaps you fail to understand why I went to Urbino.

630
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,730
You think Rome will look after the Pazzis.

631
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,700
But, when all is said and done,

632
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,830
Rome only looks after Rome.

633
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:54,830
And you both of you are loyal sons of Florence.

634
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:03,500
Don't you think the time has come for union in our republic...

635
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,600
not further divisions?

636
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,360
My brother Giuliano has a stubborn mind,

637
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:14,330
but a good heart.

638
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:18,200
At one point, we hoped to see him in a cardinal's hat,

639
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:23,060
but our current relations with the church have precluded that.

640
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:28,360
And yet, a young man like Giuliano, needs a future.

641
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:34,530
He would make a fine husband for Camilla...

642
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,500
would he not?

643
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,000
Honey, anyone?

644
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,100
Farewell.

645
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,330
Arrivederci.

646
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,730
Whether or not the Pazzis agree to this union, I have to ask,

647
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:57,500
did you consult your brother about this?

648
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:02,060
Giuliano's interests are the interests of Florence.

649
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,600
Don't worry. I'll have breakable objects removed from the room before I broach the topic.

650
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:08,600
She is the child of our enemy, Signor.

651
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,360
Some might argue he is being thrown to the wolves.

652
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:15,530
You underestimate my brother, Piero.

653
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,860
We are not feeding these wolves.

654
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,160
We are taming them.

655
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,000
Did you know he was going to propose this?

656
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:34,760
I had an inkling...

657
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,300
seeing as it was my idea.

658
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:48,330
- You've had your elixir?  - Relax.

659
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:52,930
They say children conceived in frustration are born bitter.

660
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:58,000
You'll understand I'm agitated by this league of devils around us.

661
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:59,730
After our ploy with the Pazzis,

662
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,730
you're not ready for another master stroke.

663
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:11,100
Our doctor said this position is more likely to conceive us a male heir.

664
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,060
Men would prefer a position where a woman's face,

665
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:16,460
is rammed down so far she can't even speak.

666
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,600
I'm sorry, what was that, dear?

667
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,060
Please.

668
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,130
Wooo!

669
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:38,230
It was the cage.

670
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,830
It was the cage. It was the cage.

671
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,330
The words written on the don't take him away.

672
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,960
It wasn't a taunt, it was a warning.

673
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:54,300
Vlad built the device to eviscerate you if you were freed...

674
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,830
to rip an unstanchable wound.

675
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:00,860
I should've realized.

676
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:03,400
- I'm sorry.  - Never mind.

677
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,200
I must tell you of the key you seek.

678
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,000
The other key that opens the vault of heaven?

679
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,600
Yes, tell me.

680
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:20,530
It's waiting in Rome, there for your taking.

681
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:25,000
And, when you have both keys...

682
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,460
your mother, Caterina.

683
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:32,430
She is alive.

684
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,860
She carries the book of leaves for us,

685
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:43,960
beneath the post of the sun in a town made of stone...

686
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,900
in a land on my map.

687
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,630
Why... I need you to decode the map.

688
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,030
Then you may take what you need.

689
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,060
Here.

690
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:06,060
Here is the secret to deciphering the map.

691
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:10,530
I will not survive to come with you.

692
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:16,300
You must cut my flesh loose and take it with you...

693
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,260
once I die.

694
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:25,200
The turk said that I would save you.

695
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,600
And so you will...

696
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:31,300
someday...

697
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:33,800
but not today.

698
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:41,630
But there are so many things you must learn first.

699
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,500
Yes? Yes?

700
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:49,400
You must learn that anything is possible...

701
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,760
including defeat.

702
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:59,100
- You must... learn...  - What? What?

703
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,300
What?

704
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:09,300
- What? What?  - Maestro...

705
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,960
- I must must learn what?  - Maestro, he's gone.

706
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,930
- Maestro.  - I must learn what?

707
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,730
I must learn...

708
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,530
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

709
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,660
Fuck! Fuck.

710
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:35,660
I've been here before.

711
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:39,000
- No, this isn't the path we came in on.  - No. No.

712
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,860
This is where the Abyssinian and I first met.

713
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,000
He warned me...

714
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,030
I thought I could solve things...

715
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,400
like I always do.

716
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,030
Hell happens...

717
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:20,800
when the evil of the world exceeds our belief,

718
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:25,360
that we can conquer it.

719
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000


720
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:52,000

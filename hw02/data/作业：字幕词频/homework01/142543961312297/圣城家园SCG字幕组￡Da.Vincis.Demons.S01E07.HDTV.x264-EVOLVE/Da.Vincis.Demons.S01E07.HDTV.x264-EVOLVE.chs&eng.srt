你要找到叶之书

你每天都在接近

洛伦佐正在会见乌尔比诺公爵

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:09,760

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,400
他希望与他们建立新的军事联盟

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,360
我已经很久没有带人参加过战斗了
It's too long since I led my men into combat.

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,560
看来 我们的请求非常适时
Our proposal is timely indeed.

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,400
给我干掉美第奇家族
End the House of Medici.

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,330
不然我就干掉你
Before I end you.

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,430
谁宵禁后还在街上闲逛 我就把他的名字
Those caught roaming the streets after curfew

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,100
记到册子上
get put in my little book.

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,300
无论什么理由 违反宵禁的人都会被记录下来
Anyone who breaks curfew, for the slightest reason, will be put down here.

13
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,060
包括那个真正的间谍 那个诬陷贝奇的人
Including the true spy whom you believe framed Becchi.

14
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,230
怀疑教廷计划是什么下场
You've seen what happens when people question

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,900
你见过了吧?
the plans of the Vatican, haven't you?

16
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,060
朱利亚诺 应该可以成为卡米拉的好丈夫...
Giuliano, he'd make a fine husband for Camilla.

17
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,160
钥匙
The key.

18
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,360
在罗马

19
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,560

达芬奇的恶魔 第一季第7集

23
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,460
只有他自己
He's alone.

24
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,160
这还是几天来的第一次
For the first time in days.

25
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,330
你自己看看 琐罗
See for yourself, Zo.

26
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,960
小心
Careful.

27
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,700
镜片刚刚调好
The lenses are delicately balanced.

28
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,800
全城都在过狂欢节 他到这来做什么?
Why is he here while the rest of the city's busy with the carnival?

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,960
那墓碑上刻的什么名字?
What's the name on that headstone?

30
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,130
我看不清
I can't make it out.

31
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,500
镜片可以再调
The lenses can be adjusted.

32
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,830
给我
Here.

33
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,630
西莉亚・利西马科斯
Celia Lysimachus.

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,900
这是个犹太姓氏
That's a Jewish surname.

35
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,000
难怪被埋在贫民墓里
Explains why she's buried in a pauper's graveyard.

36
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,600
她是谁?
Who is she?

37
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,360
她和瑞阿里奥什么关系?
And what is she to Riario?

38
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,830
大概是臭味相投吧
Maybe only gets stiff for the stiff.

39
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,360
有可能
You might be right.

40
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,930
他要走了
He's on the move.

41
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,930
大师 我们已经跟踪瑞阿里奥好几天了
Maestro, look, we've been following Riario for days.

42
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,760
- 万一被他发现...  - 不会的
- If he sees us...  - He won't.

43
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,030
莱昂 虽然我不会被瑞阿里奥吓得尿裤子 我还是同意尼科的看法
Leo, while I'm not about to piss down my leg, I have to side with Nico.

44
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,630
我知道那阿比西尼亚人说那钥匙的另一半在这里 但是你看啊
I know the Abyssinian claimed the other key's here but look around.

45
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,800
罗马有几千年的历史
Rome's been growing for thousands of years.

46
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,260
要藏一样东西 没有比这里更难被人发现的地方了
An object looking for a place to hide couldn't have chosen a better home.

47
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,830
没错 所以我们才要把它从那个
Indeed. And that's why we're going to liberate it,

48
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,800
瑞阿里奥自以为安全的地方拿走
from the one place Riario would expect it to be safe.

49
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,730
梵蒂冈的秘室
The Vatican's Secret Archives.

50
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,860
记住 你生于尘土亦湮于尘土
Remember, man, that thou art dust and unto dust thou shalt return.

51
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,200
远离罪孽 克拉丽斯
Turn away from sin, Clarice.

52
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,730
忠诚于福音
And be faithful to the Gospel.

53
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,160
我会的 哥哥
I try, brother.

54
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,100
如马太教导 我愿为迫害我的人祈祷
As Matthew urges, I pray for those who persecute me.

55
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,800
记住 你生于尘土亦湮于尘土
Remember, man, that thou art dust and unto dust thou shalt return.

56
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,900
我拿到了南城门的守卫换班图
I've got the guard rotations for the south entrance.

57
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,860
巡查紧得像耶稣受难日的尼姑一样
Tight as a nun on Good Friday.

58
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,000
我们查了每座城门 窗户
We've examined every entrance, window,

59
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,260
地道 城墙的破洞
tunnel, hole in the bloody wall.

60
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,100
发现根本不可能混进去
Getting in uncaught is impossible.

61
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,760
"不可能"这个词只会让我更想尝试
You do realize "impossible" is just a word that makes me try even harder.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,360
大师 每处城门都有哨兵巡逻
Maestro, sentries patrol every possible entrance.

63
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,400
其实 那边就来了两个
In fact, here come two now.

64
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,200
别担心 朋友
Don't worry, my friends.

65
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,230
只要他们以为你们是犹太贫民
As long as they think you're Jews here in the ghetto,

66
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,330
你们就不用担心
you have nothing to fear.

67
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,000
没人会在意犹太人
As Jews we are beneath notice.

68
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,800
看啊 你们穿着黄色衣服 他们都不看你
You see, they pay no attention because you wear the yellow.

69
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,860
感谢你带我们进来
Thank you for taking us in.

70
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,660
即便你们不是来为我们除掉罗马暴君的
Even if you are not out to undermine our oppressors,

71
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,030
我们也要欢迎琐罗的朋友
friends of Zo are always welcome

72
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,030
因为他没几个朋友
because he has so few.

73
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,430
连接梵蒂冈的圣天使堡呢?
What about the Castel Sant Angelo that connects to the Vatican?

74
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,200
要是我可以设法接近塔楼...
If I can devise a way to reach the tower...

75
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,060
莱昂 听着 你听我说
Leo, listen. Just listen to me.

76
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,630
那是个监狱
It's a prison.

77
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,900
好吗? 你那么喜欢待在巴格鲁监狱吗?
Okay? Did you enjoy your time in the Bargello that much?

78
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,330
你想念铁栅栏了吗?
You're homesick for iron bars?

79
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,100
把我关进铁栏杆的正是他们 琐罗
These are the people who put me behind those bars, Zo.

80
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,760
他们要为此付出代价
And they will pay for their folly.

81
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,460
- 再见  - 再会
- See you.  - Farewell.

82
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,700
尼科洛
Niccolo.

83
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,630
你的妻子卢克蕾齐娅信教吧? 
Your wife Lucrezia, she is a believer, is she not?

84
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,060
是的 阁下
She is, Your Magnificence.

85
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,600
她身体不好吗? 我最近没看到她
Well, is she unwell? I've not seen her of late.

86
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,460
她去锡耶纳照看她的姑妈了
She's been caring for an aunt in Siena.

87
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,860
我希望她能在这里 不过或许上帝另有安排
I'd hoped she'd be here by now but perhaps God has other plans.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,760
殿下
Your excellency,

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,830
我可以冒昧地说句 你看上去很虔诚吗?
would it be impertinent of me to say you wear your ashes well?

90
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,000
我喜欢冒昧的女孩
I like my women with a bit of cheek.

91
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,000
我要的违禁名单你都找到了?
You've gathered all the curfew ledgers as I asked?

92
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,700
- 找到了 先生  - 很好
- I have, signor.  - Excellent.

93
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,330
搬到我房间去
Bring them to my quarters.

94
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,960
噢 弗朗切斯科
Oh, Francesco.

95
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,560
节日快乐
Buone Feste.

96
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,930
我们把不愉快都忘记吧
Let us heal old wounds.

97
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,060
好的 忘记之前的不快
Yes, and put old feuds to death.

98
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,630
我们期望两家可以团结
We look forward to the union of our families.

99
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,860
我们可以把嫁妆的事谈妥
Assuming we can work out the terms of the dowry.

100
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,760
他在开玩笑
He jests.

101
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,100
我相信那不成问题
I'm sure it will sort out.

102
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,460
既然你首先表示友谊
Since you've extended the first laurel,

103
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,560
我们愿意出资为家族
we'd like to host an engagement fete for the families

104
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,930
主办订婚宴会
at our country estate.

105
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,360
也是复活节前夕的圣餐
A Lord's supper for Holy Saturday.

106
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,000
这太好了 弗朗切斯科
This is good news, Francesco.

107
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,960
对佛罗伦萨好 对我们大家都好
This is good for Florence and this is good for us all.

108
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,360
- 那就复活节前夜见了  - 好的
- Till Holy Saturday then.  - Indeed.

109
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,930
保重
Farewell.

110
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,600
做得好
Well done.

111
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,260
现在你只需把这消息告诉朱利亚诺
Now all you have to do is break the news to Giuliano.

112
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,100
首先说清楚 我在此时事上别无选择
Let's be clear on this, I get no choice in this matter.

113
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,700
是的 因为你是我弟弟
None. Because you are my brother,

114
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,860
这就是你别无选择的原因
you get an explanation of why you have no choice.

115
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,560
卡米拉・帕吉
Camilla Pazzi.

116
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,360
你必须承认她很迷人
You can't deny she is attractive.

117
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,260
如果我需要新情人 肯定会睡了她
If I needed a new mistress, I'd bed her myself.

118
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,230
帕吉家还有其他的未婚少女 但就没这么漂亮了
The Pazzis have other marriageable maidens without so much appeal.

119
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,260
克拉丽斯也是在关心你
Clarice was looking out for you.

120
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,830
你都不问我一下就决定了?
You decided all this and you didn't even consult me?

121
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,800
我们想着如果帕吉家拒绝的话
We thought that if the Pazzis turned us down,

122
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,930
我们就不用麻烦你了
we wouldn't have to burden you with it.

123
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,730
你还真是站着说话不腰疼
Easier to say from the seat of the bidder rather than the bidded upon.

124
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,830
你真的觉得这样能行吗?
Do you honestly believe this can work?

125
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,660
从我们祖先阿维拉多开始 帕吉家族就是我们的敌人了
The Pazzis have been our foes since the days of our ancestor Averardo.

126
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,360
如此的宿仇是不会化解的
Feuds like that don't just go away.

127
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,860
所以人们才发明了和亲
This is precisely why marriage was invented!

128
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,430
巩固势力 化解宿仇
To consolidate power and to settle feuds.

129
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,700
度 我一直清楚要为自己的身份付出代价
Yeah. I always knew I'd pay for being me.

130
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,500
卢克蕾齐娅 你在罗马做什么?
Lucrezia. What are you doing in Rome?

131
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,960
谁说我们在罗马的?
Who says we're in Rome?

132
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,960
我是怎么到这儿的?
How did I get here?

133
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,600
我告诉你我爱你
I told you I loved you.

134
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,730
所以我找到了方法
So I found a way.

135
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,460
而且别以为我没注意到
And don't think I didn't notice

136
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,000
你还没回答我的问题
you haven't answered my question.

137
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:35,400
开始比结束时更容易抵制
It is easier to resist at the beginning than it is at the end.

138
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,900
但话说回来 或许你根本不懂爱
But then again, perhaps you're not capable of love.

139
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:51,830
当我给你自己的珍爱时 你仍然保持沉默
You stay silent even when I've given you my dearest possession.

140
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,160
你还看不出来你对我的意义吗?
Can't you tell from this what you mean to me?

141
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,700
你就不能跟我说我想听的吗?
Can't you tell me what I need to hear?

142
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,630
我...
I...

143
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,860
没有爱 活着还有什么意思
Without love, there is no point in living.

144
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,400
嘿 嘿! 醒醒 醒醒
Hey, hey! Rouse yourselves. Rouse yourselves.

145
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
我找到去梵蒂冈的路了
I've discovered a way into the Vatican.

146
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,700
走开 你还醉着呢
Bugger off. You're still drunk.

147
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,230
那个没有守卫的地方 那个入口
What is the one place, the one entrance,

148
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,830
在哪呢?
where no guard can be found?

149
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,300
在水里
It's in the water.

150
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,360
下水道是根据维特鲁威原理建造的
The sewers were built on the principles of Vitruvius.

151
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,760
可以贯穿整个城市
Designed to flow freely into the city,

152
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:27,730
包括梵蒂冈
including into the Vatican.

153
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,200
快看 快看
Look, look.

154
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,960
空气进到玻璃瓶里让火焰可以燃烧
The air is delivered into the glass and it allows the flame to live.

155
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,000
你真是糊涂了 你钻不进那玻璃瓶的
Now I know you're besotted. You won't fit inside there.

156
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,130
当然不行 但我们可以造一个相同性能的装置
Of course not, but we can construct a device of similar properties.

157
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,200
看这些草图 这儿 在这儿 看
Look at these sketches. Here. Here. Look.

158
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,930
快看
Look.

159
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,230
这是套潜水服
It's a diving dress.

160
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,300
是仿照水龟的呼吸原理制作的
It's modeled on the breathing of a water turtle.

161
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:56,300
空气通过这条线进去
Because the air goes in through this line,

162
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,100
然后进到前面的袋子里
and then it's exhaled into this forward pouch.

163
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:04,330
听着 我们需要收集材料 动作要快
Look. We need to gather some items and do it quickly.

164
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,860
我们只有几天时间了
We've only got a few days.

165
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,930
- 给你  - 猪皮 玻璃...
- There.  - Pig's skin, glass...

166
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,200
渔网...
a fishing net...

167
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,200
- 还有船?  - 是的 船
- a boat?  - Yes, a boat.

168
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,060
没错
Right.

169
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,900
就是这个地方
This is the spot.

170
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,360
好了 要保证这个装置稳定地运行
Okay, just continue operating the mechanism at a steady pace

171
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,430
直到我到达目的地
until I reach my destination.

172
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,530
一旦我到了 我会塞住这头作为停止的信号
Once I'm there, I'll plug the end of this line as signal to stop.

173
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,760
莱昂 你确定这装置能行吗? 我们还没有试验过
Leo, are you sure of this contraption? We haven't tested it.

174
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,960
没有时间了 我们不能被发现 就当勇闯火线吧
There's no time if we're to remain undiscovered. It's trial by fire.

175
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,960
或者说水线
Or water, in this case.

176
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,960
只管拉风箱吧
Just keep pumping these bellows.

177
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,900
幸运的话 只要几个小时就可以进去了
With any luck, it'll take just a few hours to get all the way inside.

178
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,360
要是你把浮出的地点弄错了
What if you're wrong about where you'll emerge

179
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,930
碰到大队卫兵怎么办?
and you climb up into a brigade?

180
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,900
维特鲁威的图案显示了下水道的走向
The plans of Vitruvius show where the drains lead.

181
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,700
对吧? 一旦到达蓄水池
Yes? Once I reach the reservoir,

182
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,060
我会钻到梵蒂冈的地面上
I just drill up into the Vatican flooring.

183
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,030
如果我日落时没出现
If I don't reappear by sundown,

184
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,830
你们就单独回佛罗伦萨
make your way back to Florence without me.

185
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,660
- 日落?  - 不是吧? 怎么需要这么久?
- Sundown?  - Honestly? What could take so long?

186
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,760
嘿 该打烊了
Hey. Bell time.

187
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,400
打烊了
Bell.

188
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,000
再来一杯!
Another!

189
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,730
美第奇先生 今晚打烊的时间到了
Signor de Medici, we're about to ring the bell for the night.

190
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
那给我一桶酒 让我搬回家通宵畅饮
Then bring me a barrel I can roll home and drink all night.

191
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:33,060
给我再多的戒酒建议也不为过
I need all the liquid counseling I can get.

192
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,830
你能相信我哥哥逼我娶一个女人...
Would you believe my brother pledged me to marry a woman from...

193
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,230
好了 姑娘们
All right, skirts.

194
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,960
德拉戈奈蒂的卫队很快就会来了
Dragonetti's wolves will be here for a round-up soon.

195
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,630
该回家了
It's time to find your beds.

196
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,430
您也是
You too,

197
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,930
大人
your grace.

198
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,830
要是我想在你床上过夜呢?
And what if I called your bed my home for tonight?

199
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,360
抱歉
Sorry.

200
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,460
酒喝多了
Too much cider.

201
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,460
看来我的老二不知道什么是好的
Seems my cock doesn't know what's good for him.

202
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,700
幸好我知道
Luckily I do.

203
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,660
真奇怪的声音 你听到了吗?
Strange noise. Did you hear that?

204
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,400
琐罗 有人来了
Zo, Zo.

205
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,500
在这下面吗?
Is it down there?

206
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,860
不是 走吧
No, come on.

207
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,600
琐罗 快点
Zo.

208
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,030
我给你煮了汤醒酒
I boiled you some quinto quarto for your hangover.

209
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,160
很有效的
It works wonders.

210
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,830
你真是个圣女
You're a saint.

211
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,430
我想昨晚说明我不是了
I think we disproved that last night.

212
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,130
哦...
Oh...

213
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,700
有些事你必须知道
There's something you have to know.

214
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,860
我已经订婚了
I'm betrothed.

215
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,660
你说过了
You mentioned it.

216
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,230
好几次
A few times.

217
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,800
我恰恰是因为你订婚了才同意你的示爱的
I agreed to your advances precisely because you're spoken for.

218
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,530
如果你没订婚 我们又爱慕上了彼此
If you were unattached and we became enamored with each other,

219
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,400
你能想象会发生什么吗?
can you imagine what might happen?

220
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,660
美第奇家的人娶了平民
A Medici marries a commoner.

221
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,860
有这么糟吗?
Would it be so bad?

222
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,830
瓦妮莎小姐?
Lady Vanessa?

223
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,500
你的宫殿不过是华丽的监狱
Your palace is a prison with better linens.

224
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,360
一举一动都被监视 被人评头论足
Every move is watched, every action judged.

225
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,930
我在此的选择或许有限
My choices might be limited here,

226
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,300
但我只需忠于自己
but I answer to no-one but myself.

227
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,800
我何不放弃一切来和你生活在一起?
Why don't I sack it all and come and live with you on your side of things?

228
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,700
没有美第奇家族的治理
Without the Medici hand governing,

229
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,600
我会永远活在修道院的谎言里
I'd still be living a lie in the convent.

230
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,600
但那是善意的谎言
It would have been a gentle lie,

231
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,530
在朋友中的谎言...
a lie lived among friends...

232
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,800
哦
Oh.

233
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,760
但如果我娶了卡米拉・帕吉 那也是一个谎言
But if I marry Camilla Pazzi, that's a lie too.

234
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:20,200
你娶了她 你会化干戈为玉帛
When you marry her, you neutralize that family of fiends.

235
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,930
当统治佛罗伦萨压力太大时
And when ruling Florence gets to be too much,

236
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,530
你我仍然可以不时地偷欢
you and I can still snatch a little freedom here and there.

237
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,900
这样很好啊
You know this makes good sense.

238
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,360
还有事让你犹豫
Something else stops you.

239
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,000
我觉得是帕吉家族害死了贝奇
I blame the Pazzis for Becchi's death.

240
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,560
是他们陷害了他
They set him up somehow.

241
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,900
与罗马还有他们的间谍一起
Along with Rome and their spy.

242
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,230
那就洗清他的罪名
Well, then, clear his name.

243
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,560
之后帕吉就知道是什么样的人生活在他们中间了
And then the Pazzis will know just what sort of man lives among them.

244
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,530
阿门
Amen.

245
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,230
请允许我介绍费德里科・达・蒙泰费尔特罗
May I present Federico da Montefeltro,

246
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,830
乌尔比诺公爵
the Duke of Urbino.

247
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,860
- 费德里科  - 阁下
- Federico.  - Your Eminence.

248
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,730
感谢你不远万里 迅速来此
Thank you for travelling so far, so quickly.

249
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,430
随时候命
Anything for Your Holiness.

250
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,030
我只是上帝的仆人
I am but a servant of God.

251
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,330
而你却联合
And yet you ally yourself

252
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,360
你的教子洛伦佐・美第奇对抗我们
with your godson Lorenzo de Medici against us.

253
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,400
是吗? 真是奇闻了
Do I? A surprise to my ears.

254
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,030
- 嗯  - 我懂了
- Hm.  - I see.

255
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,800
那你是否认在家和洛伦佐会面
So you deny meeting Lorenzo in your home

256
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,360
商讨结盟对抗教皇统治了?
to negotiate an alliance against the Papal States?

257
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,800
请原谅我的侄子
Please forgive my nephew.

258
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,060
那些谣言让他非常生气
These rumors have angered him greatly.

259
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,230
不需道歉
No apologies necessary.

260
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,200
要是我 我也会如此气愤的
If I'd heard similar, I'd react the same.

261
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,960
或者更糟
Or worse.

262
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,530
为我们对抗美第奇家族 就赏你五千金弗罗林
5,000 gold florins to fight for us against the Medicis.

263
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,630
现在 你必须道歉了
Now, apologies are necessary.

264
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,560
你认为雇佣军只是为了钱杀人?
You think Condottieri kill only for money?

265
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,630
有些是为了乐趣
Some I kill for pleasure.

266
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:31,000
费德里科 在谈正事前先让你了解情况
Federico, let's have you refreshed before we discuss our business.

267
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,230
我们稍后再聚
We shall reconvene after.

268
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,830
先生?
Signor?

269
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,500
美第奇先生?
Signor de Medici?

270
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,960
谁啊?
Who's there?

271
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,360
美第奇先生索要了这些名单
Signor de Medici requested these lists.

272
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,230
德拉戈奈蒂终于给你索引了?
Dragonetti produced the index of symbols?

273
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,800
我得偷偷地进入他的办公室
I had to invade his office without his knowledge.

274
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,400
我不打扰你们工作了
I'll let you gentlemen get to work.

275
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,900
昨晚的杂活还没干完
Somehow I never got to my chores last night.

276
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,030
- 小姐  - 再见
- Signorina.  - Bye.

277
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,560
告诉我 天秤座代表谁?
Tell me. Who's Libra?

278
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,660
抱歉 殿下
I'm sorry, Eccellenza.

279
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,000
这是金泰尔・贝奇的标志
It's the symbol for Gentile Becchi.

280
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,800
天秤座 正义的天平
Libra, the scales of justice.

281
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,860
能让他知道这个就好了
If only we can deliver that to him.

282
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,730
- 摩羯座?  - 摩西医生
- Capricorn?  - Moses the physic.

283
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,160
可以理解 疾病可没有宵禁
Understandable. Illness respects no curfew.

284
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,960
那就剩下双子座了 他是谁?
That leaves Gemini. Who is he?

285
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,530
我不认为双子座代表了叛徒
I don't think our conspirator is Gemini.

286
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,500
这个符号是...
That's the symbol for, well...

287
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,130
卢克蕾齐娅・多纳蒂?
Lucrezia Donati?

288
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:57,200
冒犯之处请原谅 但您肯定知道她为何这么晚还在外面
Forgive any indelicacy, but you surely know why she's out late at night.

289
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,560
我确实知道
I do.

290
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,930
但是 我们雇佣达芬奇的那周
And yet, the week we hired Da Vincis,

291
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,130
- "从锡耶纳返回"  - 是的
- "Returning from Siena."  - Mm.

292
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,930
我听说现在她就在那儿 可能是在探望亲戚
I hear she's there now. She could have been easily visiting relatives.

293
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,430
也可能是去了罗马
She could have just easily traveled to Rome

294
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,960
警告他们我们有了新战争工程师
and alerted them of our new war engineer.

295
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,400
不可能 她可是... 女人啊
It's impossible. She's a... woman.

296
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,600
正是
Exactly.

297
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,500
她和我哥哥的关系成了天衣无缝的托辞
Her liaisons with my brother create an unquestionable alibi.

298
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,760
但我们不能排除卢克蕾齐娅是间谍的可能性
But we cannot ignore the possibility that Lucrezia is a spy.

299
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:23,900
备马去锡耶纳
Saddle the horses for Siena.

300
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,500
我们当面问她
We'll question her directly.

301
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,260
先生们 请集合
Gentlemen, gather round.

302
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,700
这是博纳多・巴隆切里
Bernardo Baroncelli.

303
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,400
这是贾科莫・ 波拉乔里尼
Jacomo Bracciolini.

304
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,030
佣兵队长乔瓦尼・巴蒂斯塔
Condottiere Giovan Battista.

305
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,300
这是雷纳托・朱斯蒂尼
Renato Giustini.

306
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:48,260
巴尼奥内神父
Father Bagnone.

307
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:51,230
马菲教父
Father Maffei.

308
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,300
尊敬的奥尔西尼红衣大主教
Your Eminence, Cardinal Orsini.

309
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,530
有人会说我们是叛国贼
Some may call us conspirators.

310
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,300
我认为不 绅士们
I say no. Gentlemen,

311
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:04,660
在座的每一位都是我们伟大城市的救世主
look upon each other as saviors of our great city.

312
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,160
啊
Ahhh.

313
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,660
这位就是最后一位救世主
And here's our final savior.

314
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,400
先生们
Gentlemen.

315
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,100
- 前门被锁上了  - 谁这么大胆?
- The front door was locked.  - Who dares?

316
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,800
莱昂纳多・达・芬奇
Leonardo Da Vinci.

317
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:23,430
那个你试图囚禁并烧死的人
The man you sought to have imprisoned and burned.

318
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,760
那个佛罗伦萨的大师
The Florentine virtuoso.

319
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,260
你进来的方式和特别
You make quite an entrance.

320
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,200
要确保我们不被人打扰啊
To ensure a private audience.

321
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,400
密室 请带路
The Secret Archive, if you please.

322
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,460
如你所愿
As you wish.

323
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,330
我知道外面有护卫
I'm aware of the guards outside.

324
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,000
密室
Surely a Secret Archive

325
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,900
当然会有一个秘密通道
has an attendant secret passageway.

326
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,800
那就找出来啊
Then find one.

327
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,300
这所教廷由尼瓦罗・斯佩齐亚里设计的 对吧?
This palace was designed by Nivolo Speziali, no?

328
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,630
他的建筑风格在历史上很有名
And his structures are historically rife

329
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,400
他喜欢运用暗门
with hidden doorways,

330
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,160
隧道
tunnels.

331
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,830
根据微风的方向
And judging by the direction of that breeze,

332
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,160
我认为...
I would say...

333
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:31,900
通道就在这堵墙后面
a passageway most likely lies behind this wall.

334
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,300
我赞同洛伦佐绝妙的联姻计划
I have agreed to Lorenzo's cunning plan of a marriage,

335
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,060
因为它绝对不可能实现
only because it will never happen.

336
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,730
美第奇家族答应要在圣周六(复活节前夕)过来
Accepting it obliges the Medicis to join us here on Holy Saturday.

337
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,200
要在洛伦佐过来的路上动手吗
Do we kill Lorenzo coming up the path

338
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,130
还是让我们的人埋伏在途中?
or have my men attack along his journey?

339
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,460
瑞阿里奥伯爵命令 只有他们兄弟两个在一起的时候 我们才能动手
Count Riario commands that we strike only when the brothers are together.

340
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,530
洛伦佐和朱利亚诺的喜好不同
Lorenzo and Giuliano enjoy separate but equal sway

341
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,260
但臣民不是效忠于此便是效忠于彼
over the loyalties of the people.

342
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,000
如果他们没同时死
If they are not killed simultaneously,

343
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,500
幸存者会重新掌权
then the survivor will reclaim power.

344
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,330
一旦把他们兄弟除去 我们就能削弱他们的势力
Eliminate both brothers at once and we cripple their line.

345
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,560
只要他们死了
And as soon as they're dead,

346
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:31,260
纳扎雷诺・德拉戈纳迪就以他的值夜官身份 掌权
Nazzareno Dragonetti, with his Officers of the Night, steps in.

347
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,630
我们能相信他吗?
Can we be so sure?

348
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,200
那可是一个效忠美第奇家族多年的人啊
This is the man who spent years doing the Medicis' bidding.

349
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,800
我也怀疑
I must agree.

350
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,330
那么 你又拿什么来证明你的忠诚呢?
What assurances do we have that your loyalty lies with our purpose?

351
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,030
我效忠于我的家庭
My allegiance is to my family.

352
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,130
效忠于弗洛伦萨 我的家乡
And to Florence, my home.

353
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,500
那洛伦佐的妻子怎么办呢?
And what of Lorenzo's wife?

354
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,460
我的妹妹克拉丽斯
My sister, Clarice.

355
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:55,160
如圣经所言
As the Bible says,

356
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,500
女人一结婚就不再是娘家的人了
a woman leaves her home when she weds.

357
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,300
某种意义上 她已经不是你妹妹了
She's no longer truly your sister.

358
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,400
但是
However,

359
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:11,630
等到最终你回到罗马 你真正归属的地方的时候
you will be handsomely rewarded for the loss you endure,

360
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:14,900
你的付出会换来丰厚的回报
as you finally return to Rome where you belong,

361
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,060
圣父的副司祭
Vice Chancellor to the Holy Father.

362
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,160
在座每一位都将获得丰厚的报酬
As each of you will be rewarded.

363
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,000
这不正是洛伦佐的做法吗?
Isn't this what we complain of in Lorenzo?

364
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,000
他已然不再是帝国的领导了
That he is not a leader of a republic

365
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,000
而是一个只顾及宠臣的暴君吗?
but a tyrant dividing his spoils among his cronies?

366
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,360
我们就不能改变这种任人唯亲的局面吗?
Are we just exchanging one family of nepotistic leaders for another?

367
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,660
巴斯塔!
Basta!

368
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,600
喝杯酒 兄弟 然后冷静点
Take a drink, brother, and calm down.

369
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,400
像其他新上任的领导一样...
Like any new leaders, we...

370
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:51,800
忠于我们的人能平步青云
we promote those loyal to us.

371
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,300
但洛伦佐是一个懦弱 贫穷
But Lorenzo is a weak, bankrupt traitor

372
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,860
躲在政治特权的庇护下的叛国贼
hiding behind political privilege.

373
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,930
如果欧洲知道是这样一个人在统治我们的帝国
How is Florence a world power

374
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,760
佛罗伦萨还能如何掌控世界?
if Europe knows our republic is in such hands?

375
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,000
帕吉家族能够利用他们的贸易伙伴
The Pazzi name offers legitimacy and security

376
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,860
和联盟军队提供合法保护
with trade partners and neighboring armies.

377
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,130
检验你忠诚的时候...
The time to question your allegiance is...

378
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,300
哦 已经过了很久了
well, it's long past.

379
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,300
美第奇兄弟将会这样死去
That is how the Medicis will die.

380
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,330
转瞬之间
Quickly.

381
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:04,630
效忠于我们 或者... 死
Stand with us or... not at all.

382
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,700
维克洛・玛娜
Viccolo della Manna.

383
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,430
安娜・多纳蒂 卢克蕾齐娅姑妈的家
The home of Lucrezia's aunt, Anna Donati.

384
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,500
女士 您是安娜・多纳蒂吗?
Signora, are you Anna Donati?

385
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,060
我们找你的外甥女卢克蕾齐娅
We require your niece, Lucrezia.

386
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,260
她还没回家吗?
Has she not returned home?

387
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,230
她之前在这里 但几天前就动身回佛罗伦萨了
She was here, but she left for Florence days ago.

388
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,160
不好意思 我们要进去看一下
You understand we'll need to look around.

389
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,600
她走的是波吉邦西那条路
Did she take the road to Poggibonsi

390
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,960
还是基安蒂那边?
or through Chianti?

391
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,500
当然是波吉邦西了 那条路安全些
Poggibonsi, of course. It's safer.

392
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,330
如果你有她的消息 请立即给佛罗伦萨发信通知我
If you hear from her, send word to me immediately in Florence.

393
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,760
当然
Of course.

394
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,960
看啊
Behold.

395
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,830
如果这就是你要找的
If it is treasure you seek,

396
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,500
这间屋子可远超过了你期望的
this chamber contains more that you should ever require.

397
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,260
即使达芬奇也感到惊奇了吗
It appears we awe even Da Vinci.

398
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:00,730
我只是震惊于...
I'm just astonished...

399
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,830
一个暴虐专横的人能窃取如此之多
at what tyranny can steal.

400
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:10,860
这些精致的工艺品都是鲜血换来的
Blood was the ransom paid for these artifacts.

401
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:14,560
来自一个威胁我命的人的伪善
Hypocrisy from a man who threatens my life.

402
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,430
来自一个试图杀我的人的声音
Voiced by one who attempted to take mine.

403
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,200
是谁写的这封匿名信...
Whose agent authored this denunciation...

404
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,260
害我差点被烧死的
to have me burned.

405
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,160
这是一个女人的笔迹
But this is in a woman's hand.

406
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,760
难道你相信我会雇佣女人办事?
Could you truly believe I would employ a daughter of Eve as an agent?

407
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,830
我要找一把钥匙
I seek a key.

408
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,830
打开"天穹"的第二把钥匙
The second needed to open the Vault of Heaven.

409
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,730
为了这把钥匙你甘愿冒死?
For this you would risk death?

410
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,400
别继续... 玩你的把戏了
Do not continue... with this ruse.

411
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,960
你想拖延时间
You aim only to delay me

412
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,860
直到你的护卫发现你的失踪
until your absence is noticed by your guards.

413
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,730
你从不停止思考
Your mind is restless.

414
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:06,100
探索着那些最难以理解的东西
Yearning for that which most cannot comprehend.

415
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:10,530
上帝可以使你解脱
God can end your longing.

416
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,960
因为 他将送你一份大礼
For He presents you the chance to explore

417
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,800
给你一个机会去解开这间屋子内所有的谜
all the mysteries of this chamber.

418
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:21,530
只要你答应代替莫克里红衣大主教
If you would only agree to replace Cardinal Mercuri.

419
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:26,060
你在引诱我做一个密室的守护者?
You would entice me to become keeper of the Secret Archives?

420
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:28,700
不 不 不是守护者
Not keeper. Oh, no, no, no.

421
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,030
是探索者
Its explorer.

422
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,460
跟我来 达芬奇
Come with me, Da Vinci.

423
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,930
跟我来...
Come with me...

424
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:47,360
然后你就不会说没动心了
and then tell me you're not intrigued.

425
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,130
阁下 那现在怎么办? 
So, what now, Signor?

426
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,630
如果她没什么好隐瞒的 她就会选择波吉邦西这条路
If she has nothing to hide, she'll take the road through Poggibonsi.

427
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,830
但如果她背着我们策划什么
But if she conspires against us,

428
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,330
她就会选择一个人走基安蒂这条路
she'd find a way to ride alone through Chianti.

429
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,430
那我们走哪条路?
Which road do we take? 

430
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,900
我们做最坏的打算 即使推测错误 也不会耽误什么 
We prepare for the worst and find ourselves relieved if we were wrong.

431
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,660
走基安蒂
Through Chianti.

432
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,700
- 卡拉 他们是谁?  - 洛伦佐的弟弟
- Cara mia, who were they?  - That was Lorenzo's brother.

433
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,060
或许是我离开的太久了
Perhaps I've been away too long.

434
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,800
或许是你在罗马的事情败坏了
Or perhaps your own business in Rome has gone bad.

435
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,230
我希望你别管这些事
I'd hoped to spare you knowledge of these matters.

436
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,960
在佛罗伦萨就没有一个人肯帮你吗? 洛伦佐呢?
Can no-one in Florence help you? What about Lorenzo?

437
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,300
洛伦佐把一个忠心耿耿跟随他多年的人送上刑场
He sentenced a man he's loved for decades to death,

438
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,400
因为他怀疑那人背叛了他
on suspicion of something I have done.

439
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,300
那就没有别人了吗?
Well, is there no-one else?

440
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,130
有
Yes.

441
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,660
还有一个人
There is another.

442
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:01,530
有一个可以凭空找到出路的人
A man who could invent an escape where none exists.

443
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,530
龙的头骨
The skull of a dragon.

444
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,000
这会成为你研究生物
It would serve as a unique addition to your study

445
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:14,600
和解剖工作的良机 不是吗?
of creatures and their anatomy, yes?

446
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,330
或许你想要细看一下这个
Perhaps you'd care to examine this.

447
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,600
命运之矛
The Spear of Destiny.

448
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:44,000
在基督被挂在十字架上的时候
A lance used to pierce the side of Christ

449
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,360
它曾刺过他
while He hung on the cross.

450
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,030
很多人相信 此矛在手...
Many believe that in one's hands...

451
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,900
天下无敌
it can defeat any enemy.

452
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,730
巧夺天工
It's extraordinary.

453
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,060
但钥匙呢?
But what of the key?

454
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,160
关乎叶之书啊
This obsession with the Book Of Leaves.

455
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,360
那个土耳其人在玩弄你
The Turk blinds you with tricks and deceptions.

456
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,960
密特拉之子们早就灭绝了
The Sons of Mithras are an extinct order.

457
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,730
那些借他名义的人
Those who advance its name now,

458
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,560
都想把真正身份隐藏起来
conceal their real agenda.

459
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,760
从你的行踪看来 你在不知情的情况下为土耳其帝国的苏丹人做事
In your quest, you unknowingly act as an agent for the Ottoman Sultan.

460
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,800
我不听命于任何人...
My quest is not in pursuit of anyone's purpose...

461
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,860
除了我自己
except my own.

462
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,330
啊
Ah.

463
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,060
我猜现在 你代表你母亲说话
And here, you speak of your mother, I presume.

464
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,960
这确实是一件值得为之奋斗的事情
A treasure truly worth fighting for.

465
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,530
而且只有我能让你们重新团聚
And one only I can aid in reuniting you with.

466
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,760
你知道我的母亲?
What do you know of my mother?

467
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,460
圣父?
Holy Father?

468
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,060
圣父!
Holy Father!

469
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,360
有人潜入了梵蒂冈教廷
An enemy has entered the Vatican.

470
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,930
蒙泰费尔特罗 拉响警报
Montefeltro, sound the alarm.

471
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,900
效忠罗马
Pledge your allegiance to Rome

472
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,360
整个天主教教会的所有资源都将为你所用
and you shall have the entire resources of the Catholic Church at your disposal.

473
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,100
钱 物 人
Its coffers, devisings,

474
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,500
就是教廷舰队也会听你的派遣
even the ships of the Papal Armada to ferry you.

475
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:35,730
那叶之书呢? 如果我的研究需要用到这本书呢?
And the Book Of Leaves? What if I should uncover that on my search?

476
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,900
那就更好了
So much the better.

477
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,360
它太珍贵了 无人守护我可不放心
It's far too precious to be left unguarded.

478
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,930
有时候我都怀疑它是否存在
There was a time when I distrusted its very existence.

479
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,030
直到我亲眼看到它
Until my eyes fell upon this.

480
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,430
我们从佛罗伦萨获得来的战利品
Which we recovered from Florence.

481
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,200
噢!
Oh!

482
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,860
这不是任何一种我所知道的语言
It's unlike any language I've ever encountered.

483
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,100
远不止语言本身的魅力
That is far from its only mystery.

484
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,360
这些字...
The words...

485
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,500
它们好像... 每看一次都会改变?
they seem to... change with every viewing?

486
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,530
同样的内容 从没出现过第二次
Never offering the same content twice.

487
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,430
想象着解开这个谜
Imagine solving this.

488
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:33,100
我见到这个东西不久之后就做了一个梦
I had a dream not long after I saw this.

489
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,700
来自天堂的强烈的信息
A powerful message sent from the heavens.

490
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,830
告诉我叶之书
It told me the Book Of Leaves

491
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:42,200
里面有... 神的秘密
contains... secrets of the divine.

492
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,560
它的作者是"堕落者"
That its authors were the Nephilim

493
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,230
神和人所生之子
the offspring of Angels and the women of man.

494
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,830
圣父!
Father!

495
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,260
我知道那本书和它的秘密一定
I know now that the Book with its mysteries

496
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,400
藏在教会里
must remain within the Church.

497
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:59,430
- 无论代价如何  - 你打算用它来守护自己还是埋葬自己?
- No matter the cost.  - Is it defense or burial that you intend as its fate?

498
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,460
世界需要秘密
The world needs secrets.

499
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:05,660
如果天机泄漏 将会天翻地覆
Powerful ideas can wreak havoc if unleashed before their time.

500
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:10,460
但同时也是一个崭新的开始 这将取决于你
But a new beginning can start with you here now, if you choose.

501
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,300
住手 蒙泰费尔特罗
Hold, Montefeltro.

502
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:16,860
那么... 我们是同盟了
So... we are allied.

503
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:19,460
你强迫我为你做事
You press for my devotion

504
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,300
囚禁我的自由
as only to place me here

505
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:26,330
如同你亲手打造的坟墓里的一件陪葬品
as another relic in this tomb that you've constructed.

506
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,100
抓起来
Take him.

507
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,400
抓住他!
Get him!

508
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,730
走!
Go!

509
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:50,400
尼科! 回来 憨货
Nico! Come back here, you spongy pignut.

510
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,100
你的主人回来了
Your master returns.

511
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,460
尼科!
Nico!

512
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,700
莱昂
Leo.

513
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,130
过来
Come here.

514
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:05,330
你肯定是疯了
You are completely mad.

515
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,000
该死
Oh, fuck.

516
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,360
真难相信你耍了那个瑞阿里奥
I can't believe you stuck it to that fuck Riario.

517
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,330
我真想看看他知道真相之后的样子
I wish I could see his face when he figures it out.

518
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,700
梦想成真了
Wishes come true.

519
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:24,230
在这边
Through here. 

520
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,260
达芬奇去哪了?
Where is Da Vinci?

521
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,030
只有我知道
I'm the last person he tells.

522
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,460
- 是吗?  - 是
- Really?  - Yeah.

523
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:45,700
那么... 也许我等他的时候
Then... then perhaps I'll entertain myself,

524
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,200
可以自娱自乐一下
while I wait.

525
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,230
梵蒂冈教廷可以增加一个阉割过的歌手
The Vatican choir could use a new castrato.

526
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,060
该死
Fuck.

527
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,030
闪开
Move away.

528
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:21,030
哈!
Yeaargh!

529
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,630
啊!
Aaargh!

530
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,200
哦
Oh. 

531
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,400
啊!
Aaargh!

532
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,600
天啊! 该死! 啊
God! Fuck! Aargh.

533
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,160
你知道我是谁吗?
Do you know who I am?

534
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,700
小尼科
Young Nico.

535
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:30,200
我... 我发现咱们第一次相遇让你的手还一直颤抖
I... I see our first encounter left your hand shaking.

536
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,960
我会刺进你心里
I'll steady it in your heart.

537
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:35,330
你会吗? 如果你想报仇
Will you? If revenge is your aim,

538
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,360
必须战胜自己的恐惧
you must overcome your apprehension.

539
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:54,560
好的 我也表达了自己的直率
Now that we've established my propensity for directness,

540
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:57,800
我要问你个问题
I have a question for you.

541
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:00,430
我的大师在哪?
Where is my Maestro?

542
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:04,830
你尝过血的味道吗 尼科?
Have you ever tasted blood, Nico?

543
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:09,160
嗯... 有一种奇怪的咸味
It erm... possesses a peculiar saltiness.

544
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,430
别麻烦了 尼科 他不知道
Don't bother, Nico. He doesn't know.

545
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,900
他就算知道也会装不知道
Wouldn't reveal anything even if he did.

546
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:17,660
- 对 是的  - 很对 尼科
- Yes, he will.  - You're quite right, Nico.

547
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:21,630
我可以给你讲讲在我们讲话的时候
I will tell you all about the dozen Swiss mercenaries,

548
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,130
我往台伯河边派出的
I dispatched to the Tiber,

549
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,800
一沓搜寻我的瑞士雇佣军
who search for me as we speak.

550
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,960
等他们来了我给你讲讲我的计划
I'll reveal my plan when they arrive,

551
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:32,900
让他们一层层地把你的皮剥下来
to have them peel away your skin one layer at a time.

552
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:34,300
就这样?
Like this?

553
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:35,830
啊!
Aaargh!

554
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,700
你不会想这样的
You don't want to travel this road.

555
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,930
如果你想让他流血 让我动手 行了 可以了
If you wish to see him bleed, let it be my doing. Come on, stop it.

556
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,360
不！我要对抗他 他要回答我的问题
No! He's mine to face. And he will answer my question.

557
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,300
他在哪?
Where is he?

558
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:55,260
我很欣赏你的决心 孩子
I commend you on your resolve, boy.

559
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,260
换做别人 若非此景此景
In another life, in other circumstances,

560
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,400
我一定跟你一样
I could have used someone like you.

561
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,630
啊!
Aaaarh! 

562
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,430
是第二把钥匙
It's the second key.

563
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,030
啊!
Aargh!

564
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,700
好吧...
Okay... 

565
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,460
这个曲调很熟悉
That's a curious tune.

566
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:46,200
我能问问... 你从哪学的吗?
May I ask... where you know it from?

567
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:50,000
是我编的曲子
It's of my own construction.

568
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,900
我听过这支摇篮曲
I've heard the lullaby before.

569
00:45:57,430 --> 00:46:01,060
你是卢克蕾齐娅・多纳蒂的父亲
You are Lucrezia Donati's father.

570
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,300
对吧?
Aren't you?

571
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:09,060
是的... 达芬奇阁下
Indeed... Signor Da Vinci.

572
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,730
我们以前见过吗?
Have we met before?

573
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:18,800
没有 不过还能有谁让瑞阿里奥如此苦恼呢?
No, but who else so bedevils Riario?

574
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,960
这只戒指是你的 对吧?
This ring belongs to you, doesn't it?

575
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:31,260
曾经是 被拿走了
Once upon a time. It was taken.

576
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:34,100
我能问问你是如何得到的吗?
May I ask how you acquired it?

577
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:38,400
是你女儿... 送给我的礼物
It was a gift... from your daughter.

578
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,930
不 这可不仅仅是礼物
No, it is far more than a gift.

579
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,200
你爱我女儿吗?
Do you love my daughter?

580
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,300
莱昂纳多 你爱卢克蕾齐娅吗?
Do you love my Lucrezia, Leonardo?

581
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,030
呵
Ha.

582
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,200
我必须承认...
I must confess...

583
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:04,530
我不确定你女儿是谁 阁下
I'm not sure who your daughter is, Signor.

584
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:11,760
她的身影... 对我来说如此飘渺
Her image has always been... shaded to me.

585
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,600
也许现在我知道了原因
Perhaps now I know why.

586
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,430
你...
You...

587
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,700
你...
You...

588
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:22,660
你就是...
You present...

589
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:27,430
解开她谜题的关键因素
a key piece in unlocking her puzzle.

590
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,630
她送给我你的戒指
She offers me your ring,

591
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,430
却留你在监狱里...
but keeps your imprison... 

592
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,360
她对你被监禁的事只字不提
She keeps your imprisonment a secret.

593
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,800
她...
She...

594
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,600
给了我她的爱...
extends me her love...

595
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:51,000
却仍然与洛伦佐纠缠
but she continues with Lorenzo.

596
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,230
她几乎没见过瑞阿里奥... 却如此鄙视
She despises Riario... but she's barely met him.

597
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:03,730
她想... 救你
She hopes... to save you.

598
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,600
保护...
To protect...

599
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,130
这是女人的笔迹
This is in a woman's hand.

600
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,000
你为什么会如此盲目?
How can you be so blind?

601
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:26,560
她是受罗马操纵的
She maneuvers for Rome.

602
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:31,730
她把我的秘密告知了瑞阿里奥
She feeds my secrets to Riario.

603
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:36,560
她... 她毒害自己同城的人民
She... she poisons her fellow citizens.

604
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,900
她看着我入狱 等待火刑
She sees me imprisoned and left to burn.

605
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,730
一切都是为了救你
And it's all to set you free.

606
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:47,600
卢克蕾齐娅全都是按照别人残酷的操纵行动的
Lucrezia acts at the behest of others' cruel manipulations.

607
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:52,260
她爱我 请将此归罪于我
She loves me. Blame that on me if you will.

608
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,230
而不是她
Not her.

609
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,360
用力!
Harder!

610
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:04,730
请从暗影中现身
Remove yourself from the shadows.

611
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,360
我们共同面对你的女儿
Let us face your daughter together.

612
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:12,860
卢克蕾齐娅努力要拯救你为什么还不走?
Lucrezia labors to secure your freedom why stay?

613
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:15,260
我就在自己应该在的地方
I'm exactly where I need to be.

614
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:17,730
我不明白
I don't understand. 

615
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,760
走吧 莱昂纳多
Go now, Leonardo.

616
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:21,830
回到我女儿身边
Return to my daughter.

617
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,060
向她表达我的爱
Tell her of my love.

618
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,700
还有你自己的
And your own.

619
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,730
别着急 尼科 他没事
Don't brood, Nico. He's fine.

620
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,330
你刚才
What you did earlier,

621
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,800
帮助我的行为 非常勇敢
coming to my aid, was very brave.

622
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,960
呃... 谢谢
So... thank you.

623
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:02,130
那我也该谢你
Then I should thank you as well.

624
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,660
大师! 我们很担心你
Maestro! You had us worried.

625
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:09,900
至少尼科很担心
Nico, at least.

626
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,060
我只是很高兴能离开这里了
I'm just glad to leave this hellhole.

627
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:16,500
恐怕... 恐怕...
I'm afraid... I'm afraid...

628
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:19,260
还不行
I'm afraid I can't.

629
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:23,930
我没拿到钥匙所以还不能走
I've failed to retrieve the key and I'll stay until I acquire it.

630
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:26,900
- 莱昂  - 怎么?
- Leo.  - What?

631
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:29,460
有个惊喜给你 别太高兴
Steel yourself for a surprise.

632
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,200
什么?
How?

633
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,460
因为他这个酒鬼
Credit this malt-worm.

634
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:41,800
我本来想把这个家伙刺死 可是他不让
I wanted to gut the prick, but he'd not have it.

635
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,430
呵
Huh.

636
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:03,100
艺术家... 我看到你逃出来了
Artista... I see you escaped.

637
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,000
而我看到了一把钥匙...
And I see a key...

638
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,730
是你要给我的
that you will be giving to me.

639
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:12,300
你最好先杀了我
You best kill me first.

640
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:26,160
不然就算追到天涯海角 我也要找回属于我自己的东西
I will follow you to the ends of the earth to retrieve what's mine.

641
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:33,330
或许有一天...
There may come a day...

642
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:38,600
我会不得已而取你性命 捷洛拉莫
where I am forced to take your life, Girolamo.

643
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,100
可不是今天
It's not today.

644
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:45,260
我来到了你的家园...
I've come into your home...

645
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:48,960
拿走了你最珍爱的东西
and I've taken the thing that you hold dearest.

646
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:53,530
我...
I erm...

647
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,930
会很快报答你的...
I plan to return the favor soon...

648
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:01,860
夺走你最珍爱的人
and take the one most dearest to you.

649
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:06,960
大师 我们就把他留在这?
Maestro, shall we just leave him?

650
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:12,900
被自己过错阴魂不散得萦绕 尼科...
To be haunted by your mistakes, Nico...

651
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:17,130
是比死亡更悲惨的命运
that's a fate far worse than death.

652
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,700
别碰她 她不干净
Don't touch her. She's unclean.

653
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:55,730
难道没人告诉我们她会伪装吗?
Weren't we told she'd be in disguise?

654
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,960
我们不能让她过去 去拦住她
We can't pass her by. We're stopping her.

655
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:02,830
停!
Halt! 

656
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,960
停下 停!
Halt. Halt!

657
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:08,400
停下!
Halt!

658
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,900
别动
Stay where you are.

659
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:11,230
依慕达!
Immunda!

660
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,530
- 露出脸来!  - 我很可怕
- Unveil yourself!  - I'm hideous.

661
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,760
是个女人 瑞阿里奥说过她会伪装成麻风病人
It's a woman. Riario said she'd be disguised as a leper.

662
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,860
自己露出脸来不然我们就动手了
Show your face or we do it for you.

663
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,530
摘掉面具
Take off the mask.

664
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,430
看看她一个手指都没掉
Look who has all her fingers.

665
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,860
不!
No! 

666
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:32,000
你不是麻风病人 女士
You're no leper, Signora.

667
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:39,030
退下! 我奉罗马瑞阿里奥伯爵之命
Stand down! I've been given orders by Count Riario of Rome,

668
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:41,160
为洛伦佐・美第奇传信
to bring information for Lorenzo de Medici.

669
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,730
女士 看来你的消息有点过时了
Signora, you seem to be a sunrise behind.

670
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,900
我们也是奉罗马的命令
We're on our own orders from Rome.

671
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:48,600
洛伦佐和他的弟弟将会被刺杀
Lorenzo and his dolt of a brother are to be assassinated.

672
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,530
你的任务结束了 生命也是
Your services are ended. As is your life.

673
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,900
我还没杀过这么漂亮的人
I've never killed anyone quite so pretty.

674
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:56,860
这次可不一样了
This will be different.

675
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:01,060
他说了要做的像强盗杀人越货的现场 不要一剑封喉
He said to make it look like brigands. Don't do one clean hit.

676
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:03,060
不
No.

677
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:06,800
对抗我们
That's for fighting us.

678
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:11,000
不!
No! 

679
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:16,530
不过首先 咱们让她爽爽
But first, let's give her something to remember.

680
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:22,160
住手! 退下!
Halt! Stand down!

681
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,400
不关你的事 走开
This doesn't concern you. Ride on.

682
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:25,430
我是朱利亚诺・美第奇
I am Giuliano de Medici,

683
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,730
佛罗伦萨总督洛伦佐阁下的弟弟
brother to His Magnificence, Lorenzo of Florence.

684
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,330
我命令你们停手!
I order you to stop!

685
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:31,900
罗马在这里没有权利
Romans have no authority here.

686
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,060
很快就会有了
They will soon enough.

687
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:36,930
而且罗马要这个不可靠的小婊子死
And they want this deceptive little tart dead.

688
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:41,860
她怎样冒犯了罗马?
How has she offended Rome?

689
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:45,600
她是瑞阿里奥伯爵的间谍 不过现在已经弃用了
She spied for Count Riario and now he's done with her.

690
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,900
帕吉家族想要掌控佛罗伦萨 用得着这样一个荡妇吗?
What use is a slattern like this with the Pazzis about to seize control of Florence?

691
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:51,030
啊!
Aaargh!

692
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,660
阁下!
Signor!

693
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,030
啊!
Aaargh!

694
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,500
博尔蒂诺!
Bertino!

695
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:27,930
啊!
Aaargh!

696
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,530
都是拜你这个间谍所赐!
All this for a spy like you!

697
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,330
博尔蒂诺是个好人 贝奇也是
Bertino was a good man. But so was Becchi.

698
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,900
你根本不知道好有何意义
Goodness means nothing to you.

699
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:47,160
是你给他带去了毒芹 对吧?
The hand that brought him the hemlock was yours, wasn't it?

700
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,500
是什么让你背叛洛伦佐? 
What possesses you to betray Lorenzo?

701
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:54,290
背叛我们大家?
To betray us all?

702
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,220
你永远不会明白
You would never understand.

703
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,900
啊!
Aaargh!

704
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:02,660
你这个欲壑难填的浪货
You are the cunt of an overworked whore.

705
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,720
我哥哥操你的时候
As my brother fucked you in the ass,

706
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:09,210
你是不是因为知道也在毁掉他 所以才能笑得出来?
did you smile, knowing you were doing the same to him?

707
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,340
我要带你回去见他 看他会有何感觉
Let's return to him and see how he feels about all this.

708
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:15,780
他会以祸乱民众
Will he opt to break you on the wheel,

709
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,490
把你绑在广场的木轮上 被乱棍打死吗?
in the public square, for the edification of the masses?

710
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:22,020
还是会因羞愧而私下处你死刑?
Or will his shame lead him to kill you privately?

711
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,180
慢慢地 经历数周
Slowly, over weeks of time.

712
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:28,180
- 呃!  - 啊!
- Urgh!  - Oh!

713
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:32,680
啊! 啊!
Aargh! Aargh!

1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,830
我们被称为密特拉之子
We are known as the Sons of Mithras.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,830
鬼火 这就是密特拉神之子的杰作
Ignis fatuus, that's what this Sons of Mithras business is.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,730
如果我娶了卡米拉・帕吉...
If I marry Camilla Pazzi...

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,960
你我仍然可以不时地偷欢
You and I can still snatch a little freedom here and there.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,060
要在洛伦佐过来的路上动手吗?
Do we kill Lorenzo coming up the path?

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,560
只有他们兄弟两个在一起的时候 我们才能动手
Strike only when the brothers are together.

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,000
卢克蕾齐娅・多纳蒂?
Lucrezia Donati?

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,530
备马去锡耶纳 我们当面问她
Saddle the horses for Siena. We'll question her directly.

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,230
- 这位就是最后一位救世主  - 先生们
- And here's our final savior.  - Gentlemen.

10
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,360
是什么让你背叛洛伦佐 背叛我们大家?
What possesses you to betray Lorenzo, to betray us all?

11
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,300
- 你是卢克蕾齐娅・多纳蒂的父亲  - 是的
- You are Lucrezia Donati's father.  - Indeed.

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,830
艺术家 我看到你逃出来了
L'Artista, I see you escaped.

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,100
而我看到了一把钥匙
And I see a key.

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,630
科西莫・美第奇是密特拉之子
Cosimo de Medici was a Son of Mithras.

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,160
一艘装了探险补给的船
A ship provisioned for a journey.

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,560
天穹就在那
The Vault of Heaven is out there.

达芬奇的恶魔 第一季第8集

20
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,630
君士坦丁堡 13年前

21
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,600
真主至上
Allahu Akbar.

22
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,260
真主至上
Allahu Akbar.

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,730
阿尔拉希姆 密特拉之子的命运如何?
What does the future hold for the Sons of Mithras, Al-Rahim?

24
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,260
占卜是难以捉摸的
Augury is a tricky business.

25
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,860
我看到了愤怒的潮水
I see grim tidings.

26
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,500
无尽的黑暗和绝望
Darkness, despair.

27
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,730
一如既往的疯言疯语啊
The usual cant and caper, then.

28
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,530
你会让情况好起来的 对吗 科西莫・美第奇?
You would make light of our circumstances, Cosimo de Medici?

29
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,700
当然了 我的朋友 唯一支撑我的就是光明 
Light is the only thing that sustains me, my friend.

30
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,730
地平线上有福音出现吗?
Are there no bright spots on the horizon, then?

31
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,700
有一个从芬奇来的男孩
There is one, a boy from Vinci.

32
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,130
他大有希望
He has promise.

33
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,500
即便使诈 也要把他带到佛罗伦萨
Even now, events conspire to bring him to Florence.

34
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,060
需要我盯他吗?
Am I to keep an eye on him?

35
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,000
别靠太近
Only from a distance.

36
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,000
他必须靠自己的创造成功或者失败
He must ascend or fall by his own devices.

37
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,630
说到创造
And speaking of devices,

38
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,760
我们请你保护它的安全
we give you this for safe-keeping.

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,130
时候到了 自然有人会来找它
Someone will come for this when it is time to make the journey.

40
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,130
或许就是那个阿尔拉希姆提到的男孩
Perhaps, the boy Al-Rahim speaks of.

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,560
如果他能捱过磨难的话
Assuming he survives his trial.

42
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,700
我相信 他会的
I have faith he will.

43
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,660
如果要我保护火种的话
If I'm to keep the candles burning,

44
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,600
要许我以保证 而不能仅仅有飘渺的信念和模糊的预言
I'll need more reassurances than faith and a vague prophecy. 

45
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,060
恐怕我不能给你任何保证
I'm afraid I cannot give you any reassurances.

46
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,100
如果卜卦显示的命运成真
If the future indicated by these signs comes to pass,

47
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,560
我们中就只有一个人能活到那时候
only one of us will live to see it.

48
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,200
那么是谁能够幸存?
So which lucky one gets to survive?

49
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,930
你错了
You misunderstand.

50
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,260
死去的才是幸运的人
The dead will be the lucky ones.

51
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,360
活下来看到未来的人...
The one who lives to see this future...

52
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,900
会备受折磨
he will truly suffer.

53
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,860
我会想念这个地方的
I'm going to miss this place.

54
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,530
还有你们 我会十分挂念的 我的朋友们
And you. I'll miss you as well, my friends.

55
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,060
我们愿意继续跟随你
We've followed you into more scrapes than I care to count.

56
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,530
为什么不带着我们?
Why not add another to the tally?

57
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,330
我不能请求你们跟随我漂洋过海
I can't ask you to follow me across an ocean.

58
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,200
我们愿意 大师
We want to, Maestro.

59
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,860
天穹 叶之书 当你找到他们的时候
The Vault of Heaven, the Book of Leaves,

60
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,800
我们想陪在你身边 
we want to be there when you find them.

61
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,430
这孩子够蠢的
The boy's a half-wit moon-calf

62
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,860
就算你让他把小弟弟插在牛粪里 他也会照办的
who'd smother his balls in ox dung if you told him to.

63
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,330
至于我? 我赌债累累
As for me? I've accrued some gambling debts

64
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,400
都付不起在佛罗伦萨的快到期的房租了
that make my near-term residence in Florence problematic.

65
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,530
下一站是哪儿呢? 我们需要一艘船 对吧?
So where to next? We'll need a ship, won't we?

66
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,530
葡萄牙人和西非的贸易往来
The Portuguese are establishing

67
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,760
日益频繁
trade routes along Western Africa.

68
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,430
我们要乘船去卡纳里岛
We'll book passage to the Canary Islands.

69
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,830
之后 就走一步算一步
After that, we'll have to improvise.

70
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,330
不过首先 我要去和美第奇家族算一笔帐
First, I've certain accounts to settle with the House of Medici.

71
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,400
为什么扯上美第奇家族? 为什么还不彻底抛下佛罗伦萨的事情?
Why bother with the Medicis? Why not skirt Florence entirely?

72
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,430
有些事 我必须要和洛伦佐说
There are things I have to say to Lorenzo.

73
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,530
只能亲口跟他说
Words for his ears alone.

74
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,760
那我们今晚在吠犬酒店碰头?
Shall we meet at the Barking Dog this evening?

75
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,000
为什么不呢? 喝一品脱酒 最后一次突袭佛罗伦萨人 碰碰运气
Why not? A pint, one last foray into a Florentine slit for luck.

76
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,900
我们还能看看尼科胆量如何
We can see if Nico's balls have dropped.

77
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,230
奇怪
That's odd.

78
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,100
地中海隼
That's a Lanner Falcon.

79
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,360
他们很少出现在亚德里亚海边
They're rare this side of the Adriatic.

80
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,230
在土耳其和非洲还有可能见到 但是这儿?
Turkey, Africa, yes. But here?

81
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,300
- 说不定它迷路了 有可能  - 不 
- It lost its way. It happens.  - No, not often.

82
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,600
最后一次我看见这种鸟是
The last time I saw a Lanner

83
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,200
在我母亲离开那天
was the day my mother disappeared.

84
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,900
- 你说它们来自土耳其?  - 嗯
- You say they hail from Turkey?  - Mm.

85
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,960
我打赌这只鸟对你来说是个恶兆 
I'll wager that bird's an omen, meant for you alone.

86
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,360
我该跟着它
I should follow it.

87
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,400
我说了 这是恶兆 如果真有什么事情 你也该往反方向跑啊
I said it's an omen. If anything, you should ride in the opposite direction.

88
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,960
- 我们酒店见  - 莱昂!
- I'll meet you at the Dog.  - Leo!

89
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,700
驾!
Yah!

90
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,630
我敢说 现在你相信梦...
I take it you now believe in visions...

91
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,400
和恶魔了?
and demons?

92
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,760
朱利亚诺去哪儿了?
Where can be Giuliano be?

93
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,530
联姻的事 你和他谈得有多糟糕?
How badly did you handle your talk with him about this marriage?

94
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,330
他知道他必须娶这个女孩
He knew he had to wed the girl.

95
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,400
他也认为没有别的办法
He agreed there was no other way

96
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,930
来平息和帕吉家的世仇了
to halt our feud with the Pazzis,

97
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,860
但我好多天都没看见他了
yet I've not seen a trace of him for days.

98
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,230
你是听到他说"愿意"两个字
Did you actually hear him utter the words, "I agree",

99
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,360
还是只听了你想听到的部分?
or did you only hear what you wanted to hear?

100
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,630
他就是同意了
He agreed.

101
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,730
朱利亚诺可能根本不会来了
Giuliano may not arrive at all.

102
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,660
我们行动吧
I say we strike.

103
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,730
趁洛伦佐和克拉丽丝都在 杀了他们
Kill Lorenzo and Clarice while we have them here.

104
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,300
你想用你的愚蠢来成全对手的成功吗?
Are you so blind to the success of your rivals?

105
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,460
民意向着他们兄弟二人
The brothers are popular.

106
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,430
杀一个 只会让幸存者
Murdering only one will allow the survivor

107
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,700
更有能力团结民众来对付我们
to rally the city against us.

108
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,130
只有在同时失去兄弟两个的重创下
Only with the shock of losing both men at once

109
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,800
佛罗伦萨才会接受新的领导者
will Florence bow to new leaders.

110
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,830
不管朱利亚诺在哪里 你都可以派人杀了他
You can send your men after Giuliano, wherever he is.

111
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,400
我能自己解决洛伦佐
I can handle Lorenzo myself.

112
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,800
如果这么做 弗朗切斯科 你就忤逆了罗马的意志 
Do so and you defy the will of Rome, Francesco.

113
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,300
我现在警告你
I warn you now.

114
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,860
太神奇了
Remarkable.

115
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,600
据说
According to lore,

116
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,330
这把钥匙能打开天穹
these will open the Vault of Heaven.

117
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,230
那个阿比西尼亚人 所罗门・奥拜告诉你具体方位了吗?
Solomon Ogbai, the Abyssinian, told you its location?

118
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,600
他跟我说
He told me it rested

119
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,800
在古老山脉上的一座石头小镇里
on an old peak, in a town made of stone.

120
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,760
天穹就在太阳之柱下面
Beneath something called "the hitching post of the sun."

121
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,960
有了这把钥匙和去天穹的地图
With these keys and the map to the Vault itself,

122
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,400
叶之书就牢牢掌握在我们手中了
it would appear the Book of Leaves lies firmly within our grasp.

123
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,500
叶之书最后一次出现是什么时候?
When was the last time the Book was actually seen?

124
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,000
千年之前
A thousand years ago.

125
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,400
亚历山大图书馆被烧毁之际
When the Library of Alexandria burned.

126
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,030
但我们相信它存在着
Yet we still have faith it exists.

127
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,800
相信
Faith.

128
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,830
总是这样 不是吗?
It always comes down to that, doesn't it?

129
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,560
从没有什么事情得到证明 只是...
Never anything that can be proven. Just...

130
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,330
只是弥漫的烟雾
It's just smoke.

131
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,900
只是篝火旁的童话
It's tales by the camp fire.

132
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,230
你生气了
You're angry.

133
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,560
西斯笃教皇说你是土耳其的人
Pope Sixtus claims you're an agent of the Ottomans.

134
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,460
密特拉之子是不会
The Sons of Mithras are not constrained

135
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,630
受地理界限所限的
by geographic borders.

136
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,200
我们的使命关乎整个人类
Our stewardship encompasses all mankind.

137
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,260
那么 我这个独立的个体
Well, this particular man

138
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,260
厌倦了被操纵
is tired of being manipulated.

139
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:46,000
如果你在森林里迷路的时候看见了一个路标
If you are lost in a forest and you see a landmark,

140
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:51,360
那么你能说这个路标在操纵着你通往出口吗?
is that landmark manipulating you along a certain path?

141
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,830
我只是你的引导者
I am merely your guide.

142
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,200
但如果我不走你选的路...
But if I ignore your chosen path, then...

143
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,300
我就永远找不到母亲了 对吧?
I'll never find my mother, will I?

144
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,160
她可真可怜
She's a poor little thing.

145
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,900
如果我弟弟坏了这场宴会 那卡米拉・帕吉伤不伤心
Mending Camilla Pazzi's heart will be the least of our concerns

146
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,200
就无关紧要了
if my brother sabotages this feast.

147
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,700
我们的怠慢或许会使血战愈演愈烈
The snub could propel us all into still more years of blood feud.

148
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,100
看看弗朗切斯科 看看他们
Look at Francesco. Look at them all.

149
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,160
- 帕吉家在强压怒火  - 没错
- The Pazzis glower like that. - Exactly.

150
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
今天本该是来解决矛盾的
Today was supposed to be different.

151
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,560
我们还要等多久?
How long should we wait?

152
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,900
别总是那么没耐性 弗朗切斯科
Always so impatient, Francesco.

153
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,730
去和他们说说话
Talk with them.

154
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,230
抱怨朱利亚诺的缺席
Complain of the scandal of Giuliano's absence.

155
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,600
你对那个狗杂种的愤怒
Your anger at the cur's impudence

156
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,230
能很好的掩饰你的杀机
will disguise your desire to kill.

157
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,200
或者只能刺激我提前动手
Or it may just spur me to strike even faster.

158
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,730
队长 你的特长是知道佛罗伦萨人的行踪
Captain, tracking the comings and goings of Florentines is your specialty.

159
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,530
我的弟弟在哪儿?
Where is my brother?

160
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,400
我不知道
I cannot say.

161
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,100
一周之前 我的手下博蒂诺请命
A week ago, my Officer Bertino asked permission

162
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,100
陪同朱利亚诺去锡耶纳
to accompany Giuliano to Siena.

163
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,330
从那儿以后 我再没见过他们
I've seen neither of them since.

164
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,860
为什么去锡耶纳?
Why Siena?

165
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,860
朱利亚诺
Giuliano,

166
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,760
显然是想在结婚之前再疯狂一把
apparently longed for one last fling before his nuptials.

167
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,600
博蒂诺很忠诚 他发誓会保护他的
The pious Bertino promised to keep him from too much trouble.

168
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,800
但如果博蒂诺出事了呢?
What if Bertino failed?

169
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,660
如果朱利亚诺遭到埋伏了呢?
What if Giuliano was waylaid on the road?

170
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,760
当然 这会是他用缺席来羞辱我们的
Surely that's the only reason he'd insult us

171
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,460
唯一解释
with his absence today.

172
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,730
带上你的人 在佛罗伦萨和锡耶纳之间
Take a few men and search the roads

173
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,160
沿路搜寻
between Florence and Siena.

174
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,560
队长 我们都非常迫切想知道朱利亚诺的下落
All of us yearn to know what has become of Giuliano, Captain.

175
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,630
尽快为我们找到他 谢谢
Settle the matter for us. Please.

176
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,260
有一艘停在佛得角的船 皇冠蜥蜴号
There is a ship bound for Cape Verde, the Basilisk.

177
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,860
那是安东尼奥・诺里的船
Under the command of Antonio de Noli.

178
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,630
我们讲话的时候 诺里正在佛罗伦萨
As we speak, de Noli is in Florence,

179
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,200
往船上运送配给 为他的旅途做准备
loading a barge with provisions for a journey.

180
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,560
黎明时 他会启程去往比萨
At dawn, he takes the barge to Pisa,

181
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,200
就是皇冠蜥蜴号下锚的地方
where the Basilisk is anchored.

182
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,330
莱昂纳多 你必须乘那艘船去
You, Leonardo, must book passage on that ship.

183
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,960
凭你的航海技术
With your navigational skills,

184
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,100
皇冠蜥蜴号才能扛过暴风雨
the Basilisk will survive the storms

185
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,660
抵达另一片陆地
and reach another land entirely,

186
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,430
也就是叶之书所在的地方
where the Book of Leaves awaits.

187
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,300
多年以前 一个魔术士答应我为你藏一件东西
Some years ago, a magician promised me he would hide something for you.

188
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,860
魔术士?
A magician?

189
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,530
科西莫・美第奇?
Cosimo de Medici?

190
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,900
科西莫墓里有一个航海星盘
Cached within Cosimo's tomb is a mariner's astrolabe.

191
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,130
利用它你能判别方向 驾驶皇冠蜥蜴号
With it, you will navigate the Basilisk safely

192
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,300
到达地图上标记的地方
to the lands indicated on the map.

193
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:46,100
科西莫把它藏了起来 只有你能解开谜 找到它
Cosimo hid it in a way that only you would solve his riddle.

194
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,700
又要像以前一样 用你的游戏来玩弄我吗
As ever, you know the right games to tantalize me.

195
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,660
你必须带着星盘上驳船
You must carry the astrolabe onto that barge.

196
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,430
关乎你母亲命运的叶之书 
The Book of Leaves, of your mother's fate,

197
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,760
仍是一个谜
will remain a mystery.

198
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,900
这不该是你旋转硬币
Isn't this the moment where you spin a coin,

199
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,160
来迷惑我的时候了吗?
put me into a trance?

200
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,060
没有硬币
No coins.

201
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,700
没有迷惑
No trances.

202
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,960
要么选西部走廊 要么不选
You either book passage West or you don't.

203
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,860
要么成功 要么失败
You succeed or you fail.

204
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:37,300
决定由你来做 后果由你来承担
The choice and the consequences are yours.

205
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,930
- 别紧张 孩子  - 我快病了
- Be still, child.  - I'm going to be sick.

206
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,430
你已经病了 没病谁也不会找我
You're already sick. No-one calls for me if they're well.

207
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,800
给 夹紧
Here. Hold this.

208
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,660
你没从坟上跨过吧?
You've not stepped over a grave, have you?

209
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,660
没喝本来要倒掉的牛奶吧?
Or drunk milk that's gone to spoil?

210
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,860
没 奥塔维亚 没干过那样的事
No, Ottavia. Nothing like that.

211
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,800
给 尿进去
Here. Piss into this.

212
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,200
上周我见到一个屠夫的女儿 因类似的病症而哭闹
I saw a butcher's daughter last week, blubbering on about a malady akin to this.

213
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:12,330
不得不把她剖开 里边全是虫子
Had to split her open. Worms.

214
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,530
天啊 这么浑浊
Oh. Cloudy as a winter's dawn.

215
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,600
很严重吗?
Is that bad?

216
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,100
每两天吃一小撮这个
A pinch or two of this every two days,

217
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,060
还有 别见月光了
and be sure to stay out of the light of the moon.

218
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:35,999
- 不是为了你 是为了他  - 为谁?
- Not for your sack, but for his.  - For whom?

219
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:40,999
你儿子 你也知道虫子跑哪去了 你怀孕了
Your son, you know where the worms go, you're with child.

220
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,860
带我去见他
Bring me to him.

221
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:57,430
不管你带来了什么噩耗 克拉丽丝都不会看到
I've sent Clarice away to spare her whatever tragedy you may have brought here.

222
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,600
别再拖延了 给我看看
Delay no more. Show me.

223
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:09,160
我的属下博蒂诺 被发现死在去锡耶纳的路上
My Officer Bertino. Found on the road to Siena.

224
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:12,900
被砍死的 是强盗干的吗?
Hacked to death. Bandits?

225
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,800
很有可能 不过没找到朱利亚诺的踪迹
Most likely. Yet we found no trace of Giuliano.

226
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,930
多带些人去 找到他 活要见人 死要见尸
Take more men. Find him, alive or dead.

227
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,530
我一定要知道弟弟的命运
I must know my brother's fate.

228
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,660
我这是在哪儿?
Where am I?

229
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,230
先生 你在埃尔萨谷口
In the Val d'Elsa, Signor.

230
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,400
我们从河里救出你时 你一只半脚都踏进鬼门关了
We found you in the river, more dead than alive.

231
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,700
我给你包扎了伤口
I nursed your wounds.

232
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,100
谢谢你
I thank you for that.

233
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,760
一看衣服就知道 你是个贵人
Soon as I seen your clothes, I knew you was a nobleman.

234
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,430
可你却没抢劫我
And yet, you didn't rob me.

235
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,760
抢劫不是基督徒的作风
Wouldn't be Christian.

236
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,360
今天周几? 我昏迷了多久?
What day is it? How long have I been out?

237
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
先生 今天是圣周六
Holy Saturday, Signor.

238
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,860
是基督尸体入坟的日子
When they laid Christ's body in the tomb.

239
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,500
啊呀!
Argh!

240
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,200
我得回佛罗伦萨去
I have to get back to Florence.

241
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,230
我要去提醒洛伦佐
I need to warn Lorenzo.

242
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,200
你需要休息 小伙子
You need to rest, son.

243
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,900
我不能休息
I can't.

244
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,600
没时间了
No time.

245
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,760
呵 死人还能走路
Hm. The dead still walk.

246
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:40,130
我以为你早死了
I assumed you had to be dead.

247
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,500
有人说你去了瓦拉吉亚 还有人说你去了罗马
Some said you traveled to Wallachia, others to Rome.

248
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,460
- 你去了哪里?  - 都去了
- Which was it?  - Both.

249
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,800
啊 都去了
Ah. Both.

250
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:54,130
那为何要在此相见?
So why are we meeting here? Hm?

251
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,230
你这次又想让我卷进什么阴谋?
What intrigue are you involving me in this time?

252
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,760
这是你为科西莫设计的坟墓吧?
This tomb, you designed it for Cosimo?

253
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,200
可以这么说
To an extent.

254
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,800
这座坟墓会不会
Like Cosimo's portrait,

255
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,760
像科西莫的画一样 隐含着什么秘密呢?
is it possible this tomb contains secret mysteries?

256
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,330
瞧瞧这些马赛克 这些圈圈
This mosaic, see how the circles

257
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,600
在整个设计中的编制样式
weave through the design.

258
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:22,000
后退 只看这东西
Step back and focus only on that.

259
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,230
所罗门王的结
King Solomon's Knot.

260
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,860
代表着永恒智慧的古老符号
The ancient symbol representing the wisdom of eternity.

261
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,300
没错
Yes.

262
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,530
众生均为凡事所扰
Other men live among the trappis of this world.

263
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,230
独独科西莫的思想
But Cosimo's face was always turned beyond

264
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,530
不被世俗所动
worldly distractions

265
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,960
而只关注世俗之上的宇宙
to the universe above.

266
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,800
他思维敏捷 世所罕见...
He had the most agile mind I've ever known...

267
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,600
你与他不相上下
until I met you.

268
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,130
过奖了
You honor me.

269
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,160
对我来说 你是最接近父亲这个称谓的人了
You're the closest thing I've ever known to a father.

270
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,360
我即将再次离开你
I'm about to leave you again.

271
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,530
这一次是可能回不来的追寻之旅
This time, on a quest from which I may never return.

272
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,830
你所回答的每一个问题 都会牵出另外的问题
Every question you answer leads to another question.

273
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:42,900
这样的追寻 得到的只有痛苦
And such quests lead many to nothing but misery.

274
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,260
真正的痛苦
The true misery

275
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,260
是所有的问题都被解决了
is if all the questions are solved,

276
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,030
那时候就再也没什么可问的了
cos then there's nothing left to ask.

277
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,160
- 你如今想到哪里去?  - 这要看我在这儿的发现
- Where do you voyage now?  - It depends on what I find here.

278
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,130
我不会不辞而别
I designed no secret compartment.

279
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,300
啊! 但是...
Ah! But...

280
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,160
但是魔术师
but the Magician

281
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,330
可以神不知鬼不觉地实施
could install one without anyone knowing.

282
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,830
就像瑕疵一样
Like a flaw.

283
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,400
科西莫不会这么做的
Cosimo would never have permitted it.

284
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,830
而且...
And yet...

285
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,930
瞧 快看! 看到没?
Look. Look! Do you see?

286
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:28,260
这和所罗门王的结里的半圆
It's exactly the same as the semi-circles

287
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,930
完全一模一样
in King Solomon's Knot.

288
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,400
而科斯莫的关注点
And Cosimo's gaze reflected

289
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,130
也反映在天秤座上
on Libra,

290
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,060
即平衡的天秤上
the scales of balance.

291
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,260
或许有相应的偏差?
Perhaps there's a matching discrepancy?

292
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,800
这儿 看到没? 那儿 看吧
Here. Do you see? There. Look.

293
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,700
它们是不是构成了一条轴线?
Do they form an axis?

294
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:53,060
这样的话 必定会有另外一条轴线与之相交
Well, if so, then there must be another axis that crosses it.

295
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,500
没错
Exactly.

296
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,500
从这里开始
Starting here.

297
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,760
那它的交点应该在...
Then its mate would be...

298
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,030
这儿 快看
Here. Look.

299
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,700
结的中心
The center of the knot

300
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,430
应该会...
would be...

301
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,260
在心脏的正上方
directly above the heart.

302
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,760
这个问题解决了
The question answered.

303
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,360
也就又有了问题
Which leads to another question.

304
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,930
没错
Yes.

305
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,060
确实如此
Magnificently so.

306
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,460
先生!
Signor!

307
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,600
美第奇阁下 你去了哪里?
Signor Medici, where have you been?

308
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,330
你出什么事了?
What's befallen you?

309
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:33,000
背叛 队长 能借一步说话吗?
Treachery. A moment alone, Captain?

310
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,530
博蒂诺和我确认了卢克蕾齐娅・多纳蒂是间谍
Bertino and I determined Lucrezia Donati to be a spy.

311
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,360
你不是认真的吧
You cannot mean it.

312
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,160
我们在锡耶纳找到了她 正好碰见一队强盗袭击她
We sought her out in Siena, and came across her being attacked by bandits.

313
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,200
我们击退了强盗 但是博蒂诺却牺牲了
We dispatched them but at the cost of Bertino's life.

314
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,860
卢克蕾齐娅捅了我
Lucrezia stabbed me.

315
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,800
以为我死了
Left me for dead.

316
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,800
她是瑞阿里奥和西斯笃教皇的间谍
She is an agent of Riario and Pope Sixtus.

317
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,660
卡波尔蒂! 骑马跟布莱克・马丁先走 告诉洛伦佐 朱利亚诺还活着
Capaldi! Ride with Black Martin. Tell Lorenzo Giuliano lives.

318
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:11,200
我会根据他的伤势跟上你们的 走 快走!
I will escort him home at a pace his wounds allow. Go. Go!

319
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,230
谢谢你 队长 考虑得真周到
Thank you, Captain, for your consideration.

320
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,660
这不算什么
It is nothing.

321
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,230
总得有人来关照你
Someone needs to tend to you.

322
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,830
我们有过合约
We had a contract.

323
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,100
你违反它 我就有权
You break it and I will be justified

324
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,230
剥夺你的自由
in depriving you of your freedom.

325
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,500
那上次那个把我
And what happened to the last man

326
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,300
关进佛罗伦萨监狱的人怎么样了?
who tried to pen me up in Florence?

327
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,160
你会发现比起那个倒霉的法官
You'll find me more of a match to you

328
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,600
我更配做你的对手
than that hapless magistrate.

329
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,230
的确
I would.

330
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,430
赠你一片封地如何?
What about a small duchy of your own?

331
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,700
这样你就可以自由地学习
That would give you the freedom to amass

332
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,730
你想学习的知识了
all the knowledge you like.

333
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,730
你手边的领地多到
And you have duchies sitting around

334
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,730
可以随便分发了吗?
to hand out like party favors?

335
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,760
乌尔比诺公爵和我已经同盟对抗教皇
The Duke of Urbino and I made an alliance to move on the Papacy.

336
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,760
我们很快就会有能力
That will give us the ability to give you

337
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,700
给你从来没有过的赏赐
the legitimacy you have never had.

338
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,130
我恐怕你的同盟已经胎死腹中
I suspect your alliance is dead.

339
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,230
我在梵蒂冈亲眼看到了乌尔比诺公爵
At the Vatican I saw the Duke of Urbino himself.

340
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,530
他可不是容易忽视的人 他在那相当自在
One can't miss the man. He looked quite at home.

341
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,160
你离我而去以后 还来告诉我 我唯一
So as you desert me, you bring me word that

342
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,560
能依赖的军事防御力量
my only other source of military defense

343
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,630
已经不能指望了?
is a sham?

344
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,900
你找上他也是以为他能够被收买 不是吗?
You approached him because you knew he had a price, yes?

345
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,600
有人出价比你高
Someone outbid you.

346
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,260
胡说
Fuck you.

347
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,360
总有艺术家找上我
Artists approach me all the time.

348
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,100
满脑子模糊又堂皇的想法
They are full of vague and glorious ideas

349
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,630
可他们从来没实现过
on which they rarely deliver.

350
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,460
这就是个例子
Case in point.

351
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,330
有人警告过你
You were warned.

352
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,700
有人在这间屋子里就警告过你
You were warned in this very room.

353
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,630
我收了很多酬金却完成了很少的任务
I accept many commissions, I finish few.

354
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,830
我给了你成为最风光的艺术家的机会
I gave you the chance to be the foremost artist of your day.

355
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,130
我把佛罗伦萨最有魅力的女人给你做模特
I gave you the most desirable woman in Florence as a subject.

356
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,030
她从来都不是我的模特
She was never my subject.

357
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,900
你我都爱这座城市 不是吗?
You and I love this city, do we not?

358
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,160
没错
We do.

359
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,400
那就帮我拯救她
Then help me save it.

360
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,700
我还能给你什么?
What else can I give you?

361
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,830
她怎么样?
What about her?

362
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:54,930
她的丈夫显然不是个问题
Her husband's clearly not an obstacle.

363
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:59,330
你认为我会这么轻易地就把她让给你?
You think I would just toss her to you just like that?

364
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,230
你已经有个妻子了
You have a wife.

365
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,700
同样美丽 同样需要你的关心
Who has her charms. Who needs attention.

366
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:12,200
卢克蕾齐娅对你来说有多重要 洛伦佐?
How much does Lucrezia mean to you, Lorenzo?

367
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,560
你愿意为了把我留在佛罗伦萨
Are you willing to set aside your toy

368
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,860
而放弃你的玩偶吗?
to keep me in Florence?

369
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,960
大人 您的弟弟已经被找到了
Magnifico, your brother has been found.

370
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,700
朱利亚诺还活着
Giuliano is alive.

371
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,030
受伤了 但还活着
Wounded but alive.

372
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,830
谁弄伤了他?
Who wounded him?

373
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,100
卢克蕾齐娅・多纳蒂
Lucrezia Donati.

374
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,560
- 那她也活着?  - 似乎是的
- And she is also alive? - It appears so.

375
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,730
她为什么要攻击朱利亚诺?
What was she doing attacking Giuliano?

376
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,760
她知道你的计划了吗?
Did she know of your plans?

377
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,100
朱利亚诺手无寸铁 德拉戈纳迪在照顾他
Giuliano is unarmed and  in the care of Dragonetti.

378
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,730
他不会活着回到佛罗伦萨了
He won't live to see Florence again.

379
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,600
但如果有人知道朱利亚诺被杀了
But if people learn Giuliano has been killed,

380
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,200
洛伦佐会得到人民的支持
Lorenzo will rally the people behind him.

381
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:30,330
我们必须先拿下洛伦佐
We must strike at Lorenzo first.

382
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,930
复活节弥撒
Easter Mass.

383
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,360
明天黎明我们在洛伦佐的圣餐里动手脚
Dawn tomorrow we will poison Lorenzo in the very act

384
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,200
毒死他
of taking holy communion,

385
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,300
让奥尔西尼唯唯诺诺的虔诚见鬼去
and damn Cardinal Orsini's pious hesitations.

386
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:49,960
就像上帝亲自下手夺走独裁者的性命
It will look as if God himself has taken down the tyrant.

387
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,730
- 你叫什么名字?  - 卡波尔蒂
- What is your name?  - Capaldi.

388
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,160
去找巴尼奥内神父和马菲神父
Find Father Bagnone and Father Maffei.

389
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,630
让他们准备好给洛伦佐的圣饼
Have them prepare the Host for Lorenzo,

390
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,800
还有他妻子的
and his wife,

391
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,130
以及他所有女儿的
and all his daughters.

392
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:08,960
然后骑马去找德拉戈纳迪 确保朱利亚诺必死无疑
Then ride back to Dragonetti and make sure that Giuliano has met his death.

393
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,330
必不辱命 大人
Consider it done, my lord.

394
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,400
几小时之后... 佛罗伦萨就是我们的了
Within hours... we will own Florence.

395
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,960
但是为什么卢克蕾齐娅会让罗马利用?
But why would Lucrezia agree to act as Rome's catspaw?

396
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,860
西斯笃任人唯亲
Sixtus only rewards his own blood.

397
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,430
你知道他已经把他的六个侄子任命为红衣大主教了吗?
Did you know he's already rewarded six of his nephews as cardinals?

398
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,800
- 他很衷心  - 到了乱伦的地步
- He is loyal.  - To the point of incestuousness.

399
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,500
佛罗伦萨的美德在于
The virtue of a republic like Florence

400
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,330
能者才能居之
is that offices go to the most worthy,

401
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,760
能者才能上任
appointments are made only on merit.

402
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:48,400
我敢说你的职位是你通过努力取得的 德拉戈纳迪 对吧?
I dare say you earned your rank on the basis of achievement, Dragonetti?

403
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,300
的确
I did.

404
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,560
而你不止一次地证明了自己
And you demonstrate that repeatedly.

405
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,530
多亏了你违反宵禁的名单
The details in your curfew ledgers

406
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,230
没有它们 博蒂诺和我永远不会发现
without them, Bertino and I could never have uncovered

407
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,530
背叛洛伦佐的人
the name of Lorenzo's betrayer.

408
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,500
其实只需要花时间研究记录
All one needed was the time to study the records.

409
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:13,700
当然 你就有这个时间
And you had the time, of course.

410
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,230
我确实很认真地对待我的工作
I do take my work seriously.

411
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:28,260
所以她在宵禁后躲过了检查 对吧?
That's how she was able to avoid detection after curfew, isn't it?

412
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,230
她不在场理由很充分 忙着和我哥哥偷情
She had the perfect alibi, fucking my brother,

413
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,300
而第一个会怀疑她动向的人
and because the first man to raise questions about her activities

414
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,030
早就站到罗马那边了
was already in league with Rome himself.

415
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,500
我逃跑也没用
I could try and ride away.

416
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,400
你毫发未伤 马也更加健壮 
But you're unwounded, your mount is fresher.

417
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,760
那就杀了我吧
Finish what your spy began, then.

418
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,260
或许她会跟你上床
Perhaps she'll reward you between her legs.

419
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,730
- 我想要的不是这个  - 那是什么?
- That is not what spurs me.  - What does?

420
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,260
渴望一个敬畏上帝的佛罗伦萨
A desire for a Florence that fears God,

421
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,930
而不是害怕主人的
not its masters.

422
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,360
我们去找你哥哥
Let's get to your brother's side.

423
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,800
诺里的船 开往比萨的吗?
De Noli's barge, bound for Pisa?

424
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,430
是的 先生
Aye, Signor.

425
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,730
订三个位置多少钱?
How much to book passage for three?

426
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,260
我们只运货物和行李
We take only freight and baggage.

427
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:38,560
告诉你了 只运货物和行李
I told you, only freight and baggage.

428
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,330
我必须登上王冠蜥蜴号
I have to board the Basilisk.

429
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,430
恩 这下看起来像行李了
Yeah, you're beginning to look like baggage.

430
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,900
明早黎明 别迟到
Dawn tomorrow. Don't be late.

431
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,260
每个队都在其中一个门附近
Each of my brigades awaits near one of these gates.

432
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:02,430
可以说佛罗伦萨已经在我们的掌控之下了
You may consider Florence already under our control.

433
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:09,030
- 你的人忠诚吗?  - 当然
- Your men are loyal to you?  - But of course.

434
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:12,330
如果他们军粮不足提前入侵的话
Because if they get battle-hungry and invade prematurely,

435
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,560
佛罗伦萨人会奋起反抗的
the Florentines will rise against them.

436
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,360
佛罗伦萨人只是店主和店员
The Florentines are shopkeepers and clerks.

437
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:19,730
我们是士兵
We're soldiers.

438
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,630
佛罗伦萨人住在狭窄的走廊和小巷中
The Florentines live in narrow corridors and alleyways

439
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,200
他们可以出其不意地攻击
where they can strike unexpectedly.

440
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:28,200
如果他们为保卫家园而奋起
If they rise to fight for their home,

441
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,860
将会有一场你从未见过的战斗
it will not resemble the fields of battle you know.

442
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:36,230
我们有新武器打街头战
We have new weapons for street warfare.

443
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,730
你要听我们指挥
You will follow our lead.

444
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,700
帕吉家族在此间的角色是推翻暴君
The Pazzis' role in all this is to overthrow the tyrants,

445
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,800
建立一个全新的王国
establish a clear new regime.

446
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:47,360
而你的角色只是被传唤的时候出现一下
While your role is only to appear if summoned

447
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:50,160
巩固即将成立的政权的地位
to cement the powers-that-will-be into place.

448
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,130
如果我选择单独进入佛罗伦萨...
If I choose to move on Florence myself...

449
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,360
你又凭什么阻拦我?
who are you to stop me?

450
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,860
告诉我 是谁养你的队伍的?
Tell me, who is it that pays your men?

451
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,500
你高高在上 给他们发军资
You sit in the middle, conveying their wages

452
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,760
用的可是罗马的钱
which issue from the vaults of Rome.

453
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,660
违背我
Act against me,

454
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:16,230
罗马会给你打上异教徒的烙印
and that same city shall brand you a heretic,

455
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,330
剥脱你的头衔 把你逐出教会
strip you of your titles, and excommunicate you.

456
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,460
继续反抗 大主教
Resist further, and His Holiness

457
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,860
会把你的金属眼罩熔化
will have that metal eyepiece of yours melted down

458
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,560
在纳沃纳广场浇到你的睾丸上
and poured over your testicles in the middle of the Piazza Navona.

459
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:34,600
我见识过他的能力... 是双眼所见
I've seen what he's capable of with... both of my eyes.

460
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,230
你的人回来了
Your man returns.

461
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,230
或许有我哥哥的消息
Perhaps with news from my brother.

462
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,800
他不是从大人那儿来的...
He comes not from Il Magnifico...

463
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,730
而是从瑞阿里奥伯爵那儿...
but from Count Riario...

464
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,830
确认我已经杀了你
to confirm I've killed you.

465
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,330
那他干嘛不带着我还活着的消息离开?
Why is he not riding away with news I'm still alive?

466
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,960
我想他另有打算
I think he has another plan.

467
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,160
停下
Hold.

468
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,530
- 你要做什么?  - 做对佛罗伦萨最好的事
- What are you doing?  - What's best for Florence.

469
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,330
啊!
Aargh! 

470
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,430
捡起他的剑
Pick up his sword.

471
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,100
要救你哥哥 你需要武器
You'll need a weapon if you're going to save your brother.

472
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,960
快 朱利亚诺 趁我没改变主意
Do it now, Giuliano. Before I change my mind again.

473
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,300
是我
It's me.

474
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,560
你以为我听不出你的脚步声?
You think I don't know your footsteps?

475
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,560
给我个理由...
Give me a reason...

476
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,460
我为什么不现在就刺穿你的脖子
why I shouldn't puncture your neck this instant.

477
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,660
今天不行
Not today.

478
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,930
你给瓦妮莎下毒 我为救她差点变痴呆
You poisoned Vanessa and I risked dementia trying to save her.

479
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,260
你告诉了瑞阿里奥战争机器的秘密
You shared the secrets of my war machinery with Riario

480
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,430
让这座城市陷入危机
and put the city at peril.

481
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,600
这个... 这封揭发信
This... this denunciation

482
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,830
指控我性侵
that names me a sexual criminal,

483
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,160
把我投进监狱 等待火刑
had me thrown in jail to face the bonfire.

484
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,330
都是你干的好事!
This is your work!

485
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:55,460
是我让尼科把你带到修道院救你朋友的命
I had Nico send you to the convent to keep your friend alive.

486
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,130
审判时我为你求情
I begged for your mercy during the trial

487
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,900
树下了想取我性命的敌人
and made enemies who seek my life.

488
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:03,430
你不知道我冒了多大的险...
You will never understand the risks I have taken...

489
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:07,000
- 让你父亲活命  - 什么?
- To keep your father alive.  - What?

490
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:10,860
我知道 我知道
I know. I know.

491
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:14,460
他希望我告诉你他有多爱你
He wishes me to tell you how much he loves you.

492
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,960
我在圣天使堡的监狱里和他谈过了
I spoke with him in his cell in Castel Sant'angelo.

493
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,400
然后你利用了他们对我的控制
Then you grasp the hold they have maintained over me.

494
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,060
这种控制太强大了...
It's a hold so strong...

495
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:33,200
让你对一个无辜的人下毒
that you would even poison an innocent man.

496
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,730
你为找你母亲又冒了多大的险呢?
And what of the risks you have faced in search of your mother?

497
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,200
哈?
Huh?

498
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,700
如果是你能决定她的生死
If it fell to you to keep her alive,

499
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,300
你会说"不 我宁可救另一个人的命"吗?
would you say "No, I'll preserve another's life"?

500
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,830
我会找到别的办法
I would find another way.

501
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,930
是啊 你说起来可真是轻松
Yeah, how easy it is for you to believe that.

502
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,660
我会理解你的行为 卢克蕾齐娅...
I would understand your actions, Lucrezia...

503
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,200
若不是你父亲拒绝了让他自由的机会
if your father hadn't rejected my offer to set him free.

504
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,660
- 你在撒谎  - 没有
- You're lying.  - No.

505
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:07,000
你犯的这些罪都是徒劳
You've committed these sins for nothing.

506
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,060
你的作品都想证明人是否无所不能
Your work argues that man is capable of anything.

507
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,560
你我就是证明
Well, between us, we prove it.

508
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:33,130
你展现了人类伟大的极限 而我是丑恶的极限
You show us the heights that we can reach and I show us the depths.

509
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,100
最近...
Of late...

510
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,000
我遇见了身居黑暗中的智者
I've met men who dwell in shadows,

511
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,560
他们对我提起... 另一个世界
speaking of... other times and other lives.

512
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:16,030
或许... 如果他们所说是真的...
Maybe... if they're correct...

513
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,500
有另一个世界存在于我们...
a life exists in which we...

514
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,900
是 是的
Yes. Yes.

515
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,360
是
Yes.

516
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,000
不行 我不能这样 我不能
No, I can't do this. I can't.

517
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,230
- 求求你 求求你  - 我不能 不能
- Please. Please.  - I can't. I can't.

518
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,800
我必须走了 我必须...
I have to go. I have to...

519
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,200
停在比萨的一条船将载我寻找叶之书
A ship waits in Pisa to take me to the Book of Leaves.

520
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,460
要是我没有登上王冠蜥蜴号...
If I'm not on the Basilisk...

521
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,200
瑞阿里奥和帕吉的军队已经逼近佛罗伦萨
Riario and the Pazzis are moving on Florence.

522
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,700
- 他们想杀洛伦佐  - 我不必在乎他们
- They want to kill Lorenzo.  - I could care less, what they do.

523
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,330
让政客们互相残杀吧 那是他们的专长
Let the politicians kill each other, that's their forte.

524
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:58,230
莱昂纳多 求求你 如今只有你能阻止这一切
Leonardo, please, you are only one who can stop this now.

525
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,060
要是你不愿为我和洛伦佐
If you're not going to do it for me or for Lorenzo,

526
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,230
请为佛罗伦萨阻止他们
then do it for Florence.

527
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,660
为佛罗伦萨?
For Florence?

528
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,830
为佛罗伦萨? 这座背叛我的城市?
For Florence? The city that turned its back on me?

529
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,030
我这个私生子?
The bastard son?

530
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,860
我这个鸡奸犯?
The sodomite?

531
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,800
从前的达芬奇可能会听你话 卢克蕾齐娅
A younger Da Vinci might've bought your arguments, Lucrezia.

532
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,360
但是... 几个月来我忍受的太多了
But... I've endured too much these last few months

533
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,400
我不再被情绪左右
to be swayed by sentiment.

534
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,130
现在是复活节
It's Easter.

535
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:38,100
如果佛罗伦萨需要祭品...
If Florence demands a sacrifice...

536
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,600
我建议你献上自己
I suggest you offer yourself.

537
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:33,530
你还在用那烟臭味污染空气呢
You still endeavor to taint the air with that foul stench, I see.

538
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,600
我的恶习
A vice.

539
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,600
但吉罗拉摩允许我抽烟
One that Girolamo sees fit to allow me.

540
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,000
你不只有一个恶习
Not the only one.

541
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,560
我不明白你为何对这游戏如此着迷
I've never understood your obsession with this game.

542
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,930
我想象你玩了几千遍
I imagine you've played thousands of times,

543
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,860
它能带你给什么?
and what has it brought you?

544
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,260
帮你知己
Know thy self,

545
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,960
帮你知彼
know thine enemy.

546
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,300
这不过是休闲游戏
It is but a recreation.

547
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,760
真正的谋略
True strategic mastery

548
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,460
只能在生活的竞技场上锻造
must be forged in the arena of life.

549
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,800
- 复活节快乐  - 的确快乐
- Happy Easter.  - Indeed.

550
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:16,060
因为今天不止基督复活...
For today brings not only the resurrection of Christ...

551
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:20,800
佛罗伦萨也将在罗马的统治下复兴
but the resurrection of Florence under Rome's rule.

552
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:25,760
很快 意大利诸国将会统一
Soon, all the Italian states will fall into line.

553
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,860
然后我将把转移注意力转移到
I will then turn my attention

554
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:31,330
上帝的真正敌人上...
to the true enemy of God...

555
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,700
奥斯曼帝国
the Ottoman Empire.

556
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,860
最后发动一场圣战
A final Holy War.

557
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,330
辉煌的胜利将使我被誉为...
A glorious victory for which I will be made...

558
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,160
一位圣者
a saint.

559
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,130
你一定要记得在人民面前
Beware of practicing your righteousness

560
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:51,160
表现自己的正直
before other people in order to be seen by them,

561
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:55,230
因为人民不会从你的上帝那里...
for then there will be no reward from your Father...

562
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,000
得到任何好处
who is in heaven.

563
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,130
我必须感谢你
I must thank you.

564
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,360
因为没有你 我不会有今天的成就
For without you, I could never have achieved today's triumph.

565
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,560
这样说 或许你应该给我...
And for this, perhaps you would offer me...

566
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,300
一点回报?
something in return?

567
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,760
嗯
Hmm.

568
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:23,230
现在是时候 你和我...
I believe it's time you and I...

569
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,360
再下一局了
played another game.

570
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:35,330
同意吧... 兄弟?
Don't you agree... Brother?

571
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,300
都准备好了?
Is all in place?

572
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,430
巴尼奥内和马菲神父正在准备毒药
Fathers Bagnone and Maffei are preparing the poison.

573
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,830
那大主教呢?
And the Cardinal?

574
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,660
他太他妈虔诚了 我没敢告诉他计划有变
He's too fucking pious to be told of this change of plans.

575
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:07,600
祈祷时 神父会把圣餐捧给洛伦佐
While he prays, the priests will deliver the tainted Eucharist to Lorenzo.

576
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:11,360
这人是夸特罗内 美蒂奇的忠诚支持者
Quattrone. Medici loyalist.

577
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,000
要是和我们作起对
If he goes against us,

578
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,030
他变成鬼也会支持洛伦佐
he'll join Lorenzo in the afterlife.

579
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,800
有达芬奇的消息吗?
Is there any news of Da Vinci?

580
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:25,160
上次我收到消息时 他还在罗马
The last I heard, he was in Rome.

581
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,830
他每次和咱们作对!
He's countered us again and again!

582
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:31,360
我们不知他的下落 还可以行动吗?
Can we act if we don't know the man's whereabouts?

583
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,600
镇定点 弗朗切斯科
Calm yourself, Francesco.

584
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,230
我们准备周全 一切待命
We have long prepared. All is ready.

585
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,960
女士 你让我这个老头...
Signorina, you make an old man...

586
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,030
也相信人看起来可以如此完美
believe in the perfectibility of mankind.

587
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,900
谢谢你 大师
Thank you, Maestro.

588
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,900
你怎么了 瓦妮莎?
What troubles you, Vanessa?

589
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,900
你看见朱利亚诺・美第奇了吗?
Have you seen Giuliano de Medici?

590
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,900
我要见他 我有话和他说
I must speak to him. He needs to hear this.

591
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,930
快点 别让大主教看见
Quickly, before the Cardinal sees.

592
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,860
确保这些圣饼送到美蒂奇家族那边
Ensure that these wafers go to the Medicis,

593
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,460
别出差错
and only the Medicis.

594
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,830
然后我们就能真正庆祝弥撒了
And then we can truly celebrate this mass.

595
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:20,330
复活节快乐 洛伦佐
Happy Easter, Lorenzo.

596
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,800
你也是 弗朗切斯科
And to you, Francesco.

597
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:28,960
朱利亚诺在哪?
Where is Giuliano?

598
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,360
我相信德拉戈纳迪会带他来的
I'm sure Dragonetti will bring him straight here.

599
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
我今天心里没底
I'm sure of nothing today.

600
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:45,800
上帝啊 莱昂 你昨夜到底去哪了?
God's trousers, Leo. Where the fuck have you been all night?

601
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,900
道别时纠缠了一下
Only haunted by a final farewell.

602
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,830
船装好货后 船长急着离岸
The barge is loaded and the captain's keen to depart.

603
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:57,100
那货威胁说再等的话 就把票价翻倍
Impatient canker blossom threatened to double the fee if he waited any longer.

604
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:07,130
好吧... 那咱省点钱
Well... then let's save some coin

605
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:09,430
赶快上船吧
and be on our way.

606
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:12,230
这是什么?
What's this?

607
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:16,130
我们用这占卜你到底是去哪里了
This is us asking the Fates where the fuck you've been.

608
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:20,460
战车 逆位的?
The Chariot. Reversed?

609
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,200
不受控制的激情 导致失败
Uncontrolled passion, leading to defeat.

610
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,700
我说该走了 走吧
Time to leave, I'd say. Come on.

611
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,400
太安静了
It's so quiet.

612
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,800
钟不响了
The bells have stopped.

613
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,700
弥撒开始了
Mass has begun.

614
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,100
该死
Fuck.

615
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,700
有件事我必须去做
There's something I must do.

616
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,730
- 没时间了  - 驳船不会等你的 你想清楚了
- There's no time.  - The barge won't wait. Make a decision.

617
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:38,800
叶之书还是女人 不可兼得啊
The Book Of Leaves or whoever tears you away. You can't have both.

618
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:43,730
我可以 我可以的 只要你们能想办法让船等我回来
I can. I can, if you just find a way to keep them here until I return.

619
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,800
我很快就回来 想想办法 琐罗
I'm not gonna be long. Just stall them, Zo.

620
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,060
求你了!
Please!

621
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:54,500
这就是那张牌的另一个意思
There's another meaning to that card.

622
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,400
被阻挡的旅途
A journey thwarted.

623
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:02,760
以圣父 圣子 圣灵之名
In nominee Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

624
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,360
- 阿门  - 阿门
- Amen.  - Amen.

625
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,560
你惧怕上帝吗 女士?
Do you fear God, Signora?

626
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,330
聪明的人... 对上帝应怀爱与惧之心
The wise... both fear and love God.

627
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,600
那你为什么犹豫不敢进入他的圣殿?
Why then do you hesitate to enter His house?

628
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,760
因为在门后等着我的并不是上帝
Because it isn't God who waits for me inside those doors.

629
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,330
聆听子民的祈祷 赐予他们想要的圣体
tui, cum oblationibus hostiarum:

630
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,900
如你在逾越节所作的
ut paschalibus initiata mysteriis,

631
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,200
您的赠与 
ad aeternitatis  nobis medelam,

632
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,830
将带给我们救赎
te operante, proficiant.

633
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:41,200
借圣子耶稣之体
Per Dominum.

634
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:43,430
有人骑马接近
Riders approach.

635
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:46,060
两匹
Two.

636
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,360
厄运将降临在这座城市
Hell is descending upon this city.

637
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,360
快 找个安全地方躲起来
Get yourself to safety. Now.

638
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,730
你怎么了?
What has happened to you?

639
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,160
上帝不允许暴力
God will permit no violence.

640
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,360
你不能打断弥撒!
You cannot disrupt a sacred Mass!

641
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:04,700
- 放下武器!  - 很抱歉 我不能
- Sheathe your weapon!  - I'm sorry, but I cannot.

642
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:08,460
立即停止你的行为 这里是教堂
Cease your intrusion. This is a House of God.

643
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:12,400
上帝爱真相 让他说
And God loves truth. Let him speak.

644
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,600
帕吉家族密谋对付我们 我的家族!
The Pazzis conspire against us, my family!

645
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:19,860
他们与罗马结盟 他们背叛了佛罗伦萨!
They're in league with Rome and betray all Florence!

646
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,900
以人民和自由的名义! 消灭美第奇家族!
People and Liberty! Death to the Medicis!

647
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,000
快走 带女儿们去安全的地方
Go. Take our daughters to safety.

648
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:38,430
他们在大门口布置了人 找条路逃出去 快!
They'll have men at the doors. Find a way out. Go!

649
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,360
- 朱利亚诺!  - 洛伦佐啊!
- Giuliano!  - Lorenzo!

650
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,000
朝门那边跑
Towards the door.

651
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:59,430
你背叛了我们的事业 队长
You betray our cause, Captain.

652
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,700
你们的事业背叛了佛罗伦萨
Your cause betrays Florence.

653
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:12,230
快跑吧 女士! 这里面刀剑交加啊!
Flee, my lady! It is a chaos of swords in there!

654
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,660
杀光他们!
Kill them!

655
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,330
哥哥! 哥哥! 帮帮你的亲人!
Brother! Brother! Help your family!

656
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,900
罗马才是我的亲人
Rome is my family.

657
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,730
请原谅
Forgive me.

658
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,830
- 啊!  - 朱利亚诺!
- Aaargh!  - Giuliano!

659
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:50,560
死吧 美第奇渣滓!
Die, Medici scum!

660
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,560
他妻子和孩子 快 追!
The wife and children. Go, go!

661
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,560
朱利亚诺! 不!
Oh, Giuliano! Oh, no! No!

662
00:51:58,130 --> 00:51:59,530
不!
No!

663
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,460
快跑!
Come on!

664
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,930
啊!
Aaargh!

665
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,730
克拉丽丝... 快!
Clarice... please!

666
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:25,930
快来
Come on.

667
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:32,460
我... 我要死了 瓦妮莎
I'm... I'm dying, Vanessa.

668
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:36,860
我将延续你的血脉
Your line will live on. In me.

669
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:42,660
我怀了你的孩子 你的儿子 朱利亚诺
I'm bearing your child, your son, Giuliano.

670
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:51,930
瓦妮莎 太晚了 瓦妮莎 快走吧
Vanessa, it's too late. Vanessa, leave him.

671
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,400
别管他了! 瓦妮莎!
Leave him! Vanessa!

672
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,400
- 不! 不!  - 快走吧
- No! No!  - Yes. Come on.

673
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:02,300
跟我来
Stay with me.

674
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,560
把剑扔掉 亲爱的表妹
Drop it, dear cousin.

675

676
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,430
你觉得我对付不了你们?

瑞阿里奥
Riario.

678
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:26,230
如果你真的忠诚于美第奇家 队长...
If your true loyalty is to the Medicis, Captain... 

679
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:30,160
我建议你带他们走 这个留给我
I suggest you take them away and leave this one to me.

680
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,460
- 但多纳蒂夫人...  - 已经背叛你们投靠罗马了
- But Signora Donati...  - Has betrayed you for Rome.

681
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:36,860
让他们狗咬狗去吧 夫人

682

不...
No...

我一直祈祷这一天的来临 今天 佛罗伦萨欢欣鼓舞
I've prayed for this day. Today, Florence rejoices.

686
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,660
你真以为会那样吗? 帕吉?
Are you certain of that, Pazzi?

687
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,400
啊!
Aaargh!

688
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:14,130
洛伦佐 临死之前
Before you die, Lorenzo,

689
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,600
让你知道 我将会杀尽佛罗伦萨所有美第奇家的人
know that I'll kill every last Medici in Florence.

690
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:20,860
我要将你家族的痕迹从世界上完全抹除!
I'll wipe all evidence of your family's existence from this world!

691
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,560
剑不用会生锈
Iron rusts from disuse.

692
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,860
让我们消灭美第奇家族 小作家
Let us finish off the Medicis, scribbler,

693
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,530
你还可以苟活
and we might let you live.

694
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:49,060
帕吉家族掌管佛罗伦萨? 绝不!
A Florence ruled by Pazzis? No!

695
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:52,360
我更愿意为此而战
No. I think I'd rather go down fighting.

696
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:53,660
遂你所愿
As you wish.

697
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:07,030
快点 快点!
Come on. Come on!

698
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:11,730
快点! 快点!
Come on! Come on!

699
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:23,060
- 那撑不了多久的  - 门能撑住
- That won't hold long.  - The doors will hold.

700
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:26,730
韦罗基奥设计的锁具
Verrocchio designed the locks.

701
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:34,130
朱利亚诺呢? 我弟弟死了吗?
Giuliano? Have I lost a brother?

702
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:40,360
给我砸! 砸开 砸开!
Come on! Come on, come on!

703
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,700
达芬奇!
Da Vinci!

704
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:45,330
我来的时候只看到你
Upon my arrival I saw only you.

705
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:52,400
- 我知道你不会不管我们的  - 别说了 省点劲吧
- I knew you wouldn't abandon us.  - Stop. Save your strength.

706
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,460
达芬奇!
Da Vinci!

707
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,100
很快就有结果啦 卢克蕾齐娅!
It'll be over soon, Lucrezia!

708

很抱歉 莱昂纳多 你救了我 我知道这对你来说...
I'm sorry, Leonardo. You've saved my life, and I know what it's cost y... 

709
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,930
嘘 把你的赞美之词留给值得的人吧
Ssh. Save your praise for someone who deserves it.

710
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:17,200
你希望他们中的哪一个为你陪葬?
I wonder which of the two men you fuck will be buried alongside you?

711
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:20,260
你放弃梦想 选择了保卫佛罗伦萨
You chose Florence over your own dreams.

712
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,260
请接受我的敬意
You will accept my love.

713
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,530
我也只能向你致敬了
It is the least I can offer you.

714
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:31,600
这戒指 我认识这戒指
This ring. I know this ring.

715
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,100
这是卢克蕾齐娅的
It's Lucrezia's.

716
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:45,860
你跟她上床了... 或者更甚?
Are you fucking her... or is it more?

717
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,630
要么你现在帮他们干掉我 否则我发誓...
You better finish the job they have begun or I swear... 

718
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:55,430
如果我们能生还 我要把你俩都杀掉
if we survive this, I'll kill you both.

719
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,760

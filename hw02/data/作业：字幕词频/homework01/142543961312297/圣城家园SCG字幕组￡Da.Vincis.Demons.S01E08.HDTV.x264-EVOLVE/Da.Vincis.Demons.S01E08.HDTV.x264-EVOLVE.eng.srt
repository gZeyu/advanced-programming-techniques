1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,830
We are known as the Sons of Mithras.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,830
Ignis fatuus, that's what this Sons of Mithras business is.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,730
If I marry Camilla Pazzi...

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,960
You and I can still snatch a little freedom here and there.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,060
Do we kill Lorenzo coming up the path?

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,560
Strike only when the brothers are together.

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,000
Lucrezia Donati?

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,530
Saddle the horses for Siena. We'll question her directly.

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,230
- And here's our final savior.  - Gentlemen.

10
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,360
What possesses you to betray Lorenzo, to betray us all?

11
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,300
- You are Lucrezia Donati's father.  - Indeed.

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,830
L'Artista, I see you escaped.

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,100
And I see a key.

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,630
Cosimo de Medici was a Son of Mithras.

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,160
A ship provisioned for a journey.

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,560
The Vault of Heaven is out there.

17
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:51,000


18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000


19
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:46,999


20
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,630


21
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,600
Allahu Akbar.

22
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,260
Allahu Akbar.

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,730
What does the future hold for the Sons of Mithras, Al-Rahim?

24
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,260
Augury is a tricky business.

25
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,860
I see grim tidings.

26
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,500
Darkness, despair.

27
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,730
The usual cant and caper, then.

28
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,530
You would make light of our circumstances, Cosimo de Medici?

29
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,700
Light is the only thing that sustains me, my friend.

30
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,730
Are there no bright spots on the horizon, then?

31
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,700
There is one, a boy from Vinci.

32
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,130
He has promise.

33
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,500
Even now, events conspire to bring him to Florence.

34
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,060
Am I to keep an eye on him?

35
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,000
Only from a distance.

36
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,000
He must ascend or fall by his own devices.

37
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,630
And speaking of devices,

38
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,760
we give you this for safe-keeping.

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,130
Someone will come for this when it is time to make the journey.

40
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,130
Perhaps, the boy Al-Rahim speaks of.

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,560
Assuming he survives his trial.

42
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,700
I have faith he will.

43
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,660
If I'm to keep the candles burning,

44
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,600
I'll need more reassurances than faith and a vague prophecy. 

45
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,060
I'm afraid I cannot give you any reassurances.

46
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,100
If the future indicated by these signs comes to pass,

47
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,560
only one of us will live to see it.

48
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,200
So which lucky one gets to survive?

49
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,930
You misunderstand.

50
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,260
The dead will be the lucky ones.

51
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,360
The one who lives to see this future...

52
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,900
he will truly suffer.

53
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,860
I'm going to miss this place.

54
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,530
And you. I'll miss you as well, my friends.

55
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,060
We've followed you into more scrapes than I care to count.

56
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,530
Why not add another to the tally?

57
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,330
I can't ask you to follow me across an ocean.

58
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,200
We want to, Maestro.

59
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,860
The Vault of Heaven, the Book of Leaves,

60
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,800
we want to be there when you find them.

61
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,430
The boy's a half-wit moon-calf

62
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,860
who'd smother his balls in ox dung if you told him to.

63
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,330
As for me? I've accrued some gambling debts

64
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,400
that make my near-term residence in Florence problematic.

65
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,530
So where to next? We'll need a ship, won't we?

66
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,530
The Portuguese are establishing

67
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,760
trade routes along Western Africa.

68
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,430
We'll book passage to the Canary Islands.

69
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,830
After that, we'll have to improvise.

70
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,330
First, I've certain accounts to settle with the House of Medici.

71
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,400
Why bother with the Medicis? Why not skirt Florence entirely?

72
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,430
There are things I have to say to Lorenzo.

73
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,530
Words for his ears alone.

74
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,760
Shall we meet at the Barking Dog this evening?

75
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,000
Why not? A pint, one last foray into a Florentine slit for luck.

76
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,900
We can see if Nico's balls have dropped.

77
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,230
That's odd.

78
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,100
That's a Lanner Falcon.

79
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,360
They're rare this side of the Adriatic.

80
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,230
Turkey, Africa, yes. But here?

81
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,300
- It lost its way. It happens.  - No, not often.

82
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,600
The last time I saw a Lanner

83
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,200
was the day my mother disappeared.

84
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,900
- You say they hail from Turkey?  - Mm.

85
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,960
I'll wager that bird's an omen, meant for you alone.

86
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,360
I should follow it.

87
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,400
I said it's an omen. If anything, you should ride in the opposite direction.

88
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,960
- I'll meet you at the Dog.  - Leo!

89
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,700
Yah!

90
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,630
I take it you now believe in visions...

91
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,400
and demons?

92
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,760
Where can be Giuliano be?

93
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,530
How badly did you handle your talk with him about this marriage?

94
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,330
He knew he had to wed the girl.

95
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,400
He agreed there was no other way

96
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,930
to halt our feud with the Pazzis,

97
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,860
yet I've not seen a trace of him for days.

98
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,230
Did you actually hear him utter the words, "I agree",

99
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,360
or did you only hear what you wanted to hear?

100
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,630
He agreed.

101
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,730
Giuliano may not arrive at all.

102
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,660
I say we strike.

103
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,730
Kill Lorenzo and Clarice while we have them here.

104
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,300
Are you so blind to the success of your rivals?

105
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,460
The brothers are popular.

106
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,430
Murdering only one will allow the survivor

107
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,700
to rally the city against us.

108
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,130
Only with the shock of losing both men at once

109
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,800
will Florence bow to new leaders.

110
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,830
You can send your men after Giuliano, wherever he is.

111
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,400
I can handle Lorenzo myself.

112
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,800
Do so and you defy the will of Rome, Francesco.

113
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,300
I warn you now.

114
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,860
Remarkable.

115
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,600
According to lore,

116
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,330
these will open the Vault of Heaven.

117
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,230
Solomon Ogbai, the Abyssinian, told you its location?

118
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,600
He told me it rested

119
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,800
on an old peak, in a town made of stone.

120
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,760
Beneath something called "the hitching post of the sun."

121
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,960
With these keys and the map to the Vault itself,

122
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,400
it would appear the Book of Leaves lies firmly within our grasp.

123
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,500
When was the last time the Book was actually seen?

124
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,000
A thousand years ago.

125
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,400
When the Library of Alexandria burned.

126
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,030
Yet we still have faith it exists.

127
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,800
Faith.

128
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,830
It always comes down to that, doesn't it?

129
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,560
Never anything that can be proven. Just...

130
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,330
It's just smoke.

131
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,900
It's tales by the camp fire.

132
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,230
You're angry.

133
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,560
Pope Sixtus claims you're an agent of the Ottomans.

134
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,460
The Sons of Mithras are not constrained

135
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,630
by geographic borders.

136
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,200
Our stewardship encompasses all mankind.

137
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,260
Well, this particular man

138
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,260
is tired of being manipulated.

139
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:46,000
If you are lost in a forest and you see a landmark,

140
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:51,360
is that landmark manipulating you along a certain path?

141
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,830
I am merely your guide.

142
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,200
But if I ignore your chosen path, then...

143
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,300
I'll never find my mother, will I?

144
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,160
She's a poor little thing.

145
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,900
Mending Camilla Pazzi's heart will be the least of our concerns

146
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,200
if my brother sabotages this feast.

147
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,700
The snub could propel us all into still more years of blood feud.

148
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,100
Look at Francesco. Look at them all.

149
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,160
- The Pazzis glower like that. - Exactly.

150
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
Today was supposed to be different.

151
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,560
How long should we wait?

152
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,900
Always so impatient, Francesco.

153
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,730
Talk with them.

154
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,230
Complain of the scandal of Giuliano's absence.

155
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,600
Your anger at the cur's impudence

156
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,230
will disguise your desire to kill.

157
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,200
Or it may just spur me to strike even faster.

158
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,730
Captain, tracking the comings and goings of Florentines is your specialty.

159
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,530
Where is my brother?

160
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,400
I cannot say.

161
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,100
A week ago, my Officer Bertino asked permission

162
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,100
to accompany Giuliano to Siena.

163
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,330
I've seen neither of them since.

164
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,860
Why Siena?

165
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,860
Giuliano,

166
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,760
apparently longed for one last fling before his nuptials.

167
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,600
The pious Bertino promised to keep him from too much trouble.

168
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,800
What if Bertino failed?

169
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,660
What if Giuliano was waylaid on the road?

170
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,760
Surely that's the only reason he'd insult us

171
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,460
with his absence today.

172
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,730
Take a few men and search the roads

173
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,160
between Florence and Siena.

174
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,560
All of us yearn to know what has become of Giuliano, Captain.

175
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,630
Settle the matter for us. Please.

176
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,260
There is a ship bound for Cape Verde, the Basilisk.

177
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,860
Under the command of Antonio de Noli.

178
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,630
As we speak, de Noli is in Florence,

179
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,200
loading a barge with provisions for a journey.

180
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,560
At dawn, he takes the barge to Pisa,

181
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,200
where the Basilisk is anchored.

182
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,330
You, Leonardo, must book passage on that ship.

183
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,960
With your navigational skills,

184
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,100
the Basilisk will survive the storms

185
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,660
and reach another land entirely,

186
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,430
where the Book of Leaves awaits.

187
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,300
Some years ago, a magician promised me he would hide something for you.

188
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,860
A magician?

189
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,530
Cosimo de Medici?

190
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,900
Cached within Cosimo's tomb is a mariner's astrolabe.

191
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,130
With it, you will navigate the Basilisk safely

192
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,300
to the lands indicated on the map.

193
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:46,100
Cosimo hid it in a way that only you would solve his riddle.

194
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,700
As ever, you know the right games to tantalize me.

195
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,660
You must carry the astrolabe onto that barge.

196
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,430
The Book of Leaves, of your mother's fate,

197
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,760
will remain a mystery.

198
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,900
Isn't this the moment where you spin a coin,

199
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,160
put me into a trance?

200
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,060
No coins.

201
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,700
No trances.

202
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,960
You either book passage West or you don't.

203
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,860
You succeed or you fail.

204
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:37,300
The choice and the consequences are yours.

205
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,930
- Be still, child.  - I'm going to be sick.

206
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,430
You're already sick. No-one calls for me if they're well.

207
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,800
Here. Hold this.

208
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,660
You've not stepped over a grave, have you?

209
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,660
Or drunk milk that's gone to spoil?

210
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,860
No, Ottavia. Nothing like that.

211
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,800
Here. Piss into this.

212
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,200
I saw a butcher's daughter last week, blubbering on about a malady akin to this.

213
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:12,330
Had to split her open. Worms.

214
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,530
Oh. Cloudy as a winter's dawn.

215
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,600
Is that bad?

216
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,100
A pinch or two of this every two days,

217
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,060
and be sure to stay out of the light of the moon.

218
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:35,999
- Not for your sack, but for his.  - For whom?

219
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:40,999
Your son, you know where the worms go, you're with child.

220
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,860
Bring me to him.

221
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:57,430
I've sent Clarice away to spare her whatever tragedy you may have brought here.

222
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,600
Delay no more. Show me.

223
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:09,160
My Officer Bertino. Found on the road to Siena.

224
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:12,900
Hacked to death. Bandits?

225
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,800
Most likely. Yet we found no trace of Giuliano.

226
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,930
Take more men. Find him, alive or dead.

227
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,530
I must know my brother's fate.

228
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,660
Where am I?

229
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,230
In the Val d'Elsa, Signor.

230
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,400
We found you in the river, more dead than alive.

231
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,700
I nursed your wounds.

232
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,100
I thank you for that.

233
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,760
Soon as I seen your clothes, I knew you was a nobleman.

234
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,430
And yet, you didn't rob me.

235
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,760
Wouldn't be Christian.

236
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,360
What day is it? How long have I been out?

237
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
Holy Saturday, Signor.

238
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,860
When they laid Christ's body in the tomb.

239
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,500
Argh!

240
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,200
I have to get back to Florence.

241
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,230
I need to warn Lorenzo.

242
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,200
You need to rest, son.

243
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,900
I can't.

244
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,600
No time.

245
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,760
Hm. The dead still walk.

246
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:40,130
I assumed you had to be dead.

247
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,500
Some said you traveled to Wallachia, others to Rome.

248
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,460
- Which was it?  - Both.

249
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,800
Ah. Both.

250
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:54,130
So why are we meeting here? Hm?

251
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,230
What intrigue are you involving me in this time?

252
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,760
This tomb, you designed it for Cosimo?

253
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,200
To an extent.

254
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,800
Like Cosimo's portrait,

255
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,760
is it possible this tomb contains secret mysteries?

256
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,330
This mosaic, see how the circles

257
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,600
weave through the design.

258
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:22,000
Step back and focus only on that.

259
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,230
King Solomon's Knot.

260
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,860
The ancient symbol representing the wisdom of eternity.

261
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,300
Yes.

262
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,530
Other men live among the trappis of this world.

263
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,230
But Cosimo's face was always turned beyond

264
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,530
worldly distractions

265
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,960
to the universe above.

266
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,800
He had the most agile mind I've ever known...

267
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,600
until I met you.

268
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,130
You honor me.

269
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,160
You're the closest thing I've ever known to a father.

270
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,360
I'm about to leave you again.

271
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,530
This time, on a quest from which I may never return.

272
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,830
Every question you answer leads to another question.

273
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:42,900
And such quests lead many to nothing but misery.

274
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,260
The true misery

275
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,260
is if all the questions are solved,

276
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,030
cos then there's nothing left to ask.

277
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,160
- Where do you voyage now?  - It depends on what I find here.

278
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,130
I designed no secret compartment.

279
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,300
Ah! But...

280
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,160
but the Magician

281
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,330
could install one without anyone knowing.

282
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,830
Like a flaw.

283
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,400
Cosimo would never have permitted it.

284
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,830
And yet...

285
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,930
Look. Look! Do you see?

286
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:28,260
It's exactly the same as the semi-circles

287
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,930
in King Solomon's Knot.

288
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,400
And Cosimo's gaze reflected

289
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,130
on Libra,

290
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,060
the scales of balance.

291
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,260
Perhaps there's a matching discrepancy?

292
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,800
Here. Do you see? There. Look.

293
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,700
Do they form an axis?

294
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:53,060
Well, if so, then there must be another axis that crosses it.

295
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,500
Exactly.

296
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,500
Starting here.

297
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,760
Then its mate would be...

298
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,030
Here. Look.

299
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,700
The center of the knot

300
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,430
would be...

301
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,260
directly above the heart.

302
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,760
The question answered.

303
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,360
Which leads to another question.

304
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,930
Yes.

305
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,060
Magnificently so.

306
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,460
Signor!

307
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Signor Medici, where have you been?

308
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,330
What's befallen you?

309
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:33,000
Treachery. A moment alone, Captain?

310
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,530
Bertino and I determined Lucrezia Donati to be a spy.

311
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,360
You cannot mean it.

312
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,160
We sought her out in Siena, and came across her being attacked by bandits.

313
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,200
We dispatched them but at the cost of Bertino's life.

314
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,860
Lucrezia stabbed me.

315
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,800
Left me for dead.

316
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,800
She is an agent of Riario and Pope Sixtus.

317
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,660
Capaldi! Ride with Black Martin. Tell Lorenzo Giuliano lives.

318
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:11,200
I will escort him home at a pace his wounds allow. Go. Go!

319
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,230
Thank you, Captain, for your consideration.

320
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,660
It is nothing.

321
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,230
Someone needs to tend to you.

322
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,830
We had a contract.

323
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,100
You break it and I will be justified

324
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,230
in depriving you of your freedom.

325
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,500
And what happened to the last man

326
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,300
who tried to pen me up in Florence?

327
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,160
You'll find me more of a match to you

328
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,600
than that hapless magistrate.

329
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,230
I would.

330
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,430
What about a small duchy of your own?

331
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,700
That would give you the freedom to amass

332
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,730
all the knowledge you like.

333
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,730
And you have duchies sitting around

334
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,730
to hand out like party favors?

335
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,760
The Duke of Urbino and I made an alliance to move on the Papacy.

336
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,760
That will give us the ability to give you

337
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,700
the legitimacy you have never had.

338
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,130
I suspect your alliance is dead.

339
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,230
At the Vatican I saw the Duke of Urbino himself.

340
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,530
One can't miss the man. He looked quite at home.

341
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,160
So as you desert me, you bring me word that

342
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,560
my only other source of military defense

343
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,630
is a sham?

344
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,900
You approached him because you knew he had a price, yes?

345
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,600
Someone outbid you.

346
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,260
Fuck you.

347
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,360
Artists approach me all the time.

348
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,100
They are full of vague and glorious ideas

349
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,630
on which they rarely deliver.

350
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,460
Case in point.

351
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,330
You were warned.

352
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,700
You were warned in this very room.

353
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,630
I accept many commissions, I finish few.

354
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,830
I gave you the chance to be the foremost artist of your day.

355
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,130
I gave you the most desirable woman in Florence as a subject.

356
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,030
She was never my subject.

357
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,900
You and I love this city, do we not?

358
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,160
We do.

359
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,400
Then help me save it.

360
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,700
What else can I give you?

361
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,830
What about her?

362
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:54,930
Her husband's clearly not an obstacle.

363
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:59,330
You think I would just toss her to you just like that?

364
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,230
You have a wife.

365
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,700
Who has her charms. Who needs attention.

366
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:12,200
How much does Lucrezia mean to you, Lorenzo?

367
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,560
Are you willing to set aside your toy

368
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,860
to keep me in Florence?

369
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,960
Magnifico, your brother has been found.

370
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,700
Giuliano is alive.

371
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,030
Wounded but alive.

372
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,830
Who wounded him?

373
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,100
Lucrezia Donati.

374
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,560
- And she is also alive? - It appears so.

375
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,730
What was she doing attacking Giuliano?

376
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,760
Did she know of your plans?

377
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,100
Giuliano is unarmed and  in the care of Dragonetti.

378
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,730
He won't live to see Florence again.

379
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,600
But if people learn Giuliano has been killed,

380
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,200
Lorenzo will rally the people behind him.

381
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:30,330
We must strike at Lorenzo first.

382
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,930
Easter Mass.

383
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,360
Dawn tomorrow we will poison Lorenzo in the very act

384
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,200
of taking holy communion,

385
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,300
and damn Cardinal Orsini's pious hesitations.

386
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:49,960
It will look as if God himself has taken down the tyrant.

387
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,730
- What is your name?  - Capaldi.

388
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,160
Find Father Bagnone and Father Maffei.

389
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,630
Have them prepare the Host for Lorenzo,

390
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,800
and his wife,

391
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,130
and all his daughters.

392
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:08,960
Then ride back to Dragonetti and make sure that Giuliano has met his death.

393
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,330
Consider it done, my lord.

394
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,400
Within hours... we will own Florence.

395
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,960
But why would Lucrezia agree to act as Rome's catspaw?

396
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,860
Sixtus only rewards his own blood.

397
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,430
Did you know he's already rewarded six of his nephews as cardinals?

398
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,800
- He is loyal.  - To the point of incestuousness.

399
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,500
The virtue of a republic like Florence

400
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,330
is that offices go to the most worthy,

401
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,760
appointments are made only on merit.

402
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:48,400
I dare say you earned your rank on the basis of achievement, Dragonetti?

403
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,300
I did.

404
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,560
And you demonstrate that repeatedly.

405
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,530
The details in your curfew ledgers

406
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,230
without them, Bertino and I could never have uncovered

407
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,530
the name of Lorenzo's betrayer.

408
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,500
All one needed was the time to study the records.

409
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:13,700
And you had the time, of course.

410
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,230
I do take my work seriously.

411
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:28,260
That's how she was able to avoid detection after curfew, isn't it?

412
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,230
She had the perfect alibi, fucking my brother,

413
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,300
and because the first man to raise questions about her activities

414
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,030
was already in league with Rome himself.

415
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,500
I could try and ride away.

416
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,400
But you're unwounded, your mount is fresher.

417
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,760
Finish what your spy began, then.

418
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,260
Perhaps she'll reward you between her legs.

419
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,730
- That is not what spurs me.  - What does?

420
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,260
A desire for a Florence that fears God,

421
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,930
not its masters.

422
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,360
Let's get to your brother's side.

423
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,800
De Noli's barge, bound for Pisa?

424
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,430
Aye, Signor.

425
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,730
How much to book passage for three?

426
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,260
We take only freight and baggage.

427
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:38,560
I told you, only freight and baggage.

428
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,330
I have to board the Basilisk.

429
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,430
Yeah, you're beginning to look like baggage.

430
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,900
Dawn tomorrow. Don't be late.

431
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,260
Each of my brigades awaits near one of these gates.

432
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:02,430
You may consider Florence already under our control.

433
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:09,030
- Your men are loyal to you?  - But of course.

434
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:12,330
Because if they get battle-hungry and invade prematurely,

435
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,560
the Florentines will rise against them.

436
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,360
The Florentines are shopkeepers and clerks.

437
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:19,730
We're soldiers.

438
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,630
The Florentines live in narrow corridors and alleyways

439
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,200
where they can strike unexpectedly.

440
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:28,200
If they rise to fight for their home,

441
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,860
it will not resemble the fields of battle you know.

442
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:36,230
We have new weapons for street warfare.

443
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,730
You will follow our lead.

444
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,700
The Pazzis' role in all this is to overthrow the tyrants,

445
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,800
establish a clear new regime.

446
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:47,360
While your role is only to appear if summoned

447
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:50,160
to cement the powers-that-will-be into place.

448
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,130
If I choose to move on Florence myself...

449
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,360
who are you to stop me?

450
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,860
Tell me, who is it that pays your men?

451
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,500
You sit in the middle, conveying their wages

452
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,760
which issue from the vaults of Rome.

453
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,660
Act against me,

454
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:16,230
and that same city shall brand you a heretic,

455
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,330
strip you of your titles, and excommunicate you.

456
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,460
Resist further, and His Holiness

457
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,860
will have that metal eyepiece of yours melted down

458
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,560
and poured over your testicles in the middle of the Piazza Navona.

459
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:34,600
I've seen what he's capable of with... both of my eyes.

460
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,230
Your man returns.

461
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,230
Perhaps with news from my brother.

462
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,800
He comes not from Il Magnifico...

463
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,730
but from Count Riario...

464
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,830
to confirm I've killed you.

465
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,330
Why is he not riding away with news I'm still alive?

466
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,960
I think he has another plan.

467
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,160
Hold.

468
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,530
- What are you doing?  - What's best for Florence.

469
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,330
Aargh! 

470
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,430
Pick up his sword.

471
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,100
You'll need a weapon if you're going to save your brother.

472
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,960
Do it now, Giuliano. Before I change my mind again.

473
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,300
It's me.

474
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,560
You think I don't know your footsteps?

475
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,560
Give me a reason...

476
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,460
why I shouldn't puncture your neck this instant.

477
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,660
Not today.

478
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,930
You poisoned Vanessa and I risked dementia trying to save her.

479
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,260
You shared the secrets of my war machinery with Riario

480
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,430
and put the city at peril.

481
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,600
This... this denunciation

482
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,830
that names me a sexual criminal,

483
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,160
had me thrown in jail to face the bonfire.

484
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,330
This is your work!

485
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:55,460
I had Nico send you to the convent to keep your friend alive.

486
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,130
I begged for your mercy during the trial

487
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,900
and made enemies who seek my life.

488
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:03,430
You will never understand the risks I have taken...

489
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:07,000
- To keep your father alive.  - What?

490
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:10,860
I know. I know.

491
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:14,460
He wishes me to tell you how much he loves you.

492
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,960
I spoke with him in his cell in Castel Sant'angelo.

493
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,400
Then you grasp the hold they have maintained over me.

494
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,060
It's a hold so strong...

495
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:33,200
that you would even poison an innocent man.

496
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,730
And what of the risks you have faced in search of your mother?

497
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,200
Huh?

498
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,700
If it fell to you to keep her alive,

499
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,300
would you say "No, I'll preserve another's life"?

500
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,830
I would find another way.

501
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,930
Yeah, how easy it is for you to believe that.

502
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,660
I would understand your actions, Lucrezia...

503
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,200
if your father hadn't rejected my offer to set him free.

504
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,660
- You're lying.  - No.

505
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:07,000
You've committed these sins for nothing.

506
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,060
Your work argues that man is capable of anything.

507
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,560
Well, between us, we prove it.

508
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:33,130
You show us the heights that we can reach and I show us the depths.

509
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,100
Of late...

510
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,000
I've met men who dwell in shadows,

511
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,560
speaking of... other times and other lives.

512
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:16,030
Maybe... if they're correct...

513
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,500
a life exists in which we...

514
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,900
Yes. Yes.

515
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,360
Yes.

516
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,000
No, I can't do this. I can't.

517
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,230
- Please. Please.  - I can't. I can't.

518
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,800
I have to go. I have to...

519
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,200
A ship waits in Pisa to take me to the Book of Leaves.

520
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,460
If I'm not on the Basilisk...

521
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,200
Riario and the Pazzis are moving on Florence.

522
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,700
- They want to kill Lorenzo.  - I could care less, what they do.

523
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,330
Let the politicians kill each other, that's their forte.

524
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:58,230
Leonardo, please, you are only one who can stop this now.

525
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,060
If you're not going to do it for me or for Lorenzo,

526
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,230
then do it for Florence.

527
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,660
For Florence?

528
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,830
For Florence? The city that turned its back on me?

529
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,030
The bastard son?

530
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,860
The sodomite?

531
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,800
A younger Da Vinci might've bought your arguments, Lucrezia.

532
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,360
But... I've endured too much these last few months

533
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,400
to be swayed by sentiment.

534
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,130
It's Easter.

535
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:38,100
If Florence demands a sacrifice...

536
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,600
I suggest you offer yourself.

537
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:33,530
You still endeavor to taint the air with that foul stench, I see.

538
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,600
A vice.

539
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,600
One that Girolamo sees fit to allow me.

540
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,000
Not the only one.

541
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,560
I've never understood your obsession with this game.

542
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,930
I imagine you've played thousands of times,

543
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,860
and what has it brought you?

544
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,260
Know thy self,

545
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,960
know thine enemy.

546
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,300
It is but a recreation.

547
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,760
True strategic mastery

548
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,460
must be forged in the arena of life.

549
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,800
- Happy Easter.  - Indeed.

550
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:16,060
For today brings not only the resurrection of Christ...

551
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:20,800
but the resurrection of Florence under Rome's rule.

552
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:25,760
Soon, all the Italian states will fall into line.

553
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,860
I will then turn my attention

554
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:31,330
to the true enemy of God...

555
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,700
the Ottoman Empire.

556
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,860
A final Holy War.

557
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,330
A glorious victory for which I will be made...

558
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,160
a saint.

559
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,130
Beware of practicing your righteousness

560
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:51,160
before other people in order to be seen by them,

561
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:55,230
for then there will be no reward from your Father...

562
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,000
who is in heaven.

563
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,130
I must thank you.

564
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,360
For without you, I could never have achieved today's triumph.

565
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,560
And for this, perhaps you would offer me...

566
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,300
something in return?

567
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,760
Hmm.

568
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:23,230
I believe it's time you and I...

569
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,360
played another game.

570
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:35,330
Don't you agree... Brother?

571
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,300
Is all in place?

572
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,430
Fathers Bagnone and Maffei are preparing the poison.

573
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,830
And the Cardinal?

574
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,660
He's too fucking pious to be told of this change of plans.

575
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:07,600
While he prays, the priests will deliver the tainted Eucharist to Lorenzo.

576
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:11,360
Quattrone. Medici loyalist.

577
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,000
If he goes against us,

578
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,030
he'll join Lorenzo in the afterlife.

579
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,800
Is there any news of Da Vinci?

580
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:25,160
The last I heard, he was in Rome.

581
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,830
He's countered us again and again!

582
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:31,360
Can we act if we don't know the man's whereabouts?

583
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,600
Calm yourself, Francesco.

584
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,230
We have long prepared. All is ready.

585
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,960
Signorina, you make an old man...

586
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,030
believe in the perfectibility of mankind.

587
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,900
Thank you, Maestro.

588
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,900
What troubles you, Vanessa?

589
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,900
Have you seen Giuliano de Medici?

590
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,900
I must speak to him. He needs to hear this.

591
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,930
Quickly, before the Cardinal sees.

592
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,860
Ensure that these wafers go to the Medicis,

593
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,460
and only the Medicis.

594
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,830
And then we can truly celebrate this mass.

595
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:20,330
Happy Easter, Lorenzo.

596
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,800
And to you, Francesco.

597
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:28,960
Where is Giuliano?

598
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,360
I'm sure Dragonetti will bring him straight here.

599
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I'm sure of nothing today.

600
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:45,800
God's trousers, Leo. Where the fuck have you been all night?

601
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,900
Only haunted by a final farewell.

602
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,830
The barge is loaded and the captain's keen to depart.

603
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:57,100
Impatient canker blossom threatened to double the fee if he waited any longer.

604
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:07,130
Well... then let's save some coin

605
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:09,430
and be on our way.

606
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:12,230
What's this?

607
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:16,130
This is us asking the Fates where the fuck you've been.

608
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:20,460
The Chariot. Reversed?

609
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,200
Uncontrolled passion, leading to defeat.

610
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,700
Time to leave, I'd say. Come on.

611
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,400
It's so quiet.

612
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,800
The bells have stopped.

613
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,700
Mass has begun.

614
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,100
Fuck.

615
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,700
There's something I must do.

616
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,730
- There's no time.  - The barge won't wait. Make a decision.

617
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:38,800
The Book Of Leaves or whoever tears you away. You can't have both.

618
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:43,730
I can. I can, if you just find a way to keep them here until I return.

619
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,800
I'm not gonna be long. Just stall them, Zo.

620
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,060
Please!

621
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:54,500
There's another meaning to that card.

622
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,400
A journey thwarted.

623
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:02,760
In nominee Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

624
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,360
- Amen.  - Amen.

625
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,560
Do you fear God, Signora?

626
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,330
The wise... both fear and love God.

627
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,600
Why then do you hesitate to enter His house?

628
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,760
Because it isn't God who waits for me inside those doors.

629
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,330
tui, cum oblationibus hostiarum:

630
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,900
ut paschalibus initiata mysteriis,

631
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,200
ad aeternitatis  nobis medelam,

632
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,830
te operante, proficiant.

633
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:41,200
Per Dominum.

634
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:43,430
Riders approach.

635
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:46,060
Two.

636
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,360
Hell is descending upon this city.

637
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,360
Get yourself to safety. Now.

638
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,730
What has happened to you?

639
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,160
God will permit no violence.

640
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,360
You cannot disrupt a sacred Mass!

641
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:04,700
- Sheathe your weapon!  - I'm sorry, but I cannot.

642
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:08,460
Cease your intrusion. This is a House of God.

643
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:12,400
And God loves truth. Let him speak.

644
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,600
The Pazzis conspire against us, my family!

645
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:19,860
They're in league with Rome and betray all Florence!

646
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,900
People and Liberty! Death to the Medicis!

647
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,000
Go. Take our daughters to safety.

648
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:38,430
They'll have men at the doors. Find a way out. Go!

649
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,360
- Giuliano!  - Lorenzo!

650
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,000
Towards the door.

651
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:59,430
You betray our cause, Captain.

652
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,700
Your cause betrays Florence.

653
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:12,230
Flee, my lady! It is a chaos of swords in there!

654
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,660
Kill them!

655
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,330
Brother! Brother! Help your family!

656
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,900
Rome is my family.

657
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,730
Forgive me.

658
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,830
- Aaargh!  - Giuliano!

659
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:50,560
Die, Medici scum!

660
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,560
The wife and children. Go, go!

661
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,560
Oh, Giuliano! Oh, no! No!

662
00:51:58,130 --> 00:51:59,530
No!

663
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,460
Come on!

664
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,930
Aaargh!

665
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,730
Clarice... please!

666
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:25,930
Come on.

667
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:32,460
I'm... I'm dying, Vanessa.

668
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:36,860
Your line will live on. In me.

669
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:42,660
I'm bearing your child, your son, Giuliano.

670
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:51,930
Vanessa, it's too late. Vanessa, leave him.

671
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,400
Leave him! Vanessa!

672
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,400
- No! No!  - Yes. Come on.

673
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:02,300
Stay with me.

674
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,560
Drop it, dear cousin.

675
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:13,930
No, no!

676
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,430
You imagine I can't take on the lot of you?

677
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,500
Riario.

678
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:26,230
If your true loyalty is to the Medicis, Captain... 

679
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:30,160
I suggest you take them away and leave this one to me.

680
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,460
- But Signora Donati...  - Has betrayed you for Rome.

681
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:36,860
Leave them to each other, Signora.

682
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:40,130
Children.

683
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,360
Hurry.

684
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,700
No... 

685
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,730
I've prayed for this day. Today, Florence rejoices.

686
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,660
Are you certain of that, Pazzi?

687
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,400
Aaargh!

688
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:14,130
Before you die, Lorenzo,

689
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,600
know that I'll kill every last Medici in Florence.

690
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:20,860
I'll wipe all evidence of your family's existence from this world!

691
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,560
Iron rusts from disuse.

692
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,860
Let us finish off the Medicis, scribbler,

693
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,530
and we might let you live.

694
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:49,060
A Florence ruled by Pazzis? No!

695
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:52,360
No. I think I'd rather go down fighting.

696
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:53,660
As you wish.

697
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:07,030
Come on. Come on!

698
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:11,730
Come on! Come on!

699
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:23,060
- That won't hold long.  - The doors will hold.

700
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:26,730
Verrocchio designed the locks.

701
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:34,130
Giuliano? Have I lost a brother?

702
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:40,360
Come on! Come on, come on!

703
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,700
Da Vinci!

704
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:45,330
Upon my arrival I saw only you.

705
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:52,400
- I knew you wouldn't abandon us.  - Stop. Save your strength.

706
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,460
Da Vinci!

707
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,100
It'll be over soon, Lucrezia!

708
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,060
I'm sorry, Leonardo. You've saved my life, and I know what it's cost y... 

709
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,930
Ssh. Save your praise for someone who deserves it.

710
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:17,200
I wonder which of the two men you fuck will be buried alongside you?

711
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:20,260
You chose Florence over your own dreams.

712
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,260
You will accept my love.

713
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,530
It is the least I can offer you.

714
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:31,600
This ring. I know this ring.

715
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,100
It's Lucrezia's.

716
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:45,860
Are you fucking her... or is it more?

717
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,630
You better finish the job they have begun or I swear... 

718
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:55,430
if we survive this, I'll kill you both.

719
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,760
God's vengeance is upon you!

720
00:57:09,001 --> 00:57:13,000


721
00:57:14,001 --> 00:57:22,000

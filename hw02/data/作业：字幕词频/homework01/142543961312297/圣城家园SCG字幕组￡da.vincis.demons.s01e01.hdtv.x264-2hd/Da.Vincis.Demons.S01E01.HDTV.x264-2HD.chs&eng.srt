00:00:49,151 --> 00:01:00,018
达芬奇恶魔 第一季 第1集

4
00:01:06,797 --> 00:01:08,831
要跟我一起抽吗 达芬奇?
Will you smoke with me, Da Vinci?

5
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:12,268
那要看里面装的是什么了
Well, that depends on what's in the pipe.

6
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:15,939
烟草混着圣诞玫瑰
It is a mixture of tobacco and black hellebore

7
00:01:16,073 --> 00:01:18,475
据说可让人产生幻觉
and is rumored to induce visions

8
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:20,210
召唤出恶魔
and summon demons.

9
00:01:20,278 --> 00:01:22,478
全是无稽之谈
Well, I believe in neither.

10
00:01:22,546 --> 00:01:27,217
那你又何必这么努力克制呢?
Then why do you struggle so hard to keep both at bay?

11
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,331
历史就如同武器一般 被那些意欲掩盖真相的人
History is a lie that has been honed like a weapon

12
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,701
肆意改动 只剩谎言
by people who have suppressed the truth.

13
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,237
你注定会学会那些
The knowledge you are destined to learn

14
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,006
颠覆事物既定秩序的知识
will upend the established order of things.

15
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,209
你怎么知道?
How could you possibly know that?

16
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,996
你应该听过 '时间是一条河流'吧?
You have heard the phrase 'Time is a river'?

17
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:52,379
是的
Yes.

18
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:57,250
但大多数人没有理解到 这条河流是环形的
What most fail to grasp is that the river is circular.

19
00:01:57,318 --> 00:02:00,020
每个人的死亡都开启了
One man's death opens a doorway

20
00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:01,755
另一个人重生的大门
to the birth of the next.

21
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:03,957
你想知道这道重生之门
Would you like to know how

22
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:06,426
是如何开启的吗?
this particular doorway opened?

23
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:07,894
想
Yes.

24
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:10,864
先提醒你一句
Be forewarned, then.

25
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:14,268
并非所有大门都通向光明
Some doorways lead into darkness.

26
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,500
4天前

27
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,729
走吧 孩子 把衣服穿上!
Out you go, boy. Get on with you!

28
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:58,075
走吧! 快走!
Go on! Go on!

29
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:06,883
奇高!
Cicco!

30
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:13,320
- 今天星期几?  - 棕榈主日(复活节前的星期日)
- What day is it today?  - Palm Sunday.

31
00:03:13,388 --> 00:03:14,955
该死
Oh, balls.

32
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:17,724
夫人和您的子民都已经在教堂了
The Duchess and your children are already at the church.

33
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,826
给我煮些鸡蛋吧
Could you round me up some coddled eggs?

34
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:26,563
我宿醉得厉害 肚子里翻江倒海的
I have a beastly hangover and my bowels are in a tumble.

35
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:28,698
我很快就穿好
I'll be dressed in but a minute.

36
00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:53,317
大家不必拘礼 我来了!
At ease, people, I've arrived!

37
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,322
走开 混账东西 这是我的时刻
Be gone, you artless fuckwit. This is my moment.

38
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,923
经密令指示
And thanks to the Secret Archives,

39
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:05,025
这将是你最后的时刻!
it's the last you will ever enjoy!

40
00:04:26,814 --> 00:04:29,082
莱昂纳多 告诉我一个秘密吧
Tell me a secret, Leonardo.

41
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,020
你最早的记忆... 是什么?
What was your... earliest memory?

42
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:35,122
或者 换个问题
Or better yet,

43
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,158
你最害怕的是什么?
your greatest fear?

44
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:38,826
对我来说...
In my case...

45
00:04:38,894 --> 00:04:40,862
这两个问题差不多
the two go hand-in-hand.

46
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,397
我那时...
I was...um...

47
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:44,299
我那时才六个月
I was six months old.

48
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,301
没人能记得这么小时候的事
No-one remembers back that far.

49
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,869
也许我比较特别吧
Well, perhaps I'm unique, then.

50
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:51,273
- 好吧  - 我母亲...
- Oh.  - My mother... um...

51
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:57,179
带着我去田里 将我放在摇篮里
put me in a cradle out in the field.

52
00:04:57,246 --> 00:05:00,415
一只猎鹰飞了下来 我还记得
And a falcon flew down. I can still recall it.

53
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:04,419
它就栖在那儿 看着我
It just perched there, looking at me

54
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:06,254
仿佛想要揭示
almost as if it were trying to reveal

55
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:08,657
什么秘密
some kind of mystery.

56
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,225
母亲赶走了它
My mother drove it away.

57
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:13,095
虽然我的记性很好
Yet, as clear as that memory is,

58
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:15,330
但是我唯一记不得的...
the one thing I can never recall...

59
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,300
就是我母亲的脸
is my mother's face.

60
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:23,973
我能画出所有看过的东西 甚至那些转瞬即逝的 
I can draw anything I've seen, even in passing.

61
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:28,311
但每次回想我母亲 都没有一丁点印象
But when it comes to my mother, all I see is a void.

62
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:30,713
自从那夜她消失后 我一直...
She disappeared that night and I've been...

63
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:32,816
努力回想她的样子
trying to recall her face ever since.

64
00:05:32,884 --> 00:05:35,185
所有的男人都在寻找自己的母亲
All men are searching for their mothers.

65
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:37,554
所以才会流连于女人的大腿之间
That's what guides you between our thighs.

66
00:05:37,622 --> 00:05:39,589
我雇你来当模特的 瓦妮莎
I pay you to pose, Vanessa.

67
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:41,857
不是让你来窥探我心底的
Not to plumb the innermost depths of my character.

68
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,226
你希望我在你面前赤裸裸
If you expect me to bare my figure for you,

69
00:05:44,294 --> 00:05:47,930
我也希望你能对我坦诚灵魂
I expect you to bare your soul in return.

70
00:05:47,998 --> 00:05:51,167
告诉我吧 你最害怕什么?
So, tell me, is there nothing else you fear?

71
00:05:57,808 --> 00:05:59,776
不够完美
Only imperfection.

72
00:05:59,844 --> 00:06:01,945
大师! 大师!
Maestro! Maestro!

73
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:04,982
你迟到了 尼科
You're late, Nico.

74
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,718
是你迟到了 维罗吉欧正找你呢
You're late. Verrocchio's been looking for you.

75
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:10,354
让他等吧 我们来做一个实验
Well, he can wait. We've an experiment to conduct.

76
00:06:10,422 --> 00:06:12,589
这个实验少了你不行
You're meant to play a principal role in it.

77
00:06:12,657 --> 00:06:14,692
- 来吧!  - 你好
- Come on!  - Hello.

78
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,828
那叫胸部 尼科 每个女人都有的
They're called breasts, Nico. Every woman possesses them.

79
00:06:17,896 --> 00:06:19,997
尼科! 那是瓦妮莎
Nico! That's Vanessa.

80
00:06:20,064 --> 00:06:22,966
她刚从圣安东尼修道院解放出来
She's newly liberated from the Convent of St Anthony.

81
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:26,637
过来帮我
Now help me do this.

82
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:28,672
绑上那个背带
Climb into that harness.

83
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,541
今天
Hey today,

84
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:32,678
我们要尝试证明 这个风筝
we are attempting to ascertain whether or not

85
00:06:32,746 --> 00:06:35,181
能否提供足够的空气阻力
this kite can provide the necessary wind resistance

86
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:36,382
来支撑你的重量
to support your weight.

87
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,151
大师 如果它不能呢?
Well, Maestro, what if it can't?

88
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:40,987
瓦妮莎 可以跳会儿舞吗?
Vanessa, do you mind just dancing about for a moment?

89
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:43,022
看见了吗? 那些飘动的丝带
You see? Those weighted ribbons

90
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,424
我能够因此计算出
allow me to calculate the strength

91
00:06:44,492 --> 00:06:45,959
风力和风向
and direction of the wind.

92
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:49,763
现在 我估算... 风力大约20节 
In this case, I would say... it's about 20 knots

93
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:51,799
风向...
and shifting...

94
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:53,467
北方
westerly.

95
00:06:56,738 --> 00:06:59,740
等等 大师! 万一你算错了呢?
Wait, Maestro! What if your calculations are wrong?

96
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08,784
等等 等等 大师! 大师 求你了 快停下!
Wait, wait, Maestro! Oh, Maestro, please, please stop!

97
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:12,855
等等 大师 大师!
Oh, wait, Maestro. Maestro!

98
00:07:27,004 --> 00:07:28,772
哦 我的天哪 快停下!
Oh, my God, please!

99
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:41,253
看啊!
Yes!

100
00:07:41,321 --> 00:07:44,490
你飞起来了 尼科!
You're flying, Nico!

101
00:07:44,558 --> 00:07:46,526
大师!
Maestro-o-o!

102
00:07:47,161 --> 00:07:48,728
太完美了!
It's perfect!

103
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:01,776
太高了! 别这么高
You're too high! Not so high.

104
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:03,611
尼科!
Nico!

105
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:39,613
成功了! 成功了 大师!
It works! It works, Maestro!

106
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:42,516
我从未怀疑过
I never had any doubts.

107
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,688
天哪 我讨厌这个地方
Oh, God, I hate this place.

108
00:08:47,755 --> 00:08:50,390
什么? 除了佛罗伦萨还有其他地方
What? Where else could we practice our flights

109
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,192
能让我们飞吗?
but in Florence?

110
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,528
要是在其他地方 我们早就因此
Anywhere else, we'd just be burnt at the stake

111
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:55,662
被施以火刑了
for our efforts.

112
00:08:56,998 --> 00:08:59,999
这儿呢? 我只是一个思想自由的异教徒
But here? I'm just another free-thinking heretic.

113
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:01,835
混沌 文化
Chaos. Culture.

114
00:09:01,903 --> 00:09:04,170
在这高墙之内 所有的一切都是自由的
It's all celebrated within these walls.

115
00:09:04,238 --> 00:09:07,206
佛罗伦萨对它的人民只有一个要求
Florence only demands one thing of its people.

116
00:09:07,274 --> 00:09:10,510
真正的觉醒
To be truly awake.

117
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,381
此女只应天上有
Like that angelic vision.

118
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:18,050
别妄想了 那是卢克蕾齐娅・多纳蒂
Don't even think about it. That's Lucrezia Donati.

119
00:09:18,118 --> 00:09:21,320
洛伦佐・德・美第奇的情妇 我很清楚她是谁
Lorenzo de Medici's mistress. I'm well aware of who she is.

120
00:09:21,387 --> 00:09:22,587
如果他抓到你在看她
He'll break you on the wheel,

121
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:23,989
会把你五马分尸的
if he catches you looking at her.

122
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:27,927
但如果是她在看我呢?
But what if she's caught looking at me?

123
00:09:36,336 --> 00:09:38,304
米兰那边传来坏消息 尼科
Bad tidings from Milan, Nico.

124
00:09:38,372 --> 00:09:40,039
你怎么知道?
How can you tell?

125
00:09:40,107 --> 00:09:43,009
骑士外套上的图案是无毒环纹蛇
That serpent on the rider's surcoat is the Biscione,

126
00:09:43,077 --> 00:09:46,212
斯福尔扎家族的族徽
the Sforza family emblem.

127
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,847
如果他带来的是好消息 他应该戴上
If he was bringing good news, he'd have been dressed

128
00:09:47,915 --> 00:09:50,851
更传统的红白相间的米兰徽章
in the more traditional red and white shield of Milan.

129
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:52,285
不管是什么消息
Whatever the message is,

130
00:09:52,353 --> 00:09:54,187
洛伦佐都会不高兴的
Lorenzo won't be happy with it.

131
00:10:13,808 --> 00:10:15,642
出去!
Out!

132
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,046
出去! 全部出去!
Out! All of you!

133
00:10:19,113 --> 00:10:21,581
洛伦佐? 洛伦佐!
Lorenzo? Lorenzo!

134
00:10:23,117 --> 00:10:27,019
米兰公爵死了
The Duke of Milan is dead.

135
00:10:27,087 --> 00:10:29,355
- 被刺杀的  - 谁干的?
- Assassinated.  - By whose hand?

136
00:10:29,423 --> 00:10:33,092
- 威士康蒂和另外两个人  - 那是荣誉谋杀了
- Visconti and two others.  - An honor killing, then.

137
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,162
他们说 公爵强暴了自己的侄女
They say the Duke deflowered his niece.

138
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:38,865
斯福尔扎是欲求不满的猪
Sforza was a pig of epic appetites.

139
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:41,935
是 但他也是我们的猪!
Yes, but he was our pig!

140
00:10:42,003 --> 00:10:44,704
我觉得梵蒂冈是幕后黑手
I sense the Vatican's hand behind this.

141
00:10:44,772 --> 00:10:47,139
时机把握得太准确
The timing is just too perfect.

142
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:50,576
如果你是对的 这会打破意大利的势力平衡 洛伦佐
If you're right, this upsets the balance of power in Italy, Lorenzo.

143
00:10:50,643 --> 00:10:52,912
哦 神啊 贝奇 这不仅仅是打破
Oh, by God, Becchi, this more than upsets.

144
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:54,947
这简直就是完全摧毁
This all but decapitates the concept

145
00:10:55,015 --> 00:10:57,149
对它公然挑衅!
and shits down its throat!

146
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,292
我们需要争取公众的支持
We need to shore up public support.

147
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,361
复活节假期快到了
Easter holiday is nearly upon us.

148
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:10,363
我们办一个嘉年华
Let's throw a carnival.

149
00:11:10,431 --> 00:11:12,499
让佛罗伦萨的人民像庆祝
Allow the people of Florence to celebrate

150
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,434
大斋节的到来一样欢送它的结束
the end of Lent as they do its arrival.

151
00:11:14,502 --> 00:11:16,136
盛况越空前
The more flamboyant the pageantry,

152
00:11:16,204 --> 00:11:17,771
显得我们越强
the stronger we appear.

153
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,741
我们不是爱炫耀的孔雀 朱利亚诺
We're not fucking peacocks, Giuliano.

154
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:22,309
嘉年华是不错
Carnival is all well and good,

155
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:24,078
但如果没有强大的后台
but if it has no teeth behind it,

156
00:11:24,146 --> 00:11:26,680
我们同样是在自取灭亡
we might as well slit our own throats.

157
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:36,557
你害怕吗?
Are you frightened?

158
00:11:36,624 --> 00:11:39,593
不 尊敬的教皇
No, Most Holy Father.

159
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:41,695
说谎是一种罪 我的孩子
Lying is a sin, my dear boy.

160
00:11:41,763 --> 00:11:43,965
它会让我们失去神的恩宠
It separates us from God's grace.

161
00:11:47,603 --> 00:11:52,207
是的 我害怕
Yes, I'm frightened.

162
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:55,644
这也是谎话 对吧?
But that's also a lie, isn't it?

163
00:11:55,712 --> 00:11:58,748
至少 不全是真话
At least, a partial one.

164
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:01,884
也许这是可赦之罪
A venial sin, perhaps.

165
00:12:01,952 --> 00:12:03,453
那么...
So...

166
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,788
哪一种回答才是真的?
which statement is correct?

167
00:12:05,856 --> 00:12:08,358
嗯?
Hm?

168
00:12:08,425 --> 00:12:10,293
说啊 孩子
Speak, child.

169
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,929
难道你不想上天堂?
Don't you want to enter heaven?

170
00:12:15,232 --> 00:12:18,534
正确的回答应该是...
The proper answer would be...

171
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:23,773
请留步! 教皇禁止任何人打扰
Please! His Holiness has forbidden any visitors.

172
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:26,943
我们的人成功了 大人!
Our men succeeded, Your Grace!

173
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:30,347
斯福尔扎死了
Sforza is dead.

174
00:12:30,415 --> 00:12:34,284
是时候拿下佛罗伦萨了 教皇大人
Florence is ripe for the picking, Your Eminence.

175
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:35,952
相信我
Trust me.

176
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,720
为什么这么说?
You know this how?

177
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:40,190
洛伦佐身边有我的人
Because I have an agent within Lorenzo's ranks.

178
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:44,694
美第奇家族要举办一个嘉年华
The Medicis are throwing a carnival,

179
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:47,798
想借此来赢得人民的支持
in a pathetic bid to win the people's favor.

180
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:50,968
他们不堪一击 陛下
They're weak, Your Holiness.

181
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,004
这是您一举拿下他们的好机会
This is your chance to strike.

182
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:56,207
不是我 侄子
Not mine, Nephew.

183
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,211
是上帝
The Lord's.

184
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,280
还有一件事要告诉您
There is another reason for haste.

185
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,716
土耳其人已经到佛罗伦萨了
The Turk has arrived in Florence.

186
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,686
他在找叶之书
He's after the Book of Leaves.

187
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,795
真的很抱歉
I am truly sorry.

188
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,402
为什么?
Why?

189
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,638
因为你听到的太多了
Because you can't have heard this.

190
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,503
你们准备好鸽子表演了吗?
Do you have the plans for the colombina or not?

191
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:01,506
是的
We do.

192
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:03,474
十分惊艳
And they're breathtaking.

193
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,176
那就把这些神奇的效果展现出来
Then produce these miraculous renderings

194
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:06,877
让我们评估一下
and let us evaluate them.

195
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:08,612
很遗憾...
Unfortunately...

196
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,214
我不能
I can't.

197
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:12,249
因为它们不存在!
Because they don't exist!

198
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:14,251
神啊 如果你觉得你能欺骗
By God, if you think you can defraud

199
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:15,486
美第奇家族...
the House of Medici...

200
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:18,923
不 不 不 它们存在 我向你保证!
No, no, no, they do exist, I promise you!

201
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,593
它们在这个箱子里
They're in this chest.

202
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,461
- 打开  - 它被锁上了
- Open it.  - It's locked.

203
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:27,164
好啊 那我用剑劈开它
Well, then, I'll take my sword to it.

204
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,068
如果强行打开这个箱子的话
The chest is rigged to explode

205
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,803
它就会爆炸
if anyone tampers with it.

206
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:34,705
你疯了?
Are you mad?

207
00:14:34,772 --> 00:14:37,942
怎么会有人造出这种可怕的发明?
Why would anyone engineer such an infernal contrivance?

208
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:42,380
当然是为了保护我的创意
To protect my ideas, obviously.

209
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:45,183
先生们 这位是莱昂纳多・达芬奇
Gentlemen, Leonardo Da Vinci.

210
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,753
啊 我听说过你
Ah, I've heard of you.

211
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,421
他们说你是个自由思想家
They say you're quite the free-thinker.

212
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,322
- 你来晚了  - 来吃个葡萄
- You're late.  - Grape.

213
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,359
好! 佛罗伦萨长官
So! The First Citizen of Florence

214
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,268
渴求我们给他制造出一只鸽子
is desperate for us to fashion him a colombina.

215
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,896
"渴求"说得太过了
"Desperate" is a strong word.

216
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,765
可我说的是事实
And yet it happens to be the word I used.

217
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,533
让我们回想一下
But let's review.

218
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,169
每年复活节 佛罗伦萨的街头
Every Easter, a grand procession makes its way

219
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,205
都会有浩大的游行队伍
through the streets of Florence,

220
00:15:07,272 --> 00:15:08,940
走向大教堂
terminating at the cathedral.

221
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:10,374
你为什么非要说这些
Why do you insist on stating

222
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,178
连三岁小孩都知道的废话?
what every child of three already knows?

223
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,447
你为什么非要打断我?
Why do you insist on interrupting me?

224
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,416
我有我的方法论 你可以听我的
I have a methodology. We can follow it.

225
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:18,651
或者咱们也可以打一架
Or we can flail about.

226
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,423
不说话我就默认你们听我的了 那我继续
I'll take your silence as a vote for the former. Onward.

227
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,425
在人群上空 一只机械鸽子
At the culmination of mass, a mechanical dove,

228
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,761
也就是这只鸽子 带着牵线 从圣坛上
the colombina, is flown from the altar on a wire.

229
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:31,630
翱翔到广场上空
Out into the public square it soars.

230
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,765
点燃一车的烟花
It ignites a cart full of fireworks.

231
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,201
群众开始欢庆 戴上面具
The Republic celebrates, they don masks.

232
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,437
喝酒狂欢...
They engage in drunken revelry. Now...

233
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,707
几年来 美第奇家族一直在雇佣
For years, the House of Medici has contracted

234
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:46,311
低劣的工坊制造这仪式鸽子
with inferior workshops to produce said ceremonial dove.

235
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,213
但是今年
But, this year,

236
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,316
不出我所料的话
if I am to understand the politics afoot,

237
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:56,120
这种低劣的情景
the same shoddy pageantry

238
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,222
不会再发生了
just won't do.

239
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,124
从没有人对我们的鸽子吹毛求疵
No-one's carped about our dove before.

240
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:03,328
你们管那个叫"鸽子" 简直是对鸟类的侮辱
To call your previous efforts 'a dove' is to insult the entire avian class.

241
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:06,264
够了! 快给我们展示你这破玩意吧
Enough! Just show us the damn thing.

242
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,832
好吧
All right.

243
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,521
这是个四分之一比例模型
That is but a quarter-scale model.

244
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:33,458
来
There.

245
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,827
这个真的很漂亮啊
It's a thing of beauty, I'll grant you that.

246
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:38,063
没错 30弗罗林 你就能带走了
Yes, and it can be yours for 30 florins.

247
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,965
- 30弗罗林?  - 没错
- 30?  - Yeah.

248
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,800
合同上写的是12弗罗林
The contract stated 12.

249
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:44,803
那种鸟需要绳子牵引才行
That was for a bird that needed a guide wire.

250
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:49,174
这个则不需要那种东西
This miracle requires no such handicap.

251
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:19,572
你的作品令人印象深刻
Your work is impressive.

252
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,807
但是价钱太不合理了
But the price is too steep.

253
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:25,443
- 30弗罗林很便宜啊  - 30弗罗林简直是抢劫!
- 30 florins is a bargain.  - 30 florins is sodomy!

254
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,346
或许我应该
Perhaps I should be negotiating

255
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:27,654
和你的哥哥谈价
with your older brother instead.

256
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:36,756
天啊 贝奇
For God's sake, Becchi,

257
00:17:36,824 --> 00:17:39,860
付钱给这贱民 赶紧了结这事算了
just pay the degenerate and be done with it.

258
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,598
算你赢了 艺术家
You win, artista.

259
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,167
按照佣金的惯例
As is customary with commissions,

260
00:17:47,235 --> 00:17:51,438
我们先付一半定金 完工后再付另一半
we shall pay half now and half upon completion.

261
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:54,074
既然说到佣金...
While we're on the subject of commissions,

262
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:58,545
我听说 你们在找人给卢克蕾齐娅・多纳蒂画肖像
I'm told that there's an open one to paint Lucrezia Donati.

263
00:17:58,613 --> 00:18:01,715
洛伦佐的情妇
Lorenzo's mistress.

264
00:18:01,783 --> 00:18:06,286
专心于你的玩意和小把戏吧 达芬奇
Stick to your whirligigs and parlor tricks, Da Vinci.

265
00:18:06,354 --> 00:18:08,855
想想伊卡洛斯的下场
Take a lesson from Icarus.

266
00:19:10,485 --> 00:19:12,019
告诉我吧...
So, tell me...

267
00:19:13,689 --> 00:19:15,856
你最害怕什么?
is there nothing else you fear?

268
00:19:32,575 --> 00:19:34,643
你没事吧 莱昂纳多?
Are you all right, Leonardo?

269
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:40,181
只是个噩梦 安德里亚
It was just a nightmare, Andrea.

270
00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:42,383
你噩梦做得太频繁了
You have them all too frequently.

271
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:46,154
我在计算上遇到了点问题 仅此而已
I'm having some issues with my mathematics, that's all.

272
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:48,290
问题?
Issues?

273
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:50,058
我不知道...
I'm not sure...

274
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:52,994
复活节前 能不能造出来那种鸽子
that the colombina will be flightworthy by Easter.

275
00:19:53,062 --> 00:19:55,029
- 但那个模型...  - 那只是个模型
- But the model...  - Was a model.

276
00:19:55,097 --> 00:19:57,265
当我按比例放大的之后
Once I scale up the dimensions,

277
00:19:57,332 --> 00:19:59,868
计算就出问题了 真烦人
the calculations don't hold. It's annoying!

278
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:03,972
你抽鸦片没有用
Smoking opium won't help matters.

279
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:06,007
- 至少能让我清醒  - 它只能让你糊涂
- It clears my head.  - It clouds it.

280
00:20:06,075 --> 00:20:10,477
你是谁? 我的保姆吗? 我要想的事情太多了 好吗?
What are you, my nursemaid? I think too much. All right?

281
00:20:10,545 --> 00:20:12,681
我需要糊涂一下 不然我就要疯了
I need to dull my thoughts or I'll be eviscerated by them.

282
00:20:12,748 --> 00:20:15,016
我觉得你现在应该
I would have thought that you would have

283
00:20:15,084 --> 00:20:16,852
明白了吧!
understood that by now!

284
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:23,292
鸦片有药用价值
The tears of the poppy have medicinal properties.

285
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,696
- 埃及的祭司...  - 我们不在埃及
- The priests in Egypt...  - We are not in Egypt.

286
00:20:27,764 --> 00:20:30,199
你也不是祭司
And you are no priest.

287
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:38,073
你很有天赋 莱昂
You have a gift, Leo.

288
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:40,175
可以说是个... 天才... 
A kind of...genius...

289
00:20:40,243 --> 00:20:43,412
我从未见过像你这样的人
the likes of which I've never seen.

290
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,582
正因如此 人们总会想方设法地消灭你
Because of that, people will always seek to destroy you.

291
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,551
拜托...
Please...

292
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:53,488
不要在自我毁灭 如他们所愿了
don't aid them in their endeavor.

293
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,389
- 这些椋鸟多少钱?  - 每只六铜钱
- How much for the starlings?  - Six denari apiece.

294
00:21:28,457 --> 00:21:30,658
给你两铜钱 我都要了
I'll give you two soldi for the lot.

295
00:21:30,726 --> 00:21:32,527
你在侮辱我吗?
Are you trying to offend me?

296
00:21:32,595 --> 00:21:33,962
没有 要是我想侮辱你的话
No, if I was trying to offend you,

297
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:36,230
我会说你的臀部后
I'd comment on the scent of fecal matter

298
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:37,498
挂着粪便物
wafting from your hindquarters.

299
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:39,901
两铜钱到底行不行?
Do you want the soldi or not?

300
00:21:39,969 --> 00:21:42,570
只有这么多钱 不要就算了
They're my last. I'm bored.

301
00:21:46,442 --> 00:21:48,410
不 我不想带走这些鸟
No, I'm not interested in the birds.

302
00:21:48,477 --> 00:21:50,712
听我的指挥把笼子打开
Just open the cage on my say-so.

303
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,682
他对飞行感兴趣 他想通过鸟找灵感
He's obsessed with flight. He studies them for inspiration.

304
00:22:07,164 --> 00:22:08,231
开
Now.

305
00:23:01,053 --> 00:23:03,521
恩? 如愿看到什么了吗?
Well? Did you see what you were hoping to?

306
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:07,992
还我一铜钱 我就告诉你
For one of my soldi back, I just might tell you.

307
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,995
好吧 告诉我
All right. Tell me.

308
00:23:11,063 --> 00:23:14,331
我看到一个傻瓜不知道怎样谈价
I saw an idiot who doesn't know how to haggle.

309
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:18,201
看那边 尼科 她又来了
Look, Nico. There she is again.

310
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:20,337
她和洛伦佐在一起
Look at her with Lorenzo.

311
00:23:20,405 --> 00:23:23,239
所有人都装得不知道两人上过床
Everyone pretending the two of them aren't fucking.

312
00:23:23,307 --> 00:23:27,343
- 那不是你父亲吗?  - 他像寄生虫一样
- Isn't that your father?  - Crown Prince of parasites.

313
00:23:27,411 --> 00:23:30,546
给洛伦佐当公证人
He serves as Lorenzo's notary.

314
00:23:30,614 --> 00:23:33,383
来吧 尼科 咱们去凑凑热闹
Come on, Nico, let's stir the pot a little.

315
00:23:33,451 --> 00:23:36,720
殿下!
Your Magnificence!

316
00:23:36,787 --> 00:23:39,690
我叫莱昂纳多・达芬奇 您可能听说过我?
My name is Leonardo Da Vinci. Perhaps you've heard of me?

317
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:42,025
我在为您设计复活节的鸽子
I am designing your Easter colombina.

318
00:23:42,093 --> 00:23:44,127
噢 对
Oh, yes.

319
00:23:44,195 --> 00:23:47,930
你就是维罗吉欧雇佣的那个怪人
You're the eccentric that Verrocchio employs.

320
00:23:47,998 --> 00:23:49,733
我是个艺术家 解剖学家
I'm an artist, yes, and an anatomist

321
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,667
还是个工程师
and an engineer of some note.

322
00:23:50,735 --> 00:23:53,770
我记得我称呼你为"劫匪"吧
"Extortionist" is the word I recall using.

323
00:23:53,838 --> 00:23:55,139
我谈价时很吝啬 没错
I drive a stiff bargain, it's true.

324
00:23:55,206 --> 00:23:56,907
但事实上 我设计了
But the fact is, I have designed

325
00:23:56,975 --> 00:23:58,976
许多更宏大的装置
a more ambitious series of devices

326
00:23:59,044 --> 00:24:01,079
我知道您慧眼识珠
that I know your percipient mind

327
00:24:01,146 --> 00:24:02,347
一定会感兴趣
will take an interest in.

328
00:24:02,414 --> 00:24:04,582
躲开点 混蛋
Move along, vermin.

329
00:24:07,286 --> 00:24:09,920
下次吧
Another time.

330
00:24:10,187 --> 00:24:11,756
也许
Perhaps.

331
00:24:19,197 --> 00:24:22,199
我伤心了 尼科
I'm wounded, Nico.

332
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:23,467
我要喝酒
I need wine.

333
00:24:34,113 --> 00:24:36,414
生意怎么样 琐罗亚斯德?
How goes business, Zoroaster?

334
00:24:36,482 --> 00:24:37,982
自从公爵死后 一直糟透了
Execrable, since the Duke's demise.

335
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,818
佛罗伦萨阴云密布
These are dark times for Florence.

336
00:24:39,885 --> 00:24:42,420
比如那些涌进城的雇佣兵
Case in point. Those mercenaries flooding into town.

337
00:24:42,487 --> 00:24:44,221
假如战争真的爆发
If war does break out,

338
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:45,723
他们是唯一能赚钱的人
they'll be the only ones gainfully employed.

339
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:47,825
说到赚钱
Speaking of employment,

340
00:24:47,893 --> 00:24:50,394
兹托的农场有只牛犊长了两个头 刚出生就死了
a two-headed calf, stillborn on Zitto's farm.

341
00:24:50,462 --> 00:24:51,929
如果你医学研究用的话 我可以给你弄来
I can procure it, if you like, for your medical studies.

342
00:24:51,997 --> 00:24:55,132
上一次你送来的那具尸体都腐烂了
The last corpse was decomposing by the time I took a scalpel to it.

343
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,634
挖坟掘墓和捕鱼一样
Grave-robbing is like fishmongering.

344
00:24:56,702 --> 00:24:58,903
每次都要靠运气
You're at the mercy of the day's catch.

345
00:24:58,971 --> 00:25:01,005
吃猪肠吗?
Come on. A boar sausage?

346
00:25:01,073 --> 00:25:03,508
你知道我是素食主义者
You know damn well that I am a vegetarian.

347
00:25:03,576 --> 00:25:06,477
- 所以我才尽力腐化你  - 噢 我很容易腐化的
- So I keep hoping to corrupt you.  - Oh, I'm corruptible.

348
00:25:06,545 --> 00:25:08,980
我只是不想吃长眼睛的东西
I just prefer not to eat anything with eyes.

349
00:25:09,047 --> 00:25:11,716
- 土豆也会长眼睛  - 滚吧 尼科!
- Potatoes have eyes.  - Fuck off, Nico!

350
00:25:11,784 --> 00:25:13,718
大师!
Maestro!

351
00:25:13,785 --> 00:25:15,786
我能再为您做模特吗?
May I model for you again?

352
00:25:15,854 --> 00:25:18,522
从没有人像您一样眼光独特
No-one looks at my form as you do.

353
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,657
我看什么都眼光独特
No-one looks at any form as I do.

354
00:25:19,725 --> 00:25:21,192
想推销商品去博蒂切利那边吧
Go peddle your wares with Botticelli.

355
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,393
他容易上当
He's an easy mark.

356
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,865
模特? 那孩子只是个骗子
Model? That boy's nothing but a hustler

357
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:28,533
而且骗技很差
and an artless one at that.

358
00:25:28,601 --> 00:25:30,702
但他眼神招人喜爱
But pleasing to the eye, nonetheless.

359
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,571
呸
Piss.

360
00:25:32,638 --> 00:25:34,939
来 看一眼这个
Here. Have a gander at these.

361
00:25:35,007 --> 00:25:37,075
我的最新爱好
My latest venture.

362
00:25:37,142 --> 00:25:39,143
这是塔罗牌
They're called tarot cards.

363
00:25:39,211 --> 00:25:42,881
用来占卜命运
They're used to divine fortunes.

364
00:25:42,948 --> 00:25:47,318
来吧 尼科 抽一张 看看是否和你性情一致
Here. Pick one, Nico. We'll see if it squares with your temperament.

365
00:25:47,386 --> 00:25:49,120
- 有意思 是魔术吧  - 是吗?
- Funny. It's a trick.  - Is it?

366
00:25:49,187 --> 00:25:51,789
也许是远古力量和我的沟通呢?
Or am I simply channeling the powers of The Ancients?

367
00:25:51,857 --> 00:25:53,892
你用这骗过多少女孩 琐罗?
How many women has that line worked on, Zo?

368
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:56,060
一大堆女孩 谢谢夸奖
A respectable amount. Thank you very much.

369
00:25:56,128 --> 00:25:58,162
我也骗过很多男的
And a goodly number of gentlemen, as well.

370
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:01,232
塔罗牌不止能象征性情
But a card can symbolize not just one's temperament,

371
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,869
还能占卜命运
but one's fate.

372
00:26:03,936 --> 00:26:06,071
你敢占卜你的吗?
Do you dare see yours?

373
00:26:13,512 --> 00:26:18,549
告诉我 别隐瞒
Tell me. Don't hold back.

374
00:26:18,616 --> 00:26:20,618
这张...
This one...

375
00:26:20,685 --> 00:26:23,687
代表祭献
represents sacrifice.

376
00:26:23,755 --> 00:26:28,392
在生与死之间游离 然后可能...
A suspension between life and death and then perhaps...

377
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:31,895
迎来伟大的觉醒
a great awakening.

378
00:26:31,963 --> 00:26:34,965
我是个傻瓜
I'm an idiot.

379
00:26:35,032 --> 00:26:37,834
那些雇佣兵 佛罗伦萨没有自己的军队
Those mercenaries. Florence has no army of its own.

380
00:26:37,902 --> 00:26:40,304
所以那些佣兵才来卖命 对吧?
So they're here to sell their muscle. Right?

381
00:26:40,371 --> 00:26:44,374
但要是有更加有利可图的方法呢?
But what if there was a more lucrative way to traffic in the Republic's unease?

382
00:26:44,442 --> 00:26:46,543
- 比如?  - 我应该说自己...
- Like what?  - I should promote myself

383
00:26:46,611 --> 00:26:49,780
去做军事工程师 而不是画家
as a military engineer, not a painter.

384
00:26:49,847 --> 00:26:52,549
战争总是可以推动发展
War has always been the handmaiden of progress.

385
00:26:52,617 --> 00:26:54,351
如果我想继续探索下去
If I want to explore my ideas,

386
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:58,654
我只要以防御佛罗伦萨为借口就可以了
I just need to cloak them in the guise of Florence's defense.

387
00:26:58,722 --> 00:27:01,858
为什么那些夜巡长官在找那个人的麻烦?
Why are the officers of the night bothering that man?

388
00:27:01,926 --> 00:27:05,161
他是土耳其异教徒 原因还不够明显吗?
He's a Turk, a heathen. Isn't that reason enough?

389
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,800
不要管
No.

390
00:27:10,868 --> 00:27:12,803
这不关你的事 莱昂
No, this isn't your fight, Leo.

391
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,272
这种原因能阻止我吗?
When's that ever stopped me?

392
00:27:18,243 --> 00:27:20,211
发生什么事了?
What seems to be the trouble here?

393
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,913
该干嘛干嘛去 画画的
Go back to your sketchbook, scribbler.

394
00:27:21,981 --> 00:27:24,782
这没你的事
This isn't your concern.

395
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,418
你看 很不幸 恩...
You see, unfortunately, um...

396
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:29,587
我有种癖好
I have this character flaw

397
00:27:29,655 --> 00:27:35,293
遇到不平的事我就忍不住要插手 所以...
that compels me to intervene whenever stupidity rears its head, so...

398
00:27:35,361 --> 00:27:37,428
看到了吗? 太笨了
You see? Cos that was stupid.

399
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:39,396
因为你握得太松了
Cos your man's grip was too loose

400
00:27:39,464 --> 00:27:41,432
现在你低头看时
and now he finds himself

401
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:46,770
才发现自己把剑丢了
staring down this handsome spada da filo.

402
00:27:46,838 --> 00:27:48,872
这个更笨了
Even more stupidity.

403
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,308
你去打听打听
Cos if you'd just asked around,

404
00:27:51,376 --> 00:27:53,777
所有人都说我双手灵巧
anyone will tell you that I'm ambidextrous

405
00:27:53,845 --> 00:27:56,914
可以轻松地同时对付两个...
and perfectly capable of fighting two or...

406
00:27:59,684 --> 00:28:01,685
甚至三个人
even three men simultaneously.

407
00:28:01,753 --> 00:28:03,687
欺负别人去吧 德拉戈奈蒂
Bully someone else, Dragonetti.

408
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:12,863
你今晚失算了 艺术家
You've made a serious miscalculation tonight, artista.

409
00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:14,965
反正又不是第一次了
It wouldn't be the first time.

410
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:27,811
- 你还好吧 先生?  - 我很好
- Are you all right, sir?  - I'm more than all right.

411
00:28:27,878 --> 00:28:33,449
我是大地与星空之子
I am a son of Earth and Starry Heaven.

412
00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:36,353
后天我就要回君士坦丁堡了
I return to Constantinople the day after tomorrow.

413
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,357
我住在黑天鹅旅店
But I am staying at the Inn of the Black Swan.

414
00:28:40,425 --> 00:28:42,760
我离开之前来见见我...
Come see me before I leave...

415
00:28:44,696 --> 00:28:46,698
大师
Maestro.

416
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,570
有点怪
A bit weird.

417
00:28:51,638 --> 00:28:55,808
他给你的是什么?
What did he give you?

418
00:28:55,876 --> 00:28:57,977
我觉得 是个提示
A tip, I think.

419
00:28:59,046 --> 00:29:00,646
那是她妈妈
It was her mother.

420
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:04,517
屁股一样 脸可大不一样
The same arse, very different faces

421
00:29:04,585 --> 00:29:08,989
然后 我认出来之后 还小吸了下她奶头
and, when I realized, I did a little sip on her tit.

422
00:29:09,056 --> 00:29:13,425
扶着他 尼科 天啊 他一个人回不了家的
Take him, Nico. Jesus. He'll never make it home alone.

423
00:29:13,493 --> 00:29:16,363
你确定吗 大师? 已经宵禁了 也许有强盗什么的
Are you sure, Maestro? It's after curfew and there are bound to be rogues about.

424
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,664
- 正好适合我 去吧!  - 听着 里奥
- Then I'll fit right in. Go!  - Listen, Leo.

425
00:29:18,732 --> 00:29:19,699
什么?
What?

426
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:23,269
倒吊人那张卡 不是我特意弄的 是你自己选的
I didn't deal you the Hanged Man. That was all you.

427
00:29:23,337 --> 00:29:27,306
那是个预兆 不是什么好兆头
It was an omen. It was just like the two-headed calf.

428
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,875
行了 我不信什么预兆
No, I don't believe in omens.

429
00:29:28,942 --> 00:29:31,210
行了行了 你才会信 走吧
No. No, this is you. Go.

430
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:32,879
快走!
Go!

431
00:29:46,895 --> 00:29:49,831
我知道是你 德拉戈奈蒂
I know it's you, Dragonetti.

432
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:52,533
之前的教训你还没接受啊?
Did you not learn your lesson earlier?

433
00:29:58,306 --> 00:29:59,707
啊
Ah.

434
00:30:00,575 --> 00:30:04,145
看来你接受了
I guess you did learn.

435
00:30:09,618 --> 00:30:11,119
可以了
That's enough.

436
00:30:13,222 --> 00:30:15,056
我早该知道
I should have known.

437
00:30:15,124 --> 00:30:17,292
大家对你议论纷纷
People are talking about you.

438
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,496
就是没什么好评价
And not in a positive light.

439
00:30:20,564 --> 00:30:24,332
我从不在乎别人怎么说我
I couldn't care less what they're saying about me.

440
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,669
我在乎!
I care!

441
00:30:26,737 --> 00:30:29,472
我不能让你玷污家族的名声
I'll not have you tarnishing our family's name

442
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,343
油腔滑调 自我宣传 举止轻佻
with your flippant tone and your vulgar attempts at self-promotion.

443
00:30:34,411 --> 00:30:36,846
那跟我脱离关系好了
Perhaps you should disown me, then.

444
00:30:36,913 --> 00:30:37,880
你是我的长子
You're my first-born.

445
00:30:37,948 --> 00:30:40,816
就算我想跟你脱离父子关系
And much as I may wish to disavow you,

446
00:30:40,884 --> 00:30:43,286
我们的名声总是纠缠一起
our reputations are intertwined.

447
00:30:43,353 --> 00:30:45,655
长子?
First-born?

448
00:30:46,857 --> 00:30:48,824
你说得倒像是...
You say that as if...

449
00:30:48,892 --> 00:30:52,394
我妻子 玛格丽特...
My wife, Margherita...

450
00:30:52,462 --> 00:30:57,666
上周为我生了个儿子
bore me a son this past week.

451
00:30:57,733 --> 00:31:01,236
一个合法继承人
A legitimate heir.

452
00:31:01,304 --> 00:31:04,239
哦 向他表示哀悼
Well, my condolences to him.

453
00:31:04,307 --> 00:31:08,209
不知道他什么时候才会开始痛恨自己的血统
I wonder how long it will take him to curse his lineage.

454
00:31:08,277 --> 00:31:12,314
你不过是个私生子 社会地位就没什么可商量的了
As a bastard, your rank within the social order has been rigidly defined.

455
00:31:12,382 --> 00:31:15,717
你最好老实地接受自己的地位
You should endeavor to remain within it.

456
00:31:15,785 --> 00:31:18,120
离美第奇家族远点 莱昂纳多
Stay away from the Medicis, Leonardo.

457
00:31:18,187 --> 00:31:20,822
- 这是最后一次警告了  - 省省吧
- I'll not warn you again.  - I'll wager you will.

458
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:23,425
你为什么总跟我作对?
Why do you have to make this so difficult?

459
00:31:23,493 --> 00:31:25,995
这是我的天性! 我看到事物的本质
It's my nature! I see things as they are,

460
00:31:26,062 --> 00:31:28,097
而不是表象
not as they might be.

461
00:31:33,236 --> 00:31:34,871
你...
You...

462
00:31:34,938 --> 00:31:37,674
心胸狭隘
are a petty man.

463
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,615
你... 没可能有所作为
And... you will never achieve greatness.

464
00:31:47,952 --> 00:31:49,953
而我...
Where as I...

465
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:53,156
我已经有所作为了
I already have.

466
00:31:58,029 --> 00:32:01,264
你现在跪在地牢里
You're kneeling in a dungeon.

467
00:32:01,332 --> 00:32:04,268
还要继续挨打
About to be hit again and again.

468
00:32:04,335 --> 00:32:08,939
打你的都是个中好手
By men who know how to hit.

469
00:32:09,007 --> 00:32:12,643
你就这点作为了 莱昂纳多
That's what you've achieved, Leonardo.

470
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:24,789
再打一小时
Beat him for another hour,

471
00:32:24,856 --> 00:32:29,327
然后跟其他垃圾一起扔到街上去
then toss him back onto the street with the rest of the garbage.

472
00:32:32,631 --> 00:32:34,265
按住这小子的手
Hold out the scribbler's hand.

473
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:46,375
说真的 你看起来比我还要可怜了 所以...
To be fair, you actually look more wretched than I, so...

474
00:32:46,443 --> 00:32:48,911
你厉害
well done.

475
00:32:48,979 --> 00:32:51,147
还是去看看医生吧
Perhaps you should see a physician.

476
00:32:51,214 --> 00:32:52,681
我没事
I'm fine.

477
00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:56,051
噢 今天有个犹太人要被绞死
Oh, they're executing a Jew today.

478
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:58,254
很显然 他们抓到他闯入了西尔・达街的一家书店
Apparently, they caught him breaking into the book shop on the Via Dei Librai.

479
00:32:58,321 --> 00:33:00,222
会是个不错的盛会
It should be good sport.

480
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,225
我不觉得一个人的死可以被称为盛会
I'm not sure a man's death should be characterized as sport.

481
00:33:03,293 --> 00:33:06,428
这地方太晒了 我们换个阴凉点的地方吧?
This fucking spot is too sunny. Can't we move over into the shade?

482
00:33:06,495 --> 00:33:08,296
- 不行  - 为什么?
- No.  - Why?

483
00:33:08,364 --> 00:33:10,799
因为每天早上 就这个时候
Because every morning, at precisely this time,

484
00:33:10,867 --> 00:33:14,202
卢克蕾齐娅・多纳蒂都会来这里买...
Lucrezia Donati comes to this exact spot to purchase...

485
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,870
鲜花
flowers.

486
00:33:15,938 --> 00:33:18,607
瞧
There.

487
00:33:22,245 --> 00:33:26,648
她很迷人 这点我赞同 但是...
She's appealing, I'll grant you that, but...

488
00:33:26,716 --> 00:33:29,584
我宁肯跟那个没牙老巫婆睡一觉
I'd rather bed that old toothless hag over there.

489
00:33:29,652 --> 00:33:32,687
你这纯属抬扛
Now you're just being contrary.

490
00:33:32,755 --> 00:33:35,157
干漂亮女人不需要什么技巧
It takes no great skill to fuck a pretty face.

491
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:38,326
但要干丑女人 才真正是挑战
But a truly ugly woman, that actually requires discipline

492
00:33:38,394 --> 00:33:40,114
听我说 朋友 搞得好的话
and, let me tell you, my friend, done right,

493
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:42,196
那可真是欲仙欲死
a transcendent experience.

494
00:34:05,288 --> 00:34:08,256
尼科 把这给她送去
Nico, run this over to her.

495
00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:10,325
确保她知道是谁送的
Make sure she knows where it's come from.

496
00:34:12,562 --> 00:34:14,830
里奥 你到底在想些什么?
What the devil are you up to, Leo?

497
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,788
她要跟你说话
She wants to speak with you.

498
00:34:39,855 --> 00:34:42,090
啊哈 告诉她 我忙着呢
Uh-huh? Well, tell her I'm busy.

499
00:34:42,158 --> 00:34:43,926
干嘛不趁热打铁?
You're seriously not turning her down?

500
00:34:43,993 --> 00:34:47,029
去跟她说 尼科 时机未到
Tell her, Nico. Timing is all.

501
00:34:50,801 --> 00:34:52,602
他现在没空
He can't right now.

502
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,310
看哪 我们中的一个罪犯!
Behold, a criminal in our midst!

503
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:01,412
犹太人 又是犹太人!
A Jew, no less!

504
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:05,683
看着他跳! 看着他晃!
Watch him dance! Watch him dangle!

505
00:35:05,751 --> 00:35:07,919
拿好你们的水果和石子!
Bring your fruit and small stones!

506
00:35:07,987 --> 00:35:11,222
上帝保佑佛罗伦萨共和国!
God protect the Republic of Florence!

507
00:35:16,495 --> 00:35:18,830
我是大地与星空之子
I am a son of Earth and Starry Heaven.

508
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:23,133
我渴了
I am thirsty.

509
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:25,169
求你了 从记忆之泉中
Please, give me something to drink

510
00:35:25,236 --> 00:35:26,970
取水给我喝
from the Fountain of Memory.

511
00:35:40,585 --> 00:35:43,187
大师 你没事吧?
Are you all right, Maestro?

512
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:47,958
我得走了
I need to leave.

513
00:35:54,332 --> 00:35:57,601
这里住着个外国人吗? 一个土耳其人?
Is there a foreigner staying here, a Turkish man?

514
00:35:57,668 --> 00:35:59,603
他说你可以到罗马遗迹去找他
He said you could find him at the Roman ruins,

515
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:01,238
就在城北
north of town.

516
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,488
达芬奇 和我一起抽吧?
Will you smoke with me, Da Vinci?

517
00:36:48,555 --> 00:36:51,291
那要看烟管里装了什么
Well, that depends on what's in the pipe.

518
00:37:05,673 --> 00:37:08,642
历史就如同武器一般
History is a lie that has been honed like a weapon

519
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:11,444
被那些意欲掩盖真相的人肆意改动 只剩谎言
by people who have suppressed the truth.

520
00:37:11,511 --> 00:37:13,479
几百年后 你自己的历史
Centuries from now, your own history

521
00:37:13,547 --> 00:37:16,282
也会被掩盖
will also be suppressed.

522
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,484
你怎么可能知道?
How could you possibly know that?

523
00:37:18,552 --> 00:37:21,821
你听过这句话吗? "时间是一条河流"
You have heard the phrase "Time is a river"?

524
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:23,890
所不为人知的是
What most fail to grasp

525
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:26,559
河流是一个循环
is that the river is circular.

526
00:37:26,627 --> 00:37:28,395
一个人死去...
One man's death...

527
00:37:28,462 --> 00:37:31,231
为另一个人的降生敞开了大门
opens a doorway to the birth of the next.

528
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:35,634
我今天看到一个人被绞死了
I saw a man executed today.

529
00:37:35,702 --> 00:37:36,669
他对我说了些话
He said something to me.

530
00:37:36,736 --> 00:37:38,904
- 我是...  - 大地与
- I am...  - A son of Earth

531
00:37:38,972 --> 00:37:40,940
星空之子
and Starry Heaven.

532
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,976
我渴了
I am thirsty.

533
00:37:43,044 --> 00:37:45,312
求你了 从记忆之泉中
Please, give me something to drink

534
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,848
取水给我喝
from the Fountain of Memory.

535
00:37:49,284 --> 00:37:50,717
这是一句祷词
It is an invocation.

536
00:37:50,785 --> 00:37:52,186
我们同族之间
A way for members of our fraternity

537
00:37:52,253 --> 00:37:53,353
互相辨认的暗语
to recognize one another.

538
00:37:53,421 --> 00:37:55,456
我又不是你们一族
I'm not a member of your fraternity.

539
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,924
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

540
00:37:59,628 --> 00:38:02,563
这座庙宇曾是一个宗教的礼拜堂
This temple was once a place of worship

541
00:38:02,631 --> 00:38:04,731
而这个宗教 历史比基督教
for a religion that originated

542
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:07,734
更加久远
long before Christ.

543
00:38:07,802 --> 00:38:10,837
我们被称为密特拉(波斯太阳神)之子
We are known as the Sons of Mithras.

544
00:38:10,905 --> 00:38:12,705
大多数你们所谓的"进步"
Much of what you call 'progress'

545
00:38:12,773 --> 00:38:16,910
不过都是些一度失落的回忆
has simply been a matter of remembering what was once forgotten.

546
00:38:16,977 --> 00:38:18,945
这些知识都被记录在
This knowledge was set down

547
00:38:19,013 --> 00:38:22,983
一本被称为"叶之书"的典籍里
in a compendium known as the Book of Leaves.

548
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:27,788
最近 关于这本书所在之处的种种线索 逐渐浮出水面
Recently, certain clues have surfaced regarding the Book's location.

549
00:38:27,856 --> 00:38:30,624
阿乌拉罕・本・尤瑟夫被逮捕并处死前
Avraham ben Yosef was following those clues

550
00:38:30,692 --> 00:38:34,795
就一直在追寻这些线索
when he was apprehended and put to death.

551
00:38:34,863 --> 00:38:40,434
梵蒂冈的密令 不知你是否有所耳闻?
Perhaps you have heard of the Secret Archives the Vatican has assembled?

552
00:38:40,502 --> 00:38:44,671
密令的管理人 叫卢珀・梅克里
Its curator is a man called Lupo Mercuri.

553
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,707
密特拉族人的叛徒
A fallen son of Mithras.

554
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:51,745
我们追求的是传播和保护知识
Where we seek to disseminate and preserve knowledge.

555
00:38:51,813 --> 00:38:54,415
而他们篡改知识 限制知识传播
They seek to alter and suppress it.

556
00:38:54,482 --> 00:38:56,417
我还是... 我还是不明白
I still... I still don't understand

557
00:38:56,485 --> 00:38:59,620
这些跟我有什么关系
what any of this has to do with me.

558
00:38:59,688 --> 00:39:02,757
你对你母亲... 有什么印象?
What do you know... about your mother?

559
00:39:02,825 --> 00:39:05,259
几乎没有
Almost nothing.

560
00:39:05,994 --> 00:39:08,029
她... 她失踪了
She... she disappeared.

561
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:13,200
- 她是个女仆  - 她是个奴隶
- She was a servant girl.  - She was a slave.

562
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:17,037
被强行从君士坦丁堡带走了
Taken from Constantinople against her will.

563
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,706
你是否记得...
Do you remember...

564
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:22,210
童年时代遭遇过的什么事故吗?
an incident that occurred in your childhood?

565
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,548
你一直压制这段记忆
You have suppressed it.

566
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:35,556
我小时候在芬奇
I was a boy in Vinci.

567
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,963
被派去寻找丢失的羊群
I'd been sent to fetch some sheep that had wandered off.

568
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:44,065
我发现了一个山洞
I found a cave.

569
00:39:46,769 --> 00:39:48,570
我不敢进去 但...
I was scared to go inside, but...

570
00:39:50,172 --> 00:39:52,540
但我很好奇
But I was curious.

571
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:56,011
还是冒险进去了
So I ventured in.

572
00:39:57,613 --> 00:40:02,884
然后的事情... 我想不起来了
The next hours... are blank.

573
00:40:02,952 --> 00:40:06,821
我记得...
I remember...

574
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:10,525
踉跄地走出来
stumbling out.

575
00:40:10,592 --> 00:40:12,894
我的手上脸上...
My hands and face...

576
00:40:15,797 --> 00:40:17,765
都沾满了血
were covered in blood.

577
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,801
不知何故...
And somehow...

578
00:40:19,868 --> 00:40:22,871
我清楚那不是我的血
I knew it wasn't my own.

579
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:28,310
总有一天...
One day...

580
00:40:28,377 --> 00:40:31,980
你将饮下记忆之泉的水...
you will sip from the Fountain of Memory...

581
00:40:32,047 --> 00:40:36,851
想起更多你在洞中的经历
and learn more of what occurred in that cave.

582
00:40:36,919 --> 00:40:39,154
到那一天 我们还会再见
When that day comes, we will meet again.

583
00:40:39,221 --> 00:40:42,156
在那之前我应该怎么做?
What do I do till then?

584
00:40:42,224 --> 00:40:44,392
寻找"叶之书"
Search for the Book of Leaves.

585
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,262
莱昂纳多 命运选择了你
Fate has chosen you, Leonardo.

586
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:53,001
- 我不相信命运  - 那就相信你自己
- I don't believe in fate.  - Then believe in yourself.

587
00:40:53,069 --> 00:40:55,436
好吧 那么我该从何处开始寻找?
Well, where do I start my search, then?

588
00:40:55,504 --> 00:41:00,008
从绞死的人入手 从灵魂深处入手
With the hanged man, the seat of the soul.

589
00:41:00,075 --> 00:41:02,344
他已经为你打开了一扇门
He's already opened the door for you.

590
00:41:02,411 --> 00:41:05,380
那我母亲?
And my mother?

591
00:41:05,448 --> 00:41:09,986
她将在彼端等待着你
She will be for you on the other side.

592
00:41:12,022 --> 00:41:13,989
你需要做的就是...
All you have to do...

593
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:16,625
进入那扇门
is enter.

594
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:28,570
大师? 大师? 能听到吗?
Maestro? Maestro? Can you hear me?

595
00:41:28,638 --> 00:41:31,740
大师!
Maestro!

596
00:41:31,808 --> 00:41:34,243
我们从昨晚就在找你 发生了什么事?
We've been looking for you since last night. What happened?

597
00:41:39,815 --> 00:41:41,649
那个土耳其人当时在这儿
The Turk was here.

598
00:41:45,187 --> 00:41:48,589
这儿原先还有... 还有一座雕像
There was... there was a statue.

599
00:41:48,657 --> 00:41:50,258
是个祭坛
An altar.

600
00:41:50,325 --> 00:41:52,293
得有一吨重
Must have weighed a ton.

601
00:41:52,361 --> 00:41:54,962
里奥 这地方都荒废很久了
This place has been empty for centuries, Leo.

602
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:58,097
大师 夜巡官一直在找你
Maestro, the Officers of the Night have been searching for you.

603
00:41:58,166 --> 00:42:00,835
他们说洛伦佐・美第奇本人要接见你
They say Lorenzo Medici himself has asked for you.

604
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:44,646
你是莱昂纳多・迪・瑟・皮耶罗...
Leonardo di ser Piero...

605
00:42:44,713 --> 00:42:46,414
达芬奇
Da Vinci.

606
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:51,353
听说你是我公证员的私生子
I am told you are my notary's bastard son.

607
00:42:53,222 --> 00:42:54,622
没错
I am.

608
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:57,025
我还听说你是个惹事精
I'm also told that you are a troublemaker,

609
00:42:57,093 --> 00:43:00,128
傲慢自大 无视尊长...
you are arrogant, impolitic...

610
00:43:00,196 --> 00:43:03,696
还完全不懂得保留自己的想法
and utterly incapable of keeping your opinions to yourself.

611
00:43:03,766 --> 00:43:07,936
傲慢自大 说明我夸大了自己的价值
Arrogance implies that I exaggerate my own worth.

612
00:43:08,004 --> 00:43:09,505
我没有
I don't.

613
00:43:12,642 --> 00:43:15,645
我的女人 卢克蕾齐娅
My mistress, Lucrezia,

614
00:43:15,713 --> 00:43:20,054
似乎觉得你有非凡的绘画天赋
seems to think that you have a singular talent for portraiture.

615
00:43:20,118 --> 00:43:24,088
她坚持认为 除了你 没有人能够...
She insisted that you and none other be the one to...

616
00:43:24,156 --> 00:43:26,257
捕捉到她的美貌
capture her beauty.

617
00:43:26,324 --> 00:43:28,425
那我要说她有双识人的慧眼
I'd say she has a discerning eye, then.

618
00:43:28,493 --> 00:43:29,508
长官 给您个警醒 
A warning, sir. 

619
00:43:29,508 --> 00:43:33,931
这家伙只拿钱不干活是出了名的
The man has a reputation for taking many commissions, but finishing few.

620
00:43:33,999 --> 00:43:37,635
我经常斟酌细节 所以容易厌烦
I wrestle with details. I bore easily.

621
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:39,703
这算是性格缺陷吧
Call it a character flaw.

622
00:43:39,771 --> 00:43:42,406
接了这份活
Well, with this commission,

623
00:43:42,474 --> 00:43:43,941
你最好能克服这个缺陷
you'd be wise to overcome it.

624
00:43:44,009 --> 00:43:46,310
要画多纳蒂小姐的话
When it comes to Miss Donati,

625
00:43:46,378 --> 00:43:49,480
我绝对不会感到厌烦
boredom is the last thing I fear.

626
00:43:53,652 --> 00:43:56,053
那我就让你父亲起草合同啦
I'll have your father draw up a contract then.

627
00:43:56,121 --> 00:43:58,889
长官 不知当讲不当讲 我还有些其他设计...
Sir, if I may, I have a few other designs...

628
00:44:04,363 --> 00:44:08,766
有些设计 或许你会感兴趣
I have some designs that I think you might be interested in.

629
00:44:08,834 --> 00:44:12,270
这将会极大地增强你手下炮手的火力
This will greatly increase your gunner's rate of firepower.

630
00:44:12,338 --> 00:44:14,339
当上层的炮架发射弹药的同时
So, while the top rack's being fired,

631
00:44:14,407 --> 00:44:16,508
下层的炮架可以装填弹药
the rack below that one can be loaded

632
00:44:16,575 --> 00:44:19,110
再下层的炮架就有时间冷却
and the rack below that one is allowed to cool.

633
00:44:19,178 --> 00:44:21,546
炮管呈扇形排开 能够...
The cannons are arranged in a fan, which...

634
00:44:21,614 --> 00:44:24,282
- 够了 达芬奇  - 这是一辆装甲车
- That will be enough. Da Vinci.   - This is an armored cart.

635
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:27,652
由两名藏在其中的士兵推动
Propulsion is achieved by two men, who are housed within.

636
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,289
通过转动曲柄 带动车轮前进
They operate cranks, which rotate the wheels.

637
00:44:30,357 --> 00:44:32,792
炮管可以安置在车的四周
Cannons can be mounted around the perimeter of the cart.

638
00:44:44,472 --> 00:44:46,573
这是架飞行机器
It's a flying machine.

639
00:44:46,641 --> 00:44:48,675
仿自蝙蝠铰接式的翅膀
It's modeled after the articulated wings of a bat.

640
00:44:48,743 --> 00:44:50,710
疯了 如果人要能飞的话...
Madness. If man were meant to fly...

641
00:44:50,778 --> 00:44:52,846
那生来就该有翅膀 没错
He would have been born with wings. Yes.

642
00:44:52,913 --> 00:44:55,881
但是人类发明火药 以及其他的一些发明之前 甚至发现火之前
But a similar assertion could have been made prior to the invention of gunpowder

643
00:44:55,883 --> 00:45:00,420
也有人有类似的论断吧
or any other invention conceived since fire.

644
00:45:00,487 --> 00:45:03,489
我相信人类能征服蓝天 我之所以这么认为
I believe man will fly and I base this assumption

645
00:45:03,557 --> 00:45:05,290
是因为上帝给了我们思想
on the fact that God has blessed us

646
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:08,227
能够想象的大脑
with minds that are capable of imagining it.

647
00:45:08,294 --> 00:45:12,232
人们所梦想的一切 最终都能实现
Anything that can be dreamt of will eventually be built.

648
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,736
不同意我的人 都是傻子
Anyone who says otherwise is a fool.

649
00:45:18,139 --> 00:45:20,541
你到底想干什么?
What exactly do you propose?

650
00:45:20,608 --> 00:45:22,743
我想受雇...
I wish to be employed...

651
00:45:22,811 --> 00:45:26,046
成为军事工程师
as a military engineer.

652
00:45:26,114 --> 00:45:28,081
达芬奇 我是个人道主义者
I am a humanist, Da Vinci.

653
00:45:28,149 --> 00:45:30,550
我无意发动战争
I have no interest in waging war.

654
00:45:30,618 --> 00:45:33,821
但正是由于你的人道主义 才会发生战争
And yet your humanism is precisely why war will happen.

655
00:45:33,889 --> 00:45:35,857
弗罗伦萨没有常备军
Florence has no standing army.

656
00:45:35,925 --> 00:45:37,892
罗马也没有
Nor does Rome.

657
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,862
出于需要...
Necessarily...

658
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:42,698
你们都和拥有常备军的国家结了盟
you've both made alliances with states that do.

659
00:45:42,765 --> 00:45:44,733
弗洛伦萨和米兰结盟
Florence with Milan,

660
00:45:44,801 --> 00:45:47,903
罗马和纳普勒斯结盟
and Rome with Naples.

661
00:45:47,971 --> 00:45:51,373
斯福尔扎遇刺 颠覆了游戏规则
Sforza's death has up-ended the game board.

662
00:45:51,441 --> 00:45:54,043
殿下 您需要属于自己的武器
You need weapons of your own, Your Magnificence.

663
00:45:59,248 --> 00:46:03,117
我给你一笔合适的经费
I will give you a modest stipend.

664
00:46:03,185 --> 00:46:05,152
看这些能否...
To see whether these...

665
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,589
你的这些奇妙装置能否最终实现
contraptions of yours can actually be realized.

666
00:46:08,657 --> 00:46:11,092
- 给100佛罗林如何?  - 50
- Shall we say 100 florins?  - 50.

667
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,928
你再讨价还价 我就割下你的舌头
If you haggle any further, I'll cut out your tongue.

668
00:46:13,996 --> 00:46:16,230
您说了算 长官
As you say, sir.

669
00:46:16,298 --> 00:46:18,166
谢谢
Thank you.

670
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:21,737
你利用卢克蕾齐娅来接近我 对吧?
You used Lucrezia to gain access to me, didn't you?

671
00:46:21,804 --> 00:46:23,873
我会利用一切手段
I utilize any device at my disposal,

672
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,908
来实现我的目标
in order to realize my goals.

673
00:46:25,976 --> 00:46:27,643
聪明
Clever,

674
00:46:27,711 --> 00:46:30,379
但我警告你 替我干活 别聪明过头了
but I'd caution you not to be too clever around me.

675
00:46:30,447 --> 00:46:32,448
钟表的内部构造
Clockwork loses its luster,

676
00:46:32,515 --> 00:46:37,619
只要被看穿 也就会失去魅力
once one glimpses the gears beneath its face.

677
00:46:37,687 --> 00:46:39,021
您说得对
Point taken.

678
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:56,805
有什么问题吗?
Is there a problem?

679
00:46:56,873 --> 00:46:58,874
没有 长官
None at all, sir.

680
00:46:58,942 --> 00:47:01,310
再见
Good day.

681
00:47:11,588 --> 00:47:15,124
- 祝贺你 莱昂纳多  - 消息传得真快
- Congratulations, Leonardo.  - Word travels fast.

682
00:47:15,192 --> 00:47:17,093
弗洛伦萨哪有什么秘密
Ah, there are no secrets in Florence.

683
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,028
你到底怎么做到的呢?
How the devil did you do it?

684
00:47:19,095 --> 00:47:20,796
哦 他利用了一个女人的虚荣
Oh, he played on a woman's vanity.

685
00:47:20,864 --> 00:47:23,265
你个混蛋 你的计谋我们看得一清二楚
Your stratagem has become clear, you bastard.

686
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:26,001
他是一流的混蛋
A bastard of the highest order.

687
00:47:26,069 --> 00:47:28,103
哈! 大伙干杯
Ha! Drink up everybody.

688
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:32,975
之后回去工作 我们还得做只焰鸽呢!
Then get back to work. We've got a colombina to build!

689
00:47:33,043 --> 00:47:35,244
你去把被绞死犹太人的尸体挖出来
The Jew that was hanged, I want you to unearth his body.

690
00:47:35,245 --> 00:47:36,645
我要检查检查
I need to examine it.

691
00:47:36,713 --> 00:47:38,514
给我什么报酬?
And my compensation?

692
00:47:38,582 --> 00:47:40,949
得看尸体烂成什么样了
Well, that depends how fresh the corpse is.

693
00:47:41,017 --> 00:47:42,952
那我最好现在就开挖
Ah, well, then, I'd best get digging.

694
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,735
帕锡家族来了
Ah, here's the Pazzi clan.

695
00:48:35,803 --> 00:48:38,772
还有他们的阴谋家弗朗西斯科和老男人雅各布
With their schemer Francesco and old man Jacopo.

696
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:41,440
可能是佛罗伦萨最老的家族
Probably the oldest family in Florence,

697
00:48:41,508 --> 00:48:43,809
但绝对是地位最低的
definitely the most ornery.

698
00:48:51,818 --> 00:48:56,321
帕锡家族委托洛伦佐・德・美第奇
The Pazzi family entrusts Lorenzo de Medici

699
00:48:56,389 --> 00:48:58,357
将这束新火
with this new fire,

700
00:48:58,424 --> 00:49:02,494
插在圣墓大教堂的石座上
struck on stones from the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.

701
00:49:02,562 --> 00:49:04,563
以行使我们的权力
As is our right.

702
00:49:04,631 --> 00:49:06,599
行使我们祖先在第一次十字军东征时
Granted to our ancestor for his actions

703
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:08,167
所获得的权力
during the First Crusade.

704
00:49:27,286 --> 00:49:29,854
焰鸽即将翱翔
The colombina is about to fly.

705
00:49:37,229 --> 00:49:41,532
欢迎你们所有人来到上帝之家
Welcome, all of you, into God's home.

706
00:51:15,828 --> 00:51:19,798
凤凰的火焰和你很配
The flames of the phoenix suit you well.

707
00:51:19,865 --> 00:51:21,466
老实告诉我
Tell me, truly,

708
00:51:21,534 --> 00:51:25,336
你对和你上床的妓女们 都这么念念不忘吗?
are you always this wistful with the whores you bed?

709
00:51:25,404 --> 00:51:27,806
哦 你不是妓女 夫人
Oh, you are no whore, Signora.

710
00:51:29,175 --> 00:51:32,577
没必要再装下去了 多纳蒂小姐
We need not continue this pretence any longer, Miss Donati.

711
00:51:32,645 --> 00:51:35,647
从你接近我的一开始我就知道是你
I knew it was you from the moment you approached me.

712
00:51:35,714 --> 00:51:37,682
你怎么知道的?
How did you know?

713
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,652
我画过你
I sketched you.

714
00:51:42,121 --> 00:51:46,124
一颦一笑 一动一静 一言一行
Your features, your form, your bearing.

715
00:51:46,192 --> 00:51:49,328
更重要的是...
The more salient question...

716
00:51:49,395 --> 00:51:52,864
为何高贵如你
is why would a noblewoman

717
00:51:52,932 --> 00:51:56,067
却不惜自毁名誉委身于一个低贱的画师呢?
risk her reputation on a lowly artisan?

718
00:51:58,338 --> 00:52:01,774
这不是狂欢的意义吗?
Well, isn't that the point of a carnival?

719
00:52:01,841 --> 00:52:04,843
装作你不是你自己 然后一夜风流
To pretend, for a night, that you're someone you're not.

720
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:07,379
不 我觉得不止这样
No, I think there's more to it than that, yeah.

721
00:52:07,446 --> 00:52:08,713
那说给我听听
Tell me, then.

722
00:52:10,717 --> 00:52:12,684
你被我的画迷住了
You were intrigued by my sketch.

723
00:52:12,752 --> 00:52:14,353
对 所以...
Yeah, so...

724
00:52:16,323 --> 00:52:20,026
你感觉它勾勒出了你的另一面
You felt that it captured an aspect of yourself

725
00:52:20,094 --> 00:52:23,163
这是你的丈夫 你的情人洛伦佐
that remains hidden from your husband,

726
00:52:23,231 --> 00:52:25,766
都没有发现的
and from your lover, Lorenzo.

727
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:32,372
而你也只是在...
The only time you see this aspect...

728
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,473
照镜子的时候
is on the rare occasions

729
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:34,875
才看到自己的另一面
that you glimpse yourself in the mirror,

730
00:52:34,942 --> 00:52:39,046
镜中的你 仿佛一个陌生人 回看着自己
and you find a stranger staring back at you.

731
00:52:42,184 --> 00:52:43,918
你知道我会再把你找出来
You knew I'd seek you out, then.

732
00:52:45,588 --> 00:52:48,089
哈...
Well...

733
00:52:48,157 --> 00:52:51,259
嘿 我试着先发现人们行为的动机
Hey, I try to work out what motivates people

734
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:54,563
然后就顺水推舟
and then I proceed accordingly.

735
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:55,630
你掌控他们
You manipulate them.

736
00:52:55,698 --> 00:52:57,065
不 我更愿意看做是 稍微地
No. I prefer to think of it as gently

737
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:58,667
把他们重新找回自己
redirecting their trajectories.

738
00:53:18,188 --> 00:53:21,591
洛伦佐对你的设计很感兴趣
Lorenzo was quite taken with your designs.

739
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:24,061
我可以看一下这些奇迹吗?
Well, may I see one of these marvels?

740
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:39,977
这是什么?
What is it?

741
00:53:40,045 --> 00:53:42,546
这是一个减慢下降速度的装置
It's a device for slowing one's rate of descent.

742
00:53:42,614 --> 00:53:44,247
- 哦  - 嗯
- Oh.  - Yeah.

743
00:53:44,315 --> 00:53:47,718
那我什么时候才可能用到它呢?
And under what circumstances would I possibly have use for this?

744
00:53:49,987 --> 00:53:52,388
比方说你被困在堡垒里
Say that you were trapped in a fortress.

745
00:53:52,456 --> 00:53:56,392
- 堡垒?  - 被攻陷的堡垒
- A fortress?  - A fortress that had been breached.

746
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,961
你可以这个绑在身上...
You could strap yourself into this...

747
00:53:59,029 --> 00:54:01,497
就能安全落地 重获自由
and you'd safely float down to freedom.

748
00:54:01,565 --> 00:54:03,165
哦 谢谢老天
Oh, thank goodness.

749
00:54:07,037 --> 00:54:10,139
难怪洛伦佐对会你这么感兴趣
It would appear Lorenzo's interest in you was justified.

750
00:54:10,207 --> 00:54:12,742
不过告诉我
But tell me.

751
00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:16,646
我冒着身败名裂的险和你同床
I have risked my reputation by sleeping with you.

752
00:54:16,714 --> 00:54:18,615
你付出了更大的代价
You've risked more.

753
00:54:18,683 --> 00:54:21,751
说不定是生命
Perhaps even death.

754
00:54:21,819 --> 00:54:25,089
我这么不顾一切 你觉得是为什么?
And to what do you ascribe my reckless behavior, then?

755
00:54:25,157 --> 00:54:26,324
爱
Love.

756
00:54:26,391 --> 00:54:28,059
别开玩笑了
Don't be absurd.

757
00:54:28,126 --> 00:54:30,428
过目难忘 画眉描香 日思夜想
You saw me, you drew me, you fell in love.

758
00:54:30,496 --> 00:54:32,296
就这么简单
It's as simple as that.

759
00:54:32,364 --> 00:54:35,232
事实上我就是禁果
Add in the fact that I am forbidden fruit...

760
00:54:37,034 --> 00:54:39,535
你命中注定爱上我
and your fate was sealed.

761
00:54:43,874 --> 00:54:46,742
你是这星期第三个跟我说命运的人
You're the third person this week to lecture me on fate.

762
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:50,346
也许这正是你该听的时候
Well, perhaps it's time you started listening.

763
00:54:50,414 --> 00:54:52,248
现在...
Now...

764
00:54:57,588 --> 00:55:00,691
再和我做一次 莱昂纳多
Fuck me again, Leonardo.

765
00:55:00,758 --> 00:55:04,762
这次 记好了...
This time, remember...

766
00:55:06,898 --> 00:55:09,900
你不是唯一一个有掌控权的人
you're not the only one capable of manipulation.

767
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,181
这密令只对
The Secret Archives are open

768
00:55:24,249 --> 00:55:28,419
教皇最亲近的顾问开放
only to his Holiness' closest advisors.

769
00:55:28,486 --> 00:55:32,923
显然 我们不能让你进前面的门了
For obvious reasons, we can't have you parading through the front door.

770
00:55:32,991 --> 00:55:35,593
啊
Ah.

771
00:55:35,661 --> 00:55:39,464
真是失礼了
How rude of me.

772
00:55:39,531 --> 00:55:42,567
我答应过要先给你报酬
I promised you your payment first.

773
00:55:49,308 --> 00:55:52,209
你满意了?
I take it you're satisfied?

774
00:56:16,803 --> 00:56:18,771
陛下
Your Eminence,

775
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:20,839
我从佛罗伦萨带来了消息
I bring news from Florence.

776
00:56:20,907 --> 00:56:22,875
那就快点说
Get on with it, then.

777
00:56:22,943 --> 00:56:25,944
有个新人出现了
A new player has entered the stage.

778
00:56:26,012 --> 00:56:29,881
一个叫做莱昂纳多・达芬奇的画师
An artist known as Leonardo Da Vinci.

779
00:56:29,949 --> 00:56:34,052
美第奇家族雇他设计攻城武器
The Medicis have employed him to design siege weapons.

780
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,589
画师就跟宫廷弄臣一样普通
Artists are as common as court jesters.

781
00:56:37,657 --> 00:56:41,293
我看不出这个消息哪里关系到我们
I see no reason why this news should concern us.

782
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,963
这个画师不一样 他的想法都...
This artist is different. His ideas are...

783
00:56:45,031 --> 00:56:45,997
不同寻常
unusual,

784
00:56:46,065 --> 00:56:48,033
富有革新意义
revolutionary.

785
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:51,103
这是我在佛罗伦萨的线人
My agent in Florence.

786
00:56:58,244 --> 00:57:00,946
你相信一个女人的情报?
You trust your intelligence to a woman?

787
00:57:01,014 --> 00:57:03,314
当要传递情报时
When one seeks to convey a message,

788
00:57:03,382 --> 00:57:07,185
我更愿意选择容易被忽视的人
I prefer to use vessels others would readily dismiss.

789
00:57:07,253 --> 00:57:10,222
要是我没看错 你就是卢珀・梅克里
If I am not mistaken, you are Lupo Mercuri,

790
00:57:10,289 --> 00:57:11,957
密令的管理人
Curator of the Secret Archives.

791
00:57:12,024 --> 00:57:14,126
- 这有什么关系?  - 你也许会有兴趣
- What of it?  - It may interest you to know

792
00:57:14,193 --> 00:57:16,328
达芬奇已经接触过了...
that Da Vinci has made contact...

793
00:57:16,395 --> 00:57:18,496
那个土耳其人
with the Turk.

794
00:57:18,564 --> 00:57:22,767
他在找一个叫"叶之书"的东西
He's searching for something called the Book of Leaves.

795
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:27,573
似乎土耳其人找到了新的守护神
It would appear the Turk has found a new champion.

796
00:57:30,076 --> 00:57:32,077
继续监视他
Continue watching him.

797
00:57:32,145 --> 00:57:34,179
看能不能收拢他
See if he can be co-opted.

798
00:57:34,247 --> 00:57:36,948
要是不能呢?
And if he can't?

799
00:57:37,016 --> 00:57:38,983
那达芬奇将陷入
Then Da Vinci will be consumed

800
00:57:39,051 --> 00:57:42,054
炽热恐惧的地狱
in the fiery sorrows of hell

801
00:57:42,121 --> 00:57:45,591
如同上帝的敌人一样
along with the rest of God's enemies.

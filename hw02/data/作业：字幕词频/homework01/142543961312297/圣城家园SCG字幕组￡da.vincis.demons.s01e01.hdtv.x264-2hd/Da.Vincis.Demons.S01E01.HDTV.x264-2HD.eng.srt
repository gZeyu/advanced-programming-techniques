1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:31,000


3
00:00:49,151 --> 00:01:00,018


4
00:01:06,797 --> 00:01:08,831
Will you smoke with me, Da Vinci?

5
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:12,268
Well, that depends on what's in the pipe.

6
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:15,939
It is a mixture of tobacco and black hellebore

7
00:01:16,073 --> 00:01:18,475
and is rumored to induce visions

8
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:20,210
and summon demons.

9
00:01:20,278 --> 00:01:22,478
Well, I believe in neither.

10
00:01:22,546 --> 00:01:27,217
Then why do you struggle so hard to keep both at bay?

11
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,331
History is a lie that has been honed like a weapon

12
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,701
by people who have suppressed the truth.

13
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,237
The knowledge you are destined to learn

14
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,006
will upend the established order of things.

15
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,209
How could you possibly know that?

16
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,996
You have heard the phrase 'Time is a river'?

17
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:52,379
Yes.

18
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:57,250
What most fail to grasp is that the river is circular.

19
00:01:57,318 --> 00:02:00,020
One man's death opens a doorway

20
00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:01,755
to the birth of the next.

21
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:03,957
Would you like to know how

22
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:06,426
this particular doorway opened?

23
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:07,894
Yes.

24
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:10,864
Be forewarned, then.

25
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:14,268
Some doorways lead into darkness.

26
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,500


27
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,729
Out you go, boy. Get on with you!

28
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:58,075
Go on! Go on!

29
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:06,883
Cicco!

30
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:13,320
- What day is it today?  - Palm Sunday.

31
00:03:13,388 --> 00:03:14,955
Oh, balls.

32
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:17,724
The Duchess and your children are already at the church.

33
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,826
Could you round me up some coddled eggs?

34
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:26,563
I have a beastly hangover and my bowels are in a tumble.

35
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:28,698
I'll be dressed in but a minute.

36
00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:53,317
At ease, people, I've arrived!

37
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,322
Be gone, you artless fuckwit. This is my moment.

38
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,923
And thanks to the Secret Archives,

39
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:05,025
it's the last you will ever enjoy!

40
00:04:26,814 --> 00:04:29,082
Tell me a secret, Leonardo.

41
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,020
What was your... earliest memory?

42
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:35,122
Or better yet,

43
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,158
your greatest fear?

44
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:38,826
In my case...

45
00:04:38,894 --> 00:04:40,862
the two go hand-in-hand.

46
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,397
I was...um...

47
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:44,299
I was six months old.

48
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,301
No-one remembers back that far.

49
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,869
Well, perhaps I'm unique, then.

50
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:51,273
- Oh.  - My mother... um...

51
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:57,179
put me in a cradle out in the field.

52
00:04:57,246 --> 00:05:00,415
And a falcon flew down. I can still recall it.

53
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:04,419
It just perched there, looking at me

54
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:06,254
almost as if it were trying to reveal

55
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:08,657
some kind of mystery.

56
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,225
My mother drove it away.

57
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:13,095
Yet, as clear as that memory is,

58
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:15,330
the one thing I can never recall...

59
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,300
is my mother's face.

60
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:23,973
I can draw anything I've seen, even in passing.

61
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:28,311
But when it comes to my mother, all I see is a void.

62
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:30,713
She disappeared that night and I've been...

63
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:32,816
trying to recall her face ever since.

64
00:05:32,884 --> 00:05:35,185
All men are searching for their mothers.

65
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:37,554
That's what guides you between our thighs.

66
00:05:37,622 --> 00:05:39,589
I pay you to pose, Vanessa.

67
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:41,857
Not to plumb the innermost depths of my character.

68
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,226
If you expect me to bare my figure for you,

69
00:05:44,294 --> 00:05:47,930
I expect you to bare your soul in return.

70
00:05:47,998 --> 00:05:51,167
So, tell me, is there nothing else you fear?

71
00:05:57,808 --> 00:05:59,776
Only imperfection.

72
00:05:59,844 --> 00:06:01,945
Maestro! Maestro!

73
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:04,982
You're late, Nico.

74
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,718
You're late. Verrocchio's been looking for you.

75
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:10,354
Well, he can wait. We've an experiment to conduct.

76
00:06:10,422 --> 00:06:12,589
You're meant to play a principal role in it.

77
00:06:12,657 --> 00:06:14,692
- Come on!  - Hello.

78
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,828
They're called breasts, Nico. Every woman possesses them.

79
00:06:17,896 --> 00:06:19,997
Nico! That's Vanessa.

80
00:06:20,064 --> 00:06:22,966
She's newly liberated from the Convent of St Anthony.

81
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:26,637
Now help me do this.

82
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:28,672
Climb into that harness.

83
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,541
Hey today,

84
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:32,678
we are attempting to ascertain whether or not

85
00:06:32,746 --> 00:06:35,181
this kite can provide the necessary wind resistance

86
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:36,382
to support your weight.

87
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,151
Well, Maestro, what if it can't?

88
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:40,987
Vanessa, do you mind just dancing about for a moment?

89
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:43,022
You see? Those weighted ribbons

90
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,424
allow me to calculate the strength

91
00:06:44,492 --> 00:06:45,959
and direction of the wind.

92
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:49,763
In this case, I would say... it's about 20 knots

93
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:51,799
and shifting...

94
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:53,467
westerly.

95
00:06:56,738 --> 00:06:59,740
Wait, Maestro! What if your calculations are wrong?

96
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08,784
Wait, wait, Maestro! Oh, Maestro, please, please stop!

97
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:12,855
Oh, wait, Maestro. Maestro!

98
00:07:27,004 --> 00:07:28,772
Oh, my God, please!

99
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:41,253
Yes!

100
00:07:41,321 --> 00:07:44,490
You're flying, Nico!

101
00:07:44,558 --> 00:07:46,526
Maestro-o-o!

102
00:07:47,161 --> 00:07:48,728
It's perfect!

103
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:01,776
You're too high! Not so high.

104
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:03,611
Nico!

105
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:39,613
It works! It works, Maestro!

106
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:42,516
I never had any doubts.

107
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,688
Oh, God, I hate this place.

108
00:08:47,755 --> 00:08:50,390
What? Where else could we practice our flights

109
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,192
but in Florence?

110
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,528
Anywhere else, we'd just be burnt at the stake

111
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:55,662
for our efforts.

112
00:08:56,998 --> 00:08:59,999
But here? I'm just another free-thinking heretic.

113
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:01,835
Chaos. Culture.

114
00:09:01,903 --> 00:09:04,170
It's all celebrated within these walls.

115
00:09:04,238 --> 00:09:07,206
Florence only demands one thing of its people.

116
00:09:07,274 --> 00:09:10,510
To be truly awake.

117
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,381
Like that angelic vision.

118
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:18,050
Don't even think about it. That's Lucrezia Donati.

119
00:09:18,118 --> 00:09:21,320
Lorenzo de Medici's mistress. I'm well aware of who she is.

120
00:09:21,387 --> 00:09:22,587
He'll break you on the wheel,

121
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:23,989
if he catches you looking at her.

122
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:27,927
But what if she's caught looking at me?

123
00:09:36,336 --> 00:09:38,304
Bad tidings from Milan, Nico.

124
00:09:38,372 --> 00:09:40,039
How can you tell?

125
00:09:40,107 --> 00:09:43,009
That serpent on the rider's surcoat is the Biscione,

126
00:09:43,077 --> 00:09:46,212
the Sforza family emblem.

127
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,847
If he was bringing good news, he'd have been dressed

128
00:09:47,915 --> 00:09:50,851
in the more traditional red and white shield of Milan.

129
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:52,285
Whatever the message is,

130
00:09:52,353 --> 00:09:54,187
Lorenzo won't be happy with it.

131
00:10:13,808 --> 00:10:15,642
Out!

132
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,046
Out! All of you!

133
00:10:19,113 --> 00:10:21,581
Lorenzo? Lorenzo!

134
00:10:23,117 --> 00:10:27,019
The Duke of Milan is dead.

135
00:10:27,087 --> 00:10:29,355
- Assassinated.  - By whose hand?

136
00:10:29,423 --> 00:10:33,092
- Visconti and two others.  - An honor killing, then.

137
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,162
They say the Duke deflowered his niece.

138
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:38,865
Sforza was a pig of epic appetites.

139
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:41,935
Yes, but he was our pig!

140
00:10:42,003 --> 00:10:44,704
I sense the Vatican's hand behind this.

141
00:10:44,772 --> 00:10:47,139
The timing is just too perfect.

142
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:50,576
If you're right, this upsets the balance of power in Italy, Lorenzo.

143
00:10:50,643 --> 00:10:52,912
Oh, by God, Becchi, this more than upsets.

144
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:54,947
This all but decapitates the concept

145
00:10:55,015 --> 00:10:57,149
and shits down its throat!

146
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,292
We need to shore up public support.

147
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,361
Easter holiday is nearly upon us.

148
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:10,363
Let's throw a carnival.

149
00:11:10,431 --> 00:11:12,499
Allow the people of Florence to celebrate

150
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,434
the end of Lent as they do its arrival.

151
00:11:14,502 --> 00:11:16,136
The more flamboyant the pageantry,

152
00:11:16,204 --> 00:11:17,771
the stronger we appear.

153
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,741
We're not fucking peacocks, Giuliano.

154
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:22,309
Carnival is all well and good,

155
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:24,078
but if it has no teeth behind it,

156
00:11:24,146 --> 00:11:26,680
we might as well slit our own throats.

157
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:36,557
Are you frightened?

158
00:11:36,624 --> 00:11:39,593
No, Most Holy Father.

159
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:41,695
Lying is a sin, my dear boy.

160
00:11:41,763 --> 00:11:43,965
It separates us from God's grace.

161
00:11:47,603 --> 00:11:52,207
Yes, I'm frightened.

162
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:55,644
But that's also a lie, isn't it?

163
00:11:55,712 --> 00:11:58,748
At least, a partial one.

164
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:01,884
A venial sin, perhaps.

165
00:12:01,952 --> 00:12:03,453
So...

166
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,788
which statement is correct?

167
00:12:05,856 --> 00:12:08,358
Hm?

168
00:12:08,425 --> 00:12:10,293
Speak, child.

169
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,929
Don't you want to enter heaven?

170
00:12:15,232 --> 00:12:18,534
The proper answer would be...

171
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:23,773
Please! His Holiness has forbidden any visitors.

172
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:26,943
Our men succeeded, Your Grace!

173
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:30,347
Sforza is dead.

174
00:12:30,415 --> 00:12:34,284
Florence is ripe for the picking, Your Eminence.

175
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:35,952
Trust me.

176
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,720
You know this how?

177
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:40,190
Because I have an agent within Lorenzo's ranks.

178
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:44,694
The Medicis are throwing a carnival,

179
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:47,798
in a pathetic bid to win the people's favor.

180
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:50,968
They're weak, Your Holiness.

181
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,004
This is your chance to strike.

182
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:56,207
Not mine, Nephew.

183
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,211
The Lord's.

184
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,280
There is another reason for haste.

185
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,716
The Turk has arrived in Florence.

186
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,686
He's after the Book of Leaves.

187
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,795
I am truly sorry.

188
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,402
Why?

189
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,638
Because you can't have heard this.

190
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,503
Do you have the plans for the colombina or not?

191
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:01,506
We do.

192
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:03,474
And they're breathtaking.

193
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,176
Then produce these miraculous renderings

194
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:06,877
and let us evaluate them.

195
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:08,612
Unfortunately...

196
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,214
I can't.

197
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:12,249
Because they don't exist!

198
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:14,251
By God, if you think you can defraud

199
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:15,486
the House of Medici...

200
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:18,923
No, no, no, they do exist, I promise you!

201
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,593
They're in this chest.

202
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,461
- Open it.  - It's locked.

203
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:27,164
Well, then, I'll take my sword to it.

204
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,068
The chest is rigged to explode

205
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,803
if anyone tampers with it.

206
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:34,705
Are you mad?

207
00:14:34,772 --> 00:14:37,942
Why would anyone engineer such an infernal contrivance?

208
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:42,380
To protect my ideas, obviously.

209
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:45,183
Gentlemen, Leonardo Da Vinci.

210
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,753
Ah, I've heard of you.

211
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,421
They say you're quite the free-thinker.

212
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,322
- You're late.  - Grape.

213
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,359
So! The First Citizen of Florence

214
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,268
is desperate for us to fashion him a colombina.

215
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,896
"Desperate" is a strong word.

216
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,765
And yet it happens to be the word I used.

217
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,533
But let's review.

218
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,169
Every Easter, a grand procession makes its way

219
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,205
through the streets of Florence,

220
00:15:07,272 --> 00:15:08,940
terminating at the cathedral.

221
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:10,374
Why do you insist on stating

222
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,178
what every child of three already knows?

223
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,447
Why do you insist on interrupting me?

224
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,416
I have a methodology. We can follow it.

225
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:18,651
Or we can flail about.

226
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,423
I'll take your silence as a vote for the former. Onward.

227
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,425
At the culmination of mass, a mechanical dove,

228
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,761
the colombina, is flown from the altar on a wire.

229
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:31,630
Out into the public square it soars.

230
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,765
It ignites a cart full of fireworks.

231
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,201
The Republic celebrates, they don masks.

232
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,437
They engage in drunken revelry. Now...

233
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,707
For years, the House of Medici has contracted

234
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:46,311
with inferior workshops to produce said ceremonial dove.

235
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,213
But, this year,

236
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,316
if I am to understand the politics afoot,

237
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:56,120
the same shoddy pageantry

238
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,222
just won't do.

239
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,124
No-one's carped about our dove before.

240
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:03,328
To call your previous efforts 'a dove' is to insult the entire avian class.

241
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:06,264
Enough! Just show us the damn thing.

242
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,832
All right.

243
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,521
That is but a quarter-scale model.

244
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:33,458
There.

245
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,827
It's a thing of beauty, I'll grant you that.

246
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:38,063
Yes, and it can be yours for 30 florins.

247
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,965
- 30?  - Yeah.

248
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,800
The contract stated 12.

249
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:44,803
That was for a bird that needed a guide wire.

250
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:49,174
This miracle requires no such handicap.

251
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:19,572
Your work is impressive.

252
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,807
But the price is too steep.

253
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:25,443
- 30 florins is a bargain.  - 30 florins is sodomy!

254
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,346
Perhaps I should be negotiating

255
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:27,654
with your older brother instead.

256
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:36,756
For God's sake, Becchi,

257
00:17:36,824 --> 00:17:39,860
just pay the degenerate and be done with it.

258
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,598
You win, artista.

259
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,167
As is customary with commissions,

260
00:17:47,235 --> 00:17:51,438
we shall pay half now and half upon completion.

261
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:54,074
While we're on the subject of commissions,

262
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:58,545
I'm told that there's an open one to paint Lucrezia Donati.

263
00:17:58,613 --> 00:18:01,715
Lorenzo's mistress.

264
00:18:01,783 --> 00:18:06,286
Stick to your whirligigs and parlor tricks, Da Vinci.

265
00:18:06,354 --> 00:18:08,855
Take a lesson from Icarus.

266
00:19:10,485 --> 00:19:12,019
So, tell me...

267
00:19:13,689 --> 00:19:15,856
is there nothing else you fear?

268
00:19:32,575 --> 00:19:34,643
Are you all right, Leonardo?

269
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:40,181
It was just a nightmare, Andrea.

270
00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:42,383
You have them all too frequently.

271
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:46,154
I'm having some issues with my mathematics, that's all.

272
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:48,290
Issues?

273
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:50,058
I'm not sure...

274
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:52,994
that the colombina will be flightworthy by Easter.

275
00:19:53,062 --> 00:19:55,029
- But the model...  - Was a model.

276
00:19:55,097 --> 00:19:57,265
Once I scale up the dimensions,

277
00:19:57,332 --> 00:19:59,868
the calculations don't hold. It's annoying!

278
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:03,972
Smoking opium won't help matters.

279
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:06,007
- It clears my head.  - It clouds it.

280
00:20:06,075 --> 00:20:10,477
What are you, my nursemaid? I think too much. All right?

281
00:20:10,545 --> 00:20:12,681
I need to dull my thoughts or I'll be eviscerated by them.

282
00:20:12,748 --> 00:20:15,016
I would have thought that you would have

283
00:20:15,084 --> 00:20:16,852
understood that by now!

284
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:23,292
The tears of the poppy have medicinal properties.

285
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,696
- The priests in Egypt...  - We are not in Egypt.

286
00:20:27,764 --> 00:20:30,199
And you are no priest.

287
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:38,073
You have a gift, Leo.

288
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:40,175
A kind of...genius...

289
00:20:40,243 --> 00:20:43,412
the likes of which I've never seen.

290
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,582
Because of that, people will always seek to destroy you.

291
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,551
Please...

292
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:53,488
don't aid them in their endeavor.

293
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,389
- How much for the starlings?  - Six denari apiece.

294
00:21:28,457 --> 00:21:30,658
I'll give you two soldi for the lot.

295
00:21:30,726 --> 00:21:32,527
Are you trying to offend me?

296
00:21:32,595 --> 00:21:33,962
No, if I was trying to offend you,

297
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:36,230
I'd comment on the scent of fecal matter

298
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:37,498
wafting from your hindquarters.

299
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:39,901
Do you want the soldi or not?

300
00:21:39,969 --> 00:21:42,570
They're my last. I'm bored.

301
00:21:46,442 --> 00:21:48,410
No, I'm not interested in the birds.

302
00:21:48,477 --> 00:21:50,712
Just open the cage on my say-so.

303
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,682
He's obsessed with flight. He studies them for inspiration.

304
00:22:07,164 --> 00:22:08,231
Now.

305
00:23:01,053 --> 00:23:03,521
Well? Did you see what you were hoping to?

306
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:07,992
For one of my soldi back, I just might tell you.

307
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,995
All right. Tell me.

308
00:23:11,063 --> 00:23:14,331
I saw an idiot who doesn't know how to haggle.

309
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:18,201
Look, Nico. There she is again.

310
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:20,337
Look at her with Lorenzo.

311
00:23:20,405 --> 00:23:23,239
Everyone pretending the two of them aren't fucking.

312
00:23:23,307 --> 00:23:27,343
- Isn't that your father?  - Crown Prince of parasites.

313
00:23:27,411 --> 00:23:30,546
He serves as Lorenzo's notary.

314
00:23:30,614 --> 00:23:33,383
Come on, Nico, let's stir the pot a little.

315
00:23:33,451 --> 00:23:36,720
Your Magnificence!

316
00:23:36,787 --> 00:23:39,690
My name is Leonardo Da Vinci. Perhaps you've heard of me?

317
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:42,025
I am designing your Easter colombina.

318
00:23:42,093 --> 00:23:44,127
Oh, yes.

319
00:23:44,195 --> 00:23:47,930
You're the eccentric that Verrocchio employs.

320
00:23:47,998 --> 00:23:49,733
I'm an artist, yes, and an anatomist

321
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,667
and an engineer of some note.

322
00:23:50,735 --> 00:23:53,770
"Extortionist" is the word I recall using.

323
00:23:53,838 --> 00:23:55,139
I drive a stiff bargain, it's true.

324
00:23:55,206 --> 00:23:56,907
But the fact is, I have designed

325
00:23:56,975 --> 00:23:58,976
a more ambitious series of devices

326
00:23:59,044 --> 00:24:01,079
that I know your percipient mind

327
00:24:01,146 --> 00:24:02,347
will take an interest in.

328
00:24:02,414 --> 00:24:04,582
Move along, vermin.

329
00:24:07,286 --> 00:24:09,920
Another time.

330
00:24:10,187 --> 00:24:11,756
Perhaps.

331
00:24:19,197 --> 00:24:22,199
I'm wounded, Nico.

332
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:23,467
I need wine.

333
00:24:34,113 --> 00:24:36,414
How goes business, Zoroaster?

334
00:24:36,482 --> 00:24:37,982
Execrable, since the Duke's demise.

335
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,818
These are dark times for Florence.

336
00:24:39,885 --> 00:24:42,420
Case in point. Those mercenaries flooding into town.

337
00:24:42,487 --> 00:24:44,221
If war does break out,

338
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:45,723
they'll be the only ones gainfully employed.

339
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:47,825
Speaking of employment,

340
00:24:47,893 --> 00:24:50,394
a two-headed calf, stillborn on Zitto's farm.

341
00:24:50,462 --> 00:24:51,929
I can procure it, if you like, for your medical studies.

342
00:24:51,997 --> 00:24:55,132
The last corpse was decomposing by the time I took a scalpel to it.

343
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,634
Grave-robbing is like fishmongering.

344
00:24:56,702 --> 00:24:58,903
You're at the mercy of the day's catch.

345
00:24:58,971 --> 00:25:01,005
Come on. A boar sausage?

346
00:25:01,073 --> 00:25:03,508
You know damn well that I am a vegetarian.

347
00:25:03,576 --> 00:25:06,477
- So I keep hoping to corrupt you.  - Oh, I'm corruptible.

348
00:25:06,545 --> 00:25:08,980
I just prefer not to eat anything with eyes.

349
00:25:09,047 --> 00:25:11,716
- Potatoes have eyes.  - Fuck off, Nico!

350
00:25:11,784 --> 00:25:13,718
Maestro!

351
00:25:13,785 --> 00:25:15,786
May I model for you again?

352
00:25:15,854 --> 00:25:18,522
No-one looks at my form as you do.

353
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,657
No-one looks at any form as I do.

354
00:25:19,725 --> 00:25:21,192
Go peddle your wares with Botticelli.

355
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,393
He's an easy mark.

356
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,865
Model? That boy's nothing but a hustler

357
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:28,533
and an artless one at that.

358
00:25:28,601 --> 00:25:30,702
But pleasing to the eye, nonetheless.

359
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,571
Piss.

360
00:25:32,638 --> 00:25:34,939
Here. Have a gander at these.

361
00:25:35,007 --> 00:25:37,075
My latest venture.

362
00:25:37,142 --> 00:25:39,143
They're called tarot cards.

363
00:25:39,211 --> 00:25:42,881
They're used to divine fortunes.

364
00:25:42,948 --> 00:25:47,318
Here. Pick one, Nico. We'll see if it squares with your temperament.

365
00:25:47,386 --> 00:25:49,120
- Funny. It's a trick.  - Is it?

366
00:25:49,187 --> 00:25:51,789
Or am I simply channeling the powers of The Ancients?

367
00:25:51,857 --> 00:25:53,892
How many women has that line worked on, Zo?

368
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:56,060
A respectable amount. Thank you very much.

369
00:25:56,128 --> 00:25:58,162
And a goodly number of gentlemen, as well.

370
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:01,232
But a card can symbolize not just one's temperament,

371
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,869
but one's fate.

372
00:26:03,936 --> 00:26:06,071
Do you dare see yours?

373
00:26:13,512 --> 00:26:18,549
Tell me. Don't hold back.

374
00:26:18,616 --> 00:26:20,618
This one...

375
00:26:20,685 --> 00:26:23,687
represents sacrifice.

376
00:26:23,755 --> 00:26:28,392
A suspension between life and death and then perhaps...

377
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:31,895
a great awakening.

378
00:26:31,963 --> 00:26:34,965
I'm an idiot.

379
00:26:35,032 --> 00:26:37,834
Those mercenaries. Florence has no army of its own.

380
00:26:37,902 --> 00:26:40,304
So they're here to sell their muscle. Right?

381
00:26:40,371 --> 00:26:44,374
But what if there was a more lucrative way to traffic in the Republic's unease?

382
00:26:44,442 --> 00:26:46,543
- Like what?  - I should promote myself

383
00:26:46,611 --> 00:26:49,780
as a military engineer, not a painter.

384
00:26:49,847 --> 00:26:52,549
War has always been the handmaiden of progress.

385
00:26:52,617 --> 00:26:54,351
If I want to explore my ideas,

386
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:58,654
I just need to cloak them in the guise of Florence's defense.

387
00:26:58,722 --> 00:27:01,858
Why are the officers of the night bothering that man?

388
00:27:01,926 --> 00:27:05,161
He's a Turk, a heathen. Isn't that reason enough?

389
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,800
No.

390
00:27:10,868 --> 00:27:12,803
No, this isn't your fight, Leo.

391
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,272
When's that ever stopped me?

392
00:27:18,243 --> 00:27:20,211
What seems to be the trouble here?

393
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,913
Go back to your sketchbook, scribbler.

394
00:27:21,981 --> 00:27:24,782
This isn't your concern.

395
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,418
You see, unfortunately, um...

396
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:29,587
I have this character flaw

397
00:27:29,655 --> 00:27:35,293
that compels me to intervene whenever stupidity rears its head, so...

398
00:27:35,361 --> 00:27:37,428
You see? Cos that was stupid.

399
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:39,396
Cos your man's grip was too loose

400
00:27:39,464 --> 00:27:41,432
and now he finds himself

401
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:46,770
staring down this handsome spada da filo.

402
00:27:46,838 --> 00:27:48,872
Even more stupidity.

403
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,308
Cos if you'd just asked around,

404
00:27:51,376 --> 00:27:53,777
anyone will tell you that I'm ambidextrous

405
00:27:53,845 --> 00:27:56,914
and perfectly capable of fighting two or...

406
00:27:59,684 --> 00:28:01,685
even three men simultaneously.

407
00:28:01,753 --> 00:28:03,687
Bully someone else, Dragonetti.

408
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:12,863
You've made a serious miscalculation tonight, artista.

409
00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:14,965
It wouldn't be the first time.

410
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:27,811
- Are you all right, sir?  - I'm more than all right.

411
00:28:27,878 --> 00:28:33,449
I am a son of Earth and Starry Heaven.

412
00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:36,353
I return to Constantinople the day after tomorrow.

413
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,357
But I am staying at the Inn of the Black Swan.

414
00:28:40,425 --> 00:28:42,760
Come see me before I leave...

415
00:28:44,696 --> 00:28:46,698
Maestro.

416
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,570
A bit weird.

417
00:28:51,638 --> 00:28:55,808
What did he give you?

418
00:28:55,876 --> 00:28:57,977
A tip, I think.

419
00:28:59,046 --> 00:29:00,646
It was her mother.

420
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:04,517
The same arse, very different faces

421
00:29:04,585 --> 00:29:08,989
and, when I realized, I did a little sip on her tit.

422
00:29:09,056 --> 00:29:13,425
Take him, Nico. Jesus. He'll never make it home alone.

423
00:29:13,493 --> 00:29:16,363
Are you sure, Maestro? It's after curfew and there are bound to be rogues about.

424
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,664
- Then I'll fit right in. Go!  - Listen, Leo.

425
00:29:18,732 --> 00:29:19,699
What?

426
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:23,269
I didn't deal you the Hanged Man. That was all you.

427
00:29:23,337 --> 00:29:27,306
It was an omen. It was just like the two-headed calf.

428
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,875
No, I don't believe in omens.

429
00:29:28,942 --> 00:29:31,210
No. No, this is you. Go.

430
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:32,879
Go!

431
00:29:46,895 --> 00:29:49,831
I know it's you, Dragonetti.

432
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:52,533
Did you not learn your lesson earlier?

433
00:29:58,306 --> 00:29:59,707
Ah.

434
00:30:00,575 --> 00:30:04,145
I guess you did learn.

435
00:30:09,618 --> 00:30:11,119
That's enough.

436
00:30:13,222 --> 00:30:15,056
I should have known.

437
00:30:15,124 --> 00:30:17,292
People are talking about you.

438
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,496
And not in a positive light.

439
00:30:20,564 --> 00:30:24,332
I couldn't care less what they're saying about me.

440
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,669
I care!

441
00:30:26,737 --> 00:30:29,472
I'll not have you tarnishing our family's name

442
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,343
with your flippant tone and your vulgar attempts at self-promotion.

443
00:30:34,411 --> 00:30:36,846
Perhaps you should disown me, then.

444
00:30:36,913 --> 00:30:37,880
You're my first-born.

445
00:30:37,948 --> 00:30:40,816
And much as I may wish to disavow you,

446
00:30:40,884 --> 00:30:43,286
our reputations are intertwined.

447
00:30:43,353 --> 00:30:45,655
First-born?

448
00:30:46,857 --> 00:30:48,824
You say that as if...

449
00:30:48,892 --> 00:30:52,394
My wife, Margherita...

450
00:30:52,462 --> 00:30:57,666
bore me a son this past week.

451
00:30:57,733 --> 00:31:01,236
A legitimate heir.

452
00:31:01,304 --> 00:31:04,239
Well, my condolences to him.

453
00:31:04,307 --> 00:31:08,209
I wonder how long it will take him to curse his lineage.

454
00:31:08,277 --> 00:31:12,314
As a bastard, your rank within the social order has been rigidly defined.

455
00:31:12,382 --> 00:31:15,717
You should endeavor to remain within it.

456
00:31:15,785 --> 00:31:18,120
Stay away from the Medicis, Leonardo.

457
00:31:18,187 --> 00:31:20,822
- I'll not warn you again.  - I'll wager you will.

458
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:23,425
Why do you have to make this so difficult?

459
00:31:23,493 --> 00:31:25,995
It's my nature! I see things as they are,

460
00:31:26,062 --> 00:31:28,097
not as they might be.

461
00:31:33,236 --> 00:31:34,871
You...

462
00:31:34,938 --> 00:31:37,674
are a petty man.

463
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,615
And... you will never achieve greatness.

464
00:31:47,952 --> 00:31:49,953
Where as I...

465
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:53,156
I already have.

466
00:31:58,029 --> 00:32:01,264
You're kneeling in a dungeon.

467
00:32:01,332 --> 00:32:04,268
About to be hit again and again.

468
00:32:04,335 --> 00:32:08,939
By men who know how to hit.

469
00:32:09,007 --> 00:32:12,643
That's what you've achieved, Leonardo.

470
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:24,789
Beat him for another hour,

471
00:32:24,856 --> 00:32:29,327
then toss him back onto the street with the rest of the garbage.

472
00:32:32,631 --> 00:32:34,265
Hold out the scribbler's hand.

473
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:46,375
To be fair, you actually look more wretched than I, so...

474
00:32:46,443 --> 00:32:48,911
well done.

475
00:32:48,979 --> 00:32:51,147
Perhaps you should see a physician.

476
00:32:51,214 --> 00:32:52,681
I'm fine.

477
00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:56,051
Oh, they're executing a Jew today.

478
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:58,254
Apparently, they caught him breaking into the book shop on the Via Dei Librai.

479
00:32:58,321 --> 00:33:00,222
It should be good sport.

480
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,225
I'm not sure a man's death should be characterized as sport.

481
00:33:03,293 --> 00:33:06,428
This fucking spot is too sunny. Can't we move over into the shade?

482
00:33:06,495 --> 00:33:08,296
- No.  - Why?

483
00:33:08,364 --> 00:33:10,799
Because every morning, at precisely this time,

484
00:33:10,867 --> 00:33:14,202
Lucrezia Donati comes to this exact spot to purchase...

485
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,870
flowers.

486
00:33:15,938 --> 00:33:18,607
There.

487
00:33:22,245 --> 00:33:26,648
She's appealing, I'll grant you that, but...

488
00:33:26,716 --> 00:33:29,584
I'd rather bed that old toothless hag over there.

489
00:33:29,652 --> 00:33:32,687
Now you're just being contrary.

490
00:33:32,755 --> 00:33:35,157
It takes no great skill to fuck a pretty face.

491
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:38,326
But a truly ugly woman, that actually requires discipline

492
00:33:38,394 --> 00:33:40,114
and, let me tell you, my friend, done right,

493
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:42,196
a transcendent experience.

494
00:34:05,288 --> 00:34:08,256
Nico, run this over to her.

495
00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:10,325
Make sure she knows where it's come from.

496
00:34:12,562 --> 00:34:14,830
What the devil are you up to, Leo?

497
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,788
She wants to speak with you.

498
00:34:39,855 --> 00:34:42,090
Uh-huh? Well, tell her I'm busy.

499
00:34:42,158 --> 00:34:43,926
You're seriously not turning her down?

500
00:34:43,993 --> 00:34:47,029
Tell her, Nico. Timing is all.

501
00:34:50,801 --> 00:34:52,602
He can't right now.

502
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,310
Behold, a criminal in our midst!

503
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:01,412
A Jew, no less!

504
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:05,683
Watch him dance! Watch him dangle!

505
00:35:05,751 --> 00:35:07,919
Bring your fruit and small stones!

506
00:35:07,987 --> 00:35:11,222
God protect the Republic of Florence!

507
00:35:16,495 --> 00:35:18,830
I am a son of Earth and Starry Heaven.

508
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:23,133
I am thirsty.

509
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:25,169
Please, give me something to drink

510
00:35:25,236 --> 00:35:26,970
from the Fountain of Memory.

511
00:35:40,585 --> 00:35:43,187
Are you all right, Maestro?

512
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:47,958
I need to leave.

513
00:35:54,332 --> 00:35:57,601
Is there a foreigner staying here, a Turkish man?

514
00:35:57,668 --> 00:35:59,603
He said you could find him at the Roman ruins,

515
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:01,238
north of town.

516
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,488
Will you smoke with me, Da Vinci?

517
00:36:48,555 --> 00:36:51,291
Well, that depends on what's in the pipe.

518
00:37:05,673 --> 00:37:08,642
History is a lie that has been honed like a weapon

519
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:11,444
by people who have suppressed the truth.

520
00:37:11,511 --> 00:37:13,479
Centuries from now, your own history

521
00:37:13,547 --> 00:37:16,282
will also be suppressed.

522
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,484
How could you possibly know that?

523
00:37:18,552 --> 00:37:21,821
You have heard the phrase "Time is a river"?

524
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:23,890
What most fail to grasp

525
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:26,559
is that the river is circular.

526
00:37:26,627 --> 00:37:28,395
One man's death...

527
00:37:28,462 --> 00:37:31,231
opens a doorway to the birth of the next.

528
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:35,634
I saw a man executed today.

529
00:37:35,702 --> 00:37:36,669
He said something to me.

530
00:37:36,736 --> 00:37:38,904
- I am...  - A son of Earth

531
00:37:38,972 --> 00:37:40,940
and Starry Heaven.

532
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,976
I am thirsty.

533
00:37:43,044 --> 00:37:45,312
Please, give me something to drink

534
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,848
from the Fountain of Memory.

535
00:37:49,284 --> 00:37:50,717
It is an invocation.

536
00:37:50,785 --> 00:37:52,186
A way for members of our fraternity

537
00:37:52,253 --> 00:37:53,353
to recognize one another.

538
00:37:53,421 --> 00:37:55,456
I'm not a member of your fraternity.

539
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,924
Are you sure?

540
00:37:59,628 --> 00:38:02,563
This temple was once a place of worship

541
00:38:02,631 --> 00:38:04,731
for a religion that originated

542
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:07,734
long before Christ.

543
00:38:07,802 --> 00:38:10,837
We are known as the Sons of Mithras.

544
00:38:10,905 --> 00:38:12,705
Much of what you call 'progress'

545
00:38:12,773 --> 00:38:16,910
has simply been a matter of remembering what was once forgotten.

546
00:38:16,977 --> 00:38:18,945
This knowledge was set down

547
00:38:19,013 --> 00:38:22,983
in a compendium known as the Book of Leaves.

548
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:27,788
Recently, certain clues have surfaced regarding the Book's location.

549
00:38:27,856 --> 00:38:30,624
Avraham ben Yosef was following those clues

550
00:38:30,692 --> 00:38:34,795
when he was apprehended and put to death.

551
00:38:34,863 --> 00:38:40,434
Perhaps you have heard of the Secret Archives the Vatican has assembled?

552
00:38:40,502 --> 00:38:44,671
Its curator is a man called Lupo Mercuri.

553
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,707
A fallen son of Mithras.

554
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:51,745
Where we seek to disseminate and preserve knowledge.

555
00:38:51,813 --> 00:38:54,415
They seek to alter and suppress it.

556
00:38:54,482 --> 00:38:56,417
I still... I still don't understand

557
00:38:56,485 --> 00:38:59,620
what any of this has to do with me.

558
00:38:59,688 --> 00:39:02,757
What do you know... about your mother?

559
00:39:02,825 --> 00:39:05,259
Almost nothing.

560
00:39:05,994 --> 00:39:08,029
She... she disappeared.

561
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:13,200
- She was a servant girl.  - She was a slave.

562
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:17,037
Taken from Constantinople against her will.

563
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,706
Do you remember...

564
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:22,210
an incident that occurred in your childhood?

565
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,548
You have suppressed it.

566
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:35,556
I was a boy in Vinci.

567
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,963
I'd been sent to fetch some sheep that had wandered off.

568
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:44,065
I found a cave.

569
00:39:46,769 --> 00:39:48,570
I was scared to go inside, but...

570
00:39:50,172 --> 00:39:52,540
But I was curious.

571
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:56,011
So I ventured in.

572
00:39:57,613 --> 00:40:02,884
The next hours... are blank.

573
00:40:02,952 --> 00:40:06,821
I remember...

574
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:10,525
stumbling out.

575
00:40:10,592 --> 00:40:12,894
My hands and face...

576
00:40:15,797 --> 00:40:17,765
were covered in blood.

577
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,801
And somehow...

578
00:40:19,868 --> 00:40:22,871
I knew it wasn't my own.

579
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:28,310
One day...

580
00:40:28,377 --> 00:40:31,980
you will sip from the Fountain of Memory...

581
00:40:32,047 --> 00:40:36,851
and learn more of what occurred in that cave.

582
00:40:36,919 --> 00:40:39,154
When that day comes, we will meet again.

583
00:40:39,221 --> 00:40:42,156
What do I do till then?

584
00:40:42,224 --> 00:40:44,392
Search for the Book of Leaves.

585
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,262
Fate has chosen you, Leonardo.

586
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:53,001
- I don't believe in fate.  - Then believe in yourself.

587
00:40:53,069 --> 00:40:55,436
Well, where do I start my search, then?

588
00:40:55,504 --> 00:41:00,008
With the hanged man, the seat of the soul.

589
00:41:00,075 --> 00:41:02,344
He's already opened the door for you.

590
00:41:02,411 --> 00:41:05,380
And my mother?

591
00:41:05,448 --> 00:41:09,986
She will be for you on the other side.

592
00:41:12,022 --> 00:41:13,989
All you have to do...

593
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:16,625
is enter.

594
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:28,570
Maestro? Maestro? Can you hear me?

595
00:41:28,638 --> 00:41:31,740
Maestro!

596
00:41:31,808 --> 00:41:34,243
We've been looking for you since last night. What happened?

597
00:41:39,815 --> 00:41:41,649
The Turk was here.

598
00:41:45,187 --> 00:41:48,589
There was... there was a statue.

599
00:41:48,657 --> 00:41:50,258
An altar.

600
00:41:50,325 --> 00:41:52,293
Must have weighed a ton.

601
00:41:52,361 --> 00:41:54,962
This place has been empty for centuries, Leo.

602
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:58,097
Maestro, the Officers of the Night have been searching for you.

603
00:41:58,166 --> 00:42:00,835
They say Lorenzo Medici himself has asked for you.

604
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:44,646
Leonardo di ser Piero...

605
00:42:44,713 --> 00:42:46,414
Da Vinci.

606
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:51,353
I am told you are my notary's bastard son.

607
00:42:53,222 --> 00:42:54,622
I am.

608
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:57,025
I'm also told that you are a troublemaker,

609
00:42:57,093 --> 00:43:00,128
you are arrogant, impolitic...

610
00:43:00,196 --> 00:43:03,696
and utterly incapable of keeping your opinions to yourself.

611
00:43:03,766 --> 00:43:07,936
Arrogance implies that I exaggerate my own worth.

612
00:43:08,004 --> 00:43:09,505
I don't.

613
00:43:12,642 --> 00:43:15,645
My mistress, Lucrezia,

614
00:43:15,713 --> 00:43:20,054
seems to think that you have a singular talent for portraiture.

615
00:43:20,118 --> 00:43:24,088
She insisted that you and none other be the one to...

616
00:43:24,156 --> 00:43:26,257
capture her beauty.

617
00:43:26,324 --> 00:43:28,425
I'd say she has a discerning eye, then.

618
00:43:28,493 --> 00:43:29,508
A warning, sir. 

619
00:43:29,508 --> 00:43:33,931
The man has a reputation for taking many commissions, but finishing few.

620
00:43:33,999 --> 00:43:37,635
I wrestle with details. I bore easily.

621
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:39,703
Call it a character flaw.

622
00:43:39,771 --> 00:43:42,406
Well, with this commission,

623
00:43:42,474 --> 00:43:43,941
you'd be wise to overcome it.

624
00:43:44,009 --> 00:43:46,310
When it comes to Miss Donati,

625
00:43:46,378 --> 00:43:49,480
boredom is the last thing I fear.

626
00:43:53,652 --> 00:43:56,053
I'll have your father draw up a contract then.

627
00:43:56,121 --> 00:43:58,889
Sir, if I may, I have a few other designs...

628
00:44:04,363 --> 00:44:08,766
I have some designs that I think you might be interested in.

629
00:44:08,834 --> 00:44:12,270
This will greatly increase your gunner's rate of firepower.

630
00:44:12,338 --> 00:44:14,339
So, while the top rack's being fired,

631
00:44:14,407 --> 00:44:16,508
the rack below that one can be loaded

632
00:44:16,575 --> 00:44:19,110
and the rack below that one is allowed to cool.

633
00:44:19,178 --> 00:44:21,546
The cannons are arranged in a fan, which...

634
00:44:21,614 --> 00:44:24,282
- That will be enough. Da Vinci.   - This is an armored cart.

635
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:27,652
Propulsion is achieved by two men, who are housed within.

636
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,289
They operate cranks, which rotate the wheels.

637
00:44:30,357 --> 00:44:32,792
Cannons can be mounted around the perimeter of the cart.

638
00:44:44,472 --> 00:44:46,573
It's a flying machine.

639
00:44:46,641 --> 00:44:48,675
It's modeled after the articulated wings of a bat.

640
00:44:48,743 --> 00:44:50,710
Madness. If man were meant to fly...

641
00:44:50,778 --> 00:44:52,846
He would have been born with wings. Yes.

642
00:44:52,913 --> 00:44:55,881
But a similar assertion could have been made prior to the invention of gunpowder

643
00:44:55,883 --> 00:45:00,420
or any other invention conceived since fire.

644
00:45:00,487 --> 00:45:03,489
I believe man will fly and I base this assumption

645
00:45:03,557 --> 00:45:05,290
on the fact that God has blessed us

646
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:08,227
with minds that are capable of imagining it.

647
00:45:08,294 --> 00:45:12,232
Anything that can be dreamt of will eventually be built.

648
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,736
Anyone who says otherwise is a fool.

649
00:45:18,139 --> 00:45:20,541
What exactly do you propose?

650
00:45:20,608 --> 00:45:22,743
I wish to be employed...

651
00:45:22,811 --> 00:45:26,046
as a military engineer.

652
00:45:26,114 --> 00:45:28,081
I am a humanist, Da Vinci.

653
00:45:28,149 --> 00:45:30,550
I have no interest in waging war.

654
00:45:30,618 --> 00:45:33,821
And yet your humanism is precisely why war will happen.

655
00:45:33,889 --> 00:45:35,857
Florence has no standing army.

656
00:45:35,925 --> 00:45:37,892
Nor does Rome.

657
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,862
Necessarily...

658
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:42,698
you've both made alliances with states that do.

659
00:45:42,765 --> 00:45:44,733
Florence with Milan,

660
00:45:44,801 --> 00:45:47,903
and Rome with Naples.

661
00:45:47,971 --> 00:45:51,373
Sforza's death has up-ended the game board.

662
00:45:51,441 --> 00:45:54,043
You need weapons of your own, Your Magnificence.

663
00:45:59,248 --> 00:46:03,117
I will give you a modest stipend.

664
00:46:03,185 --> 00:46:05,152
To see whether these...

665
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,589
contraptions of yours can actually be realized.

666
00:46:08,657 --> 00:46:11,092
- Shall we say 100 florins?  - 50.

667
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,928
If you haggle any further, I'll cut out your tongue.

668
00:46:13,996 --> 00:46:16,230
As you say, sir.

669
00:46:16,298 --> 00:46:18,166
Thank you.

670
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:21,737
You used Lucrezia to gain access to me, didn't you?

671
00:46:21,804 --> 00:46:23,873
I utilize any device at my disposal,

672
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,908
in order to realize my goals.

673
00:46:25,976 --> 00:46:27,643
Clever,

674
00:46:27,711 --> 00:46:30,379
but I'd caution you not to be too clever around me.

675
00:46:30,447 --> 00:46:32,448
Clockwork loses its luster,

676
00:46:32,515 --> 00:46:37,619
once one glimpses the gears beneath its face.

677
00:46:37,687 --> 00:46:39,021
Point taken.

678
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:56,805
Is there a problem?

679
00:46:56,873 --> 00:46:58,874
None at all, sir.

680
00:46:58,942 --> 00:47:01,310
Good day.

681
00:47:11,588 --> 00:47:15,124
- Congratulations, Leonardo.  - Word travels fast.

682
00:47:15,192 --> 00:47:17,093
Ah, there are no secrets in Florence.

683
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,028
How the devil did you do it?

684
00:47:19,095 --> 00:47:20,796
Oh, he played on a woman's vanity.

685
00:47:20,864 --> 00:47:23,265
Your stratagem has become clear, you bastard.

686
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:26,001
A bastard of the highest order.

687
00:47:26,069 --> 00:47:28,103
Ha! Drink up everybody.

688
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:32,975
Then get back to work. We've got a colombina to build!

689
00:47:33,043 --> 00:47:35,244
The Jew that was hanged, I want you to unearth his body.

690
00:47:35,245 --> 00:47:36,645
I need to examine it.

691
00:47:36,713 --> 00:47:38,514
And my compensation?

692
00:47:38,582 --> 00:47:40,949
Well, that depends how fresh the corpse is.

693
00:47:41,017 --> 00:47:42,952
Ah, well, then, I'd best get digging.

694
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,735
Ah, here's the Pazzi clan.

695
00:48:35,803 --> 00:48:38,772
With their schemer Francesco and old man Jacopo.

696
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:41,440
Probably the oldest family in Florence,

697
00:48:41,508 --> 00:48:43,809
definitely the most ornery.

698
00:48:51,818 --> 00:48:56,321
The Pazzi family entrusts Lorenzo de Medici

699
00:48:56,389 --> 00:48:58,357
with this new fire,

700
00:48:58,424 --> 00:49:02,494
struck on stones from the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.

701
00:49:02,562 --> 00:49:04,563
As is our right.

702
00:49:04,631 --> 00:49:06,599
Granted to our ancestor for his actions

703
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:08,167
during the First Crusade.

704
00:49:27,286 --> 00:49:29,854
The colombina is about to fly.

705
00:49:37,229 --> 00:49:41,532
Welcome, all of you, into God's home.

706
00:51:15,828 --> 00:51:19,798
The flames of the phoenix suit you well.

707
00:51:19,865 --> 00:51:21,466
Tell me, truly,

708
00:51:21,534 --> 00:51:25,336
are you always this wistful with the whores you bed?

709
00:51:25,404 --> 00:51:27,806
Oh, you are no whore, Signora.

710
00:51:29,175 --> 00:51:32,577
We need not continue this pretence any longer, Miss Donati.

711
00:51:32,645 --> 00:51:35,647
I knew it was you from the moment you approached me.

712
00:51:35,714 --> 00:51:37,682
How did you know?

713
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,652
I sketched you.

714
00:51:42,121 --> 00:51:46,124
Your features, your form, your bearing.

715
00:51:46,192 --> 00:51:49,328
The more salient question...

716
00:51:49,395 --> 00:51:52,864
is why would a noblewoman

717
00:51:52,932 --> 00:51:56,067
risk her reputation on a lowly artisan?

718
00:51:58,338 --> 00:52:01,774
Well, isn't that the point of a carnival?

719
00:52:01,841 --> 00:52:04,843
To pretend, for a night, that you're someone you're not.

720
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:07,379
No, I think there's more to it than that, yeah.

721
00:52:07,446 --> 00:52:08,713
Tell me, then.

722
00:52:10,717 --> 00:52:12,684
You were intrigued by my sketch.

723
00:52:12,752 --> 00:52:14,353
Yeah, so...

724
00:52:16,323 --> 00:52:20,026
You felt that it captured an aspect of yourself

725
00:52:20,094 --> 00:52:23,163
that remains hidden from your husband,

726
00:52:23,231 --> 00:52:25,766
and from your lover, Lorenzo.

727
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:32,372
The only time you see this aspect...

728
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,473
is on the rare occasions

729
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:34,875
that you glimpse yourself in the mirror,

730
00:52:34,942 --> 00:52:39,046
and you find a stranger staring back at you.

731
00:52:42,184 --> 00:52:43,918
You knew I'd seek you out, then.

732
00:52:45,588 --> 00:52:48,089
Well...

733
00:52:48,157 --> 00:52:51,259
Hey, I try to work out what motivates people

734
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:54,563
and then I proceed accordingly.

735
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:55,630
You manipulate them.

736
00:52:55,698 --> 00:52:57,065
No. I prefer to think of it as gently

737
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:58,667
redirecting their trajectories.

738
00:53:18,188 --> 00:53:21,591
Lorenzo was quite taken with your designs.

739
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:24,061
Well, may I see one of these marvels?

740
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:39,977
What is it?

741
00:53:40,045 --> 00:53:42,546
It's a device for slowing one's rate of descent.

742
00:53:42,614 --> 00:53:44,247
- Oh.  - Yeah.

743
00:53:44,315 --> 00:53:47,718
And under what circumstances would I possibly have use for this?

744
00:53:49,987 --> 00:53:52,388
Say that you were trapped in a fortress.

745
00:53:52,456 --> 00:53:56,392
- A fortress?  - A fortress that had been breached.

746
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,961
You could strap yourself into this...

747
00:53:59,029 --> 00:54:01,497
and you'd safely float down to freedom.

748
00:54:01,565 --> 00:54:03,165
Oh, thank goodness.

749
00:54:07,037 --> 00:54:10,139
It would appear Lorenzo's interest in you was justified.

750
00:54:10,207 --> 00:54:12,742
But tell me.

751
00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:16,646
I have risked my reputation by sleeping with you.

752
00:54:16,714 --> 00:54:18,615
You've risked more.

753
00:54:18,683 --> 00:54:21,751
Perhaps even death.

754
00:54:21,819 --> 00:54:25,089
And to what do you ascribe my reckless behavior, then?

755
00:54:25,157 --> 00:54:26,324
Love.

756
00:54:26,391 --> 00:54:28,059
Don't be absurd.

757
00:54:28,126 --> 00:54:30,428
You saw me, you drew me, you fell in love.

758
00:54:30,496 --> 00:54:32,296
It's as simple as that.

759
00:54:32,364 --> 00:54:35,232
Add in the fact that I am forbidden fruit...

760
00:54:37,034 --> 00:54:39,535
and your fate was sealed.

761
00:54:43,874 --> 00:54:46,742
You're the third person this week to lecture me on fate.

762
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:50,346
Well, perhaps it's time you started listening.

763
00:54:50,414 --> 00:54:52,248
Now...

764
00:54:57,588 --> 00:55:00,691
Fuck me again, Leonardo.

765
00:55:00,758 --> 00:55:04,762
This time, remember...

766
00:55:06,898 --> 00:55:09,900
you're not the only one capable of manipulation.

767
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,181
The Secret Archives are open

768
00:55:24,249 --> 00:55:28,419
only to his Holiness' closest advisors.

769
00:55:28,486 --> 00:55:32,923
For obvious reasons, we can't have you parading through the front door.

770
00:55:32,991 --> 00:55:35,593
Ah.

771
00:55:35,661 --> 00:55:39,464
How rude of me.

772
00:55:39,531 --> 00:55:42,567
I promised you your payment first.

773
00:55:49,308 --> 00:55:52,209
I take it you're satisfied?

774
00:56:16,803 --> 00:56:18,771
Your Eminence,

775
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:20,839
I bring news from Florence.

776
00:56:20,907 --> 00:56:22,875
Get on with it, then.

777
00:56:22,943 --> 00:56:25,944
A new player has entered the stage.

778
00:56:26,012 --> 00:56:29,881
An artist known as Leonardo Da Vinci.

779
00:56:29,949 --> 00:56:34,052
The Medicis have employed him to design siege weapons.

780
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,589
Artists are as common as court jesters.

781
00:56:37,657 --> 00:56:41,293
I see no reason why this news should concern us.

782
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,963
This artist is different. His ideas are...

783
00:56:45,031 --> 00:56:45,997
unusual,

784
00:56:46,065 --> 00:56:48,033
revolutionary.

785
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:51,103
My agent in Florence.

786
00:56:58,244 --> 00:57:00,946
You trust your intelligence to a woman?

787
00:57:01,014 --> 00:57:03,314
When one seeks to convey a message,

788
00:57:03,382 --> 00:57:07,185
I prefer to use vessels others would readily dismiss.

789
00:57:07,253 --> 00:57:10,222
If I am not mistaken, you are Lupo Mercuri,

790
00:57:10,289 --> 00:57:11,957
Curator of the Secret Archives.

791
00:57:12,024 --> 00:57:14,126
- What of it?  - It may interest you to know

792
00:57:14,193 --> 00:57:16,328
that Da Vinci has made contact...

793
00:57:16,395 --> 00:57:18,496
with the Turk.

794
00:57:18,564 --> 00:57:22,767
He's searching for something called the Book of Leaves.

795
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:27,573
It would appear the Turk has found a new champion.

796
00:57:30,076 --> 00:57:32,077
Continue watching him.

797
00:57:32,145 --> 00:57:34,179
See if he can be co-opted.

798
00:57:34,247 --> 00:57:36,948
And if he can't?

799
00:57:37,016 --> 00:57:38,983
Then Da Vinci will be consumed

800
00:57:39,051 --> 00:57:42,054
in the fiery sorrows of hell

801
00:57:42,121 --> 00:57:45,591
along with the rest of God's enemies.

802
00:57:45,691 --> 00:57:55,591


803
00:57:55,591 --> 00:58:05,591

1
00:00:00,868 --> 00:00:01,501
那不是你父亲吗?
Isn't that your father?

2
00:00:02,868 --> 00:00:04,501
他给洛伦佐当公证人
He serves as Lorenzo's notary.

3
00:00:05,934 --> 00:00:08,501
离美第奇家族远点 莱昂纳多
Stay away from the Medicis, Leonardo.

4
00:00:08,734 --> 00:00:11,167
如果您能把您的存款从美第奇银行
If you transfer your accounts to the Pazzi Bank,

5
00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:14,334
转到帕吉银行里来 您就能获得充足的资金
away from the Medicis, you'll have all the funds you need.

6
00:00:15,734 --> 00:00:17,601
几乎感觉不到疼痛
Its bite is almost never noticed.

7
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:21,434
不会有证据指向洛伦佐的爱人
So no evidence implicating Lorenzo's lover.

8
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:22,968
我能再为您做模特吗?
May I model for you again?

9
00:00:23,267 --> 00:00:25,734
想推销商品去博蒂切利那边吧 他容易上当
Go peddle your wares with Botticelli. He's an easy mark.

10
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:28,334
提审这里提到的人 队长
Interrogate the victim mentioned here, Captain.

11
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:31,501
他只要认罪 就逮捕他
Once he confirms the charges, make your arrest.

12
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:34,100
此事已经引起了值夜的官员注意
It has come to the attention of the Officers of the Night,

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,501
是通过匿名告发的方式
by means of secret denunciation,

14
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:38,434
有一位叫莱昂纳多・达芬奇的人
Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci

15
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:41,334
被认定犯有鸡奸罪
has committed the grievous act of sodomy.

16

达芬奇的恶魔 第一季第5集

19
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:27,000
不是做梦 你还在这里
Weren't no dream. You're still here.

20
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:34,000
为什么我们要跟掏粪的关在一起?
Why do we have to share cells with a dung puncher?

21
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:38,000
他睡得像婴儿一样沉 我都不敢翻身了
He's sleeping like a baby, I'm scared to turn over.

22
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,701
蝙蝠
Bats.

23
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,901
那是什么地方?
What is that place?

24
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:52,501
单人禁闭室 专关那些不服管的人
Solitary confinement, where we put the troublemakers.

25
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:54,801
你最好老实点
So behave yourself.

26
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:56,400
那有蝙蝠的窝吗?
The bats nest in there?

27
00:02:56,634 --> 00:03:00,100
上百个呢 跟粪坑一样
By the hundreds. It's a shit-hole.

28
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:03,334
所以没准你喜欢呢
Then again, maybe you'd like it.

29
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:06,067
你那个姓美第奇的朋友呢?
Where's your Medici friend now?

30
00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:17,767
尊敬的阁下
Your Highness.

31
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:20,801
这里是我们运行的心脏
The beating heart of our operation.

32
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:24,334
好 工作人员还真多
Yes. With an impressively large workforce.

33
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:27,901
我数数 三 五 七...
Let me see. Three, five, seven...

34
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:30,300
13个... 27个...
13... 27...

35
00:03:30,434 --> 00:03:32,267
阁下
Your Highness.

36
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:35,300
试试你的人抗干扰能力而已
Just testing the mettle of your men.

37
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:37,534
而且我肯定你已知晓 伊莎贝拉女王和我
As I'm sure you're aware, Queen Isabella and I,

38
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:39,534
不是随便选择银行的
don't offer our business to just anyone.

39
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:43,000
我给你的保证不止来自我们工作人员的能力
I can assure you not only of the competency of my men,

40
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:45,067
而且还来自我们这全欧洲
but also guarantee our reputation

41
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,767
最有信用银行的信誉
as the most trusted bank in all of Europe.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,734
不过你们不再是教皇的银行了
And yet you no longer serve as God's banker.

43
00:03:50,901 --> 00:03:52,701
这只是暂时的
Well, for now.

44
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:55,300
原因在于与罗马现在的政见不合
A disagreement with the current policies in Rome.

45
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:57,901
我相信教皇很快会醒悟的
One I pray God will soon see rectified.

46
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,567
那位我听说被你们
Do you deserve God's favor,

47
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:05,234
高度称赞的艺术家如此表现 还能受到教皇的眷顾吗?
given the behavior of this artist I hear you hold in high regard?

48
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:08,033
达芬奇的表现和命运我都不关心
Neither Da Vinci's actions nor his fate are my concern.

49
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,501
我只关心我们的合作
Only our business together is.

50
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:13,067
我想要的只是一个机会
All I ask is for the opportunity to show you,

51
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:15,567
向你展示美第奇家族的能力
what the Medicis are capable of.

52
00:04:17,234 --> 00:04:18,934
我好奇
I'm curious.

53
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:23,767
罗马大概...
Approximately how many florins did...

54
00:04:23,934 --> 00:04:26,234
提走了多少钱?
Rome actually default on?

55
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,767
截止到上个月 总数为八万七千弗罗林
As of last month, the sum stood at 87,000 florins.

56
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:34,267
我了如指掌
I never lose count.

57
00:04:34,434 --> 00:04:36,501
我的人都如此
Nor do my men.

58
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:40,100
美第奇家族一直都是艺术的支持者
The Medici family have always been patrons of the arts.

59
00:04:40,334 --> 00:04:43,300
特别是那些颂扬神圣的
Particularly those celebrating the holy faith.

60
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:48,067
这件艺术品最明显了 殿下
Which is distinctly true of this creation, Your Highness.

61
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:54,567
多纳泰罗雕刻的大卫
David, as sculpted by Donatello.

62
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:02,901
把我从狮熊爪下救出的主啊
The Lord who saved me from the claws of the lion and the bear,

63
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:05,801
也会救我远离这龌龊
will save me from this abomination.

64
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:08,901
您难道看不出其中的美感吗 托克马达修士?
You do not see beauty in its design, Friar Torquemada?

65
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:11,467
我听说你们这儿的艺术家
Is the artist a sexual deviant,

66
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:14,601
都有性怪癖 这个也一样吗?
like others I've heard of in this region?

67
00:05:14,734 --> 00:05:16,601
我觉得很下流
I find it lewd.

68
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:18,934
我们走之前请把它盖起来吧
Please cover it for the remainder of our visit.

69
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:25,534
听我的 小子
Here's how it works, boy.

70
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:29,667
你把吃的给我 我就不把你脑袋摁到肚子里去了
You feed me, I don't stave your head in.

71
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:31,200
还给他
Give it back.

72
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:34,434
你想怎么样啊 小书生?
What are you gonna do about it, scribbler?

73
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,133
我会抢回来
I'm gonna take it off you.

74
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:41,234
现在呢?
What about now?

75
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:53,567
行了! 分开!
Come on! Break it up!

76
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,367
现在怂了吧!
Not so confident now!

77
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:21,400
按你要求... 给你的食物
Your food... as requested.

78
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:24,834
我猜猜
Let me guess.

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,601
洛伦佐要你来救我
Lorenzo asked you to save me.

80
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:31,634
你不可能在庭上见到洛伦佐 也不能怪他
You will not see Lorenzo in court and you cannot blame him for that.

81
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,934
你的辩方只有我一个
Your defense rests solely with me.

82
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:39,167
- 我建议...  - 认罪?
- I advise...  - Pleading guilty?

83
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,167
- 很不幸 是的  - 很不幸 是的
- Unfortunately, yes.  - Unfortunately, yes.

84
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,100
我觉得这是你唯一的出路
I see this as your only option.

85
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:46,300
如果你够幸运 可以免除腐刑
If you're lucky, you may escape castration.

86
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:49,534
不! 不
No! No.

87
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:52,167
不认罪 不妥协
No, pleas. No bargains.

88
00:06:52,334 --> 00:06:54,300
我要申诉所有的罪名
I want full refutation of the charges.

89
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:56,834
不... 我要让他们撤诉
No... I want them dropped.

90
00:06:57,067 --> 00:07:02,067
我还因为某些未知的诉方被关在这里
I remain locked in here on the accusations of some unknown accuser.

91
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,167
- 不重要  - 不重要吗?
- Unimportant.  - Unimportant?

92
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,501
除非你能提供对鸡奸
Unless you can provide an alibi against the accusation

93
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,534
这位雅各布・沙特瑞里罪名的...
that you sodomized one...

94
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:13,300
不在场证明
Jacopo Saltarelli.

95
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:15,501
雅各布不是受害人
Jacopo's no victim.

96
00:07:18,968 --> 00:07:21,434
我们有些理由可以找
We have a number of defenses at our disposal.

97
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:23,567
- 酗酒...  - 不
- We can blame drink...  - No.

98
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:25,400
吸食鸦片
The use of opiates.

99
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:27,000
或者我们可以平摊罪责
Or we can shift blame.

100
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,767
比如你的导师为洛奇奥
Your mentor Verrochio, perhaps.

101
00:07:29,934 --> 00:07:31,501
是他把你惯坏了
He corrupted you as a boy,

102
00:07:31,734 --> 00:07:33,734
扭曲了你的道德观
warping your sense of morality.

103
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:37,000
你敢再扯远点吗? 就说都是拜你所赐
Why not go further back? Claim it began with you.

104
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,100
哦 该死! 我特别强调要一颗古巴雨林葡萄!
Oh, fuck! I specifically asked for Marcgravia Evenia!

105
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:49,701
啊 在这
Ah, here it is.

106
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:52,334
你是要吃还是要玩啊?
Are you gonna eat them or play with them?

107
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:55,868
- 我会没收的  - 好 随意
- I'll confiscate them.  - Yeah. By all means.

108
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:59,901
向所有人证明我用片树叶也能威胁到你
Demonstrate to everyone that I can terrify you with a leaf.

109
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,868
没准我能挖个地道逃跑呢
Perhaps I can dig an escape tunnel.

110
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,133
你挖地道的日子已经远去了 鸡奸犯
Your tunneling days are over, sodomite.

111
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:08,601
这得看你怎么看待性怪癖了
Deviance is in the eye of the beholder.

112
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:11,601
植物就演示了一种 授粉
Plants practice a form of it. Pollination.

113
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:15,000
他们吸引蜜蜂 蝙蝠 来帮它们传粉
They seduce bees, bats, into transporting their seed.

114
00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:17,868
因为蝙蝠通过回声来飞行
Because bats use echo to navigate.

115
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:20,934
看到了吗?
See?

116
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,968
植物就长出了利用的办法
Plants have devised a way to exploit it.

117
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,501
一般的叶子 回声很小
Cos normal leaves, they have weak reflections.

118
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:30,167
不过这些凹形的花瓣 它们...
But these concave petals, they...

119
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:34,067
把声音反射到更大的范围内
they reflect sound over a much larger area.

120
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:37,067
就像洞穴一样
Like a cave.

121
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,767
吸引蝙蝠前来 就像双方同意的协约一样
And it draws the bats in. It's a consensual arrangement.

122
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:44,067
蝙蝠吃到花蜜而花朵得以授粉
The bats get nectar and the flowers get sex.

123
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:56,734
精神错乱 当然 也可以让我们拿来当做理由
Insanity is, of course, another defense at our disposal.

124
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:07,701
如果你认为这些指控会凭空消失 说明你真的是疯了
You are demented if you think these charges will simply vanish.

125
00:09:07,868 --> 00:09:10,267
必须消失
They must.

126
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:11,968
会消失的
They will.

127
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,367
那个铁面的村姑根本就不懂艺术
That pan-faced wench wouldn't know art if it sat on her face,

128
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:27,100
而且肯定跟她的修士有关
which her friar clearly longs to do.

129
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,834
而且 失去罗马的业务
And yet, having lost Rome's business,

130
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:33,434
我们对斐迪南和伊莎贝拉的需要比他们对我们的需要大得多
we need Ferdinand and Isabella far more than they need us.

131
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:35,334
斐迪南提到庭审的事了吗?
Did Ferdinand mention the trial?

132
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:37,267
当然提了
Of course he did.

133
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:40,467
罗马使用这些指控的策略很明智
Rome's strategy with these charges is brilliant.

134
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,501
他们来的时机很不凑巧
They couldn't have come at a worse time.

135
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:45,534
斐迪南和伊莎贝拉也有自己的难处
Ferdinand and Isabella face their own difficulties.

136
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:47,567
他们现在正跟葡萄牙开战
Currently they wage war with Portugal,

137
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:50,601
国内还有内战
while facing civil uprisings at home.

138
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:53,767
也许他们是需要分散一下压力
Perhaps what they require is distraction.

139
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:56,367
你觉得什么东西最能让他们高兴?
And what exactly do you think would amuse them?

140
00:09:56,501 --> 00:10:00,667
篝火晚会?
A bonfire of Jews?

141
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,667
让你弟弟决定吧
Let your brother decide that.

142
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:05,567
他可以安排一场演出
He can create a theatrical spectacle,

143
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:07,467
到处都是高兴的市民
fill the stands with happy citizens,

144
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:09,234
展示一座和谐的城市
and show a harmonious city.

145
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:13,334
你疯了? 把我们的命运交到朱利亚诺那双笨手里去?
Are you mad? Put our faith in Giuliano's clod-hopping hands?

146
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:16,601
跟你一样 他有他自己的天赋
Like you, he has his talents.

147
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:19,667
你有感染力 他有魅力
You impress. He charms.

148
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:40,167
他看起来糟透了 里面给他东西吃吗?
He looks like hell. Do they feed him in there?

149
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:48,367
治安官 辩方准备就绪了
Magistrate, the defense is prepared.

150
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:50,467
诉方还来吗?
Will the prosecution be joining us?

151
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:54,734
还是他们已经意识到都是谬诉?
Or have they realized the error of these charges?

152
00:10:56,868 --> 00:10:58,701
你的答案到了
Your answer has arrived.

153
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,300
弗朗西斯科・帕吉到底来干什么? 他不是公证人
What the hell is Francesco Pazzi doing here? He's not a jurist.

154
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,300
这对达芬奇有利 不是吗?
That's good for Leo, isn't it?

155
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,167
帕吉家是美第奇家的宿敌
Pazzis are the Medicis' rivals.

156
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:16,200
治安官 我能不能指出帕吉先生出席这次庭审有些不妥?
Magistrate, may I raise a point relating to Signor Pazzi's role in this trial?

157
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:19,133
就我所知 他不是公证人之一
To my knowledge, he is not a member of the Notary Guild.

158
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,367
帕吉阁下的合作身份
Signor Pazzi's associate membership,

159
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:26,100
已于昨晚的即席会议上批准了
was approved at an impromptu session last night.

160
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:30,234
是提出反对的恰当方式
Which was the appropriate forum for raising any objections.

161
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:33,200
你要代表你儿子提出正式的申诉吗?
Do you wish to make a formal complaint on behalf of your son?

162
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,133
他不是...
He's not...

163
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,067
不
No.

164
00:11:39,234 --> 00:11:41,033
不申诉
No complaint.

165
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,000
被告要请求减刑吗?
Does the accused have any opening mitigation to enter into plea?

166
00:11:45,234 --> 00:11:48,567
请求 我们要对所有的指控提出辩护
May it please the court, we will be contesting all the charges.

167
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:52,300
达芬奇先生 你知道藐视法庭
Signor Da Vinci, do you understand the potential ramifications

168
00:11:52,534 --> 00:11:54,767
可能带来的后果吗?
of challenging these indictments?

169
00:11:56,701 --> 00:12:01,367
我的当事人要求公开声明的特权
My client requests the privilege to make an opening statement.

170
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,701
我已经将我的生命...
I have dedicated my life...

171
00:12:20,868 --> 00:12:24,334
贡献于对自然的研究...
to the study of nature...

172
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:28,100
远离迷信和歪曲
free from superstition or distortion.

173
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:30,868
这些指控 往好里讲
These accusations, at best,

174
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,467
是源于无知愚昧
stem from a wellspring of ignorance.

175
00:12:36,534 --> 00:12:39,434
往差里讲 通过这种方式
And, at worst, it speaks of political chicanery,

176
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:42,200
拷问一个人的社会关系 就是政治欺骗
to question anyone's intimate relations in this manner,

177
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:46,400
因为我没有任何羞愧之事
cos I have nothing to be ashamed of.

178
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,801
也没有什么要辩护的
And I have nothing to defend.

179
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:51,901
我可以担保 应该让我上去的
I can vouch for that. Should put me on the stand.

180
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:54,067
听他如何玷污了一个人没用
Hearing how he deflowered a nun won't help.

181
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,801
顶多就是罚款 这个罪名不会判火刑的
He'll only receive a fine. No-one burns for this any more.

182
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:01,467
那些永远不可能出生的生命
Of those who will never be born,

183
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:03,667
都是拜他们所赐
thanks to their vice.

184
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:07,167
你们城市里的鸡奸犯...
The sodomites in your city...

185
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,467
背负着那些无法出生的灵魂
have the souls of the unborn on their conscience.

186
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:15,667
那些灵魂呼唤着公正
Those souls scream for justice.

187
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:17,634
"火刑
"To the fire.

188
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:21,167
火刑!"
To the fire!"

189
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:25,567
反而 你们的领袖对鸡奸犯
Instead, your leaders promote sodomy,

190
00:13:25,734 --> 00:13:29,167
只征收罚金 而不使用适当的制裁
by levying fines instead of the proper sanction,

191
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:32,000
那就是... 火刑
which is... the fire.

192
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,934
是有人往他酒里拉屎了吗?
Who shat in his wine sack?

193
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:38,467
若是对罪行征税 那就是创造了一项商品
When you tax a crime, you make it a commodity.

194
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:42,133
美第奇家族从他人的犯罪中获利
The Medicis make their fortune from this vice

195
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,968
代价是给佛罗伦萨留下了永久的耻辱
at the price of Florence's eternal shame.

196
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:50,200
反对 治安官 我实在无法理解一个外国人
Objection, Magistrate. I cannot comprehend why a foreigner

197
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,567
凭什么在此作证
is being allowed to testify here today.

198
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:57,200
我传尊敬的托克马达修士来此 是作为道德证人
I called the esteemed Friar Torquemada as a voice of morality,

199
00:13:57,434 --> 00:14:00,868
提醒在场诸位 上帝加诸给我们的神圣责任
reminding us all of our solemn responsibilities before God.

200
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,133
难道你要否认他的这项权利?
Would you deny him that right?

201
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,300
我只想提醒法庭 这些指控的严重性当然毋庸置疑
I would only remind the court that the seriousness of these charges is not in doubt,

202
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:12,300
但上帝并不赞同我们惩罚无辜
but God is not served by punishing the innocent.

203
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:15,000
案件仍然有足够的诉由
The case remains to be made.

204
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:18,501
既然如此... 先休庭吧
Then perhaps it shall... after a recess.

205
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,868
虽然身在这里 不过我听说
I've heard, through the prison grapevine,

206
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:32,767
朱利亚诺准备给伊莎贝拉夫妇安排一场戏剧演出
that Giuliano's mounting a theatrical production for the royal couple.

207
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,601
你现在面临长期关押 可能会被判处宫刑
You face prolonged captivity and possible gelding,

208
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:38,067
你居然还关注这种无关紧要的小事
yet your thoughts focus on trivialities.

209
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:44,367
把这个交给琐罗亚斯德
See this is delivered to Zoroaster.

210
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:48,534
你写的这些都是胡言乱语
All you wrote was gibberish.

211
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:50,868
坐牢影响了你的思维
Your imprisonment affects your mind.

212
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:59,234
有可能 不过那是密码
That's perhaps true, but that's cipher.

213
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,167
如果他们还要继续关押我
If my internment is to continue,

214
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:04,701
我有些私人事情要处理
then there are certain private wishes I need fulfilled.

215
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:07,601
都是小事 处理一下我的生意
Minor matters. Disposition of my business.

216
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:09,934
没别的
That's all.

217
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,534
不用您操心 父亲
It's nothing to trouble you, Father.

218
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:16,000
哦 嗯...
Oh, um...

219
00:15:16,234 --> 00:15:20,467
如果朱利亚诺还没选好剧本的话
If Giuliano is yet to select a text,

220
00:15:20,634 --> 00:15:22,467
我建议选"十日谈"吧
may I suggest the Decameron.

221
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,667
我最喜欢那个"失窃的猪"的故事
My favorite is the stolen pig story.

222
00:15:25,868 --> 00:15:27,601
很能取悦观众的
It's quite a crowd-pleaser.

223
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:40,801
那... "耶稣受难记"呢?
What about... a Passion Play?

224
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:43,067
进行两小时的道德教学吗? 不行
Two hours of moral instruction? No.

225
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,534
要找一个更具有娱乐性的
I need a more diverting theatrical piece

226
00:15:45,734 --> 00:15:48,434
分散对那起小丑闻的注意力
to distract the royals from our little scandal.

227
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,801
- "俄狄浦斯"?  - 不 我觉得不好
- Oedipus Rex?  - No, I think not.

228
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:53,567
乱伦比鸡奸也好不到哪去
We'd just be trading sodomy for incest.

229
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:55,767
我一直很喜欢"利西翠妲"
I've always loved Lysistrata.

230
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:58,767
什么? 讲女性性罢工的那部?
What? Women withholding sex?

231
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,834
那部戏多恐怖 而且伊莎贝拉本身就...
Not only is that terrifying, but Isabella is...

232
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,868
性冷淡
well, frigid.

233
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:07,701
我们还是不要引起这个话题
We probably shouldn't draw attention to it.

234
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:09,601
那演"鸟"吧 殿下?
The Birds, then, Excellency?

235
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:12,000
一个幻想故事 还有好听的歌曲
A fantasy with pleasing songs.

236
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:14,200
听着就很无聊
Sounds boring as shit.

237
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:16,200
我儿...
My s...

238
00:16:16,234 --> 00:16:18,634
被告让我把这个交给你
defendant asked me to deliver this.

239
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:20,300
是用一些鬼密码写的
It's in some blasted code,

240
00:16:20,601 --> 00:16:23,367
不过依我看 不是他的遗愿或遗嘱
but as far as I can see, it's not his last will and testament.

241
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:25,834
安德里亚 我是来咨询你艺术家的专业意见的
I came to you for your artistic expertise, Andrea.

242
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:27,501
你有没有好建议?
Do you have nothing suitable to offer?

243
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:29,234
您有没有考虑过"十日谈"?
Have you considered the Decameron?

244
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:31,000
没有 该考虑它吗
No. Should we.

245
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,100
是讽刺题材的 十分风趣幽默 而且是佛罗伦萨人写的
It's a satire, brilliantly funny and penned by a native son of Florence.

246
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,667
当然也包含部分涉及性的内容
With quite a bit of sex in it.

247
00:16:36,901 --> 00:16:38,834
- 男女之间的性事吧?  - 那当然
- Between a man and a woman?  - Of course.

248
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,968
那我觉得没问题 就选它了
Well, I don't see the problem. We have our choice.

249
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,567
- 给我准备剧本  - 殿下 这样好吗?
- Bring me a transcription.  - Is this wise, Excellency?

250
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:48,868
难道我们不用再审查一下"十日谈"的内容?
Wouldn't it be better to examine the Decameron again?

251
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,434
我听说"失窃的猪"那段很能取悦观众的
I'm told the stolen pig is quite a crowd pleaser.

252
00:16:52,601 --> 00:16:54,901
先生 又开庭了
Signor, court has been recalled.

253
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:11,434
沙特瑞里先生... 我问你
Tell me... Signor Saltarelli,

254
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:15,033
你回到达芬奇先生的工作室的时候
when you went back to Signor da Vinci's studio,

255
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,100
发生了什么事?
what happened?

256
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:20,367
大师说要给我画一幅画 裸体画
The Maestro offered to draw me. Naked.

257
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:23,167
你也给别的画家做过模特
You've modeled for other artists before,

258
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,567
所以这也没什么不寻常
so this wasn't unusual.

259
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:27,267
那他给你付报酬了吗?
Did he pay you for your time?

260
00:17:27,434 --> 00:17:29,334
付了
Yes.

261
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:32,534
四个金弗罗林
Four gold florins.

262
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:35,100
一晚上就挣了这么大一笔
A handsome sum for an evening's work.

263
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:38,434
这可是一般劳工一个月才能挣到的数量
The laborer would have to toil for a month to earn the same.

264
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:41,400
这笔钱不仅是做模特的报酬吧?
The payment wasn't just for the drawing, was it?

265
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:43,767
不是
No.

266
00:17:43,934 --> 00:17:48,534
- 是我的封口费  - 封口费?
- It was for my silence.  - Your silence?

267
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:52,334
什么秘密能值上四个金弗罗林的价钱?
What secret requires a payment of four gold florins?

268
00:17:54,634 --> 00:17:56,000
他强迫我肛交
He sodomized me.

269
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,067
对他这可憎的行为 你表示了同意
Did you consent to this heinous act,

270
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,434
或者给他了任何暗示 鼓励什么的吗?
offer any encouragement whatsoever?

271
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:01,968
没有 先生 完全没有
No, Sir. None.

272
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:04,667
所以是莱昂纳多・达芬奇强迫你的?
So Leonardo da Vinci forced himself on you?

273
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:37,100
你这是第一次... 被强奸?
This was your first time... being raped?

274
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:40,767
是的
Yes.

275
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:42,834
所以你受了巨大的伤害
And you were so traumatized,

276
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:46,100
- 你不得不立刻跑出去大肆庆祝了一番?  - 我反对!
- you went out and celebrated immediately after?  - I object!

277
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,167
你当晚没有出现在"犬吠"酒吧
Were you not at the Barking Dog that evening,

278
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:51,300
替全店的人买单吗?
buying drinks for the establishment's entire clientele?

279
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:53,501
有
Yes.

280
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:56,901
我需要麻醉我的痛苦
I needed something to numb the pain.

281
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:58,701
需要有朋友的陪伴
To be surrounded by friends.

282
00:18:58,868 --> 00:19:03,534
前面还是后面?
Front or back?

283
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:07,467
我的当事人是从前面还是后面强暴你的?
Did my client take you from the front or the back?

284
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:09,133
- 都有  - 多少次呢?
- Both.  - How many times?

285
00:19:09,334 --> 00:19:11,000
- 三次  - 肯定很痛吧
- Three.  - It must have been painful.

286
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,934
但是你不寻求治疗 反而去狂欢
And yet you chose revelry over medical aid.

287
00:19:13,968 --> 00:19:17,767
太过分了! 这个小男孩不应该在这遭受这种耻辱
Outrageous! This boy's not the one who should suffer humiliation.

288
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:20,701
- 那我当事人受的耻辱呢?  - 那个由我来决定
- What of my client's suffering?  - I will decide.

289
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,534
你想和你儿子一起被关押吗?
Do you want to join your son in the Bargello?

290
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:33,033
你再这么问下去 你就要和你儿子作伴了
Because that's the way you're heading with this line of questioning.

291
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:36,200
被告方应该有权利追问案件的每个细节
The defense must be allowed to pursue all aspects of the case.

292
00:19:36,434 --> 00:19:39,234
- 你儿子有罪  - 案子还没审完呢
- Your son is guilty.  - The case is not complete.

293
00:19:39,434 --> 00:19:41,901
这场审判只是一场表演 蠢货
This trial is a performance, you oaf.

294
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,434
就像美第奇赞助的面包和马戏
Like the bread and circuses of your Medici sponsor.

295
00:19:44,634 --> 00:19:48,367
现在 演好你那部分戏 否则你就是多余的
Now, play your part and perhaps you will be spared.

296
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:58,267
抱歉
I apologize

297
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:03,067
我挑起了不愉快的回忆
for dredging up what must be uncomfortable memories.

298
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:05,601
先生 这是你的本职工作而已
You were only performing your job, Signor.

299
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,133
你是做什么工作的?
And what of your job, hm?

300
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:14,467
你是怎样靠我当事人给你的金弗罗林
How do you survive beyond the gold florins

301
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:16,167
糊口度日的?
my client allegedly gave you?

302
00:20:16,434 --> 00:20:18,601
当然仅靠兼职模特是不够的
Surely not on the occasional modeling assignment.

303
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:20,634
- 达芬奇先生  - 也许你的沉默
- Signor Da Vinci.  - Perhaps your silence

304
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:25,234
是因为你不想承认你在经营卖淫业务
is because you would prefer not to admit to your true profession of prostitution.

305
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:29,801
- 反对!  - 你今天的表演收到了多少报酬?!
- Objection!  - How much are you being paid for your performance today?!

306
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,534
- 够了!  - 哈哈!
- Enough!  - Ha-ha!

307
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:33,400
现在休庭...
The court is adjourned...

308
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:37,968
我要为辩护方想一个合理的刑罚
so I may consider suitable punishment for defense council.

309
00:20:56,434 --> 00:20:57,968
你对做事很有一套啊
You're quite good at this.

310
00:21:00,934 --> 00:21:04,701
我不是为了你做的
I didn't do that for you.

311
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:08,400
你的行为令我恶心
You disgust me.

312
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:12,501
从谎言中可以看出 那男孩的部分供词是真实的
Through the lies, some part of that boy's story is true.

313
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:19,200
我警告过你 别太嚣张了
I warned you, Leonardo, about overreaching.

314
00:21:20,534 --> 00:21:23,267
你曾经把生活当成游戏
You have thought life a game,

315
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:27,067
但罗马的宠物狗已经控制了你的命运
but Rome's lapdogs have already decided your fate.

316
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,834
他们控制了舆论后
And when they have swayed the crowd,

317
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:30,834
他们会让你在监狱里慢慢腐烂死去
they'll leave you to rot in your cell

318
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,200
直到你的仅剩的一点感觉都被吃光
until your already-diminished senses are all but eaten away.

319
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,300
那个男婊子演砸了
That hustler hurt us.

320
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:57,334
如果人们相信他这个不是道德问题
If the people believe he's amoral,

321
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:00,501
即使没有贿赂 我也可以通过有罪判决
I can't pass a guilty verdict without appearing corrupt myself.

322
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:03,300
你会按命令行事
You'll do as instructed.

323
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:05,300
我是选举出来的法官
I'm an elected official.

324
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:08,834
我只做有回报的工作
I'll do as someone pays me to do.

325
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:10,834
别着急
Don't fret.

326
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:16,200
你孙子的竞选会获得瑞阿里奥伯爵的赞助
Count Riario's coin will fund even your grandson's campaign for this office.

327
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:18,567
塞翁失马焉知非福
Perhaps this setback's a blessing.

328
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:20,534
这场诉讼拖得越久
The longer we draw out these proceedings,

329
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:23,234
洛伦佐的公众形象只会更尴尬
the more we embarrass Lorenzo in the public eye.

330
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,334
达芬奇在牢房里困得越久
And the longer Da Vinci rots in his cell,

331
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:28,334
他的思想就会越来越混乱 负罪感就越重
the more his mind frays and the guiltier he looks.

332
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:30,434
队长
Captain.

333
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:32,400
先生?
Signor?

334
00:22:32,534 --> 00:22:36,667
让大家集合吧
Gather your men.

335
00:22:36,968 --> 00:22:39,067
这不是购物单 这只是些废话
This isn't a shopping list. It's just nonsense.

336
00:22:39,334 --> 00:22:41,367
别浪费你的时间 他这是用暗语写的
Don't waste your time. He wrote it in cipher.

337
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:43,167
是张清单 还为之前
A list of items, precise instructions

338
00:22:43,434 --> 00:22:47,934
在美第奇庆功会上冷落我而郑重道歉
with an absence of an apology for snubbing me at the Medici celebration.

339
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,467
镁 达芬奇大师想要这个来做什么?
Magnesium. What does Maestro Da Vinci want with this?

340
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:53,667
我如果知道就惨了 不要说他的名字 不然会被当成同伙
Fucked if I know. But don't speak his name unless you'd like to join him.

341
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,234
做什么都好 为什么要鸡奸?
Of all things, why sodomy?

342
00:22:58,467 --> 00:23:00,467
我的意思是 没有人这样做过
I mean, no-one gets tried for that.

343
00:23:00,634 --> 00:23:02,300
是的 在佛罗伦萨没有人做过
Yeah, not in Florence.

344
00:23:02,601 --> 00:23:06,467
向任何一个方向走100英里 你会发现罗马严格控制着你的性行为
Go 100 miles in any direction and suddenly Rome owns your prick.

345
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:19,167
你们没权在这里搜查!
You have no right to be here!

346
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:21,834
这里肯定有证据! 继续搜!
There must be something here! Keep searching!

347
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,200
- 你们在干什么?  - 搜查
- What are you doing?  - Look over there.

348
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:29,467
- 搜查什么?  - 证据... 关于达芬奇到底是什么人
- Look for what?  - Evidence... of who Da Vinci truly is.

349
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:32,934
长官 找到一个有更多日记的秘密隔间
Sir. Found a hidden compartment with more journals.

350
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,000
队长 看看这个
Captain, look at this.

351
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:36,801
这就是帕吉要的
This is what Pazzi wants.

352
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:44,934
深入调查莱昂纳多・达芬奇
Further investigation into Leonardo Da Vinci

353
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:49,734
已经发现了越来越多非自然的思想作品
has uncovered more products of an unnatural mind.

354
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:51,167
你面前的这幅画
The drawings here before you

355
00:23:51,434 --> 00:23:53,200
是在达芬奇的工作室里找到的
were found in Da Vinci's studio.

356
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:56,767
进一步说明了这个异教徒把男性的那个...
Notice the extent to which the deviant has detailed the male...

357
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:58,968
解剖得很细致
anatomy.

358
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,868
人类不是上帝凭想象创造出来的吗?
Was man not created in God's image?

359
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,400
上帝和艺术家相提并论? 我为你的联想感到震惊
Genesis, artista? I'm shocked you got that far.

360
00:24:04,634 --> 00:24:09,400
如果不是因为热爱神圣 研究人类形态只是一个短语 
Studying the human form is an expression, if not an adoration, of the divine.

361
00:24:09,534 --> 00:24:11,367
嗯 嗯
Mm. Mm.

362
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:14,400
那这个笔记本说明了什么?
But then, what of this notebook?

363
00:24:14,634 --> 00:24:17,734
在一个秘密小隔间找到的
Found in a secret compartment, no less.

364
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:21,734
搜索大师的工作室 太无耻了
Raiding the Maestro's workshop. That's the obscenity here.

365
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:24,434
请原谅证据的残破 因为...
Please excuse the condition of the evidence, for...

366
00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:28,467
这很显然是被告为了不让他的异教徒信仰在这里被呈现出来
clearly the accused tried to prevent his heathen beliefs from being presented here

367
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:32,133
而把这笔记本烧了
by burning it.

368
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,033
人身上有一个动物的头
An animal head on human form.

369
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:38,434
一个异教上帝
A pagan god.

370
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:40,667
这不止一页...
And not just one...

371
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:42,067
还有很多
Dozens.

372
00:24:42,234 --> 00:24:44,567
异教徒的崇拜
The adoration of a heretic.

373
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:49,801
这不是崇拜 而是一个艺术家的杰作
This is not worship but an artistic endeavor.

374
00:24:49,934 --> 00:24:51,434
真的吗?
Really?

375
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:55,167
你是在指这些虚假的上帝是
Are you then suggesting that this false god is a commission

376
00:24:55,434 --> 00:24:58,667
最近赞助你儿子的委员会成员吗?
for your son's most recent patron?

377
00:24:58,968 --> 00:25:03,100
我认为这个异教徒不仅鸡奸 还在施展巫术
I submit that not only does this deviant practice sodomy, but sorcery.

378
00:25:05,234 --> 00:25:08,334
因此我恳请法庭判处被告死刑
Thus I ask the court to consider no other sentence but death.

379
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:29,634
- 你太过分了  - 这不关你的事
- You've gone too far.  - This doesn't concern you.

380
00:25:29,934 --> 00:25:34,067
瑞阿里奥伯爵明说了他们是对达芬奇有计划的
Count Riario made it very clear that he has plans for Da Vinci.

381
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,334
他想看到他被捕 而不是死
He wanted to see him arrested, not dead.

382
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:40,033
好吧 那由法庭来决定
Well, that's in the hands of the court.

383
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,033
如果当庭揭露你家里的风流韵事会怎么样?
What might the court say about your own family's erotic proclivities?

384
00:25:44,234 --> 00:25:46,300
有谣言说你自己的妻子阿莱格拉
The rumors of your own wife, Allegra,

385
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:50,167
和一个帅气的男性化女佣有染
dallying with a strikingly mannish maidservant.

386
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:52,934
羞辱我的家人 请你后果自负 荡妇
Shame my family at your peril, harlot.

387
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,734
嗯 有本事就来吧
Mm. I welcome the invitation.

388
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,567
你似乎对一个你在法庭上谴责的男人感到异常烦恼
You seem oddly bothered about the fate of a man you denounced to the court.

389
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:02,367
如果你对控制我的力量还有忌惮之心的话
If you have any respect for the powers that command me,

390
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:05,868
就不会再提逼我写告发信的事了
you will never again mention forcing me to write the denunciation.

391
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:08,234
你太胆大了 阁下
You are reckless, Signor.

392
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:11,501
你让自己对美第奇家族的仇恨蒙蔽了自己的目的
You have let your hatred for the Medicis cloud your purpose.

393
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:15,200
而你是被自己的恐惧蒙蔽的
And your fear clouds yours.

394
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:17,400
我向你保证 女士
I assure you, Signora,

395
00:26:17,634 --> 00:26:21,400
等洛伦佐和达芬奇不在了
when Lorenzo and Da Vinci are gone,

396
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:24,634
会有很多男人想填补你的空虚
there'll be plenty of cocks willing to fill your void.

397
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:42,267
这里再加点细节吧
Perhaps a bit more detail here.

398
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:46,267
- 阁下 这好看吗?  - 好看 很可爱
- How does this look, Excellency?  - Lovely. Very lovely.

399
00:26:46,434 --> 00:26:48,200
朱利亚诺!
Giuliano!

400
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:52,567
你他妈的疯了吧?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

401
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:54,934
十日谈?
The Decameron?

402
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:58,701
我跟我弟弟说两句话 走开
I would have words with my brother. Away.

403
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:01,767
滚!
Away!

404
00:27:01,934 --> 00:27:02,868
走 走 走
Go, go, go.

405
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:05,934
我让你帮忙重塑信誉
I asked you to help restore our reputation.

406
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:08,667
- 你让我展示魅力  - 他们都是虔诚的天主教徒
- You asked me to charm them.  - They are devoted Catholics.

407
00:27:08,901 --> 00:27:11,367
你觉得他们对一部淫荡修女
How do you think they will respond to a play,

408
00:27:11,634 --> 00:27:14,968
和饥渴神父比比皆是的剧目会作何反应?
that's wall to wall nun-sluts and horny priests?

409
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:17,434
- 下流! 粗俗!  - 这是佛罗伦萨的代表
- It's bawdy! It's vulgar!  - It's Florence.

410
00:27:17,634 --> 00:27:19,501
当然粗俗! 人们就是喜欢这个
Of course it's vulgar! That's why people love it.

411
00:27:19,701 --> 00:27:22,601
你要砍掉所有丢人的情节
You will cut every scene that is at all scandalous.

412
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:25,968
如果我们不能让斐迪南和伊莎贝拉开户
If we fail to secure Ferdinand and Isabella's accounts,

413
00:27:26,133 --> 00:27:29,167
美第奇银行就完蛋了
the Medici Bank is finished.

414
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:32,133
再一次证明了你就是一堆没脑子的傻肉
Time again you prove to be nothing more than dead weight.

415
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,734
也许你应该把我也当成叛徒宰了
Well, perhaps you should mark me a traitor and have me killed as well.

416
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:49,667
就这一件事 你永远不可能比我强
This is one thing you were never better at.

417
00:27:54,267 --> 00:27:56,167
鸡奸
Sodomy.

418
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,133
巫术
Sorcery.

419
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,033
向异教之神献祭
Offerings to a pagan god.

420
00:28:01,267 --> 00:28:04,467
还有什么比这更重的罪行?
What crimes could be worse than these?

421
00:28:04,701 --> 00:28:06,901
然而 根据庭审的秩序
Thus, by the order of this court,

422
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:11,434
被告... 如果承认了巫术的指控...
the accused... if convicted of the charge of sorcery...

423
00:28:11,601 --> 00:28:13,267
就会被判火刑...
shall be burned at the stake...

424
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:20,467
直到他的灵魂从毁灭的身体中剥离
so that his eternal soul is separated from his perverted body.

425
00:28:20,734 --> 00:28:25,634
在我们继续进行下一个程序前...
We grant the accused one day to confess and plead mitigation...

426
00:28:25,868 --> 00:28:28,400
我们给被告一天时间认罪请求减刑
before we deliberate any further.

427
00:28:33,634 --> 00:28:36,467
你要接受减刑 莱昂纳多
You must accept a plea, Leonardo.

428
00:28:36,767 --> 00:28:38,400
如果你认罪 还有机会!
If you confess, there's a chance!

429
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,767
- 保护洛伦佐?  - 拯救你自己!
- To protect Lorenzo?  - To save yourself!

430
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:42,868
若是不让我帮你 你会死的
If you won't let me help you, you will die.

431
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,934
那样 你的羞耻也就扫清了
That's a clean end to your disgrace, then.

432
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:49,934
天啊! 你跟她一样惹人生气!
Oh, Christ! You are just as exasperating as she was!

433
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:55,300
她死了吗?
Is she dead?

434
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:59,100
没什么区别 她离开了
It makes no difference. She's gone.

435
00:28:59,267 --> 00:29:02,834
我让你想起她了
I remind you of her.

436
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:06,000
所以你才不敢直视我
That's why you can't stand to look at me.

437
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:08,200
因为她离开你了
Because she left you.

438
00:29:08,367 --> 00:29:10,934
你母亲是个平民
Your mother was a commoner.

439
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,868
她是个侍女
She was a servant girl.

440
00:29:13,133 --> 00:29:16,501
像她那样的人不能离开我这样的人
People like her don't leave people like me.

441
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:22,701
不可以
They don't.

442
00:29:22,734 --> 00:29:25,167
讲不通
It wouldn't make sense.

443
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:33,067
你身上的天赋真是浪费了
Genius was wasted on you.

444
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:07,267
你想要什么吗?
Do you want something?

445
00:30:07,434 --> 00:30:09,000
嗯
Mm.

446
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:12,200
达芬奇会被判刑
Da Vinci faces imprisonment,

447
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:14,267
可能会被处死
perhaps death,

448
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:17,601
而你有办法跟治安官周旋
and you have the power to intercede with the magistrate.

449
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:24,234
那需要做出牺牲...
Not without certain sacrifices...

450
00:30:24,467 --> 00:30:27,367
目前我们的贵宾很拘谨
given the prudery of my current guests.

451
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:34,934
他给我画的肖像很好
His portrait of me is remarkable.

452
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:38,300
可是如果不能完成的话 就不能让你想起我了
But it won't remind me of you nearly so well if it's never finished.

453
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:43,000
博蒂切利或者基尔兰达约可以接手
Botticelli or Ghirlandaio can take over.

454
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:46,467
你就为了这个要放掉艺术家?
Is that why you want the artista freed?

455
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:50,334
- 为了让自己名垂千古?  - 不是
- To immortalize you?  - No.

456
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:52,801
为了保护我们
To protect us.

457
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:56,000
达芬奇发明的天赋救过我们的命 洛伦佐
Da Vinci's gift for inventions saved our lives, Lorenzo.

458
00:30:56,167 --> 00:31:00,200
他可以发明一个方法跳出窘境
Well, he can invent his way out of his dilemma.

459
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,534
晚安
Good night,

460
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:06,234
亲爱的
my dear.

461
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:20,501
嗯... 这些放大镜是当放大镜用的吗?
Um... does this periscope thing do what it's supposed to do?

462
00:31:20,801 --> 00:31:24,701
我是按照说明办的 不过跟你们有一样的猜测
I followed the specifications but your guess is as good as mine.

463
00:31:24,934 --> 00:31:26,634
他单子上的其它东西呢?
What about the other items on his list?

464
00:31:26,901 --> 00:31:29,934
嗯 这罐浆糊溶解之前可以把一个人粘住好一阵
Um, this paste will hold a man for a good while before dissolving.

465
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:33,467
我给尼科试过这个药了 把他放翻了将近15分钟
I tested this potion out on Nico. Knocked him out for nearly 15 minutes.

466
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:37,467
你应该先告诉我 不然我摔倒的时候可能把脑袋摔坏了
You might have told me first. I could have split my head open when I collapsed.

467
00:31:37,701 --> 00:31:40,534
有没有人能告诉我... 我们要粘谁 为什么要粘?
Can anyone tell me... who are we gluing to what and why?

468
00:31:40,767 --> 00:31:43,801
是这样 我们的朋友可能在监狱里已经傻了
Look, our friend might have lost his wits in prison.

469
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,133
有这种情况
It happens.

470
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:47,334
捆绑架 迷药 放大镜
A prison, a potion, a periscope,

471
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:48,934
一头猪还有浆糊
a pig and a paste pot.

472
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,734
要是有个疯子造出来个抓动物的陷阱 应该就是这个样子了吧
If a madman created a scavenger hunt, this is what it would look like.

473
00:32:06,334 --> 00:32:10,767
你觉得自己比我们都聪明 艺术家
You thought you could outsmart us all, artista.

474
00:32:10,968 --> 00:32:14,167
可是上帝比你聪明
But God's wiser than you.

475
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:16,234
而且是站在我们这边的
And he's on our side.

476
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,868
- 现在呢?  - 等信号
- What happens now?  - We wait.

477
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,968
- 等干什么?  - 不知道
- For what?  - I don't know.

478
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:47,400
他说会很明显
He said it would be obvious.

479
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,567
- 怎么回事?  - 怎么了?
- What's going on?  - What is that?

480
00:32:56,767 --> 00:33:00,834
我觉得这够明显了
I guess that's pretty clear.

481
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,701
达芬奇!
Da Vinci!

482
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:15,467
别放炮了
Stop the explosions.

483
00:33:18,734 --> 00:33:20,334
怎么了?
What?

484
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:24,400
你觉得我是在牢房里策划了一次炮击吗?
You think I've organized a bombardment from my cell?

485
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:26,734
我从来不会停止取乐
I never cease to amaze myself.

486
00:33:44,334 --> 00:33:45,734
哪来的?
Where are they coming from?

487
00:33:45,934 --> 00:33:47,534
你还真是不着急过来
You took your time coming to visit.

488
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:50,400
你也就危急的时候会想到我了!
You want my company now, with your little prick on the line!

489
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:54,367
- 我们时间有限 琐罗  - 他们说的是真的吗? 这地方把你脑子整坏了?
- We have minutes, Zo.  - Is it true what they say? This place sours your brain?

490
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:57,701
- 你要帮我吗?  - 穿过厨房有一条出去的路
- Do you want to help me or not?  - There's a way out through the kitchens.

491
00:33:57,968 --> 00:34:00,067
我们不能一起走 你要留下
We're not going together. You're staying.

492
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:03,000
- 才不要  - 听着...
- Fuck, no.  - Look...

493
00:34:03,234 --> 00:34:04,701
不能让他们知道我越狱了
They can't know I've escaped.

494
00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:07,033
要让他们认为我还在这
They need to think I'm still here.

495
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:10,067
带上吧 老鼠毛的
Wear that. It's rat's hair.

496
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,234
把我自己埋进蝙蝠屎里冒充你?
Cloak myself in bat shit and pretend I'm you?

497
00:34:12,434 --> 00:34:16,033
对天发誓 我还没疯呢
I swear to God I'm not mad.

498
00:34:16,234 --> 00:34:18,133
我只是绝望
I'm desperate.

499
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,167
愤怒 另外需要吃顿好的
Enraged. In need of a good meal.

500
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:23,334
不过我没疯
But I am not mad.

501
00:34:26,634 --> 00:34:28,567
你还真是跟朋友不客气
You ask a great deal of your friends.

502
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:33,100
我知道
I know.

503
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:34,667
别打我主意
Sodomite.

504
00:34:41,834 --> 00:34:44,000
所有人都在押 长官!
Everybody's still locked in, sir!

505
00:34:55,534 --> 00:34:58,901
不管你朋友策划了什么 都失败了
Whatever your friends planned, it failed.

506
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:05,467
去你的 莱昂
Fuck you, Leo.

507
00:35:09,601 --> 00:35:12,167
蝙蝠屎的磷化炸弹
Phosphorus bat shit bombs.

508
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:16,901
也许我是疯了
Maybe I am losing my mind.

509
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:19,767
计划就是大家一起被烧死?
So the grand plan is we all burn at the stake?

510
00:35:20,033 --> 00:35:21,767
这是个简单直接的行动
It's a straightforward operation.

511
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,834
这是禁闭和中毒性疯癫的产物！彻底疯了!
It's the product of solitude and delirium! It's totally mad!

512
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,434
难道艺术不需要一点疯癫吗?
Doesn't certain art require a touch of madness?

513
00:35:28,701 --> 00:35:32,000
我觉得你应该知道这东西只有在日光下才能工作的吧?
I suppose you are aware that this device can only function in the daylight?

514
00:35:32,267 --> 00:35:34,734
- 我早有准备  - 你当然有
- I've prepared for that.  - Of course you have.

515
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:38,067
要是这招不奏效 你想过后果吗?
Have you given any thought to what will happen if it doesn't work?

516
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:42,067
- 没什么  - 我受惊了 又放心了
- None whatsoever.  - I'm both terrified and reassured.

517
00:35:42,234 --> 00:35:46,567
我才不当别人的爪牙
I will be no-one's pawn.

518
00:35:46,767 --> 00:35:49,334
他们把我放在众目睽睽之下取笑
They put me on display to be ridiculed,

519
00:35:49,534 --> 00:35:52,901
作为鸡奸洛伦佐的工具
as a tool to sodomize Lorenzo.

520
00:35:53,033 --> 00:35:54,834
他们夺走了我的自由
They took away my liberty.

521
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:59,767
要让他们也尝到跟我同样的境遇!
And now they will taste the same bile that I have!

522
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:02,534
而且...
Besides...

523
00:36:02,767 --> 00:36:08,267
还有什么计划可以给我带来我渴望的东西?
what other plan gains me what I crave? Hm?

524
00:36:08,434 --> 00:36:11,400
你渴望什么 莱昂?
Which is what, Leo?

525
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:15,133
治安官的屁股
The magistrate's arse.

526
00:36:15,434 --> 00:36:18,200
在我们看演出之前 我给你们看过这个吗?
Before we head in to the performance, have I shown you this?

527
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:20,701
长凳?
A bench?

528
00:36:20,868 --> 00:36:22,067
我们阿拉贡地区也有
We have benches in Aragon.

529
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,367
是 我知道 不过请注意...
Yes, yes, but please notice...

530
00:36:25,567 --> 00:36:29,834
这边缘上面的标记
notice the markings along its edge.

531
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:34,033
每周一次 我都对想要见我的人开放我的书房
Once a week, I open my study to anyone who wishes to approach me

532
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,968
长凳上的标记显示了请求人排队的次序
and petitioners mark on the bench to indicate their place in line.

533
00:36:39,234 --> 00:36:41,901
对下等人开放吗?
Doesn't that open you to rabble?

534
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:44,100
有时候 会的
On occasion, yes.

535
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:47,133
不过这也保持了佛罗伦萨的兴旺
But it also keeps Florence thriving.

536
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:50,367
就像古语说的 "金钱无罪"
As the old saying has it, "Pecunia non olet."

537
00:36:50,534 --> 00:36:54,367
铜臭不臭
Money has no smell.

538
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:57,567
我们美第奇家族没有帕吉家族那么辉煌的历史
We Medicis have no historic name like the Pazzis.

539
00:36:57,734 --> 00:37:01,434
我们只能依靠自己的智慧
We must rely on our wits.

540
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:05,300
我们改革 创造金融工具
We innovate. We create the financial instruments,

541
00:37:05,534 --> 00:37:08,033
现在已经受整片大陆的依赖
on which the entire continent now relies.

542
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,300
美第奇家族的座右铭?
The motto of the house of Medici?

543
00:37:10,467 --> 00:37:15,367
"敬神... 求利"
"In God... and profit."

544
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:19,767
而且这利润是看得见的
And that profit emerges from vision.

545
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:25,167
听着 家族血统还有头衔...
See, names and lineages and titles...

546
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:28,033
它们会消退 不过金钱...
they fade, but currency...

547
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:32,200
永远是金钱
currency stays current.

548
00:37:32,434 --> 00:37:35,400
而且 比这片大陆上其它银行更出众的
And that, more than any other bank in the land,

549
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:39,834
是美第奇家族的专业性
is the expertise of the house of Medici.

550
00:37:43,868 --> 00:37:49,200
这枚弗罗林正面有我们的印章...
This florin, with our seal on the front...

551
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,334
还有哪种货币是以城市命名的?
What other currency is named after a city?

552
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:55,467
只有佛罗伦萨是因为金融的成功而出名的
Only Florence is so identified with financial success,

553
00:37:55,634 --> 00:37:58,200
堪称此种荣誉
to lay claim to that honor.

554
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:02,434
这里有一个新的世界...
There is a new world here...

555
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:04,300
就在佛罗伦萨
in Florence.

556
00:38:09,834 --> 00:38:14,334
我等你们的决定
I await your decision.

557
00:38:14,634 --> 00:38:19,033
我想知道他今晚的演员会不会像他这样高谈阔论
I wonder if his actors tonight will speechify quite like he does.

558
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:22,334
演员们 请注意
Players, attend.

559
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:26,868
今晚我们要演十日谈 不过不是全部的章节
We will be performing the Decameron this evening, but not all the parts.

560
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,400
我被劝告删掉所有章节 只保留最虔诚的部分
I've been counseled to remove all but the most pious pieces,

561
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:32,601
是为了我们皇室的贵宾
for the deference of our regal guests.

562
00:38:32,868 --> 00:38:37,234
不过... 佛罗伦萨不是他们的家 是我们的
But... Florence is not their home. It's ours.

563
00:38:37,467 --> 00:38:40,234
他们要是不喜欢就滚蛋
And they will either love it or leave.

564
00:38:40,534 --> 00:38:45,000
准备好 我们的剧目只演出下流和粗俗的章节
Prepare our production so that only the bawdy and vulgar stories remain.

565
00:38:46,067 --> 00:38:48,100
阁下 那你哥哥怎么办?
Excellency, what of your brother?

566
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:50,567
他会跟其他人一起笑抽的
He'll laugh his arse off with the rest of them.

567
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:53,067
- 这头猪呢 阁下?  - 留下
- And this pig, Signor?  - Stays in.

568
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:56,901
我们的城市里怎么就不能留一两头猪呢?
For what's our city without a pig or two?

569
00:39:23,701 --> 00:39:27,067
今天怎么样?
How did it go today?

570
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:31,434
他们有好领袖心照不宣的特点
They have the tacit trait of all good leaders.

571
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:34,601
藏不住心里所想
Their faces belie nothing.

572
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:44,534
我不敢相信我们要接受这种堕落
I cannot believe we are to be subjected to such decadence.

573
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:48,133
衰落的制度戏剧化得抽打着他们的痛处
Dying regimes flail dramatically in their death throes.

574
00:39:48,434 --> 00:39:53,467
而且请相信我 美第奇家族的制度也时日无多了
And trust me when I predict the days of the Medici regime are numbered.

575
00:39:56,133 --> 00:39:58,267
晚上好
Buona sera.

576
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,067
晚上好
Buona sera.

577
00:40:01,267 --> 00:40:04,968
今晚我们为你呈献佛罗伦萨的礼物
Tonight we give you a gift of Florence.

578
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:07,300
薄伽丘的十日谈
Boccaccio's the Decameron.

579
00:40:07,601 --> 00:40:11,534
出于对您的尊重 我删除了部分剧目
As a favor to you, I've chosen not to present all the pieces.

580
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,634
一百个故事太长了
100 stories takes a long time,

581
00:40:15,901 --> 00:40:17,767
我不想让前排的观众们
and I didn't want the poor souls in the front

582
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,968
被牧羊人毛里奇奥的味道熏晕了
to be smoked out by the stench of Maurizio the shepherd.

583
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:27,667
今晚你们将会见证佛罗伦萨的精髓
Now, this evening, you will witness the true spirit of Florence.

584
00:40:27,834 --> 00:40:29,667
她的信仰和品德
Her faith and virtues,

585
00:40:29,868 --> 00:40:33,267
还有她的自由和庸俗
right along with her freedom and vulgarities.

586
00:40:33,434 --> 00:40:36,067
请欣赏... 十日谈
Enjoy... the Decameron.

587
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:45,534
哎呀 我把所有的钱都花在发带上了
Alas, I've used my last coin on ribbons for my hair.

588
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,868
让我买面包的阿姨肯定会生气的
The aunt who wanted bread will surely be angry with me.

589
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:53,133
我还能做什么?
Whatever am I to do?

590
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,400
哎呀...
Alas...

591
00:40:55,634 --> 00:40:59,567
我在这条路上等了很久
I have wandered this road for many a day and night.

592
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:03,868
为了触摸女人的身体 我什么都愿意付出
What I would not give to touch a woman's flesh.

593
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,167
哦!
Ooh!

594
00:41:05,434 --> 00:41:09,133
为什么我的腿突然这么无力
Why, I'd give my legs underneath me.

595
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:11,734
啊
Ah.

596
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,167
只有当圣阿里格让我触摸到她的时候
Only when Saint Arrigo's hand does touch her bones to mine,

597
00:41:16,334 --> 00:41:19,467
才能治愈我
will I be healed in time.

598
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:23,400
也许我可以用尽我的力气试试
Perhaps I could try to lift with all my might.

599
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:26,300
如果你可以 我一定会抓紧的
And if you could, I'd surely hold on tight.

600
00:41:26,467 --> 00:41:29,567
哦 啊!
Ooh. Argh!

601
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:45,501
这是什么...?
What's this...?

602
00:41:49,601 --> 00:41:54,133
温柔的幽会需要合适的光线
A romantic assignation requires the appropriate light.

603
00:41:55,968 --> 00:42:01,868
现在 你问过我 什么样的罪行会比鸡奸和巫术更重
Now, you asked me what crime could possibly be worse than sodomy or sorcery.

604
00:42:02,067 --> 00:42:03,968
我从来不回避挑战
Well, I never turn down a challenge.

605
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,534
别动 别动
Be still. Be still.

606
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:09,901
不然你一动我朋友可能就提起性趣来了
Or my friend here may get aroused by your movements.

607
00:42:11,901 --> 00:42:14,234
黏胶要粘好长一阵呢
The fixative will last a good while,

608
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,767
请仔细听吧
so listen closely.

609
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,167
因为你的名誉决定于此
Your reputation depends on it.

610
00:42:22,467 --> 00:42:25,901
在这一组镜头最后面
At the far end of this arrangement of prisms and lenses,

611
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:27,534
是一个模糊相机
lies a camera obscura.

612
00:42:27,868 --> 00:42:31,667
通常是凭借自然光线来投射影像的
It's usually employed to delight crowds with projections of nature.

613
00:42:31,901 --> 00:42:36,634
不过非自然光线也可以
But unnatural projections work just as well.

614
00:42:36,868 --> 00:42:39,567
- 你疯了  - 是
- You're insane.  - Yes.

615
00:42:39,701 --> 00:42:42,434
现在收获我的破坏吧
Now reap the whirlwind.

616
00:43:10,367 --> 00:43:12,601
上帝完成了所有的愿望...
God grants all wishes...

617
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:25,734
他们看不到你的脸
They cannot see your face.

618
00:43:25,901 --> 00:43:27,501
目前还看不到
Yet.

619
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:37,534
我要做的只是调整几度焦距 再打开镜头
All I need to do is rotate you a few degrees, open the prism again,

620
00:43:37,767 --> 00:43:41,667
你就将遗臭万年
and your notoriety will be assured for centuries.

621
00:43:41,968 --> 00:43:45,734
- 你想怎么样?  - 你给我在四份文件上盖章
- What do you want?  - Your mark on four documents.

622
00:43:45,968 --> 00:43:49,400
第一份 不可撤销的驳回所有对我的指控
One, an irrevocable dismissal of the charges against me,

623
00:43:49,634 --> 00:43:51,667
以及对未来指控的赔偿文件
and indemnity against future prosecution.

624
00:43:51,701 --> 00:43:57,000
第二份 对你自己兽奸罪行的公正悔过
Two, a full confession to your crime of bestiality in the palace of justice,

625
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:59,634
可以在我死之前完全保密
to be held in safekeeping in the event of my death.

626
00:43:59,934 --> 00:44:03,868
第三份 为你所谓的庭审造成对达芬奇的折磨
Three, a donation of 50 florins to Piero da Vinci,

627
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,033
赔付五十弗罗林
for tolerating your so-called courtroom.

628
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:11,868
第四份 向我明示匿名告发的人
Four, the release to me of the secret denunciation which accused me.

629
00:44:12,133 --> 00:44:15,968
火焰熄灭之前你要在四份文件上盖章
You will make your mark on all four documents before this flare dies,

630
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,534
不然我就打开镜头把你的罪行公之于众
or I will open the prism again and expose your vice for all to see.

631
00:44:19,834 --> 00:44:23,334
我会告诉大家你的所作所为的!
I'll tell them what you've done!

632
00:44:23,367 --> 00:44:27,067
你是想解释说这个现场
Your preferred explanation is that this entire scene,

633
00:44:27,267 --> 00:44:29,567
是一个全佛罗伦萨都知道
was engineered in your inner sanctum,

634
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:33,033
被单独关押在禁闭室的人干的吗?
by a man that all Florence knows is in solitary confinement?

635
00:44:33,267 --> 00:44:35,100
不会有人信的
The people will never believe it of me.

636
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,501
罪行越重 越吸引人
The more scandalous the accusation, the greater their appetite for it.

637
00:44:39,734 --> 00:44:41,701
庭审我的时候旁听席里满是人
The gallery was filled at my trial,

638
00:44:41,868 --> 00:44:45,334
而我只是一个疯癫的艺术家而已!
and I am just a mad artist!

639
00:44:45,634 --> 00:44:49,200
对治安官的庭审应该就只剩下站席了
It'll be standing room only for a magistrate's trial.

640
00:44:49,434 --> 00:44:51,634
而如果你违约
And should you renege on our agreement,

641
00:44:51,868 --> 00:44:56,067
这块板子... 通过阿氏处理法
then this shroud... treated with silver nitrate,

642
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,133
使用硝酸银制作
using the methods of Albertus Magnus,

643
00:44:58,367 --> 00:45:01,434
可以承载你的丑行很长时间
bears a lasting record of your infamy,

644
00:45:01,634 --> 00:45:04,601
我会很高兴在未来展出
which I would be happy to display in the future.

645
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:07,300
就算你能说服人们
And even if you could convince people,

646
00:45:07,501 --> 00:45:11,968
这个不是你
somehow that this isn't you,

647
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,100
你的余生都将用来
you will spend the rest of your life,

648
00:45:14,267 --> 00:45:16,767
回应无尽的传言
answering the undying rumors.

649
00:45:17,033 --> 00:45:19,400
因为人们相信自己的眼睛
Cos people believe what's before their eyes.

650
00:45:19,701 --> 00:45:23,701
而我既然能让这幅图展现在佛罗伦萨的天空
And if I can get this image seen in the skies above Florence,

651
00:45:23,868 --> 00:45:27,100
我就能让它无处不在
I can get it seen everywhere.

652
00:45:27,334 --> 00:45:31,234
历史就会这样铭记你
This is how history will remember you.

653
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,701
在你的法庭上
Fucking a pig,

654
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:37,167
操一头猪
in the middle of your courtroom.

655
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:40,267
谎言 还是真相...
Lies, truth...

656
00:45:40,434 --> 00:45:42,434
根本没关系
It's irrelevant.

657
00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:46,300
只有最精彩的故事会传承
The best story wins.

658
00:45:48,534 --> 00:45:51,601
光明带来了什么困惑
Oh, what confusion comes with light.

659
00:45:51,834 --> 00:45:54,801
请赐予我夜的黑暗
Bring me the darkness of the night.

660
00:45:54,968 --> 00:45:58,200
太多不可见 太多未知
So much unseen, so much to know.

661
00:45:58,434 --> 00:46:03,200
在黑暗中 才会出现最好的惊喜
In the dark, the best surprise does show.

662
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:10,434
多么激动的场面 阁下
A hysterical spectacle, Your Excellency.

663
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:13,067
空中的图像 我从来没见过
The image in the sky. I've never seen anything like it.

664
00:46:13,234 --> 00:46:16,434
剧场是... 神奇的
Theatre is... magic.

665
00:46:16,667 --> 00:46:19,167
就是这样!
That it is!

666
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,534
干得好 各位 干得漂亮!
Well done, everyone. Well done!

667
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,400
被告被指控关于...
The defendant stands accused of...

668
00:46:45,567 --> 00:46:49,234
鸡奸和异教的罪名
deviancy and heresy.

669
00:46:49,467 --> 00:46:52,901
经过考虑 庭审程序
After due consideration, it is the ruling of this court,

670
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,534
诉方无法证实罪名成立
that the prosecution was unable to prove these crimes true.

671
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:00,701
我在此解除对莱昂纳多・达芬奇的所有指控
I hereby dismiss all charges against Leonardo da Vinci.

672
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,801
- 我是个天才  - 你还一身蝙蝠屎味儿
- Well, I'm a genius.  - You still smell like bat shit.

673
00:47:26,701 --> 00:47:29,167
好哇!
Ah, bravo!

674
00:47:29,334 --> 00:47:30,868
好啊 莱昂
Bravo, Leo.

675
00:47:31,167 --> 00:47:35,200
你应该祝贺的是他
That's the man you should be congratulating.

676
00:47:35,434 --> 00:47:37,334
我不知道你怎么做到的
I don't know how you did that,

677
00:47:37,567 --> 00:47:39,200
不过在拥有自由的时候 好好享受吧
but enjoy your freedom while you may.

678
00:47:39,501 --> 00:47:42,000
罗马不能通过法庭达到的目的
For what Rome cannot accomplish through the courts,

679
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:44,334
会换别的方式来的
it will by other means.

680
00:47:44,467 --> 00:47:45,968
别惹麻烦
Stay out of trouble.

681
00:47:46,133 --> 00:47:47,534
父亲...
Father...

682
00:47:51,267 --> 00:47:53,100
我会的
I will.

683
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,100
你的路永远不会平坦
Your path has never been easy.

684
00:48:04,067 --> 00:48:07,400
在我的土地 力量都是与生俱来的
In my land, power derives from birthright.

685
00:48:12,767 --> 00:48:14,968
为了保持家族的力量
I had to marry my pug-faced cousin,

686
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,901
我不得不娶我那个狗脸的表妹
to keep power in the family.

687
00:48:19,067 --> 00:48:20,701
不过你和你弟弟
But you and your brother,

688
00:48:20,834 --> 00:48:22,834
并没有皇室血统
with no royal blood at all,

689
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,868
可以组建一整座城市
rally an entire city.

690
00:48:26,033 --> 00:48:29,567
不用恐怖统治 而是欢乐
Not out of fear, but joy.

691
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:37,133
你们甚至知道人民的名字
You even know some of them by name.

692
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,667
人民也因此拥戴你
And they love you for it.

693
00:48:40,868 --> 00:48:45,400
你给我留下了印象
You've left your mark on me.

694
00:48:45,634 --> 00:48:49,534
我也会在佛罗伦萨留下我的印象
And I leave my mark in Florence.

695
00:48:54,634 --> 00:48:57,234
我们同意你的条款
We agree to your terms.

696
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:02,367
美第奇家族将会是新西班牙使用的银行
The Medicis will be the bankers of a new Spain.

697
00:49:08,701 --> 00:49:12,634
敬佛罗伦萨 同性恋可以和任何人 随时随地 不受拘束
To Florence, where you can bugger whoever, wherever, and get away with it.

698
00:49:12,868 --> 00:49:15,400
敬使这成为可能的朋友
To the friends who make it possible.

699
00:49:15,667 --> 00:49:17,667
说真的 我很高兴有你这个朋友
Seriously, I'm lucky to have you.

700
00:49:17,901 --> 00:49:21,968
等你帮我从屁股里洗蝙蝠屎的时候也别忘了就行
Remember that when you're washing the bat shit from my arse crack.

701
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:43,667
如果我在庭审上展示这个 就不会有那么多的诡辩可以救得了你了
If I'd produced this at the trial, no amount of sophistry would have saved you.

702
00:49:43,868 --> 00:49:47,334
不过我只是想让你曝光 不想让你死
But I wanted to see you exposed, not killed.

703
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:51,868
为什么?
Why?

704
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,934
因为你跟女人之间的不是真爱
What you have with women isn't love.

705
00:49:56,133 --> 00:49:57,567
你是因为恐惧才找女人的
You're with them out of fear.

706
00:49:57,734 --> 00:50:01,734
我这是自然天性的好奇
I'm curious by nature.

707
00:50:01,934 --> 00:50:06,567
欲望... 并不只是喜欢哪个性别那么简单
Desire... It's not as simple as one sex or the other.

708
00:50:10,334 --> 00:50:13,601
抱歉 我伤害了你
I'm sorry I hurt you.

709
00:50:13,868 --> 00:50:17,467
我的实验和好奇心 太过...
My experiments and curiosities, they're...

710
00:50:17,801 --> 00:50:20,601
有时候是有代价的 我本该多加小心
They're not always without cost and I should mind that better.

711
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:25,367
不过相信我... 相信我...
But trust me... trust me...

712
00:50:25,534 --> 00:50:28,200
没有人能管我
no-one defines me.

713
00:50:32,267 --> 00:50:34,901
不管是佛罗伦萨过时的法律
Not Florence's outdated laws,

714
00:50:34,934 --> 00:50:36,300
而且当然...
and certainly...

715
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:40,167
当然... 你也不行
certainly... not you.

716
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:50,267
你对我的感情会消退 也会再找到别人去爱
Your infatuation will fade and you will find others to love.

717
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,400
我不怀疑
I have no doubt.

718
00:51:13,767 --> 00:51:17,033
每一个吻都有意义
Every kiss sends a message.

719
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:21,667
这个吻... 即是告别
That one... was goodbye.

720
00:51:21,801 --> 00:51:23,133
告别?
Goodbye?

721
00:51:47,667 --> 00:51:52,634
是这样 这个曲调从没听别人哼过
Do you know, I've never heard that tune from anyone except you.

722
00:51:52,834 --> 00:51:56,968
我小的时候我父亲经常哼唱
My father used to hum it to me when I was a child.

723
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:00,033
好了
Done.

724
00:52:00,234 --> 00:52:02,000
他现在在哪?
Where is he now?

725
00:52:05,868 --> 00:52:09,234
我不能说
I cannot say.

726
00:52:09,467 --> 00:52:12,434
失去父母很让人伤心
Losing a parent breaks hearts.

727
00:52:12,634 --> 00:52:15,234
我的父亲对我来说一直是...
My father's always been...

728
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,267
迷失的
lost to me.

729
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,767
那你母亲呢?
And your mother?

730
00:52:20,801 --> 00:52:25,901
在隔海相望的 一块没有名字的土地上
In a land with no name, across the seas.

731
00:52:26,167 --> 00:52:29,834
如果我收集的线索是真的
If the clues I've gathered on my quest are true.

732
00:52:30,067 --> 00:52:34,033
脱离这次告发 也许我就能再找到她
Escaping that denunciation, perhaps I can find her again.

733
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,167
你怎么得到的?
How did you come by this?

734
00:52:39,634 --> 00:52:43,133
这些告发信通常都是被严密看管的
These denunciations are usually so well guarded.

735
00:52:43,367 --> 00:52:47,567
嗯 我对被严密看管的东西...
Mm. Well, I have a penchant for acquiring things...

736
00:52:48,567 --> 00:52:50,567
都有强烈的获取倾向
that are well guarded.

737
00:52:56,634 --> 00:52:59,200
你计划怎么办呢?
And what do you plan on doing with it?

738
00:53:01,334 --> 00:53:03,300
嗯?
Hm?

739
00:53:03,334 --> 00:53:08,901
我计划通过它来找到并面对我的告发者
I plan on using it to find and confront my accuser.

740
00:53:09,067 --> 00:53:10,434
显然是
Obviously.

741
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:16,234
不管是谁写的 都差点断送了我的自由和性命
Cos whoever wrote those words almost took my freedom and my life.

742
00:53:16,467 --> 00:53:20,334
要是告发者并没有想让事情这么严重呢?
And what if your accuser didn't intend for it to go that far?

743
00:53:20,567 --> 00:53:23,167
他们还能有什么期望?
What other outcome could they have intended?

744
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,701
- 这可是鸡奸的罪名  - 我知道
- It was a sodomy charge.  - I know.

745
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:27,767
我凭借胆识和智慧才摆脱的
I only got out with nerve and wit.

746
00:53:32,901 --> 00:53:34,901
嗯
Hm.

747
00:53:38,801 --> 00:53:41,434
这个是与我很亲近的人送的
That belonged to someone very dear to me.

748
00:53:41,601 --> 00:53:44,467
嗯?
Hm?

749
00:53:44,601 --> 00:53:47,267
给
Here.

750
00:53:47,467 --> 00:53:52,133
带着吧 小心保管以防不测
Carry it with you. Keep it safe in case anything happens.

751
00:53:52,367 --> 00:53:54,234
为什么你会发生不测?
Why would anything happen to you?

752
00:53:54,367 --> 00:53:56,434
因为天有不测风云
Because these are uncertain times.

753
00:53:56,667 --> 00:54:01,167
我能向洛伦佐炫耀吗?
And shall I flaunt it near Lorenzo?

754
00:54:01,334 --> 00:54:04,467
那可能会引起不测
That would alleviate any uncertainty.

755
00:54:04,634 --> 00:54:06,901
你要是聪明就不会这么做的
You'd be wise not to.

756
00:54:15,267 --> 00:54:18,567
你恋爱过吗... 女士?
Have you ever been in love... Signora?

757
00:54:19,567 --> 00:54:21,567
嗯...
Um...

758
00:54:25,901 --> 00:54:28,734
在我的追求中 爱只是负担
In my pursuits, love is a liability.

759
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:31,734
我也是
Mine, too.

760
00:54:33,434 --> 00:54:35,534
也许这就是我们的共同点
Maybe that's what we share.

761
00:54:35,701 --> 00:54:37,234
什么?
What?

762
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,000
我们都注定一生无爱
Both of us bound to a life without love.

763
00:55:19,934 --> 00:55:22,834
你看起来有点意外
You seem surprised.

764
00:55:23,133 --> 00:55:27,267
我告诉过你 一旦你饮过记忆之泉我就会回来
I told you I would return once you had sipped from the fountain of memory.

765
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,200
可我没有
But I haven't.

766
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:39,567
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

767
00:55:39,734 --> 00:55:44,234
你在监狱里没有遇到什么吗?
You did not experience something while imprisoned?

768
00:55:54,033 --> 00:55:55,834
那只是一个梦
That was a dream.

769
00:55:55,968 --> 00:55:57,834
仅此而已
It was nothing more.

770
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,834
当然 你全都记得
Surely you, who remembers all,

771
00:56:00,968 --> 00:56:03,400
须知这不是梦
know it was no dream.

772
00:56:03,567 --> 00:56:07,033
什么都不是
It was nothing.

773
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,267
只是...
It was just...

774
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,801
只是一闪而过 偶发...
Just flashes. Incoher...

775
00:56:13,534 --> 00:56:17,033
闭上眼睛再看一遍
Close your eyes and see again.

776
00:56:19,701 --> 00:56:22,300
回到洞里 莱昂纳多
Return to the cave, Leonardo.

777
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,767
有尸体 我看到尸体
There were bodies. I saw bodies.

778
00:56:31,801 --> 00:56:33,834
我看... 我看到一个人...
I s... I saw a man...

779
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,701
被倒吊着
hanging upside down.

780
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:42,701
我...
I... 

781
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,567
我觉得... 我觉得他跟别人一样 已经死了
I thought... I thought he was dead, like the rest.

782
00:56:50,467 --> 00:56:52,000
不过他还活着
But he was alive.

783
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,300
- 他是谁 莱昂纳多?  - 我...
- Who was it, Leonardo?  - I...

784
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,868
放开我
Free me.

785
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:03,167
放开我!
Free me!

786
00:57:08,567 --> 00:57:10,834
- 不可能  - 你看到了什么?
- It doesn't make sense.  - What did you see?

787
00:57:11,834 --> 00:57:13,267
放开我
Free me.

788
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,834
是我自己
It was me.

789

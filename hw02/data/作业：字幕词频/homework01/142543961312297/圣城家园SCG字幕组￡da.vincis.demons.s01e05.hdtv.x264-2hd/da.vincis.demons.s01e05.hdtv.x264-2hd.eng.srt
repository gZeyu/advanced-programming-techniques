1
00:00:00,868 --> 00:00:01,501
Isn't that your father?

2
00:00:02,868 --> 00:00:04,501
He serves as Lorenzo's notary.

3
00:00:05,934 --> 00:00:08,501
Stay away from the Medicis, Leonardo.

4
00:00:08,734 --> 00:00:11,167
If you transfer your accounts to the Pazzi Bank,

5
00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:14,334
away from the Medicis, you'll have all the funds you need.

6
00:00:15,734 --> 00:00:17,601
Its bite is almost never noticed.

7
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:21,434
So no evidence implicating Lorenzo's lover.

8
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:22,968
May I model for you again?

9
00:00:23,267 --> 00:00:25,734
Go peddle your wares with Botticelli. He's an easy mark.

10
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:28,334
Interrogate the victim mentioned here, Captain.

11
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:31,501
Once he confirms the charges, make your arrest.

12
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:34,100
It has come to the attention of the Officers of the Night,

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,501
by means of secret denunciation,

14
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:38,434
Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci

15
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:41,334
has committed the grievous act of sodomy.

16
00:00:42,434 --> 00:00:46,334


17
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:56,367


18
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:42,167


19
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:27,000
Weren't no dream. You're still here.

20
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:34,000
Why do we have to share cells with a dung puncher?

21
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:38,000
He's sleeping like a baby, I'm scared to turn over.

22
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,701
Bats.

23
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,901
What is that place?

24
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:52,501
Solitary confinement, where we put the troublemakers.

25
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:54,801
So behave yourself.

26
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:56,400
The bats nest in there?

27
00:02:56,634 --> 00:03:00,100
By the hundreds. It's a shit-hole.

28
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:03,334
Then again, maybe you'd like it.

29
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:06,067
Where's your Medici friend now?

30
00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:17,767
Your Highness.

31
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:20,801
The beating heart of our operation.

32
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:24,334
Yes. With an impressively large workforce.

33
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:27,901
Let me see. Three, five, seven...

34
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:30,300
13... 27...

35
00:03:30,434 --> 00:03:32,267
Your Highness.

36
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:35,300
Just testing the mettle of your men.

37
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:37,534
As I'm sure you're aware, Queen Isabella and I,

38
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:39,534
don't offer our business to just anyone.

39
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:43,000
I can assure you not only of the competency of my men,

40
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:45,067
but also guarantee our reputation

41
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,767
as the most trusted bank in all of Europe.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,734
And yet you no longer serve as God's banker.

43
00:03:50,901 --> 00:03:52,701
Well, for now.

44
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:55,300
A disagreement with the current policies in Rome.

45
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:57,901
One I pray God will soon see rectified.

46
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,567
Do you deserve God's favor,

47
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:05,234
given the behavior of this artist I hear you hold in high regard?

48
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:08,033
Neither Da Vinci's actions nor his fate are my concern.

49
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,501
Only our business together is.

50
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:13,067
All I ask is for the opportunity to show you,

51
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:15,567
what the Medicis are capable of.

52
00:04:17,234 --> 00:04:18,934
I'm curious.

53
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:23,767
Approximately how many florins did...

54
00:04:23,934 --> 00:04:26,234
Rome actually default on?

55
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,767
As of last month, the sum stood at 87,000 florins.

56
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:34,267
I never lose count.

57
00:04:34,434 --> 00:04:36,501
Nor do my men.

58
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:40,100
The Medici family have always been patrons of the arts.

59
00:04:40,334 --> 00:04:43,300
Particularly those celebrating the holy faith.

60
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:48,067
Which is distinctly true of this creation, Your Highness.

61
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:54,567
David, as sculpted by Donatello.

62
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:02,901
The Lord who saved me from the claws of the lion and the bear,

63
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:05,801
will save me from this abomination.

64
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:08,901
You do not see beauty in its design, Friar Torquemada?

65
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:11,467
Is the artist a sexual deviant,

66
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:14,601
like others I've heard of in this region?

67
00:05:14,734 --> 00:05:16,601
I find it lewd.

68
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:18,934
Please cover it for the remainder of our visit.

69
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:25,534
Here's how it works, boy.

70
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:29,667
You feed me, I don't stave your head in.

71
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:31,200
Give it back.

72
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:34,434
What are you gonna do about it, scribbler?

73
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,133
I'm gonna take it off you.

74
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:41,234
What about now?

75
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:53,567
Come on! Break it up!

76
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,367
Not so confident now!

77
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:21,400
Your food... as requested.

78
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:24,834
Let me guess.

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,601
Lorenzo asked you to save me.

80
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:31,634
You will not see Lorenzo in court and you cannot blame him for that.

81
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,934
Your defense rests solely with me.

82
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:39,167
- I advise...  - Pleading guilty?

83
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,167
- Unfortunately, yes.  - Unfortunately, yes.

84
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,100
I see this as your only option.

85
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:46,300
If you're lucky, you may escape castration.

86
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:49,534
No! No.

87
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:52,167
No, pleas. No bargains.

88
00:06:52,334 --> 00:06:54,300
I want full refutation of the charges.

89
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:56,834
No... I want them dropped.

90
00:06:57,067 --> 00:07:02,067
I remain locked in here on the accusations of some unknown accuser.

91
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,167
- Unimportant.  - Unimportant?

92
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,501
Unless you can provide an alibi against the accusation

93
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,534
that you sodomized one...

94
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:13,300
Jacopo Saltarelli.

95
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:15,501
Jacopo's no victim.

96
00:07:18,968 --> 00:07:21,434
We have a number of defenses at our disposal.

97
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:23,567
- We can blame drink...  - No.

98
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:25,400
The use of opiates.

99
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:27,000
Or we can shift blame.

100
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,767
Your mentor Verrochio, perhaps.

101
00:07:29,934 --> 00:07:31,501
He corrupted you as a boy,

102
00:07:31,734 --> 00:07:33,734
warping your sense of morality.

103
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:37,000
Why not go further back? Claim it began with you.

104
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,100
Oh, fuck! I specifically asked for Marcgravia Evenia!

105
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:49,701
Ah, here it is.

106
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:52,334
Are you gonna eat them or play with them?

107
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:55,868
- I'll confiscate them.  - Yeah. By all means.

108
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:59,901
Demonstrate to everyone that I can terrify you with a leaf.

109
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,868
Perhaps I can dig an escape tunnel.

110
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,133
Your tunneling days are over, sodomite.

111
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:08,601
Deviance is in the eye of the beholder.

112
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:11,601
Plants practice a form of it. Pollination.

113
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:15,000
They seduce bees, bats, into transporting their seed.

114
00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:17,868
Because bats use echo to navigate.

115
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:20,934
See?

116
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,968
Plants have devised a way to exploit it.

117
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,501
Cos normal leaves, they have weak reflections.

118
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:30,167
But these concave petals, they...

119
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:34,067
they reflect sound over a much larger area.

120
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:37,067
Like a cave.

121
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,767
And it draws the bats in. It's a consensual arrangement.

122
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:44,067
The bats get nectar and the flowers get sex.

123
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:56,734
Insanity is, of course, another defense at our disposal.

124
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:07,701
You are demented if you think these charges will simply vanish.

125
00:09:07,868 --> 00:09:10,267
They must.

126
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:11,968
They will.

127
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,367
That pan-faced wench wouldn't know art if it sat on her face,

128
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:27,100
which her friar clearly longs to do.

129
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,834
And yet, having lost Rome's business,

130
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:33,434
we need Ferdinand and Isabella far more than they need us.

131
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:35,334
Did Ferdinand mention the trial?

132
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:37,267
Of course he did.

133
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:40,467
Rome's strategy with these charges is brilliant.

134
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,501
They couldn't have come at a worse time.

135
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:45,534
Ferdinand and Isabella face their own difficulties.

136
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:47,567
Currently they wage war with Portugal,

137
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:50,601
while facing civil uprisings at home.

138
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:53,767
Perhaps what they require is distraction.

139
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:56,367
And what exactly do you think would amuse them?

140
00:09:56,501 --> 00:10:00,667
A bonfire of Jews?

141
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,667
Let your brother decide that.

142
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:05,567
He can create a theatrical spectacle,

143
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:07,467
fill the stands with happy citizens,

144
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:09,234
and show a harmonious city.

145
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:13,334
Are you mad? Put our faith in Giuliano's clod-hopping hands?

146
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:16,601
Like you, he has his talents.

147
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:19,667
You impress. He charms.

148
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:40,167
He looks like hell. Do they feed him in there?

149
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:48,367
Magistrate, the defense is prepared.

150
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:50,467
Will the prosecution be joining us?

151
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:54,734
Or have they realized the error of these charges?

152
00:10:56,868 --> 00:10:58,701
Your answer has arrived.

153
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,300
What the hell is Francesco Pazzi doing here? He's not a jurist.

154
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,300
That's good for Leo, isn't it?

155
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,167
Pazzis are the Medicis' rivals.

156
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:16,200
Magistrate, may I raise a point relating to Signor Pazzi's role in this trial?

157
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:19,133
To my knowledge, he is not a member of the Notary Guild.

158
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,367
Signor Pazzi's associate membership,

159
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:26,100
was approved at an impromptu session last night.

160
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:30,234
Which was the appropriate forum for raising any objections.

161
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:33,200
Do you wish to make a formal complaint on behalf of your son?

162
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,133
He's not...

163
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,067
No.

164
00:11:39,234 --> 00:11:41,033
No complaint.

165
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,000
Does the accused have any opening mitigation to enter into plea?

166
00:11:45,234 --> 00:11:48,567
May it please the court, we will be contesting all the charges.

167
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:52,300
Signor Da Vinci, do you understand the potential ramifications

168
00:11:52,534 --> 00:11:54,767
of challenging these indictments?

169
00:11:56,701 --> 00:12:01,367
My client requests the privilege to make an opening statement.

170
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,701
I have dedicated my life...

171
00:12:20,868 --> 00:12:24,334
to the study of nature...

172
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:28,100
free from superstition or distortion.

173
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:30,868
These accusations, at best,

174
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,467
stem from a wellspring of ignorance.

175
00:12:36,534 --> 00:12:39,434
And, at worst, it speaks of political chicanery,

176
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:42,200
to question anyone's intimate relations in this manner,

177
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:46,400
cos I have nothing to be ashamed of.

178
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,801
And I have nothing to defend.

179
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:51,901
I can vouch for that. Should put me on the stand.

180
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:54,067
Hearing how he deflowered a nun won't help.

181
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,801
He'll only receive a fine. No-one burns for this any more.

182
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:01,467
Of those who will never be born,

183
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:03,667
thanks to their vice.

184
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:07,167
The sodomites in your city...

185
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,467
have the souls of the unborn on their conscience.

186
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:15,667
Those souls scream for justice.

187
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:17,634
"To the fire.

188
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:21,167
To the fire!"

189
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:25,567
Instead, your leaders promote sodomy,

190
00:13:25,734 --> 00:13:29,167
by levying fines instead of the proper sanction,

191
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:32,000
which is... the fire.

192
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,934
Who shat in his wine sack?

193
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:38,467
When you tax a crime, you make it a commodity.

194
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:42,133
The Medicis make their fortune from this vice

195
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,968
at the price of Florence's eternal shame.

196
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:50,200
Objection, Magistrate. I cannot comprehend why a foreigner

197
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,567
is being allowed to testify here today.

198
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:57,200
I called the esteemed Friar Torquemada as a voice of morality,

199
00:13:57,434 --> 00:14:00,868
reminding us all of our solemn responsibilities before God.

200
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,133
Would you deny him that right?

201
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,300
I would only remind the court that the seriousness of these charges is not in doubt,

202
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:12,300
but God is not served by punishing the innocent.

203
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:15,000
The case remains to be made.

204
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:18,501
Then perhaps it shall... after a recess.

205
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,868
I've heard, through the prison grapevine,

206
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:32,767
that Giuliano's mounting a theatrical production for the royal couple.

207
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,601
You face prolonged captivity and possible gelding,

208
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:38,067
yet your thoughts focus on trivialities.

209
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:44,367
See this is delivered to Zoroaster.

210
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:48,534
All you wrote was gibberish.

211
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:50,868
Your imprisonment affects your mind.

212
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:59,234
That's perhaps true, but that's cipher.

213
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,167
If my internment is to continue,

214
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:04,701
then there are certain private wishes I need fulfilled.

215
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:07,601
Minor matters. Disposition of my business.

216
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:09,934
That's all.

217
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,534
It's nothing to trouble you, Father.

218
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh, um...

219
00:15:16,234 --> 00:15:20,467
If Giuliano is yet to select a text,

220
00:15:20,634 --> 00:15:22,467
may I suggest the Decameron.

221
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,667
My favorite is the stolen pig story.

222
00:15:25,868 --> 00:15:27,601
It's quite a crowd-pleaser.

223
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:40,801
What about... a Passion Play?

224
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:43,067
Two hours of moral instruction? No.

225
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,534
I need a more diverting theatrical piece

226
00:15:45,734 --> 00:15:48,434
to distract the royals from our little scandal.

227
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,801
- Oedipus Rex?  - No, I think not.

228
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:53,567
We'd just be trading sodomy for incest.

229
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:55,767
I've always loved Lysistrata.

230
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:58,767
What? Women withholding sex?

231
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,834
Not only is that terrifying, but Isabella is...

232
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,868
well, frigid.

233
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:07,701
We probably shouldn't draw attention to it.

234
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:09,601
The Birds, then, Excellency?

235
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:12,000
A fantasy with pleasing songs.

236
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:14,200
Sounds boring as shit.

237
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:16,200
My s...

238
00:16:16,234 --> 00:16:18,634
defendant asked me to deliver this.

239
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:20,300
It's in some blasted code,

240
00:16:20,601 --> 00:16:23,367
but as far as I can see, it's not his last will and testament.

241
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:25,834
I came to you for your artistic expertise, Andrea.

242
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:27,501
Do you have nothing suitable to offer?

243
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:29,234
Have you considered the Decameron?

244
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:31,000
No. Should we.

245
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,100
It's a satire, brilliantly funny and penned by a native son of Florence.

246
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,667
With quite a bit of sex in it.

247
00:16:36,901 --> 00:16:38,834
- Between a man and a woman?  - Of course.

248
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,968
Well, I don't see the problem. We have our choice.

249
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,567
- Bring me a transcription.  - Is this wise, Excellency?

250
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:48,868
Wouldn't it be better to examine the Decameron again?

251
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,434
I'm told the stolen pig is quite a crowd pleaser.

252
00:16:52,601 --> 00:16:54,901
Signor, court has been recalled.

253
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:11,434
Tell me... Signor Saltarelli,

254
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:15,033
when you went back to Signor da Vinci's studio,

255
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,100
what happened?

256
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:20,367
The Maestro offered to draw me. Naked.

257
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:23,167
You've modeled for other artists before,

258
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,567
so this wasn't unusual.

259
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:27,267
Did he pay you for your time?

260
00:17:27,434 --> 00:17:29,334
Yes.

261
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:32,534
Four gold florins.

262
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:35,100
A handsome sum for an evening's work.

263
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:38,434
The laborer would have to toil for a month to earn the same.

264
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:41,400
The payment wasn't just for the drawing, was it?

265
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:43,767
No.

266
00:17:43,934 --> 00:17:48,534
- It was for my silence.  - Your silence?

267
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:52,334
What secret requires a payment of four gold florins?

268
00:17:54,634 --> 00:17:56,000
He sodomized me.

269
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,067
Did you consent to this heinous act,

270
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,434
offer any encouragement whatsoever?

271
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:01,968
No, Sir. None.

272
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:04,667
So Leonardo da Vinci forced himself on you?

273
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:37,100
This was your first time... being raped?

274
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:40,767
Yes.

275
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:42,834
And you were so traumatized,

276
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:46,100
- you went out and celebrated immediately after?  - I object!

277
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,167
Were you not at the Barking Dog that evening,

278
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:51,300
buying drinks for the establishment's entire clientele?

279
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:53,501
Yes.

280
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:56,901
I needed something to numb the pain.

281
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:58,701
To be surrounded by friends.

282
00:18:58,868 --> 00:19:03,534
Front or back?

283
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:07,467
Did my client take you from the front or the back?

284
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:09,133
- Both.  - How many times?

285
00:19:09,334 --> 00:19:11,000
- Three.  - It must have been painful.

286
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,934
And yet you chose revelry over medical aid.

287
00:19:13,968 --> 00:19:17,767
Outrageous! This boy's not the one who should suffer humiliation.

288
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:20,701
- What of my client's suffering?  - I will decide.

289
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,534
Do you want to join your son in the Bargello?

290
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:33,033
Because that's the way you're heading with this line of questioning.

291
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:36,200
The defense must be allowed to pursue all aspects of the case.

292
00:19:36,434 --> 00:19:39,234
- Your son is guilty.  - The case is not complete.

293
00:19:39,434 --> 00:19:41,901
This trial is a performance, you oaf.

294
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,434
Like the bread and circuses of your Medici sponsor.

295
00:19:44,634 --> 00:19:48,367
Now, play your part and perhaps you will be spared.

296
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:58,267
I apologize

297
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:03,067
for dredging up what must be uncomfortable memories.

298
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:05,601
You were only performing your job, Signor.

299
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,133
And what of your job, hm?

300
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:14,467
How do you survive beyond the gold florins

301
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:16,167
my client allegedly gave you?

302
00:20:16,434 --> 00:20:18,601
Surely not on the occasional modeling assignment.

303
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:20,634
- Signor Da Vinci.  - Perhaps your silence

304
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:25,234
is because you would prefer not to admit to your true profession of prostitution.

305
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:29,801
- Objection!  - How much are you being paid for your performance today?!

306
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,534
- Enough!  - Ha-ha!

307
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:33,400
The court is adjourned...

308
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:37,968
so I may consider suitable punishment for defense council.

309
00:20:56,434 --> 00:20:57,968
You're quite good at this.

310
00:21:00,934 --> 00:21:04,701
I didn't do that for you.

311
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:08,400
You disgust me.

312
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:12,501
Through the lies, some part of that boy's story is true.

313
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:19,200
I warned you, Leonardo, about overreaching.

314
00:21:20,534 --> 00:21:23,267
You have thought life a game,

315
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:27,067
but Rome's lapdogs have already decided your fate.

316
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,834
And when they have swayed the crowd,

317
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:30,834
they'll leave you to rot in your cell

318
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,200
until your already-diminished senses are all but eaten away.

319
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,300
That hustler hurt us.

320
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:57,334
If the people believe he's amoral,

321
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:00,501
I can't pass a guilty verdict without appearing corrupt myself.

322
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:03,300
You'll do as instructed.

323
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:05,300
I'm an elected official.

324
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:08,834
I'll do as someone pays me to do.

325
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:10,834
Don't fret.

326
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:16,200
Count Riario's coin will fund even your grandson's campaign for this office.

327
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:18,567
Perhaps this setback's a blessing.

328
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:20,534
The longer we draw out these proceedings,

329
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:23,234
the more we embarrass Lorenzo in the public eye.

330
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,334
And the longer Da Vinci rots in his cell,

331
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:28,334
the more his mind frays and the guiltier he looks.

332
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:30,434
Captain.

333
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:32,400
Signor?

334
00:22:32,534 --> 00:22:36,667
Gather your men.

335
00:22:36,968 --> 00:22:39,067
This isn't a shopping list. It's just nonsense.

336
00:22:39,334 --> 00:22:41,367
Don't waste your time. He wrote it in cipher.

337
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:43,167
A list of items, precise instructions

338
00:22:43,434 --> 00:22:47,934
with an absence of an apology for snubbing me at the Medici celebration.

339
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,467
Magnesium. What does Maestro Da Vinci want with this?

340
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:53,667
Fucked if I know. But don't speak his name unless you'd like to join him.

341
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,234
Of all things, why sodomy?

342
00:22:58,467 --> 00:23:00,467
I mean, no-one gets tried for that.

343
00:23:00,634 --> 00:23:02,300
Yeah, not in Florence.

344
00:23:02,601 --> 00:23:06,467
Go 100 miles in any direction and suddenly Rome owns your prick.

345
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:19,167
You have no right to be here!

346
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:21,834
There must be something here! Keep searching!

347
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,200
- What are you doing?  - Look over there.

348
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:29,467
- Look for what?  - Evidence... of who Da Vinci truly is.

349
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:32,934
Sir. Found a hidden compartment with more journals.

350
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,000
Captain, look at this.

351
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:36,801
This is what Pazzi wants.

352
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:44,934
Further investigation into Leonardo Da Vinci

353
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:49,734
has uncovered more products of an unnatural mind.

354
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:51,167
The drawings here before you

355
00:23:51,434 --> 00:23:53,200
were found in Da Vinci's studio.

356
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:56,767
Notice the extent to which the deviant has detailed the male...

357
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:58,968
anatomy.

358
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,868
Was man not created in God's image?

359
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,400
Genesis, artista? I'm shocked you got that far.

360
00:24:04,634 --> 00:24:09,400
Studying the human form is an expression, if not an adoration, of the divine.

361
00:24:09,534 --> 00:24:11,367
Mm. Mm.

362
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:14,400
But then, what of this notebook?

363
00:24:14,634 --> 00:24:17,734
Found in a secret compartment, no less.

364
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:21,734
Raiding the Maestro's workshop. That's the obscenity here.

365
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:24,434
Please excuse the condition of the evidence, for...

366
00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:28,467
clearly the accused tried to prevent his heathen beliefs from being presented here

367
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:32,133
by burning it.

368
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,033
An animal head on human form.

369
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:38,434
A pagan god.

370
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:40,667
And not just one...

371
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:42,067
Dozens.

372
00:24:42,234 --> 00:24:44,567
The adoration of a heretic.

373
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:49,801
This is not worship but an artistic endeavor.

374
00:24:49,934 --> 00:24:51,434
Really?

375
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:55,167
Are you then suggesting that this false god is a commission

376
00:24:55,434 --> 00:24:58,667
for your son's most recent patron?

377
00:24:58,968 --> 00:25:03,100
I submit that not only does this deviant practice sodomy, but sorcery.

378
00:25:05,234 --> 00:25:08,334
Thus I ask the court to consider no other sentence but death.

379
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:29,634
- You've gone too far.  - This doesn't concern you.

380
00:25:29,934 --> 00:25:34,067
Count Riario made it very clear that he has plans for Da Vinci.

381
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,334
He wanted to see him arrested, not dead.

382
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:40,033
Well, that's in the hands of the court.

383
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,033
What might the court say about your own family's erotic proclivities?

384
00:25:44,234 --> 00:25:46,300
The rumors of your own wife, Allegra,

385
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:50,167
dallying with a strikingly mannish maidservant.

386
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:52,934
Shame my family at your peril, harlot.

387
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,734
Mm. I welcome the invitation.

388
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,567
You seem oddly bothered about the fate of a man you denounced to the court.

389
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:02,367
If you have any respect for the powers that command me,

390
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:05,868
you will never again mention forcing me to write the denunciation.

391
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:08,234
You are reckless, Signor.

392
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:11,501
You have let your hatred for the Medicis cloud your purpose.

393
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:15,200
And your fear clouds yours.

394
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:17,400
I assure you, Signora,

395
00:26:17,634 --> 00:26:21,400
when Lorenzo and Da Vinci are gone,

396
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:24,634
there'll be plenty of cocks willing to fill your void.

397
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:42,267
Perhaps a bit more detail here.

398
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:46,267
- How does this look, Excellency?  - Lovely. Very lovely.

399
00:26:46,434 --> 00:26:48,200
Giuliano!

400
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:52,567
Are you out of your fucking mind?

401
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:54,934
The Decameron?

402
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:58,701
I would have words with my brother. Away.

403
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:01,767
Away!

404
00:27:01,934 --> 00:27:02,868
Go, go, go.

405
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:05,934
I asked you to help restore our reputation.

406
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:08,667
- You asked me to charm them.  - They are devoted Catholics.

407
00:27:08,901 --> 00:27:11,367
How do you think they will respond to a play,

408
00:27:11,634 --> 00:27:14,968
that's wall to wall nun-sluts and horny priests?

409
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:17,434
- It's bawdy! It's vulgar!  - It's Florence.

410
00:27:17,634 --> 00:27:19,501
Of course it's vulgar! That's why people love it.

411
00:27:19,701 --> 00:27:22,601
You will cut every scene that is at all scandalous.

412
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:25,968
If we fail to secure Ferdinand and Isabella's accounts,

413
00:27:26,133 --> 00:27:29,167
the Medici Bank is finished.

414
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:32,133
Time again you prove to be nothing more than dead weight.

415
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,734
Well, perhaps you should mark me a traitor and have me killed as well.

416
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:49,667
This is one thing you were never better at.

417
00:27:54,267 --> 00:27:56,167
Sodomy.

418
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,133
Sorcery.

419
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,033
Offerings to a pagan god.

420
00:28:01,267 --> 00:28:04,467
What crimes could be worse than these?

421
00:28:04,701 --> 00:28:06,901
Thus, by the order of this court,

422
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:11,434
the accused... if convicted of the charge of sorcery...

423
00:28:11,601 --> 00:28:13,267
shall be burned at the stake...

424
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:20,467
so that his eternal soul is separated from his perverted body.

425
00:28:20,734 --> 00:28:25,634
We grant the accused one day to confess and plead mitigation...

426
00:28:25,868 --> 00:28:28,400
before we deliberate any further.

427
00:28:33,634 --> 00:28:36,467
You must accept a plea, Leonardo.

428
00:28:36,767 --> 00:28:38,400
If you confess, there's a chance!

429
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,767
- To protect Lorenzo?  - To save yourself!

430
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:42,868
If you won't let me help you, you will die.

431
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,934
That's a clean end to your disgrace, then.

432
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:49,934
Oh, Christ! You are just as exasperating as she was!

433
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:55,300
Is she dead?

434
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:59,100
It makes no difference. She's gone.

435
00:28:59,267 --> 00:29:02,834
I remind you of her.

436
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:06,000
That's why you can't stand to look at me.

437
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:08,200
Because she left you.

438
00:29:08,367 --> 00:29:10,934
Your mother was a commoner.

439
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,868
She was a servant girl.

440
00:29:13,133 --> 00:29:16,501
People like her don't leave people like me.

441
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:22,701
They don't.

442
00:29:22,734 --> 00:29:25,167
It wouldn't make sense.

443
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:33,067
Genius was wasted on you.

444
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:07,267
Do you want something?

445
00:30:07,434 --> 00:30:09,000
Mm.

446
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:12,200
Da Vinci faces imprisonment,

447
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:14,267
perhaps death,

448
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:17,601
and you have the power to intercede with the magistrate.

449
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:24,234
Not without certain sacrifices...

450
00:30:24,467 --> 00:30:27,367
given the prudery of my current guests.

451
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:34,934
His portrait of me is remarkable.

452
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:38,300
But it won't remind me of you nearly so well if it's never finished.

453
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:43,000
Botticelli or Ghirlandaio can take over.

454
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:46,467
Is that why you want the artista freed?

455
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:50,334
- To immortalize you?  - No.

456
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:52,801
To protect us.

457
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:56,000
Da Vinci's gift for inventions saved our lives, Lorenzo.

458
00:30:56,167 --> 00:31:00,200
Well, he can invent his way out of his dilemma.

459
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,534
Good night,

460
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:06,234
my dear.

461
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:20,501
Um... does this periscope thing do what it's supposed to do?

462
00:31:20,801 --> 00:31:24,701
I followed the specifications but your guess is as good as mine.

463
00:31:24,934 --> 00:31:26,634
What about the other items on his list?

464
00:31:26,901 --> 00:31:29,934
Um, this paste will hold a man for a good while before dissolving.

465
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:33,467
I tested this potion out on Nico. Knocked him out for nearly 15 minutes.

466
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:37,467
You might have told me first. I could have split my head open when I collapsed.

467
00:31:37,701 --> 00:31:40,534
Can anyone tell me... who are we gluing to what and why?

468
00:31:40,767 --> 00:31:43,801
Look, our friend might have lost his wits in prison.

469
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,133
It happens.

470
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:47,334
A prison, a potion, a periscope,

471
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:48,934
a pig and a paste pot.

472
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,734
If a madman created a scavenger hunt, this is what it would look like.

473
00:32:06,334 --> 00:32:10,767
You thought you could outsmart us all, artista.

474
00:32:10,968 --> 00:32:14,167
But God's wiser than you.

475
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:16,234
And he's on our side.

476
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,868
- What happens now?  - We wait.

477
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,968
- For what?  - I don't know.

478
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:47,400
He said it would be obvious.

479
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,567
- What's going on?  - What is that?

480
00:32:56,767 --> 00:33:00,834
I guess that's pretty clear.

481
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,701
Da Vinci!

482
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:15,467
Stop the explosions.

483
00:33:18,734 --> 00:33:20,334
What?

484
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:24,400
You think I've organized a bombardment from my cell?

485
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:26,734
I never cease to amaze myself.

486
00:33:44,334 --> 00:33:45,734
Where are they coming from?

487
00:33:45,934 --> 00:33:47,534
You took your time coming to visit.

488
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:50,400
You want my company now, with your little prick on the line!

489
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:54,367
- We have minutes, Zo.  - Is it true what they say? This place sours your brain?

490
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:57,701
- Do you want to help me or not?  - There's a way out through the kitchens.

491
00:33:57,968 --> 00:34:00,067
We're not going together. You're staying.

492
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:03,000
- Fuck, no.  - Look...

493
00:34:03,234 --> 00:34:04,701
They can't know I've escaped.

494
00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:07,033
They need to think I'm still here.

495
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:10,067
Wear that. It's rat's hair.

496
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,234
Cloak myself in bat shit and pretend I'm you?

497
00:34:12,434 --> 00:34:16,033
I swear to God I'm not mad.

498
00:34:16,234 --> 00:34:18,133
I'm desperate.

499
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,167
Enraged. In need of a good meal.

500
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:23,334
But I am not mad.

501
00:34:26,634 --> 00:34:28,567
You ask a great deal of your friends.

502
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:33,100
I know.

503
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:34,667
Sodomite.

504
00:34:41,834 --> 00:34:44,000
Everybody's still locked in, sir!

505
00:34:55,534 --> 00:34:58,901
Whatever your friends planned, it failed.

506
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:05,467
Fuck you, Leo.

507
00:35:09,601 --> 00:35:12,167
Phosphorus bat shit bombs.

508
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:16,901
Maybe I am losing my mind.

509
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:19,767
So the grand plan is we all burn at the stake?

510
00:35:20,033 --> 00:35:21,767
It's a straightforward operation.

511
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,834
It's the product of solitude and delirium! It's totally mad!

512
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,434
Doesn't certain art require a touch of madness?

513
00:35:28,701 --> 00:35:32,000
I suppose you are aware that this device can only function in the daylight?

514
00:35:32,267 --> 00:35:34,734
- I've prepared for that.  - Of course you have.

515
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:38,067
Have you given any thought to what will happen if it doesn't work?

516
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:42,067
- None whatsoever.  - I'm both terrified and reassured.

517
00:35:42,234 --> 00:35:46,567
I will be no-one's pawn.

518
00:35:46,767 --> 00:35:49,334
They put me on display to be ridiculed,

519
00:35:49,534 --> 00:35:52,901
as a tool to sodomize Lorenzo.

520
00:35:53,033 --> 00:35:54,834
They took away my liberty.

521
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:59,767
And now they will taste the same bile that I have!

522
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:02,534
Besides...

523
00:36:02,767 --> 00:36:08,267
what other plan gains me what I crave? Hm?

524
00:36:08,434 --> 00:36:11,400
Which is what, Leo?

525
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:15,133
The magistrate's arse.

526
00:36:15,434 --> 00:36:18,200
Before we head in to the performance, have I shown you this?

527
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:20,701
A bench?

528
00:36:20,868 --> 00:36:22,067
We have benches in Aragon.

529
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,367
Yes, yes, but please notice...

530
00:36:25,567 --> 00:36:29,834
notice the markings along its edge.

531
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:34,033
Once a week, I open my study to anyone who wishes to approach me

532
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,968
and petitioners mark on the bench to indicate their place in line.

533
00:36:39,234 --> 00:36:41,901
Doesn't that open you to rabble?

534
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:44,100
On occasion, yes.

535
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:47,133
But it also keeps Florence thriving.

536
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:50,367
As the old saying has it, "Pecunia non olet."

537
00:36:50,534 --> 00:36:54,367
Money has no smell.

538
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:57,567
We Medicis have no historic name like the Pazzis.

539
00:36:57,734 --> 00:37:01,434
We must rely on our wits.

540
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:05,300
We innovate. We create the financial instruments,

541
00:37:05,534 --> 00:37:08,033
on which the entire continent now relies.

542
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,300
The motto of the house of Medici?

543
00:37:10,467 --> 00:37:15,367
"In God... and profit."

544
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:19,767
And that profit emerges from vision.

545
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:25,167
See, names and lineages and titles...

546
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:28,033
they fade, but currency...

547
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:32,200
currency stays current.

548
00:37:32,434 --> 00:37:35,400
And that, more than any other bank in the land,

549
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:39,834
is the expertise of the house of Medici.

550
00:37:43,868 --> 00:37:49,200
This florin, with our seal on the front...

551
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,334
What other currency is named after a city?

552
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:55,467
Only Florence is so identified with financial success,

553
00:37:55,634 --> 00:37:58,200
to lay claim to that honor.

554
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:02,434
There is a new world here...

555
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:04,300
in Florence.

556
00:38:09,834 --> 00:38:14,334
I await your decision.

557
00:38:14,634 --> 00:38:19,033
I wonder if his actors tonight will speechify quite like he does.

558
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:22,334
Players, attend.

559
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:26,868
We will be performing the Decameron this evening, but not all the parts.

560
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,400
I've been counseled to remove all but the most pious pieces,

561
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:32,601
for the deference of our regal guests.

562
00:38:32,868 --> 00:38:37,234
But... Florence is not their home. It's ours.

563
00:38:37,467 --> 00:38:40,234
And they will either love it or leave.

564
00:38:40,534 --> 00:38:45,000
Prepare our production so that only the bawdy and vulgar stories remain.

565
00:38:46,067 --> 00:38:48,100
Excellency, what of your brother?

566
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:50,567
He'll laugh his arse off with the rest of them.

567
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:53,067
- And this pig, Signor?  - Stays in.

568
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:56,901
For what's our city without a pig or two?

569
00:39:23,701 --> 00:39:27,067
How did it go today?

570
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:31,434
They have the tacit trait of all good leaders.

571
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:34,601
Their faces belie nothing.

572
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:44,534
I cannot believe we are to be subjected to such decadence.

573
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:48,133
Dying regimes flail dramatically in their death throes.

574
00:39:48,434 --> 00:39:53,467
And trust me when I predict the days of the Medici regime are numbered.

575
00:39:56,133 --> 00:39:58,267
Buona sera.

576
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,067
Buona sera.

577
00:40:01,267 --> 00:40:04,968
Tonight we give you a gift of Florence.

578
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:07,300
Boccaccio's the Decameron.

579
00:40:07,601 --> 00:40:11,534
As a favor to you, I've chosen not to present all the pieces.

580
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,634
100 stories takes a long time,

581
00:40:15,901 --> 00:40:17,767
and I didn't want the poor souls in the front

582
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,968
to be smoked out by the stench of Maurizio the shepherd.

583
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:27,667
Now, this evening, you will witness the true spirit of Florence.

584
00:40:27,834 --> 00:40:29,667
Her faith and virtues,

585
00:40:29,868 --> 00:40:33,267
right along with her freedom and vulgarities.

586
00:40:33,434 --> 00:40:36,067
Enjoy... the Decameron.

587
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:45,534
Alas, I've used my last coin on ribbons for my hair.

588
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,868
The aunt who wanted bread will surely be angry with me.

589
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:53,133
Whatever am I to do?

590
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,400
Alas...

591
00:40:55,634 --> 00:40:59,567
I have wandered this road for many a day and night.

592
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:03,868
What I would not give to touch a woman's flesh.

593
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,167
Ooh!

594
00:41:05,434 --> 00:41:09,133
Why, I'd give my legs underneath me.

595
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:11,734
Ah.

596
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,167
Only when Saint Arrigo's hand does touch her bones to mine,

597
00:41:16,334 --> 00:41:19,467
will I be healed in time.

598
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:23,400
Perhaps I could try to lift with all my might.

599
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:26,300
And if you could, I'd surely hold on tight.

600
00:41:26,467 --> 00:41:29,567
Ooh. Argh!

601
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:45,501
What's this...?

602
00:41:49,601 --> 00:41:54,133
A romantic assignation requires the appropriate light.

603
00:41:55,968 --> 00:42:01,868
Now, you asked me what crime could possibly be worse than sodomy or sorcery.

604
00:42:02,067 --> 00:42:03,968
Well, I never turn down a challenge.

605
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,534
Be still. Be still.

606
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:09,901
Or my friend here may get aroused by your movements.

607
00:42:11,901 --> 00:42:14,234
The fixative will last a good while,

608
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,767
so listen closely.

609
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,167
Your reputation depends on it.

610
00:42:22,467 --> 00:42:25,901
At the far end of this arrangement of prisms and lenses,

611
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:27,534
lies a camera obscura.

612
00:42:27,868 --> 00:42:31,667
It's usually employed to delight crowds with projections of nature.

613
00:42:31,901 --> 00:42:36,634
But unnatural projections work just as well.

614
00:42:36,868 --> 00:42:39,567
- You're insane.  - Yes.

615
00:42:39,701 --> 00:42:42,434
Now reap the whirlwind.

616
00:43:10,367 --> 00:43:12,601
God grants all wishes...

617
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:25,734
They cannot see your face.

618
00:43:25,901 --> 00:43:27,501
Yet.

619
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:37,534
All I need to do is rotate you a few degrees, open the prism again,

620
00:43:37,767 --> 00:43:41,667
and your notoriety will be assured for centuries.

621
00:43:41,968 --> 00:43:45,734
- What do you want?  - Your mark on four documents.

622
00:43:45,968 --> 00:43:49,400
One, an irrevocable dismissal of the charges against me,

623
00:43:49,634 --> 00:43:51,667
and indemnity against future prosecution.

624
00:43:51,701 --> 00:43:57,000
Two, a full confession to your crime of bestiality in the palace of justice,

625
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:59,634
to be held in safekeeping in the event of my death.

626
00:43:59,934 --> 00:44:03,868
Three, a donation of 50 florins to Piero da Vinci,

627
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,033
for tolerating your so-called courtroom.

628
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:11,868
Four, the release to me of the secret denunciation which accused me.

629
00:44:12,133 --> 00:44:15,968
You will make your mark on all four documents before this flare dies,

630
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,534
or I will open the prism again and expose your vice for all to see.

631
00:44:19,834 --> 00:44:23,334
I'll tell them what you've done!

632
00:44:23,367 --> 00:44:27,067
Your preferred explanation is that this entire scene,

633
00:44:27,267 --> 00:44:29,567
was engineered in your inner sanctum,

634
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:33,033
by a man that all Florence knows is in solitary confinement?

635
00:44:33,267 --> 00:44:35,100
The people will never believe it of me.

636
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,501
The more scandalous the accusation, the greater their appetite for it.

637
00:44:39,734 --> 00:44:41,701
The gallery was filled at my trial,

638
00:44:41,868 --> 00:44:45,334
and I am just a mad artist!

639
00:44:45,634 --> 00:44:49,200
It'll be standing room only for a magistrate's trial.

640
00:44:49,434 --> 00:44:51,634
And should you renege on our agreement,

641
00:44:51,868 --> 00:44:56,067
then this shroud... treated with silver nitrate,

642
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,133
using the methods of Albertus Magnus,

643
00:44:58,367 --> 00:45:01,434
bears a lasting record of your infamy,

644
00:45:01,634 --> 00:45:04,601
which I would be happy to display in the future.

645
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:07,300
And even if you could convince people,

646
00:45:07,501 --> 00:45:11,968
somehow that this isn't you,

647
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,100
you will spend the rest of your life,

648
00:45:14,267 --> 00:45:16,767
answering the undying rumors.

649
00:45:17,033 --> 00:45:19,400
Cos people believe what's before their eyes.

650
00:45:19,701 --> 00:45:23,701
And if I can get this image seen in the skies above Florence,

651
00:45:23,868 --> 00:45:27,100
I can get it seen everywhere.

652
00:45:27,334 --> 00:45:31,234
This is how history will remember you.

653
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,701
Fucking a pig,

654
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:37,167
in the middle of your courtroom.

655
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:40,267
Lies, truth...

656
00:45:40,434 --> 00:45:42,434
It's irrelevant.

657
00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:46,300
The best story wins.

658
00:45:48,534 --> 00:45:51,601
Oh, what confusion comes with light.

659
00:45:51,834 --> 00:45:54,801
Bring me the darkness of the night.

660
00:45:54,968 --> 00:45:58,200
So much unseen, so much to know.

661
00:45:58,434 --> 00:46:03,200
In the dark, the best surprise does show.

662
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:10,434
A hysterical spectacle, Your Excellency.

663
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:13,067
The image in the sky. I've never seen anything like it.

664
00:46:13,234 --> 00:46:16,434
Theatre is... magic.

665
00:46:16,667 --> 00:46:19,167
That it is!

666
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,534
Well done, everyone. Well done!

667
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,400
The defendant stands accused of...

668
00:46:45,567 --> 00:46:49,234
deviancy and heresy.

669
00:46:49,467 --> 00:46:52,901
After due consideration, it is the ruling of this court,

670
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,534
that the prosecution was unable to prove these crimes true.

671
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:00,701
I hereby dismiss all charges against Leonardo da Vinci.

672
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,801
- Well, I'm a genius.  - You still smell like bat shit.

673
00:47:26,701 --> 00:47:29,167
Ah, bravo!

674
00:47:29,334 --> 00:47:30,868
Bravo, Leo.

675
00:47:31,167 --> 00:47:35,200
That's the man you should be congratulating.

676
00:47:35,434 --> 00:47:37,334
I don't know how you did that,

677
00:47:37,567 --> 00:47:39,200
but enjoy your freedom while you may.

678
00:47:39,501 --> 00:47:42,000
For what Rome cannot accomplish through the courts,

679
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:44,334
it will by other means.

680
00:47:44,467 --> 00:47:45,968
Stay out of trouble.

681
00:47:46,133 --> 00:47:47,534
Father...

682
00:47:51,267 --> 00:47:53,100
I will.

683
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,100
Your path has never been easy.

684
00:48:04,067 --> 00:48:07,400
In my land, power derives from birthright.

685
00:48:12,767 --> 00:48:14,968
I had to marry my pug-faced cousin,

686
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,901
to keep power in the family.

687
00:48:19,067 --> 00:48:20,701
But you and your brother,

688
00:48:20,834 --> 00:48:22,834
with no royal blood at all,

689
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,868
rally an entire city.

690
00:48:26,033 --> 00:48:29,567
Not out of fear, but joy.

691
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:37,133
You even know some of them by name.

692
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,667
And they love you for it.

693
00:48:40,868 --> 00:48:45,400
You've left your mark on me.

694
00:48:45,634 --> 00:48:49,534
And I leave my mark in Florence.

695
00:48:54,634 --> 00:48:57,234
We agree to your terms.

696
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:02,367
The Medicis will be the bankers of a new Spain.

697
00:49:08,701 --> 00:49:12,634
To Florence, where you can bugger whoever, wherever, and get away with it.

698
00:49:12,868 --> 00:49:15,400
To the friends who make it possible.

699
00:49:15,667 --> 00:49:17,667
Seriously, I'm lucky to have you.

700
00:49:17,901 --> 00:49:21,968
Remember that when you're washing the bat shit from my arse crack.

701
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:43,667
If I'd produced this at the trial, no amount of sophistry would have saved you.

702
00:49:43,868 --> 00:49:47,334
But I wanted to see you exposed, not killed.

703
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:51,868
Why?

704
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,934
What you have with women isn't love.

705
00:49:56,133 --> 00:49:57,567
You're with them out of fear.

706
00:49:57,734 --> 00:50:01,734
I'm curious by nature.

707
00:50:01,934 --> 00:50:06,567
Desire... It's not as simple as one sex or the other.

708
00:50:10,334 --> 00:50:13,601
I'm sorry I hurt you.

709
00:50:13,868 --> 00:50:17,467
My experiments and curiosities, they're...

710
00:50:17,801 --> 00:50:20,601
They're not always without cost and I should mind that better.

711
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:25,367
But trust me... trust me...

712
00:50:25,534 --> 00:50:28,200
no-one defines me.

713
00:50:32,267 --> 00:50:34,901
Not Florence's outdated laws,

714
00:50:34,934 --> 00:50:36,300
and certainly...

715
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:40,167
certainly... not you.

716
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:50,267
Your infatuation will fade and you will find others to love.

717
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,400
I have no doubt.

718
00:51:13,767 --> 00:51:17,033
Every kiss sends a message.

719
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:21,667
That one... was goodbye.

720
00:51:21,801 --> 00:51:23,133
Goodbye?

721
00:51:47,667 --> 00:51:52,634
Do you know, I've never heard that tune from anyone except you.

722
00:51:52,834 --> 00:51:56,968
My father used to hum it to me when I was a child.

723
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:00,033
Done.

724
00:52:00,234 --> 00:52:02,000
Where is he now?

725
00:52:05,868 --> 00:52:09,234
I cannot say.

726
00:52:09,467 --> 00:52:12,434
Losing a parent breaks hearts.

727
00:52:12,634 --> 00:52:15,234
My father's always been...

728
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,267
lost to me.

729
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,767
And your mother?

730
00:52:20,801 --> 00:52:25,901
In a land with no name, across the seas.

731
00:52:26,167 --> 00:52:29,834
If the clues I've gathered on my quest are true.

732
00:52:30,067 --> 00:52:34,033
Escaping that denunciation, perhaps I can find her again.

733
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,167
How did you come by this?

734
00:52:39,634 --> 00:52:43,133
These denunciations are usually so well guarded.

735
00:52:43,367 --> 00:52:47,567
Mm. Well, I have a penchant for acquiring things...

736
00:52:48,567 --> 00:52:50,567
that are well guarded.

737
00:52:56,634 --> 00:52:59,200
And what do you plan on doing with it?

738
00:53:01,334 --> 00:53:03,300
Hm?

739
00:53:03,334 --> 00:53:08,901
I plan on using it to find and confront my accuser.

740
00:53:09,067 --> 00:53:10,434
Obviously.

741
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:16,234
Cos whoever wrote those words almost took my freedom and my life.

742
00:53:16,467 --> 00:53:20,334
And what if your accuser didn't intend for it to go that far?

743
00:53:20,567 --> 00:53:23,167
What other outcome could they have intended?

744
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,701
- It was a sodomy charge.  - I know.

745
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:27,767
I only got out with nerve and wit.

746
00:53:32,901 --> 00:53:34,901
Hm.

747
00:53:38,801 --> 00:53:41,434
That belonged to someone very dear to me.

748
00:53:41,601 --> 00:53:44,467
Hm?

749
00:53:44,601 --> 00:53:47,267
Here.

750
00:53:47,467 --> 00:53:52,133
Carry it with you. Keep it safe in case anything happens.

751
00:53:52,367 --> 00:53:54,234
Why would anything happen to you?

752
00:53:54,367 --> 00:53:56,434
Because these are uncertain times.

753
00:53:56,667 --> 00:54:01,167
And shall I flaunt it near Lorenzo?

754
00:54:01,334 --> 00:54:04,467
That would alleviate any uncertainty.

755
00:54:04,634 --> 00:54:06,901
You'd be wise not to.

756
00:54:15,267 --> 00:54:18,567
Have you ever been in love... Signora?

757
00:54:19,567 --> 00:54:21,567
Um...

758
00:54:25,901 --> 00:54:28,734
In my pursuits, love is a liability.

759
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:31,734
Mine, too.

760
00:54:33,434 --> 00:54:35,534
Maybe that's what we share.

761
00:54:35,701 --> 00:54:37,234
What?

762
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,000
Both of us bound to a life without love.

763
00:55:19,934 --> 00:55:22,834
You seem surprised.

764
00:55:23,133 --> 00:55:27,267
I told you I would return once you had sipped from the fountain of memory.

765
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,200
But I haven't.

766
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:39,567
Are you sure?

767
00:55:39,734 --> 00:55:44,234
You did not experience something while imprisoned?

768
00:55:54,033 --> 00:55:55,834
That was a dream.

769
00:55:55,968 --> 00:55:57,834
It was nothing more.

770
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,834
Surely you, who remembers all,

771
00:56:00,968 --> 00:56:03,400
know it was no dream.

772
00:56:03,567 --> 00:56:07,033
It was nothing.

773
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,267
It was just...

774
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,801
Just flashes. Incoher...

775
00:56:13,534 --> 00:56:17,033
Close your eyes and see again.

776
00:56:19,701 --> 00:56:22,300
Return to the cave, Leonardo.

777
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,767
There were bodies. I saw bodies.

778
00:56:31,801 --> 00:56:33,834
I s... I saw a man...

779
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,701
hanging upside down.

780
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:42,701
I... 

781
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,567
I thought... I thought he was dead, like the rest.

782
00:56:50,467 --> 00:56:52,000
But he was alive.

783
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,300
- Who was it, Leonardo?  - I...

784
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,868
Free me.

785
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:03,167
Free me!

786
00:57:08,567 --> 00:57:10,834
- It doesn't make sense.  - What did you see?

787
00:57:11,834 --> 00:57:13,267
Free me.

788
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,834
It was me.

789
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000


790
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:31,000

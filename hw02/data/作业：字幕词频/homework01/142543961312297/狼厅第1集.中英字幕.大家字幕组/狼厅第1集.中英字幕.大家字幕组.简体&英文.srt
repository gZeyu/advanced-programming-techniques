00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:12,080
公元1529年 由于英王亨利八世及其妻子- 
西班牙公主阿拉贡的凯瑟琳王后 结婚20年
 仍无男性子嗣继承王位 故英王在2年前 
  已向教皇提出了离婚请求 至今未果

6
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,000
【 因根据当时的天主教教规 夫妻结合是上帝的旨意 离婚、丧偶再嫁娶 需要教皇的批准 】

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,090
红衣主教、大法官、也是亨利八世的忠实拥护者 托马斯・沃尔西在这场离婚风波中彻底失了势

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,000
然而亨利八世也不是一个宽厚仁爱的君主

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,100
《狼厅》第1季 第1集

10
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,880
沃尔西 给我滚出来
Wolsey, you're out!

11
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,960
诺尔福克勋爵 萨尔福克勋爵
My Lords Norfolk and Suffolk.

12
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,640
红衣大主教 沃尔西阁下
Cardinal Wolsey.

13
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,120
你已经从大法官的职位上被解职了
You're dismissed as Lord Chancellor,

14
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,840
这是国王陛下的直接命令
by the King's orders.

15
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,160
请立即归还大法官的印玺
You're to return to us the Great Seal.

16
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,120
你是说你们在举行晚宴？
You'll have supper?

17
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,800
你就是迷恋这掌控一切的感觉 对吗
You wanted all to rule yourself, didn't you?

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,160
然后把所有的勋爵们像小学生一样的管教 在这里苦苦挣扎是吗
and had the lords like schoolboys, creeping in here.

19
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,280
现在 我就在这
Well, I am here now...

20
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,740
而且 我要生吞了你
..and I will chew you up.

21
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,360
把你生吞活剥 骨肉分离
Bones, flesh and gristle.

22
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,640
现在立刻交出大法官的印玺！
You're to hand over the Great Seal.

23
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,520
呵
Ah!

24
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,800
很显然 如果你能给我一张国王陛下亲手写的辞呈也是极好的
Apparently, a written request from the King is necessary.

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,640
你们随身带着了吗？
Do you have one?

26
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,160
没有吗？
No?

27
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,800
噢 那可真是粗心呢
Oh, that's careless.

28
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,680
这位是我的律师 托马斯・克伦威尔
My lawyer, Thomas Cromwell.

29
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,160
你想让我们就为了一张纸就再骑马从这里往返温莎一次？
You want us to ride back to Windsor for a piece of paper?

30
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,600
在这种恶劣的天气下？
In this weather?

31
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,000
是呀是呀
I see, yes.

32
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,640
事实上 我的律师告诉我 我不能交出我的印玺
Actually, my lawyer tells me I can't give you the Seal,

33
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,080
无论你们有没有国王的辞呈
written request or no.

34
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,240
确切的说 他告诉我的是
He tells me that, properly speaking,

35
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,240
我的印玺只能交还给主记事官阁下
I should hand it only to the Master of the Rolls.

36
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,320
所以说呢...
So...

37
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,400
你们回程的时候最好带着他一起来这里
you'd better come back with him.

38
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,400
很荣幸见到你 大法官阁下
I'm obliged, master.

39
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,600
你说的那些是事实 还是自己胡编的？
Did you know that, or did you make it up?

40
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,520
估计他们一天内就会反应过来了
They'll be back in a day.

41
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,680
唉 现在这动乱的日子
Well, these days,

42
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,480
能争取24个小时已经是天大的胜利了一样
24 hours feels like a victory.

43
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,560
有没有给我们的客人招待茶点呢？
Do we have refreshments for our guests?

44
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,960
用什么招待？连盘子都被没收了
Served on what? They've taken the plate.

45
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,180
你穿的这是什么？
What's this?

46
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,200
我借来的
It's borrowed.

47
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,560
他们查抄了我的整个衣橱
They've confiscated my wardrobe

48
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,920
你也知道的 我很怕冷
and you know how I feel the cold.

49
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,120
谢谢你了 彼得
Thank you, Peter.

50
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,800
我想这座大房子会被赏给安妮・博林吧
This is to be Anne Boleyn's, I think.

51
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,980
国王陛下想让她在伦敦有个住所
The King wants her to have a London residence.

52
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,760
这座宫殿是归约克主教区所有的
This palace belongs to the Archdiocese of York.

53
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,640
那安妮夫人什么时候成为的大主教？
When did Lady Anne become an Archbishop?

54
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,280
别这样说 托马斯 我所拥有的这一切 都是国王陛下赏赐的
Now, now, Thomas. Everything I have, I have from the King.

55
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,120
如果他想要这座约克宫殿 那就完好无损的给他
If he wants to take York Place, fully furnished,

56
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,360
我们再另寻一处避身之所好了
then I'm sure we'll find some other roof to shelter under.

57
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,160
他一直都觉得我家里有一座
He's expecting to find a wax figure of himself

58
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,000
上面插着针的他的蜡像
with a pin stuck through it.

59
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,640
你跟我过来
Come and see me.

60
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,160
给我个理由 勋爵大人
Why, My Lord?

61
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,080
什么时候？
When?

62
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,200
等你再注意一点你的礼节
When you've mended your manners.

63
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,040
你们这是在干嘛 在服侍王子吗
What it is, to serve a prince.

64
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,720
基督教世界里最宽厚最睿智的王子吗
The gentlest, wisest prince in Christendom.

65
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,080
我以后将再也听不到任何人敢说出反对亨利国王的言语了
I'll not hear a word against Henry from any man.

66
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,160
你觉得这一切只是英国人才会这样做吗
Do you think it's something about the English?

67
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,520
他们见不得一个伟人的崛起 所以必须在他崛起前毁灭他？
They cannot see a great man set up, but they have to pull him down?

68
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,800
这不只是英国人如此
It's not the English.

69
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,400
人性本恶
It's just people.

70
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,880
我们将安妮夫人从法国
We brought the Lady Anne back from France,

71
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,480
带回嫁到了爱尔兰
to marry into Ireland.

72
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,240
现在我看到了她正在和年轻的亨利・珀西在假面舞会上尽情欢舞
Now I hear she danced at the court masque with young Harry Percy.

73
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,760
在漆黑的拐角处你侬我侬
Connived in dark corners with him.

74
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,000
我本不应该看见的
And I won't have that.

75
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,680
公爵大人 我真不敢想象我现在正和您在派对上...
Your grace can't think that I'm party to...

76
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,760
噢 托马斯・博林爵士
Oh, Sir Thomas Boleyn.

77
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,640
你应该很惊讶我现在的想法
You'd be amazed at what I can think.

78
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,160
安妮知道和年轻的亨利・珀西的事情不会发展顺利的
Anne knows things can't proceed with young Harry Percy.

79
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,160
但亨利相信自己有权利自由的选择自己的妻子             - 自由？
- But he believes he's free to choose his own wife.  - Free?

80
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,280
选择他的...？
Choose his own...?

81
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,360
他可不是什么随随便便的放牛娃！
He's not some ploughboy!

82
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,440
他未来某一天可是我们这北方的领主啊
He's the man who'll have to hold the north for us, some day.

83
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,800
珀西家族可是涵盖了这片大陆上最尊贵的贵族
The Percy family comprise the noblest in the land,

84
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,880
然而博林家族嘛 却有过一次...
whereas the Boleyns were once in...

85
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,520
什么来着？交易是嘛？
What? Trade, weren't you?

86
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,140
那个人是谁？
Who is that?

87
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,600
是谁？
Who's that?

88
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,120
噢 是斯蒂芬・伽纳德 我的秘书 [后来的温彻斯特主教]
Oh, it's Stephen Gardiner, my Secretary.

89
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,400
让他出去
Send him out.

90
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,880
斯蒂芬
Stephen.

91
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,320
那个人又是谁？！
And who is that?

92
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,600
你别管那么多了 他谁都不是
Never mind who that is. He's nobody.

93
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,280
现在的问题是...
The problem is...

94
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,960
...我的女儿和亨利・珀西
..my daughter and Harry Percy,

95
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,020
我觉得他们现在有点情到深处了
I think they may have gone a little far in the matter.

96
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,470
看起来他们已经私定终身了
It seems they've pledged themselves before witnesses...

97
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,920
这个嘛 你可以完全忽略所有的什么誓言证词
Well, you can forget all talk of pledges and witnesses.

98
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,680
我会马上通知他的父亲从边境赶回来
I'll get his father down from the borders

99
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,240
如果这个败家子竟敢忤逆他父亲的话
and if the prodigal defies his father,

100
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,600
他会被直接剥夺爵位继承权
he'll be tossed out of his heirdom on his prodigal snout.

101
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,840
所以说 早点把你的女儿给嫁到爱尔兰去
Now, get your daughter married into Ireland,

102
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,840
趁她还没听到什么风吹草动之前！
before her intended hears any rumours of spoilt goods.

103
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,720
说完了吗 大主教阁下？
Finished, My Lord Cardinal?

104
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,800
说完了
Finished.

105
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,460
狗娘养的！
Butcher's boy!

106
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,480
狗杂种！
Butcher's dog!

107
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,600
过来呀 狗东西
Come out, dog.

108
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,520
他在和你说话
He's talking to you.

109
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,600
所以 克伦威尔大师
So, Master Cromwell.

110
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,240
威廉・波普利告诉我 你可能会对我有点用处
William Popely tells me I might find a use for you.

111
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,640
他说 你是一个多才多艺的人
A man of many talents, he says.

112
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,800
有着惊人的记忆力?
A remarkable memory?

113
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,160
这是有技巧学成的 勋爵阁下
There's a technique, My Lord.

114
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,560
我是在意大利学会的
I learnt it in Italy.

115
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,840
你在国外呆了多长时间?
How long were you abroad?

116
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,720
12年
12 years.

117
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,760
那你来自哪里?
Where are you from?

118
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,480
帕特尼 离开的时候我还是个小男孩
Putney. Left when I was a boy.

119
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,760
那你父亲呢？
Your father?

120
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,800
是个铁匠
Blacksmith.

121
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,640
哈 终于！
Ah, at last!

122
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,960
一个比我出身更卑微的人！
A man born in a more lowly state than myself.

123
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,400
嘿...
Hey...

124
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,700
- 贝拉!      - 吃了吗?
- Bella!     - Eaten?

125
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,000
- 吃了     - 葡萄酒?
- Mm-hmm.  - Wine?

126
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,160
有何不可?
Why not?

127
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,160
我打算为他工作 那个红衣大主教
I'm going to work for him - the Cardinal.

128
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,780
你知道他们在意大利怎么说吗?
You know what they say in Italy?

129
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,600
"王子必须做出选择"
"II principe bisogna sceglierlo."

130
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,520
-"你必须选择你自己的王子"           - 做什么事?
- "You have to pick your prince."   - Doing what?

131
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,260
任何他想要的
Whatever he wants.

132
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,920
我们有的已经足够多了
We have enough.

133
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,120
我不想把我的一生浪费在买卖这些交通工具上 莉兹
I don't want to spend my life dealing in conveyances, Liz.

134
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,200
不管这个男人的围墙应该在这里或这里...
Whether this man's fence should be here or here...

135
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,680
我想你应该知道你自己在做什么
You know what you're doing, I suppose.

136
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
至少 你总是看起来好像你知道自己在做什么
At least, you always look as if you do.

137
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,160
是的 我就是这样 不是吗?
Yeah, I do, don't I?

138
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,320
你看起来比那个红衣大主教要甜美的多
You're sweeter to look at than the Cardinal.

139
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,320
这可算得上是一个女人所能收到的最差劲的恭维话了
That's the smallest compliment a woman ever received.

140
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,680
我们的儿子说了什么?
What does our son say?

141
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,240
他说...希望你一切都好 希望我一切都好
He...hopes you are well, hopes I am well,

142
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,800
希望他可爱的小妹妹们安妮和格雷丝都很好
hopes his lovely little sisters Anne and Grace are well.

143
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,720
他自己也很好
He is well.

144
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,760
‘就写到这里 没什么时间了 你孝顺的儿子 格雷戈里’
‘And now no more, for lack of time, your dutiful son, Gregory.’

145
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
字好丑的拉丁文
Terrible Latin.

146
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,280
安妮才是更出色的学者
Anne's the better scholar.

147
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,760
安妮 去吃早餐吧
Anne, go and get your breakfast.

148
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,360
学完拉丁语 我想学一学希腊语
After I've Latin, I'd like to learn Greek.

149
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,120
格雷戈里几乎都不会说一句希腊话
Gregory has hardly any Greek.

150
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,480
要是这种人当上市长了 伦敦得变成什么样子?
What will London be like when that one's Lord Mayor?

151
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,520
这是德国寄来的
From Germany.

152
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,680
它被包装成其他样子 我几乎把送信的男孩赶走
It came packaged as something else. I almost sent the boy away.

153
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,640
- 如果你想知道...          - 我不想知道
- If you want to know...   - I don't want to know.

154
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,840
..这是廷代尔翻译的《新约全书》 莉兹
..it's Tyndale's New Testament, Liz.

155
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,080
你应该自己读读它
You should read it for yourself.

156
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,920
它是英文翻译版 这才是重点
It's in English - that's the point.

157
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,440
不是拉丁文的
Not Latin.

158
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,000
基督教怎么会是误认为异教！
How can that be heresy?

159
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,800
读读它 你将发现你是如何被误导的
Read it and you'll see how you're misled.

160
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,960
没有提到修女 僧侣 文物...
No mention of nuns, monks, relics...

161
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,360
没有提到教皇
No mention of Popes.

162
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,480
我的祈祷书对我来说就很好了
My prayer book's good reading for me.

163
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,040
你的祈祷书?
Your prayer book?

164
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,120
格雷丝 看看这个
Grace, look at this.

165
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,640
理夫?
Rafe?

166
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,460
理查德?
Richard?

167
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,280
噢...
Oh...

168
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,240
- 你迟到了        - 我迟到了 还是你的自我感觉太良好了
- Late.           - Me, or your good self?

169
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,800
- 当然是你      - 他正在里面等你
- You           - he's waiting.

170
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,160
我的船夫们都喝醉了
The boatmen were drunk.

171
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,520
我真惊讶你居然自己没有带把桨
I'm surprised you didn't take an oar yourself.

172
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,840
你在河边长大的 不是吗?
You grew up at the river, didn't you?

173
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,640
上帝保佑你
God bless you.

174
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,840
谢谢你了!
Thanks!

175
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,080
噢 国王今早给我来了封信
Oh, the King sent for me this morning

176
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,720
非常非常早的时候
exceptionally early.

177
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,320
他想要做什么？
What did he want?

178
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,440
主的怜惜
Pity.

179
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,960
和一个儿子
A son.

180
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,720
国王想要一个儿子
The King wants a son.

181
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,160
18年的婚姻 却一直没有子嗣继承人
18 years of marriage, with no heir.

182
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,560
他决定有一些罪孽必须实现 来破除这个诅咒
He's decided some sin must have been committed, to cause this curse.

183
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,000
噢 上帝...
Oh, God...

184
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,640
你这是从哪学来的?
Where did you learn this?

185
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,000
在码头上 我离开家后不久
At the docks, a little after I left home.

186
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,980
有一段时间 我就靠它维持生计了
Earned a living from it, for a while.

187
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,800
所有人都觉得他们怎么也不会输给一个孩子
Everyone thought they could beat a child.

188
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,040
我还需要进一步了解
What else should I know about you,

189
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,600
一个可怕的仆人?
monstrous servant?

190
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,560
有一次在意大利 我拿一条蛇做赌注
Once, in Italy, I held a snake for a bet.

191
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,800
它有毒吗?
Was it poisonous?

192
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,280
我们不知道 这个就是赌点
We didn't know - that was the point of the bet.

193
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,840
罪过吗?
The sin?

194
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,080
噢 是的 罪过
Oh, yes, the sin.

195
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,800
我还记得当年他们把凯瑟琳皇后从西班牙带回来的时候
I remember when they brought the Queen over from Spain

196
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,720
把她嫁给了亨利的哥哥 亚瑟王子
to marry Henry's brother, Prince Arthur.

197
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,200
那年她才16岁
16...

198
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,040
真的是言语难以形容
barely a word of English.

199
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,200
上帝 当她跳舞的时候...
God, when she danced...

200
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,320
...她红色的头发滑过她的肩...
...her red hair slid over her shoulder...

201
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,040
那上帝原谅你了吗?
God forgive you?

202
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,360
主会宽恕世间所有的罪恶
God forgive us all.

203
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,320
后来 亚瑟王子去世
Then Arthur dies,

204
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,400
亨利决定与自己的寡嫂结婚
Henry decides he'll have his brother's widow for himself.

205
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,240
凯瑟琳也坚自己仍是处子之身
Katherine declares that she's still a virgin,

206
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,520
可怜的亚瑟 从未得到过她
poor Arthur never having touched her.

207
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,800
罗马方面也发出了豁免令
Rome issues the dispensation

208
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,280
与此同时 任何提出异议的人都...(灭口...)
and any doubts anyone has...

209
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,080
可是如今呢？
But now?

210
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,880
不错  如今 王后还是不能产下王储
Well, now, the Queen can't give the King a son.

211
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,200
所以 也就是说
So, now...

212
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,240
王后当年根本不可能是处子之身
..the Queen must not have been a virgin, after all.

213
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,680
亨利说这些年他都是活在不合法的婚姻关系里
Henry says that he's lived all these years in an unlawful marriage.

214
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,920
全都是罪孽
Hence the sin.

215
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,840
所以 要请求罗马教廷 正式废除这段婚姻
So it's back to Rome, for an annulment.

216
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,040
当然了 凯瑟琳会十分怨恨我
She's blaming me, of course - Katherine.

217
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,740
因为她自然是不能怨恨国王的 那就都由我承担吧
She can't blame the king, so it's all my doing.

218
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,440
不论我怎么乞求他不要这么离婚 都于事无补
No matter that I've begged him not to proceed.

219
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,440
作战击败苏格兰的时候 我听说她想把
When she defeated the Scots, I heard she wanted to send

220
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,560
苏格兰国王的人头砍下献给亨利
the Scottish King's head in a bag to Henry,

221
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,680
以此来取悦他
to cheer him up.

222
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,520
怎么 我觉得她是真正的巾帼英雄
Well, she's a fighter.

223
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,760
哈！
Ha!

224
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,600
或许你现在应该教教我怎么玩这个捉皇后的小把戏
Perhaps you should teach me your three-card trick, hmm?

225
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,280
说不准我们哪一天也会流落街头呢！
In case we both end up on the streets!

226
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,040
伙计们 快把东西都卸下来  给我点引火料 快点 干的引火料
Unpack everything. Masters, I want kindling, dry kindling.

227
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,640
史蒂芬 快生火 然后找找厨房在哪儿
Get the fires lit. Stephen, find the kitchen.

228
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,600
不 还是先照顾主教要紧 我要人给他铺床寝用具
Actually, see him in first. I need the bedding.

229
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,840
那个谁  迈克吗？ 下来  快点  等会儿再管马
What... Who is that? Michael? Down, off. The horses, later.

230
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,000
我要主教大人马上能躺在暖和的床上
We want the Cardinal in bed and warm.

231
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,480
加油 麻利点 抓紧时间
Come on, come on, we're not done yet!

232
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,080
我刚才问他们有没有肉豆蔻或是藏红花
I asked if they had nutmeg or saffron

233
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,760
他们都用疑惑的眼神看着我 好像我说的是希腊语
they looked at me as if I was speaking Greek.

234
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,680
我不得不找到当地的供货商
I'll have to find a local supplier.

235
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,960
我真该祈祷一下 希望自己能找到
I shall pray for it.

236
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,960
而与此同时 我却正在为国王及他的顾命大臣们祈祷
Currently, I pray for the King and all his counsellors.

237
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,400
为凯瑟琳王后祈祷 和安妮夫人祈祷
I pray for Queen Katherine and Lady Anne.

238
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,160
为同样深深怨恨我的托马斯・莫尔祈祷
I pray for Thomas More, who hates me so.

239
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,580
为国家的风调雨顺
I pray for a better harvest

240
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,720
以及 人民的丰衣足食 而祈祷
and that the rains might stop.

241
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,600
我为万事万物而祈祷
I pray for everyone and everything.

242
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,040
此时此刻 只有在我对上帝祷告说
It's only when I say to the Lord...

243
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,960
‘现在 轮到托马斯・克伦威尔...’
"Now, about Thomas Cromwell..."

244
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,480
上帝却对我说
..does God say to me,

245
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,320
沃尔西 难道你不懂什么事适可而止吗？
"Wolsey, don't you know when to give up?"

246
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,160
来 让我代替上帝祝福你
Let me... Let me bless you.

247
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,760
这是他们期盼已久的
This is what they've waited for

248
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,640
萨尔福克 诺尔福克  博林
Suffolk, Norfolk, Boleyn.

249
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,800
我不死 他们是不会善罢甘休的
They won't rest until they have my head.

250
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,080
托马斯 你现在应该离我而去
You should leave me, Thomas.

251
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,360
就像伽纳德那样
Gardiner has.

252
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,360
卑鄙小人当然会
Gardiner would.

253
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,760
汤姆
Tom?

254
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,560
一路平安到家
Safe journey home.

255
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,880
我准备走了
I'm going to leave.

256
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,200
他说他会送我去安妮夫人那里
He says he'll send me to the Lady Anne.

257
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,320
我觉得她会赏识我的 对吗？
I think she'll like me well enough, don't you?

258
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,520
留在这里 还有什么意义呢
What's the point of staying here?

259
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,280
他们都会慢慢厌倦那个老头儿的
They're going to be rid of the old man.

260
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,840
这是大势所趋
It serves him right.

261
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,960
那克伦威尔呢？
And Cromwell?

262
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,680
那个律师?  就让他和那个老头一起自生自灭去吧
The lawyer? He'll go down with him.

263
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,640
额... 要我说 不过就是个所谓的律师而已
Well... I say, "lawyer" -

264
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,780
天知道他到底是个什么东西？
who knows what he is?

265
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,670
要不是那个老头的话
He comes from nothing.

266
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,360
他现在还只是一无所有的贱民
The old man brings him in

267
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,080
这才不过几年光景 还真以为自己是个人物了
and in a few years, it's as if he's the one in charge...

268
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,520
以为自己接替红衣主教的权利 继续作威作福了吗
..as if he has some hold over the Cardinal.

269
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,320
我听说他在国外杀了人 至今还是戴罪之身呢
I heard he killed a man abroad and never made confession.

270
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,440
但这种人...
But that kind...

271
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,840
一看到刽子手 只会以泪洗面
they always weep when they see the hangman.

272
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,000
是的 确实是我邀请你的 但是...
I did, but...

273
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,440
只不过发生了这么多事 我以为你会陪着沃尔西的
..with things the way they are with Wolsey, I thought...

274
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,040
托马斯 莫尔也来了
Thomas More is here.

275
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,600
看起来你也邀请了他
Well, I expect you invited him too.

276
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,960
- 格雷西亚    - 普雷戈
- Gracia.     - Prego.

277
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,960
莫尔先生 你有什么想对我说的吗？
Did you want to talk about me, Master More?

278
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,200
趁我在这儿 你有话可以当面对我说 没事儿 我脸皮厚
You can speak while I'm here, I have a thick skin.

279
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,360
没人想要跟你谈
No-one was talking of you.

280
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,480
那么 要说红衣主教什么呢?
Of the Cardinal, then?

281
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,840
托马斯 这位是查普伊先生
Thomas, this is Monsieur Chapuys,

282
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,340
新一任的驻英大使
the Emperor's new ambassador here in London.

283
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,840
查普伊先生 这是我的朋友 托马斯 克伦威尔
Monsieur Chapuys, my friend, Thomas Cromwell.

284
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,240
很高兴认识你
Enchanted.

285
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,960
其实我自己也不知道我是哪冒出来的
I hardly know where I come from, myself.

286
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,680
如果您不想让我听懂你们的谈话
If you want to speak half-secretly,

287
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,600
那就请你们用说希腊语吧  查普伊先生
try Greek, Monsieur Chapuys.

288
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,320
先生  如果您不待见他的话 就想象自己在看一条鲱鱼吧
My friend, you are looking at your herring as if you hate it.

289
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,400
- 鲱鱼也没什么不好                          - 哈哈哈
- There's nothing wrong with the herring.   - Ah.

290
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,080
说到红衣主教沃尔西 不得不提的是
But of Cardinal Wolsey, I'll say only this

291
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,840
他这辈子算是完了
he has brought his fall on himself.

292
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,200
自取灭亡罢了   土地 金钱 头衔
He's drawn all to himself - land, money and titles.

293
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,560
他总有统治众人的野心
He's always had a greed for ruling over other men.

294
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,800
但红衣主教到底还是个公众人物
The Cardinal's a public man.

295
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,920
你愿意帮他从这个惹眼的位置上退下来吗
Would you have him shrink from a public role?

296
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,080
可是 现在为时已晚了
Well, I think it's a little late

297
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,400
就让他在那潮湿的小屋里受点教训吧
to read the Cardinal a lesson in humility.

298
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,680
他的好朋友们早就警告过他了 但他都置若罔闻
His real friends have read it long ago and been ignored.

299
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,760
那你觉得你是真正的朋友吗?
And you count yourself a real friend, do you?

300
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,880
我当然会告诉他的 以基督的名义 大法官阁下
I'll tell him - and by the blood of Christ, Lord Chancellor,

301
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,040
当他被流放的时候 他会找到自己的慰藉
he'll find it a consolation as he sits in exile

302
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,140
并且疑惑为什么你会去国王那儿诽谤他
and wonders why you slander him to the King.

303
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,040
- 先生们...    - 不 我们直说吧
- Gentlemen... - No, let's have this straight.

304
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,200
汤姆斯说 ‘如果我可以选择的话 我会在教堂里度过余生
Thomas here says, ‘I'd spend my life in the church, if I had a choice.

305
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,520
我醉心于精神世界
I'm devoted to things of the spirit.

306
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,160
视钱财为身外之物
I care nothing for wealth.

307
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,460
世人的评价对我如过眼云烟’
The world's esteem is nothing to me.’

308
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,560
所以这就是我回到伦敦
So how is it I come back to London

309
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,240
然后发现你已经成为尊贵的大法官的原因吗?
and find you've become Lord Chancellor?

310
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,400
尊贵的大法官
Lord Chancellor.

311
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,840
这算什么?
What's that?

312
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,240
是他妈的意外吗?
A fucking accident?

313
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,180
你对教堂来说可不是个朋友 托马斯
You're no friend to the church, Thomas.

314
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,400
你只是一个神父的朋友而已
You're a friend to one priest only

315
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,000
而且还是基督世界里最腐败的神父
and he's the most corrupt in Christendom.

316
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,360
你一定得给我制作这个酱汁的菜谱
You must give me the recipe for this sauce.

317
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,640
托马斯・莫尔是我的老朋友
Thomas More is my old friend.

318
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,920
你不该来这儿折磨他
You shouldn't come here to bait him.

319
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,880
那我就不是你朋友吗 伯尼斯?
Am I not your friend too, Bonvisi?

320
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,280
你很清楚你是的
You know you are.

321
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,960
这也是为什么我给你这个建议
And that's why I give you this advice.

322
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,160
红衣大主教已经完蛋了
The Cardinal is finished.

323
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,560
他迟早会离开的
He'll go.

324
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,400
接着你就没有主家保护你了
And then you will be without a master to protect you.

325
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,720
现在就离开他
Leave him now.

326
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,000
你觉得是真的吗
Do you think it's true?

327
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,520
他犯的错是因为太自负
The mistake was being too proud?

328
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,380
我记得他以前经常说
I remember when he used to say,

329
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,600
‘国王会做这些 做那些'
"The King will do such and such."

330
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,240
后来变成 ‘我们应该做这些 做那些’
And then it was, "We will do such-and-such."

331
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,680
现在变成 "这是我要做的"
Now, it's "This is what I will do."

332
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,360
不 不
No, no.

333
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,080
真正的错误 是树立了一个安妮・博林这样的敌人
The mistake was making an enemy of Anne Boleyn.

334
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,640
不过呢 谁能知道她会走多远呢?
But then, who knew how far she'd rise?

335
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,440
托马斯!
Thomas!

336
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,920
主人 有从罗马传来的最新消息
Of course, master. News from Rome.

337
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,960
罗马皇帝的军队已经攻进城内了
The Emperor's troops have run wild in the city.

338
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,280
他们正到处杀人 强奸妇女...
They're killing, raping...

339
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,000
托马斯・莫尔说他们把婴儿放在火上烤的劈啪作响
Thomas More says they're roasting babies on spits.

340
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,760
不过士兵们根本没时间吃 他们在忙着偷东西
Soldiers don't have time to eat babies. They're too busy stealing.

341
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,080
如果查理大帝一会儿让他们吃的话
If the Emperor Charles had paid them once in a while...

342
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,560
他们已经俘虏了教皇
They've taken the Pope prisoner.

343
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,320
你说什么?
What?

344
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,640
罗马皇帝是王后的侄子
The Emperor is the Queen's nephew.

345
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,960
如果他抓到了教皇 那国王离婚的那个请求就...
If he has the Pope, then the King's divorce petition is...

346
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,320
是啊...
Yeah...

347
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,760
每次有紧急情况
In every emergency,

348
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,280
都看看是不是能给你的王子找到些什么可利用的帮助 托马斯
look to see if there's some advantage for your prince, Thomas.

349
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,800
啊 樱桃
Ah, cherries.

350
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,920
我该怎么办呢 我想问
How did I do that, I wonder?

351
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,960
来，拿着
Here, take.

352
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,960
但现在 在现在这个紧急情况中
Now, in this current emergency,

353
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,400
对我来说 克莱门特教皇 现在看起来就像是...
it will be to me that Pope Clement looks to...

354
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,080
好吧 是为了让所有基督国家团结在一起的 存在
well, keep Christendom together.

355
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,840
因此 假设我到法国去
So, suppose if I were to travel to France

356
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,420
在议会中把所有的红衣主教们叫到一起 你知道的
and gather together the cardinals in a council, you know,

357
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:40,000
在教皇出缺的这期间管理教堂的事务?
to conduct the business of the church in the Pope's absence?

358
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,280
现在 如果教堂的事务...
Now, if this business...

359
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,880
碰巧包含国王的私事的话
happened to include the King's private matter...

360
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,480
我们能不对它进行裁决吗?
might we not rule on it?

361
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,960
而且 你瞧瞧
And voila,

362
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,360
英格兰国王变成了单身汉
the King of England will be a bachelor.

363
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,360
什么?
What?

364
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,200
没从丝绸商那儿听到更多消息吗?
Not more gossip from the silk merchants?

365
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,920
有流言说国王已经从玛丽・博林那儿搬出来了
Rumour is the King has moved from Mary Boleyn

366
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,600
搬到她那个平胸的妹妹那儿去了
to her flat-chested sister.

367
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,200
安妮?
Anne?

368
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,340
她还没原谅你关于哈里・珀西的事儿呢
She hasn't forgiven you for that business with Harry Percy.

369
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,680
- 好吧...  - 卡文迪什跟我说 她发誓要找你报仇
- Well...  - Cavendish tells me she's sworn vengeance on you.

370
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,840
可怜的黄毛丫头...
Poor chit of a girl.

371
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,040
国王在夏天会和她同床共枕
The King will have her in his bed by summer.

372
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,640
到了秋天 他就厌倦她 打发她离开了
By autumn, he'll tire of her and pension her off.

373
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,680
你在干什么呢？
What are you doing?

374
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,280
为了格雷戈里
For Gregory.

375
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,880
这跟凯瑟琳王后给国王的衬衫是一样的设计
It's the same design Queen Katherine uses for the King's shirts.

376
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,340
好吧 如果我是她的话
Well, if I were her,

377
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,560
我肯定会在衣服上留根针的
I'd leave the needle in.

378
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
我知道你会这样做的
I know you would.

379
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,680
你妹妹今天来过了
Your sister was here today.

380
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,880
她又问你能不能去看看他？
She asked again if you'd go and see him?

381
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,520
她说你现在已经不了解他了 他戒了酒 定居下来了
She said you'd hardly know him now. He's stopped drinking, settled down.

382
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,920
格雷丝 亲爱的
Grace, sweetheart,

383
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,840
你要离火炉远点
will you keep away from the fire with those, eh?

384
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,120
这可是你的天使翅膀
They're your angel wings.

385
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,560
它们可是为圣诞节准备的
They're just supposed to be for Christmas.

386
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,600
我知道得
I know.

387
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,360
好了 去玩吧
All right, off you go.

388
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,880
托马斯 你的父亲他
Your own father, Thomas

389
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,000
他从没见过我们的孩子们
and he's never seen the children.

390
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,400
很好啊 继续这样吧
Well, let's keep it that way.

391
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,360
我能选择我想跟谁结婚吗?
Can I choose who I want to marry?

392
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,480
什么?
What?

393
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,480
我能选择我想跟谁结婚吗?
Can I choose who I want to marry?

394
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,880
只要是合乎情理就行
Within reason.

395
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,560
那我选拉夫
Then I choose Rafe.

396
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,600
- 你...
- You...

397
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,920
格雷丝说我不能嫁给他 因为他是我的表亲
Grace says I can't marry him because he's my cousin.

398
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,000
理查德是你的表亲 但拉夫不是
Well, Richard's your cousin, not Rafe.

399
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,280
拉夫是我的护卫
Rafe is my ward.

400
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,620
就是说拉夫的父亲曾请求我带他入行
That means Rafe's father asked me to take him in

401
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,960
在商业环境下把他带大 你明白了吗?
and bring him up in business. Do you understand?

402
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,360
所以我能选拉夫咯?
So I can choose Rafe?

403
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,960
如果他等你的话就能
If he'll wait for you.

404
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,880
拉夫?
Rafe?

405
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,760
她本来会选更糟的选择
She could do worse.

406
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,320
- 我热的睡不着      - 噢
- I'm too warm.     - Oh.

407
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,800
回你的床上去 格雷丝 宝贝
Go back to bed, Grace, sweetheart.

408
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,600
你打算一整晚都带着那对天使翅膀睡觉吗?
Are you going to wear those angel wings all night?

409
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,200
我想祷告完再摘掉
Till I say my prayers.

410
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,080
跟我说你要去哪里
Tell me when you're going.

411
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,520
莉兹 我哪也不去
Liz, I'm not going.

412
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,480
沃尔西不在 我是不会去法国的 记得么?
I'm not going to France with Wolsey, remember?

413
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,920
回床上继续睡吧 莉兹
Go back to bed, Liz.

414
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,400
- 你好 佛朗西斯     - 先生
- Hello, Francis.   - Sir.

415
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,280
如果有人找我 就说我不在
Anyone asks for me, I'm not here.

416
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,760
好的 克伦威尔大人
Yes, Master Cromwell.

417
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:52,400
圣经的语言对我来说就像蜜糖
The words of the scripture are as honey to me.

418
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,720
我沉醉在上帝的话语中
I am drunk on the word of God.

419
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,380
我读过廷代尔的《新约福音》
I've read Tyndale's gospel.

420
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,570
人群 禁食 守夜
Masses, fasting, vigils,

421
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,760
赦免于炼狱
pardons out of purgatory...

422
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,880
所有这些都是无用的
all useless.

423
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,040
所有的这些让我明白
This is revealed to me.

424
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,080
上帝啊 老兄 你真以为你这德行能逃过主的圣裁吗
For Christ's sake, man, do you think you can crawl out of your hole

425
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,840
就因为红衣大主教沃尔西阁下走了?
because Cardinal Wolsey is away?

426
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,040
这一切意味着伽纳德和莫尔
All that means is that Gardiner and More

427
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,400
将会有更多的空闲来追捕我们
have a free hand to pursue us,

428
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,960
把我们打成异教徒
to brand us heretics.

429
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,520
只有沃尔西能保护我们
Wolsey protects us.

430
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,560
沃尔西?
Wolsey?

431
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,200
沃尔西烧了他的圣经
Wolsey burns bibles.

432
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,520
可莫尔可是会烧死异教徒的
More will burn men.

433
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,520
我在德国见到了廷代尔
I met with Tyndale in Germany...

434
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,520
噢 我...
Oh, I...

435
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,920
我可不想知道廷代尔在哪
I don't want to know where Tyndale is.

436
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
先生们...
Gentlemen...

437
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,560
我打算去罗马 去见教皇
I'm going to go to Rome and see His Holiness.

438
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,480
我知道的 我可以让他用我们的方式来思考的
I know I can bring him over to our way of thinking.

439
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,760
这是怎么回事?
What is it?

440
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,600
快说！
Say it.

441
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,960
她...
She...

442
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,240
今早你离开以后她说她很累
She said she was tired this morning, after you left.

443
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,600
她什么也不吃 然后...
She wouldn't eat anything, then...

444
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,040
她就开始发抖
she started shaking.

445
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,160
两点左右 我们叫来了牧师
We called for the priest around two.

446
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,960
她说她在意大利抓过一条蛇
She said she held a snake in Italy,

447
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,120
但是牧师说那只是她发烧了 在说胡话
but the priest said that was just the fever talking.

448
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,600
他看起来就像迫不及待要走
He couldn't wait to get away.

449
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,240
她有没有...嗯...
Did she, er...

450
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,320
她留了什么口信吗?
Did she leave any message?

451
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,200
有没有给我的?
For me?

452
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,000
她只是不停地说口渴
Just kept saying she was thirsty.

453
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,520
姑娘们出事了
It's the girls.

454
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,180
坚持住 坚持住!
Come on, come on!

455
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,760
拜托 坚持住!
Come on, come on!

456
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,960
看着我 拜托 拜托 醒醒 亲爱的
Stay with me. Come on, come on, wake up, darling.

457
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,840
拜托 拜托 你能听见我说话吗 亲爱的?
Come on, come on. Can you hear me, darling?

458
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,860
你能听见我吗? 拜托
Can you hear me? Come on.

459
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,590
坚持住 请坚持住...
Come on, please, please...

460
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,120
醒醒 把眼睛睁开
Wake up, open your eyes.

461
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,400
快睁开眼睛 亲爱的
Open your eyes, please, darling.

462
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,960
拜托...
Please, come on...

463
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,080
快 坚持住 拜托...
Come on, come on, come on, please...

464
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,320
拜托 睁开眼睛 亲爱的 拜托 拜托...
Please, open your eyes, darling, come on, come on...

465
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,240
不要 不要合上眼
Don't, don't.

466
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,440
-拜托...不要...拜托...
- Please...come on...No...Please...

467
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,400
让她们安然离去吧 给她们怜悯慈悲吧...
Mercy, mercy, mercy...

468
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,800
不要这样...
Don't.

469
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,880
没事的...
It's all right.

470
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,440
没事的...
It's all right.

471
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,240
去吧...安心去吧...
Go. Go now.

472
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,080
人人都说它回来了
Everybody said it was back.

473
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,240
这种...
This...

474
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,840
..汗热病   [亦称 流行性粟粒疹热]
..sweating sickness.

475
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,560
我应该让她们去乡下的
I should have sent them to the country.

476
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,760
莉兹不会让她们走的
Liz wouldn't have let them go.

477
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,320
你每次离开 安妮都会哭
Anne cried every time you were away.

478
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,960
是吗?
Did she?

479
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,200
安妮哭过?
Anne did?

480
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,960
约翰和我会跟你在一起待一段时间
John and I can stay with you for a while.

481
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,720
料理家务 直到你...
Look after the household, until you're...

482
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,680
安妮她曾经想学希腊语
She wanted to learn Greek.

483
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,160
嘿...
Hey...

484
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,200
噢...呃...
Oh! Ugh!

485
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,840
你去哪了?
Where've you been?

486
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,040
你看起来就像个外国人
You look like a foreigner.

487
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,080
我本来就是个外国人
I am a foreigner.

488
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,640
你要去哪?
Where'd you go?

489
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,200
没有目的地 随便走走
Here and there.

490
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,320
上次我听说 你现在为沃尔西卖命了
Working for Wolsey now, I hear.

491
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,720
我是名律师
I'm a lawyer.

492
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,760
律师？
Lawyer?

493
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,000
你不过只是夸夸其谈而已
You were always a talker.

494
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,280
耍嘴皮子功夫 是救不了你的命的
Slap in the mouth couldn't cure you.

495
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,680
上帝知道你已经尽力了
God knows you tried.

496
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,320
法律？
Law?

497
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,600
如果不是因为有法律 我早就是一名勋爵大人了
If it wasn't for the law, I'd be a lord.

498
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,560
克伦威尔有钱
Cromwells had money.

499
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,300
我们有地
We had estates.

500
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,040
真是多了了你们律师
Thieved off us -

501
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,280
把我们的地都给夺走
by lawyers.

502
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,760
我我知道你不会承认这些的 不是吗？
Suppose you don't admit to me, now, do you?

503
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,600
估计你心里早就希望我死了千遍万遍了吧
Suppose you hoped I'd be dead.

504
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,760
你为什么会在这儿
Why are you here?

505
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,920
我妻子让我来见见你
My wife told me I should come see you.

506
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,040
现在你见到了
Well, now you have.

507
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,280
是
Yeah.

508
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,920
什么事？
What is it?

509
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,920
主人 我想问您个问题
Master, I have a question to put to you.

510
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,480
我父亲去世了 现在
My father is dead and you...

511
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,160
你就是我父亲了
You are my father now.

512
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,720
所以我应该改跟着你的姓氏吗？
So, shall I change my name to yours?

513
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,440
你父亲？
Your father?

514
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,120
我每天都在为他祈祷
Every day I light a candle for him.

515
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,920
那你心里有好些吗？
Does that comfort you?

516
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,120
说实话我不知道
I don't know.

517
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,080
不过...
Well, this...

518
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,000
这让我释怀了许多
This comforts me.

519
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,800
你的名字现在是 理查德・克伦威尔
Richard Cromwell.

520
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,920
谢谢您
Thank you.

521
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,360
- 如果...  - 走 走吧 下去吧 快走
- If...    - Go, go on, get out. Get out.

522
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,640
嗯...
Ugh!

523
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,200
啊！
Agh! Oh!

524
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,920
快给我起来！
Now, get up!

525
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,280
起来！
Get up!

526
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,360
来啊，小子！让我看看你有多少能耐！
Come on, boy! Let me see you stand on your feet!

527
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,880
起来！
Get up!

528
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,880
- 啊！     - 给我起来！
- Agh!     - Get up!

529
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,400
Get...up!
起...来！

530
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,080
你应该听说了国王陛下对我的款待有多棒了
You'll hear the King's reception of me was cool.

531
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,520
虽然说是有点夸张
It's only partly true.

532
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,200
但我的这次任务仍不能说是
Still, my mission could not be described

533
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,080
一个举足轻重般的胜利
as an over-whelming success.

534
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,760
红衣主教们不肯见我
The cardinals wouldn't meet me.

535
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,760
说是到南方去太热了
They said it was too hot to travel south.

536
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,720
所以...接下来怎么办呢？
So...what next?

537
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,040
一个新计划 一个宗教法庭
A new plan. A Legatine Court.

538
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,880
我们要让教皇以他名义派遣特使来
We ask the Pope to send his envoy to act in his name

539
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,320
治理英格兰
and rule here in England,

540
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,600
并确保国王陛下和凯瑟琳的婚姻自始至终
on the validity of the King's marriage to Katherine.

541
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,000
嗯？哈？
Hm? Huh?

542
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,080
呃...
Er...

543
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,240
当你在法国的时候...
When you were in France...

544
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,920
我的妻子和女儿们都相继去世了
..my wife and daughters died.

545
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,400
噢 汤姆...
Oh, Tom...

546
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,400
因主所爱...
Whom the Lord loveth...

547
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,080
克伦威尔大师？
Master Cromwell?

548
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,520
托马斯・克伦威尔 竟然在看祈祷书？
Thomas Cromwell, reading a prayer book?

549
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,440
那么我知道事情的严重性了
Now I know how bad things are.

550
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,320
他怎么样了？
How is he?

551
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,200
你离开后...
He asks after you...

552
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,160
他马上就问起你
the minute you've gone.

553
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,160
担心你在路上摔下来
Worries you'll fall in the road.

554
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,240
乔治 你有约克宫殿这的财产清单吗
Have you an inventory for York Place, George?

555
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,920
什么？
What?

556
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,080
约克宫殿 我要送给她
York Place. I'll take it to her.

557
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,720
送给安妮夫人？
To the Lady Anne?

558
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,960
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

559
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,800
马克？
Well, Mark?

560
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,400
你在用功学习呢
You're hard at study.

561
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,040
你还好吗？
How are you?

562
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,080
回到约克宫殿这让你感到陌生了吧
It must feel strange, being back at York Place -

563
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,320
毕竟世界变化莫测
with the world so altered?

564
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,600
没有
No.

565
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,680
你不想念红衣大主教阁下吗？
You don't miss My Lord Cardinal?

566
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,720
不想
No.

567
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,880
好吧 你可能不愿想起我们
Well, you might not think of us, Mark, but...

568
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:31,960
但我们仍会挂念你
we think of you.

569
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,320
为什么！别让我的小不点跑掉
Pourquoi! Don't let him out!

570
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,840
安妮夫人
Lady Anne.

571
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,920
您可真客气
Vous etes gentil.

572
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,380
那好
Allors...

573
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,050
克伦威尔
Master...

574
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,720
大人？
Cremuel?

575
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,840
你把这里的清单带来了吗?
You have your inventories?

576
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,280
可真是多谢了你的慷慨
Thank you for this.

577
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,680
自从红衣大主教阁下风光不再后
Since My Lord Cardinal's reduction,

578
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,080
我想您过得还不错吧？
have you seen much progress in your cause?

579
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,920
在英格兰 他是唯一能满足你所需的人
He's the only man in England who can obtain for you what you need.

580
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,040
很好
Very well.

581
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,140
继续为他说话  你有五分钟
Make his case. You have five minutes.

582
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,320
如果不是的 你应该会很忙才对
Otherwise, I can see you're really busy.

583
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,560
红衣大主教是唯一有权利从教皇那里接过国王王后离婚判决的人
The Cardinal's the only man who can deliver an annulment from the Pope.

584
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,080
也是唯一能够拯救陛下良知
He's the only man who can deliver the King's conscience -

585
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,760
甚至让陛下完全醒悟过来的人
and deliver it clean.

586
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,240
如果国王想要得到那份判决的话
If the King wants it

587
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,240
并且按照你所说的 红衣大主教
and according to you, the Cardinal,

588
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,080
这位前任王国统治下的主教 也想要它
formerly the chief subject of the kingdom, wants it...

589
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,640
那我不得不说 克伦威尔大人
Then I must say, Master Cremuel

590
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,280
这还真是花了很久很久的时间才得以实现啊
it's all taking a marvellous long while to come to pass.

591
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,280
而且凯瑟琳王后已经不再年轻了
And she's not getting any younger.

592
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,900
没有人比我们的红衣大主教更紧张了吧
No-one is more distressed than the Cardinal

593
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,040
国王得不到他内心所求的欲望
that the King cannot have his heart's desire,

594
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,080
因为这同时也是红衣大主教内心的欲望
which is ever the Cardinal's desire too.

595
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,920
因为他知道国王所有统治下的国民
He knows that all the King's subjects

596
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,920
- 都把他们的希望寄托在你身上 希望你能诞下王位的继承人...   - 很好
- repose their hopes in you, for an heir to the throne...  - Very nice.

597
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,480
很好！克伦威尔大人
Very nice, Master Cremuel.

598
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,240
有本事你再说一遍！
But try again.

599
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,600
有一件事！
One thing.

600
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,400
我们要求红衣大主教做的就这么一件简单的事情而已
One simple thing we asked of the Cardinal

601
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,680
- 但他却坚决不会去做   - 你知道那并不是简单的事
- and he would not.    - You know it wasn't simple.

602
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,320
好吧 也许因为我只是一个普通的人
Well, perhaps I am a simple person.

603
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,000
你觉得我是么?
Do you feel I am?

604
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,800
也许吧 但我对你了解的并不多
You may be. I hardly know you.

605
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,440
你该走了
You may go.

606
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,120
玛丽夫人
Lady Mary.

607
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,040
我的天 我还以为她会狠狠扇你一耳光呢
God, I thought she would slap you.

608
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,840
我妹妹天性比较好斗
My sister likes a good fight.

609
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,100
下次再来试试吧
Come again.

610
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,160
我已经迫不及待了!
I can't wait!

611
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,920
我认为你姐姐能行的
Your sister can, I think.

612
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,680
噢 她知道该如何等待的
Oh, she knows how to wait.

613
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,760
据我所知
So I hear.

614
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,040
他们说她和国王...
They say she and the King...

615
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,200
还在藕断丝连着 这是真的
..still haven't. It's true.

616
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,640
她让国王为她倾倒 并亲吻她的胸脯
She lets him pull down her shift and kiss her breasts.

617
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,280
男人一样可以 如果他能找到的话
Good man, if he can find them.

618
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,920
玛丽夫人 安妮夫人找你
Lady Mary, Lady Anne wants you.

619
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,520
噢 我的天!
Oh, by the saints!

620
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,880
我要再次申请 在议会中取得一个席位
I need a seat in Parliament again.

621
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,160
为什么?
Why?

622
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,360
因为如果我不在那边为主教阁下说话
Because if I'm not there to speak for the Cardinal,

623
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,640
他们会马上杀了他
they'll kill him.

624
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,560
克伦威尔 我会满足你的愿望 让你在成为议会的议员
Cromwell, I am content you are a burgess in the Parliament.

625
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,520
谢勋爵大人
My Lord.

626
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,120
我也和国王说了 他也同意了
I spoke to the King for you and he is also content.

627
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,280
你会在下议院中接收到他和我的指令
You will take his instructions in the Commons - and mine.

628
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,120
大人 两道指令是一样的么?
Will they be the same, My Lord?

629
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,640
你这该死的 克伦威尔...
God damn it, Cromwell...

630
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,840
你为什么总是要表现成这样的...
Why are you such a...

631
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:57,920
一个人呢?
person?

632
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,200
就好像你能承担的起你这么做的后果一样！
It's not as if you can afford to be.

633
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,080
就这样一笑置之吧!
Smile away!

634
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,080
国王会授予你一个听众席位的
The King will grant you an audience,

635
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,720
但他已经准备好和你斗法了 大师
but he is preparing a quarrel against you, master.

636
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,120
噢 对了
Oh, yes!

637
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,400
他记忆力十分出色 而且记得非常清楚
He has a long memory and well remembers

638
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,440
在你上一次当选议员的时候
when you were a burgess in the Parliament before this -

639
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,800
你是怎样反对他挑起的战争的
and how you spoke against his war.

640
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,720
我至今仍希望他不要再想着了侵略法国
I hope he doesn't think still of invading France.

641
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,320
你去死吧! 有哪个英国人不这么想
God damn you! What Englishman doesn't?

642
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,800
法国那地方本来就是我们所有的!
We own France!

643
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,520
我们有权去夺回属于我们自己的东西!
We have a right to take back our own!

644
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,700
你给我听着...
Mind you...

645
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,690
也许你说的没错
You're right.

646
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:53,480
也许我们打不赢这场战争
We can't win.

647
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,280
但无论如何我们必须要去战斗
But we have to fight anyway.

648
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,720
这就是为什么说沃尔西犯了错
That was what was wrong with Wolsey

649
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,560
他总是想着如何谈判签协议
always at the treaty table.

650
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,520
一个屠夫的孩子怎么会懂...
How can a butcher's son understand...

651
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,880
拿戈卢?    [产自波尔多地区的高级红酒]
La gloire?

652
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,280
你难道是屠夫的儿子吗?
Are you a butcher's son?

653
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,140
铁匠的儿子
Blacksmith's.

654
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:13,650
你认真的?
Are you really?

655
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:14,960
给马打蹄铁的那种?
Shoe a horse?

656
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:18,080
如果我再刻苦专精一点的话 但我曾经是名战士
If I were put to it - I was a soldier, myself.

657
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,280
是么?
Were you?

658
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,960
是么?
Were you?

659
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,080
我敢说 你在任何的英国军队里都不够格
Not with any English army, I'll be bound.

660
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:34,480
我知道你是有些地方很不讨我喜欢
I knew there was something about you that I didn't like,

661
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,360
但我绝对不会对你指指点点
but I couldn't put my finger on it.

662
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,800
说说 你当时是在哪?
Where were you?

663
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,320
加里格利亚诺
Garigliano.

664
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,160
和谁一起?
With?

665
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,160
- 法国人         - 呵！
- The French.    - Huh!

666
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,280
- 你站错队了 少年       - 我知道
- Wrong side, lad.      - I noticed.

667
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,800
那你会用长弓射箭么?
Longbow-man?

668
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,760
偶尔 但玩的不是很好
Now and then. Bit on the short side.

669
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,240
我也是
Me too.

670
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,800
国王可以拉一个满弓
The King can draw a bow.

671
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,220
那很厉害
Very nice.

672
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,640
够得到手臂
Got the arm.

673
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,720
勋爵大人
My Lord,

674
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:10,040
埃莎尔那里不适合红衣大主教阁下
Esher is not suitable for My Lord Cardinal.

675
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,200
他很愿意前往他在温彻斯特那里的宫殿
He's willing to travel to his palace at Winchester.

676
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,000
噢 我打赌他肯定愿意
Oh, I bet he is.

677
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,420
想的很美 又能很接近国王!
Nice and close to the King!

678
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,640
但别把我们当傻瓜
Don't take us for fools.

679
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,200
告诉你的主教阁下 他和他所谓的法庭
Tell your cardinal that he had his last chance, with his court,

680
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,760
这是他们的最后一次机会！
here in this very building!

681
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,600
告诉他逃到北边去
Tell him to go north.

682
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,320
他没有准备好去北方那边
He's not ready to go north.

683
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,920
我想让他去北方那边
I want him north.

684
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,880
告诉他 诺尔福克想让他快点上路 早早离开这里
Tell him, Norfolk wants him on the road and away from here...

685
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,760
..并且告诉他...
..and tell him...

686
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,820
..如果他不愿意
..if he doesn't,

687
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,720
我会去找他
I'll come to him

688
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,880
然后我将用我的牙齿把他撕裂
and I'll tear him with my teeth.

689
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,960
大人 我能把‘撕裂’替代成‘咬’吗?
My Lord, may I substitute the word "bite" for "tear"?

690
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,200
没什么可替代的 你...
Substitute nothing, you...

691
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,560
..你这个无名小卒
..you nobody.

692
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,960
20年来
For 20 years,

693
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,720
我一直都陪在你身边 是你真正的爱妻
I have been your true wife.

694
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,800
我们一起生育了很多个孩子
And by me, you have had many children...

695
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,480
...虽然上帝很宠爱他们 把他们从这个世界上带走
...although it pleased God to call them from this world

696
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,440
但这并不是我的过错
which was no fault of mine.

697
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,400
当你第一次拥有了我
And when you had me first -

698
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,880
上帝为我作证 我是个真正的处子之身
as God is my witness, I was a true maid,

699
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,520
从没有碰过男人
without touch of man.

700
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,480
不管你承认与否
And whether this is true or no,

701
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,960
这答案只有你自己的良心知道
I put to your conscience.

702
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:00,120
在亚瑟王子的新婚之夜 我和牛津伯爵
On Prince Arthur's wedding night, myself and the Earl of Oxford

703
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,640
将王子带到了凯瑟琳王后的寝宫
took the prince to Queen Katherine's chambers

704
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,780
当他爬上床在她旁边时 我们都站在那里
and we were there when he climbed into bed beside her.

705
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,920
第二天早上 他再次出现 说他很口渴
Next morning, he comes out again, says he's thirsty

706
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,040
并要一些啤酒 因为 他说
and asks for some ale, because, he said...

707
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,600
"昨晚我身在西班牙！"
"Last night I was in Spain!"

708
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,800
你们都知道 女王是西班牙人呀
The Queen was Spanish, you see?

709
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,400
那是个多么可怜的新郎官啊
It would be a poor sort of bridegroom

710
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,480
谁会在大早晨就出来并且说
who'd come out in the morning and say,

711
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,560
"多么好的一天 大师 我们什么也没做成"
"Good day, masters. Nothing done!"

712
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,800
他才15岁 他在吹嘘自己呀
He was 15, he was boasting.

713
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,760
我宁愿相信凯瑟琳王后
I believe Katherine.

714
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,680
不要相信任何人
Believe nobody.

715
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,920
你迟到了 斯蒂芬 他们这一天几乎都耗光了
You're late, Stephen. They're almost done for the day.

716
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,280
无所谓
It doesn't matter.

717
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,080
为什么无所谓?
Why doesn't it matter?

718
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,960
我从我的一个在罗马的手下听到了一个消息
News from one of my men in Rome.

719
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,040
克莱门特教皇 正准备和罗马皇帝签署一个条约
Pope Clement is preparing to sign a treaty with the Emperor.

720
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,600
噢...
Oh...

721
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,560
这男孩不懂你说的什么意思
Your boy doesn't understand.

722
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,760
罗马皇帝是不会轻易接受教皇的帮助
The Emperor won't take kindly to the Pope helping

723
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,640
来让她姑姑放弃王位的
to have his aunt cast off the throne.

724
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,800
我不认为教皇的特使在那里
I don't think your papal envoy in there

725
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,400
是想给国王他最想要的 你觉得呢?
is likely to give the King what he wants, do you?

726
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,200
但如果他真的给了国王最想要的
And when he doesn't,

727
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,000
那么沃尔西就会完蛋了
Wolsey will be finished.

728
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,040
然后我也会将为你感到十分遗憾
And then I'll feel sorry for you.

729
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,800
除非你不会这样
Except you won't.

730
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,120
对 除非我不会这样
Except I won't.

731
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,240
克伦威尔? 你的那个胖牧师怎么样?
Cromwell? How's your fat priest?

732
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,640
他怎么样了...?
How is...?

733
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,560
他不会好的 除非他得到殿下您的青睐
He cannot be well till he has Your Majesty's favour.

734
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,720
指控他罪名的名单每天都在增加
The list of charges against him grows every day.

735
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,720
殿下 每个人都已经有了答案
Saving Your Majesty, there's an answer to each one

736
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,400
给他一个听证会的机会吧 我们会成功的
and given a hearing, we'd make them.

737
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,480
不是今天
Not today.

738
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,160
萨尔福克今天想去打猎
Suffolk wants to go hunting.

739
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:03,360
我们通常说 我们这些绅士们 狩猎是为将来的战争做准备
We usually say, we gentlemen, that the hunt prepares us for war.

740
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,800
这给我们带来很棘手的一点 克伦威尔大师
Which brings us to a sticky point, Master Cromwell.

741
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,080
是的 确实是
It does, indeed.

742
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:16,640
你说 在议会上 一次演讲中 大约六年前
You said, in Parliament, in a speech, some six years ago,

743
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,320
说我承受不了一场战争
that I could not afford a war.

744
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,000
战争是我们买不起的东西
Wars are not affordable things.

745
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,760
然后当我进入法国
When I went into France,

746
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:25,040
我围堵在了一个镇上的Therouanne 你管这叫...
I captured the town of Therouanne, which you called...

747
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:28,080
- 一个狗洞 殿下          - 你怎么这么肯定的?
- A dog-hole, Majesty.   - How could you say so?

748
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,480
呃...我去过那
Er... I've been there.

749
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,040
我也是 还是统领一支军队前去
So have I - at the head of an army!

750
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,720
是你说我 不能领导我自己的军队!
You told me I could not lead my own troops!

751
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,720
是你告诉我 如果我被俘虏了
You told me if I was taken prisoner,

752
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,840
赎金将使国家破产! 所以 你到底想要干什么?
the ransom would bankrupt the country! So, what do you want?

753
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,600
你想让国王蜷缩在王宫内 像一个生病的小女孩儿?
You want a king to huddle indoors, like a sick girl?

754
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,080
那样状况也许会很理想 只站在财政的角度上看
That would be ideal, for fiscal purposes.

755
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,840
一名身体强壮的男人 行动起来却会被处处受制
A strong man acts within that which constrains him.

756
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,560
我问你 是什么在限制我?
What constrains me?

757
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,320
是距离
Distance.

758
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,520
当殿下的祖先在法国作战时
When Your Majesty's ancestors fought in France,

759
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,280
他们攻下了一整个省
they held whole provinces.

760
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:12,000
在那里 他们可以自给自足粮饷军备
From there, they could supply, they could provision.

761
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,560
可现在我们却只有加来一个城市而已
Now we have only Calais,

762
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,160
打起仗来 我们要如何才能供给一支在敌人内部的军队呢?
how can we support an army in the interior?

763
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,280
所以下次我们再去法国时
So next time we go into France,

764
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:20,400
一定一定需要一个海岸做供给点
we'll need a sea coast.

765
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,160
- 当然 比如诺曼底, 布列塔尼半岛
- Of course.Normandy, Brittany.

766
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,200
克伦威尔大师
Master Cromwell,

767
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,960
你的名声可不是很好
your reputation is bad.

768
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,760
你难道不要为自己辩护吗?
You don't defend yourself?

769
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,120
殿下可以自己构成自己的观点
Your Majesty can form your own opinions.

770
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:44,960
是 我可以
I can.

771
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,240
而且 我也会的
I will.

772
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,280
我们现在画出穿着大衣的红衣大主教的手臂了吗?
Are we to paint out the Cardinal's coat of arms?

773
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,120
不行
No.

774
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,640
再涂一遍
Paint it again.

775
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,240
涂得颜色再亮点
Paint it brighter.

776
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:28,240

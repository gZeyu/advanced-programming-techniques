1
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,880
Wolsey, you're out!

2
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,960
My Lords Norfolk and Suffolk.

3
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,640
Cardinal Wolsey.

4
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,120
You're dismissed as Lord Chancellor,

5
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,840
by the King's orders.

6
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,160
You're to return to us the Great Seal.

7
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,120
You'll have supper?

8
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,800
You wanted all to rule yourself, didn't you?

9
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,160
and had the lords like schoolboys, creeping in here.

10
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,280
Well, I am here now...

11
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,740
..and I will chew you up.

12
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,360
Bones, flesh and gristle.

13
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,640
You're to hand over the Great Seal.

14
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,520
Ah!

15
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,800
Apparently, a written request from the King is necessary.

16
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,640
Do you have one?

17
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,160
No?

18
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,800
Oh, that's careless.

19
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,680
My lawyer, Thomas Cromwell.

20
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,160
You want us to ride back to Windsor for a piece of paper?

21
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,600
In this weather?

22
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,000
I see, yes.

23
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,640
Actually, my lawyer tells me I can't give you the Seal,

24
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,080
written request or no.

25
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,240
He tells me that, properly speaking,

26
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,240
I should hand it only to the Master of the Rolls.

27
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,320
So...

28
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,400
you'd better come back with him.

29
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,400
I'm obliged, master.

30
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,600
Did you know that, or did you make it up?

31
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,520
They'll be back in a day.

32
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,680
Well, these days,

33
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,480
24 hours feels like a victory.

34
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,560
Do we have refreshments for our guests?

35
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,960
Served on what? They've taken the plate.

36
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,180
What's this?

37
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,200
It's borrowed.

38
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,560
They've confiscated my wardrobe

39
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,920
and you know how I feel the cold.

40
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,120
Thank you, Peter.

41
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,800
This is to be Anne Boleyn's, I think.

42
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,980
The King wants her to have a London residence.

43
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,760
This palace belongs to the Archdiocese of York.

44
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,640
When did Lady Anne become an Archbishop?

45
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,280
Now, now, Thomas. Everything I have, I have from the King.

46
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,120
If he wants to take York Place, fully furnished,

47
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,360
then I'm sure we'll find some other roof to shelter under.

48
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,160
He's expecting to find a wax figure of himself

49
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,000
with a pin stuck through it.

50
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,640
Come and see me.

51
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,160
Why, My Lord?

52
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,080
When?

53
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,200
When you've mended your manners.

54
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,040
What it is, to serve a prince.

55
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,720
The gentlest, wisest prince in Christendom.

56
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,080
I'll not hear a word against Henry from any man.

57
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,160
Do you think it's something about the English?

58
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,520
They cannot see a great man set up, but they have to pull him down?

59
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,800
It's not the English.

60
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,400
It's just people.

61
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,880
We brought the Lady Anne back from France,

62
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,480
to marry into Ireland.

63
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,240
Now I hear she danced at the court masque with young Harry Percy.

64
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,760
Connived in dark corners with him.

65
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,000
And I won't have that.

66
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,680
Your grace can't think that I'm party to...

67
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,760
Oh, Sir Thomas Boleyn.

68
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,640
You'd be amazed at what I can think.

69
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,160
Anne knows things can't proceed with young Harry Percy.

70
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,160
- But he believes he's free to choose his own wife.  - Free?

71
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,280
Choose his own...?

72
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,360
He's not some ploughboy!

73
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,440
He's the man who'll have to hold the north for us, some day.

74
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,800
The Percy family comprise the noblest in the land,

75
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,880
whereas the Boleyns were once in...

76
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,520
What? Trade, weren't you?

77
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,140
Who is that?

78
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,600
Who's that?

79
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,120
Oh, it's Stephen Gardiner, my Secretary.

80
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,400
Send him out.

81
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,880
Stephen.

82
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,320
And who is that?

83
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,600
Never mind who that is. He's nobody.

84
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,280
The problem is...

85
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,960
..my daughter and Harry Percy,

86
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,020
I think they may have gone a little far in the matter.

87
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,470
It seems they've pledged themselves before witnesses...

88
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,920
Well, you can forget all talk of pledges and witnesses.

89
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,680
I'll get his father down from the borders

90
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,240
and if the prodigal defies his father,

91
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,600
he'll be tossed out of his heirdom on his prodigal snout.

92
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,840
Now, get your daughter married into Ireland,

93
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,840
before her intended hears any rumours of spoilt goods.

94
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,720
Finished, My Lord Cardinal?

95
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,800
Finished.

96
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,460
Butcher's boy!

97
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,480
Butcher's dog!

98
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,600
Come out, dog.

99
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,520
He's talking to you.

100
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,600
So, Master Cromwell.

101
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,240
William Popely tells me I might find a use for you.

102
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,640
A man of many talents, he says.

103
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,800
A remarkable memory?

104
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,160
There's a technique, My Lord.

105
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,560
I learnt it in Italy.

106
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,840
How long were you abroad?

107
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,720
12 years.

108
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,760
Where are you from?

109
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,480
Putney. Left when I was a boy.

110
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,760
Your father?

111
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,800
Blacksmith.

112
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,640
Ah, at last!

113
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,960
A man born in a more lowly state than myself.

114
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,400
Hey...

115
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,700
- Bella!     - Eaten?

116
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,000
- Mm-hmm.  - Wine?

117
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,160
Why not?

118
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,160
I'm going to work for him - the Cardinal.

119
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,780
You know what they say in Italy?

120
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,600
"II principe bisogna sceglierlo."

121
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,520
- "You have to pick your prince."   - Doing what?

122
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,260
Whatever he wants.

123
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,920
We have enough.

124
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,120
I don't want to spend my life dealing in conveyances, Liz.

125
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,200
Whether this man's fence should be here or here...

126
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,680
You know what you're doing, I suppose.

127
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
At least, you always look as if you do.

128
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,160
Yeah, I do, don't I?

129
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,320
You're sweeter to look at than the Cardinal.

130
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,320
That's the smallest compliment a woman ever received.

131
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,680
What does our son say?

132
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,240
He...hopes you are well, hopes I am well,

133
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,800
hopes his lovely little sisters Anne and Grace are well.

134
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,720
He is well.

135
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
Terrible Latin.

136
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,280
Anne's the better scholar.

137
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,760
Anne, go and get your breakfast.

138
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,360
After I've Latin, I'd like to learn Greek.

139
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,120
Gregory has hardly any Greek.

140
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,480
What will London be like when that one's Lord Mayor?

141
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,520
From Germany.

142
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,680
It came packaged as something else. I almost sent the boy away.

143
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,640
- If you want to know...   - I don't want to know.

144
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,840
..it's Tyndale's New Testament, Liz.

145
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,080
You should read it for yourself.

146
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,920
It's in English - that's the point.

147
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,440
Not Latin.

148
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,000
How can that be heresy?

149
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,800
Read it and you'll see how you're misled.

150
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,960
No mention of nuns, monks, relics...

151
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,360
No mention of Popes.

152
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,480
My prayer book's good reading for me.

153
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,040
Your prayer book?

154
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,120
Grace, look at this.

155
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,640
Rafe?

156
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,460
Richard?

157
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,280
Oh...

158
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,240
- Late.           - Me, or your good self?

159
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,800
- You           - he's waiting.

160
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,160
The boatmen were drunk.

161
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,520
I'm surprised you didn't take an oar yourself.

162
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,840
You grew up at the river, didn't you?

163
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,640
God bless you.

164
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,840
Thanks!

165
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,080
Oh, the King sent for me this morning

166
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,720
exceptionally early.

167
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,320
What did he want?

168
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,440
Pity.

169
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,960
A son.

170
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,720
The King wants a son.

171
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,160
18 years of marriage, with no heir.

172
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,560
He's decided some sin must have been committed, to cause this curse.

173
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,000
Oh, God...

174
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,640
Where did you learn this?

175
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,000
At the docks, a little after I left home.

176
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,980
Earned a living from it, for a while.

177
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,800
Everyone thought they could beat a child.

178
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,040
What else should I know about you,

179
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,600
monstrous servant?

180
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,560
Once, in Italy, I held a snake for a bet.

181
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,800
Was it poisonous?

182
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,280
We didn't know - that was the point of the bet.

183
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,840
The sin?

184
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,080
Oh, yes, the sin.

185
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,800
I remember when they brought the Queen over from Spain

186
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,720
to marry Henry's brother, Prince Arthur.

187
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,200
16...

188
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,040
barely a word of English.

189
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,200
God, when she danced...

190
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,320
...her red hair slid over her shoulder...

191
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,040
God forgive you?

192
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,360
God forgive us all.

193
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,320
Then Arthur dies,

194
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,400
Henry decides he'll have his brother's widow for himself.

195
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,240
Katherine declares that she's still a virgin,

196
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,520
poor Arthur never having touched her.

197
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,800
Rome issues the dispensation

198
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,280
and any doubts anyone has...

199
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,080
But now?

200
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,880
Well, now, the Queen can't give the King a son.

201
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,200
So, now...

202
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,240
..the Queen must not have been a virgin, after all.

203
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,680
Henry says that he's lived all these years in an unlawful marriage.

204
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,920
Hence the sin.

205
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,840
So it's back to Rome, for an annulment.

206
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,040
She's blaming me, of course - Katherine.

207
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,740
She can't blame the king, so it's all my doing.

208
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,440
No matter that I've begged him not to proceed.

209
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,440
When she defeated the Scots, I heard she wanted to send

210
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,560
the Scottish King's head in a bag to Henry,

211
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,680
to cheer him up.

212
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,520
Well, she's a fighter.

213
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,760
Ha!

214
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,600
Perhaps you should teach me your three-card trick, hmm?

215
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,280
In case we both end up on the streets!

216
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,040
Unpack everything. Masters, I want kindling, dry kindling.

217
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,640
Get the fires lit. Stephen, find the kitchen.

218
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,600
Actually, see him in first. I need the bedding.

219
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,840
What... Who is that? Michael? Down, off. The horses, later.

220
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,000
We want the Cardinal in bed and warm.

221
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,480
Come on, come on, we're not done yet!

222
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,080
I asked if they had nutmeg or saffron

223
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,760
they looked at me as if I was speaking Greek.

224
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,680
I'll have to find a local supplier.

225
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,960
I shall pray for it.

226
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,960
Currently, I pray for the King and all his counsellors.

227
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,400
I pray for Queen Katherine and Lady Anne.

228
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,160
I pray for Thomas More, who hates me so.

229
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,580
I pray for a better harvest

230
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,720
and that the rains might stop.

231
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,600
I pray for everyone and everything.

232
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,040
It's only when I say to the Lord...

233
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,960
"Now, about Thomas Cromwell..."

234
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,480
..does God say to me,

235
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,320
"Wolsey, don't you know when to give up?"

236
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,160
Let me... Let me bless you.

237
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,760
This is what they've waited for

238
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,640
Suffolk, Norfolk, Boleyn.

239
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,800
They won't rest until they have my head.

240
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,080
You should leave me, Thomas.

241
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,360
Gardiner has.

242
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,360
Gardiner would.

243
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,760
Tom?

244
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,560
Safe journey home.

245
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,880
I'm going to leave.

246
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,200
He says he'll send me to the Lady Anne.

247
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,320
I think she'll like me well enough, don't you?

248
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,520
What's the point of staying here?

249
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,280
They're going to be rid of the old man.

250
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,840
It serves him right.

251
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,960
And Cromwell?

252
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,680
The lawyer? He'll go down with him.

253
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,640
Well... I say, "lawyer" -

254
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,780
who knows what he is?

255
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,670
He comes from nothing.

256
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,360
The old man brings him in

257
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,080
and in a few years, it's as if he's the one in charge...

258
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,520
..as if he has some hold over the Cardinal.

259
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,320
I heard he killed a man abroad and never made confession.

260
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,440
But that kind...

261
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,840
they always weep when they see the hangman.

262
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,000
I did, but...

263
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,440
..with things the way they are with Wolsey, I thought...

264
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,040
Thomas More is here.

265
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,600
Well, I expect you invited him too.

266
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,960
- Gracia.     - Prego.

267
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,960
Did you want to talk about me, Master More?

268
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,200
You can speak while I'm here, I have a thick skin.

269
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,360
No-one was talking of you.

270
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,480
Of the Cardinal, then?

271
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,840
Thomas, this is Monsieur Chapuys,

272
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,340
the Emperor's new ambassador here in London.

273
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,840
Monsieur Chapuys, my friend, Thomas Cromwell.

274
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,240
Enchanted.

275
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,960
I hardly know where I come from, myself.

276
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,680
If you want to speak half-secretly,

277
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,600
try Greek, Monsieur Chapuys.

278
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,320
My friend, you are looking at your herring as if you hate it.

279
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,400
- There's nothing wrong with the herring.   - Ah.

280
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,080
But of Cardinal Wolsey, I'll say only this

281
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,840
he has brought his fall on himself.

282
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,200
He's drawn all to himself - land, money and titles.

283
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,560
He's always had a greed for ruling over other men.

284
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,800
The Cardinal's a public man.

285
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,920
Would you have him shrink from a public role?

286
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,080
Well, I think it's a little late

287
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,400
to read the Cardinal a lesson in humility.

288
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,680
His real friends have read it long ago and been ignored.

289
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,760
And you count yourself a real friend, do you?

290
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,880
I'll tell him - and by the blood of Christ, Lord Chancellor,

291
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,040
he'll find it a consolation as he sits in exile

292
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,140
and wonders why you slander him to the King.

293
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,040
- Gentlemen... - No, let's have this straight.

294
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,520
I'm devoted to things of the spirit.

295
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,160
I care nothing for wealth.

296
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,560
So how is it I come back to London

297
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,240
and find you've become Lord Chancellor?

298
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,400
Lord Chancellor.

299
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,840
What's that?

300
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,240
A fucking accident?

301
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,180
You're no friend to the church, Thomas.

302
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,400
You're a friend to one priest only

303
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,000
and he's the most corrupt in Christendom.

304
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,360
You must give me the recipe for this sauce.

305
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,640
Thomas More is my old friend.

306
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,920
You shouldn't come here to bait him.

307
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,880
Am I not your friend too, Bonvisi?

308
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,280
You know you are.

309
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,960
And that's why I give you this advice.

310
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,160
The Cardinal is finished.

311
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,560
He'll go.

312
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,400
And then you will be without a master to protect you.

313
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,720
Leave him now.

314
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,000
Do you think it's true?

315
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,520
The mistake was being too proud?

316
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,380
I remember when he used to say,

317
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,600
"The King will do such and such."

318
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,240
And then it was, "We will do such-and-such."

319
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,680
Now, it's "This is what I will do."

320
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,360
No, no.

321
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,080
The mistake was making an enemy of Anne Boleyn.

322
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,640
But then, who knew how far she'd rise?

323
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,440
Thomas!

324
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,920
Of course, master. News from Rome.

325
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,960
The Emperor's troops have run wild in the city.

326
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,280
They're killing, raping...

327
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,000
Thomas More says they're roasting babies on spits.

328
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,760
Soldiers don't have time to eat babies. They're too busy stealing.

329
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,080
If the Emperor Charles had paid them once in a while...

330
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,560
They've taken the Pope prisoner.

331
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,320
What?

332
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,640
The Emperor is the Queen's nephew.

333
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,960
If he has the Pope, then the King's divorce petition is...

334
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,320
Yeah...

335
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,760
In every emergency,

336
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,280
look to see if there's some advantage for your prince, Thomas.

337
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,800
Ah, cherries.

338
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,920
How did I do that, I wonder?

339
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,960
Here, take.

340
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,960
Now, in this current emergency,

341
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,400
it will be to me that Pope Clement looks to...

342
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,080
well, keep Christendom together.

343
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,840
So, suppose if I were to travel to France

344
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,420
and gather together the cardinals in a council, you know,

345
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:40,000
to conduct the business of the church in the Pope's absence?

346
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,280
Now, if this business...

347
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,880
happened to include the King's private matter...

348
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,480
might we not rule on it?

349
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,960
And voila,

350
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,360
the King of England will be a bachelor.

351
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,360
What?

352
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,200
Not more gossip from the silk merchants?

353
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,920
Rumour is the King has moved from Mary Boleyn

354
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,600
to her flat-chested sister.

355
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,200
Anne?

356
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,340
She hasn't forgiven you for that business with Harry Percy.

357
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,680
- Well...  - Cavendish tells me she's sworn vengeance on you.

358
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,840
Poor chit of a girl.

359
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,040
The King will have her in his bed by summer.

360
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,640
By autumn, he'll tire of her and pension her off.

361
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,680
What are you doing?

362
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,280
For Gregory.

363
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,880
It's the same design Queen Katherine uses for the King's shirts.

364
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,340
Well, if I were her,

365
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,560
I'd leave the needle in.

366
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
I know you would.

367
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,680
Your sister was here today.

368
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,880
She asked again if you'd go and see him?

369
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,520
She said you'd hardly know him now. He's stopped drinking, settled down.

370
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,920
Grace, sweetheart,

371
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,840
will you keep away from the fire with those, eh?

372
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,120
They're your angel wings.

373
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,560
They're just supposed to be for Christmas.

374
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,600
I know.

375
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,360
All right, off you go.

376
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,880
Your own father, Thomas

377
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,000
and he's never seen the children.

378
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,400
Well, let's keep it that way.

379
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,360
Can I choose who I want to marry?

380
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,480
What?

381
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,480
Can I choose who I want to marry?

382
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,880
Within reason.

383
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,560
Then I choose Rafe.

384
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,600
- You...

385
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,920
Grace says I can't marry him because he's my cousin.

386
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,000
Well, Richard's your cousin, not Rafe.

387
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,280
Rafe is my ward.

388
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,620
That means Rafe's father asked me to take him in

389
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,960
and bring him up in business. Do you understand?

390
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,360
So I can choose Rafe?

391
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,960
If he'll wait for you.

392
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,880
Rafe?

393
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,760
She could do worse.

394
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,320
- I'm too warm.     - Oh.

395
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,800
Go back to bed, Grace, sweetheart.

396
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,600
Are you going to wear those angel wings all night?

397
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,200
Till I say my prayers.

398
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,080
Tell me when you're going.

399
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,520
Liz, I'm not going.

400
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,480
I'm not going to France with Wolsey, remember?

401
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,920
Go back to bed, Liz.

402
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,400
- Hello, Francis.   - Sir.

403
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,280
Anyone asks for me, I'm not here.

404
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,760
Yes, Master Cromwell.

405
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:52,400
The words of the scripture are as honey to me.

406
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,720
I am drunk on the word of God.

407
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,380
I've read Tyndale's gospel.

408
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,570
Masses, fasting, vigils,

409
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,760
pardons out of purgatory...

410
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,880
all useless.

411
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,040
This is revealed to me.

412
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,080
For Christ's sake, man, do you think you can crawl out of your hole

413
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,840
because Cardinal Wolsey is away?

414
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,040
All that means is that Gardiner and More

415
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,400
have a free hand to pursue us,

416
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,960
to brand us heretics.

417
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,520
Wolsey protects us.

418
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,560
Wolsey?

419
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,200
Wolsey burns bibles.

420
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,520
More will burn men.

421
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,520
I met with Tyndale in Germany...

422
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,520
Oh, I...

423
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,920
I don't want to know where Tyndale is.

424
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Gentlemen...

425
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,560
I'm going to go to Rome and see His Holiness.

426
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,480
I know I can bring him over to our way of thinking.

427
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,760
What is it?

428
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,600
Say it.

429
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,960
She...

430
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,240
She said she was tired this morning, after you left.

431
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,600
She wouldn't eat anything, then...

432
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,040
she started shaking.

433
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,160
We called for the priest around two.

434
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,960
She said she held a snake in Italy,

435
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,120
but the priest said that was just the fever talking.

436
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,600
He couldn't wait to get away.

437
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,240
Did she, er...

438
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,320
Did she leave any message?

439
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,200
For me?

440
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,000
Just kept saying she was thirsty.

441
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,520
It's the girls.

442
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,180
Come on, come on!

443
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,760
Come on, come on!

444
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,960
Stay with me. Come on, come on, wake up, darling.

445
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,840
Come on, come on. Can you hear me, darling?

446
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,860
Can you hear me? Come on.

447
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,590
Come on, please, please...

448
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,120
Wake up, open your eyes.

449
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,400
Open your eyes, please, darling.

450
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,960
Please, come on...

451
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,080
Come on, come on, come on, please...

452
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,320
Please, open your eyes, darling, come on, come on...

453
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,240
Don't, don't.

454
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,440
- Please...come on...No...Please...

455
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,400
Mercy, mercy, mercy...

456
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,800
Don't.

457
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,880
It's all right.

458
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,440
It's all right.

459
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,240
Go. Go now.

460
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,080
Everybody said it was back.

461
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,240
This...

462
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,840
..sweating sickness.

463
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,560
I should have sent them to the country.

464
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,760
Liz wouldn't have let them go.

465
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,320
Anne cried every time you were away.

466
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,960
Did she?

467
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,200
Anne did?

468
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,960
John and I can stay with you for a while.

469
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,720
Look after the household, until you're...

470
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,680
She wanted to learn Greek.

471
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,160
Hey...

472
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,200
Oh! Ugh!

473
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,840
Where've you been?

474
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,040
You look like a foreigner.

475
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,080
I am a foreigner.

476
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,640
Where'd you go?

477
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,200
Here and there.

478
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,320
Working for Wolsey now, I hear.

479
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,720
I'm a lawyer.

480
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,760
Lawyer?

481
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,000
You were always a talker.

482
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,280
Slap in the mouth couldn't cure you.

483
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,680
God knows you tried.

484
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,320
Law?

485
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,600
If it wasn't for the law, I'd be a lord.

486
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,560
Cromwells had money.

487
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,300
We had estates.

488
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,040
Thieved off us -

489
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,280
by lawyers.

490
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,760
Suppose you don't admit to me, now, do you?

491
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,600
Suppose you hoped I'd be dead.

492
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,760
Why are you here?

493
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,920
My wife told me I should come see you.

494
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,040
Well, now you have.

495
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,280
Yeah.

496
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,920
What is it?

497
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,920
Master, I have a question to put to you.

498
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,480
My father is dead and you...

499
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,160
You are my father now.

500
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,720
So, shall I change my name to yours?

501
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,440
Your father?

502
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,120
Every day I light a candle for him.

503
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,920
Does that comfort you?

504
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,120
I don't know.

505
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,080
Well, this...

506
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,000
This comforts me.

507
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,800
Richard Cromwell.

508
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,920
Thank you.

509
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,360
- If...    - Go, go on, get out. Get out.

510
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,640
Ugh!

511
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,200
Agh! Oh!

512
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,920
Now, get up!

513
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,280
Get up!

514
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,360
Come on, boy! Let me see you stand on your feet!

515
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,880
Get up!

516
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,880
- Agh!     - Get up!

517
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,080
You'll hear the King's reception of me was cool.

518
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,520
It's only partly true.

519
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,200
Still, my mission could not be described

520
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,080
as an over-whelming success.

521
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,760
The cardinals wouldn't meet me.

522
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,760
They said it was too hot to travel south.

523
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,720
So...what next?

524
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,040
A new plan. A Legatine Court.

525
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,880
We ask the Pope to send his envoy to act in his name

526
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,320
and rule here in England,

527
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,600
on the validity of the King's marriage to Katherine.

528
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,000
Hm? Huh?

529
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,080
Er...

530
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,240
When you were in France...

531
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,920
..my wife and daughters died.

532
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,400
Oh, Tom...

533
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,400
Whom the Lord loveth...

534
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,080
Master Cromwell?

535
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,520
Thomas Cromwell, reading a prayer book?

536
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,440
Now I know how bad things are.

537
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,320
How is he?

538
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,200
He asks after you...

539
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,160
the minute you've gone.

540
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,160
Worries you'll fall in the road.

541
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,240
Have you an inventory for York Place, George?

542
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,920
What?

543
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,080
York Place. I'll take it to her.

544
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,720
To the Lady Anne?

545
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,960
Mm-hmm.

546
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,800
Well, Mark?

547
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,400
You're hard at study.

548
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,040
How are you?

549
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,080
It must feel strange, being back at York Place -

550
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,320
with the world so altered?

551
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,600
No.

552
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,680
You don't miss My Lord Cardinal?

553
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,720
No.

554
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,880
Well, you might not think of us, Mark, but...

555
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:31,960
we think of you.

556
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,320
Pourquoi! Don't let him out!

557
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,840
Lady Anne.

558
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,920
Vous etes gentil.

559
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,380
Allors...

560
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,050
Master...

561
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,720
Cremuel?

562
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,840
You have your inventories?

563
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,280
Thank you for this.

564
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,680
Since My Lord Cardinal's reduction,

565
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,080
have you seen much progress in your cause?

566
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,920
He's the only man in England who can obtain for you what you need.

567
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,040
Very well.

568
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,140
Make his case. You have five minutes.

569
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,320
Otherwise, I can see you're really busy.

570
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,560
The Cardinal's the only man who can deliver an annulment from the Pope.

571
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,080
He's the only man who can deliver the King's conscience -

572
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,760
and deliver it clean.

573
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,240
If the King wants it

574
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,240
and according to you, the Cardinal,

575
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,080
formerly the chief subject of the kingdom, wants it...

576
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,640
Then I must say, Master Cremuel

577
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,280
it's all taking a marvellous long while to come to pass.

578
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,280
And she's not getting any younger.

579
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,900
No-one is more distressed than the Cardinal

580
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,040
that the King cannot have his heart's desire,

581
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,080
which is ever the Cardinal's desire too.

582
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,920
He knows that all the King's subjects

583
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,920
- repose their hopes in you, for an heir to the throne...  - Very nice.

584
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,480
Very nice, Master Cremuel.

585
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,240
But try again.

586
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,600
One thing.

587
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,400
One simple thing we asked of the Cardinal

588
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,680
- and he would not.    - You know it wasn't simple.

589
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,320
Well, perhaps I am a simple person.

590
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,000
Do you feel I am?

591
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,800
You may be. I hardly know you.

592
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,440
You may go.

593
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,120
Lady Mary.

594
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,040
God, I thought she would slap you.

595
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,840
My sister likes a good fight.

596
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,100
Come again.

597
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,160
I can't wait!

598
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,920
Your sister can, I think.

599
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,680
Oh, she knows how to wait.

600
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,760
So I hear.

601
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,040
They say she and the King...

602
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,200
..still haven't. It's true.

603
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,640
She lets him pull down her shift and kiss her breasts.

604
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,280
Good man, if he can find them.

605
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,920
Lady Mary, Lady Anne wants you.

606
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,520
Oh, by the saints!

607
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,880
I need a seat in Parliament again.

608
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,160
Why?

609
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,360
Because if I'm not there to speak for the Cardinal,

610
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,640
they'll kill him.

611
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,560
Cromwell, I am content you are a burgess in the Parliament.

612
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,520
My Lord.

613
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,120
I spoke to the King for you and he is also content.

614
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,280
You will take his instructions in the Commons - and mine.

615
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,120
Will they be the same, My Lord?

616
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,640
God damn it, Cromwell...

617
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,840
Why are you such a...

618
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:57,920
person?

619
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,200
It's not as if you can afford to be.

620
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,080
Smile away!

621
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,080
The King will grant you an audience,

622
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,720
but he is preparing a quarrel against you, master.

623
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,120
Oh, yes!

624
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,400
He has a long memory and well remembers

625
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,440
when you were a burgess in the Parliament before this -

626
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,800
and how you spoke against his war.

627
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,720
I hope he doesn't think still of invading France.

628
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,320
God damn you! What Englishman doesn't?

629
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,800
We own France!

630
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,520
We have a right to take back our own!

631
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,700
Mind you...

632
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,690
You're right.

633
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:53,480
We can't win.

634
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,280
But we have to fight anyway.

635
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,720
That was what was wrong with Wolsey

636
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,560
always at the treaty table.

637
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,520
How can a butcher's son understand...

638
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,880
La gloire?

639
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,280
Are you a butcher's son?

640
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,140
Blacksmith's.

641
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:13,650
Are you really?

642
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:14,960
Shoe a horse?

643
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:18,080
If I were put to it - I was a soldier, myself.

644
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,280
Were you?

645
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,960
Were you?

646
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,080
Not with any English army, I'll be bound.

647
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:34,480
I knew there was something about you that I didn't like,

648
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,360
but I couldn't put my finger on it.

649
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,800
Where were you?

650
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,320
Garigliano.

651
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,160
With?

652
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,160
- The French.    - Huh!

653
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,280
- Wrong side, lad.      - I noticed.

654
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,800
Longbow-man?

655
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,760
Now and then. Bit on the short side.

656
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,240
Me too.

657
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,800
The King can draw a bow.

658
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,220
Very nice.

659
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,640
Got the arm.

660
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,720
My Lord,

661
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:10,040
Esher is not suitable for My Lord Cardinal.

662
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,200
He's willing to travel to his palace at Winchester.

663
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,000
Oh, I bet he is.

664
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,420
Nice and close to the King!

665
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,640
Don't take us for fools.

666
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,200
Tell your cardinal that he had his last chance, with his court,

667
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,760
here in this very building!

668
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,600
Tell him to go north.

669
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,320
He's not ready to go north.

670
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,920
I want him north.

671
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,880
Tell him, Norfolk wants him on the road and away from here...

672
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,760
..and tell him...

673
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,820
..if he doesn't,

674
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,720
I'll come to him

675
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,880
and I'll tear him with my teeth.

676
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,960
My Lord, may I substitute the word "bite" for "tear"?

677
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,200
Substitute nothing, you...

678
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,560
..you nobody.

679
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,960
For 20 years,

680
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,720
I have been your true wife.

681
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,800
And by me, you have had many children...

682
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,480
...although it pleased God to call them from this world

683
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,440
which was no fault of mine.

684
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,400
And when you had me first -

685
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,880
as God is my witness, I was a true maid,

686
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,520
without touch of man.

687
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,480
And whether this is true or no,

688
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,960
I put to your conscience.

689
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:00,120
On Prince Arthur's wedding night, myself and the Earl of Oxford

690
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,640
took the prince to Queen Katherine's chambers

691
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,780
and we were there when he climbed into bed beside her.

692
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,920
Next morning, he comes out again, says he's thirsty

693
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,040
and asks for some ale, because, he said...

694
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,600
"Last night I was in Spain!"

695
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,800
The Queen was Spanish, you see?

696
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,400
It would be a poor sort of bridegroom

697
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,480
who'd come out in the morning and say,

698
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,560
"Good day, masters. Nothing done!"

699
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,800
He was 15, he was boasting.

700
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,760
I believe Katherine.

701
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,680
Believe nobody.

702
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,920
You're late, Stephen. They're almost done for the day.

703
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,280
It doesn't matter.

704
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,080
Why doesn't it matter?

705
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,960
News from one of my men in Rome.

706
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,040
Pope Clement is preparing to sign a treaty with the Emperor.

707
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,600
Oh...

708
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,560
Your boy doesn't understand.

709
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,760
The Emperor won't take kindly to the Pope helping

710
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,640
to have his aunt cast off the throne.

711
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,800
I don't think your papal envoy in there

712
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,400
is likely to give the King what he wants, do you?

713
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,200
And when he doesn't,

714
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,000
Wolsey will be finished.

715
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,040
And then I'll feel sorry for you.

716
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,800
Except you won't.

717
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,120
Except I won't.

718
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,240
Cromwell? How's your fat priest?

719
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,640
How is...?

720
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,560
He cannot be well till he has Your Majesty's favour.

721
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,720
The list of charges against him grows every day.

722
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,720
Saving Your Majesty, there's an answer to each one

723
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,400
and given a hearing, we'd make them.

724
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,480
Not today.

725
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,160
Suffolk wants to go hunting.

726
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:03,360
We usually say, we gentlemen, that the hunt prepares us for war.

727
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,800
Which brings us to a sticky point, Master Cromwell.

728
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,080
It does, indeed.

729
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:16,640
You said, in Parliament, in a speech, some six years ago,

730
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,320
that I could not afford a war.

731
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,000
Wars are not affordable things.

732
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,760
When I went into France,

733
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:25,040
I captured the town of Therouanne, which you called...

734
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:28,080
- A dog-hole, Majesty.   - How could you say so?

735
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,480
Er... I've been there.

736
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,040
So have I - at the head of an army!

737
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,720
You told me I could not lead my own troops!

738
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,720
You told me if I was taken prisoner,

739
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,840
the ransom would bankrupt the country! So, what do you want?

740
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,600
You want a king to huddle indoors, like a sick girl?

741
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,080
That would be ideal, for fiscal purposes.

742
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,840
A strong man acts within that which constrains him.

743
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,560
What constrains me?

744
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,320
Distance.

745
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,520
When Your Majesty's ancestors fought in France,

746
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,280
they held whole provinces.

747
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:12,000
From there, they could supply, they could provision.

748
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,560
Now we have only Calais,

749
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,160
how can we support an army in the interior?

750
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,280
So next time we go into France,

751
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:20,400
we'll need a sea coast.

752
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,160
- Of course.Normandy, Brittany.

753
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,200
Master Cromwell,

754
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,960
your reputation is bad.

755
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,760
You don't defend yourself?

756
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,120
Your Majesty can form your own opinions.

757
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:44,960
I can.

758
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,240
I will.

759
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,280
Are we to paint out the Cardinal's coat of arms?

760
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,120
No.

761
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,640
Paint it again.

762
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,240
Paint it brighter.

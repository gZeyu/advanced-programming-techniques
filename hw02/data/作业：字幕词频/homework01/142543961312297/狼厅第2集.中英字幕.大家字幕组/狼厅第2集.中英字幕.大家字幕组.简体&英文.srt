第1季 第2集

9
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,580
谢谢
Thank you.

10
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,550
我拒绝谈论红衣主教之事
I can't talk about the Cardinal.

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,760
-陛下... -不行 你听不明白吗?
-Your Majesty... -No. Don't you understand?

12
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,520
这件事根本没有回旋的余地
I can't talk about him.

13
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,880
何必又碰一鼻子灰
Here again.

14
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,440
噢 史蒂芬
Stephen.

15
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,970
等了很长时间吧?
You been waiting long?

16
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,510
没等他 我只是沉浸在国王要和我见面的恩典中无法自拔
Well, I was under the impression I had an interview with the King.

17
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,020
再一次
Again.

18
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,440
没错 再一次
Again.

19
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:39,880
是啊
Yes.

20
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,740
捉摸不透啊 是吧?
Elusive, isn't he?

21
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,420
你还觉得你自己很受宠吗?
Did you think yourself a special favourite?

22
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,990
一只猫生了一窝幼崽
A cat has had her litter,

23
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,040
就在我的房间这里
here, in my rooms.

24
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,610
瞧你哟!
Look at it!

25
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,660
漆黑如恶魔撒旦
Black as the devil,

26
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,200
就在我的床下 它出世了
born right here, under my very bed.

27
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,520
你说这是不是我们这次远行的凶兆呢?
How's that for a bad omen before a journey?

28
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,920
您不应该离开
You shouldn't leave.

29
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,510
托马斯 当诺尔福克威胁说要撕碎我的时候...
Merry Thomas, when Norfolk threatens to bite...

30
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,240
也由不得我不离开了
.. it's time to be gone.

31
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,500
您是不会喜爱北方的
You won't like the north.

32
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,440
我可是约克的大主教
I am the Archbishop of York.

33
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,550
虽如此 但您从未到过北方 而我去过
Yes, but you've never been. I have.

34
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,330
那里民风彪悍 荒蛮未开
Filthy weather, people, morals.

35
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,320
但国王想要我远离啊
The King wants me gone.

36
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,670
他想让我蒙羞
He wants to humiliate me.

37
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,680
也觉得这算是给罗马教皇一个警告
Thinks it sends a sharp message to the Pope.

38
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,000
我就像凯瑟琳王后一样...
I feel like Katherine...

39
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,170
被罢黜了
.. cast off.

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,130
但依然敬爱他
But still, I love him.

41
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,540
我们还能做什么呢?
What will we do?

42
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,510
收买人心
Bribe people.

43
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,280
您还有土地
You still have land.

44
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,730
即使国王查抄了您的全部身家 百姓仍会自问
Even if the King takes everything you have, people will ask themselves,

45
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,360
"他真的会轻易将教会的所属物交出吗？"
"Can he truly give what belongs to the church?"

46
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,030
除非是经过您的首肯 不然他们的头衔也名不正言不顺
No-one will be sure of their title unless you confirm it.

47
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,810
所以主人您仍然...
So you see, my Lord, you still...

48
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,380
- 您仍然有王牌在手  - 确实如此
- You still have cards in your hand. - Yes.

49
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,450
但是 说起来...
And after all...

50
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,830
欲加之罪 何患无辞...
.. if he wants to bring a treason...

51
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,520
如果国王意欲将叛国罪强加于您
If the King meant to charge you with treason,

52
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,430
- 您现在怕是早已在象牙塔里了 不是吗?  - 没错
- you'd be in the tower now, wouldn't you?       - Yes.

53
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,720
国王仍牵挂您
He misses you.

54
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,410
您会重获圣宠的
You'll return to favour.

55
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,640
一条新生命
New life,

56
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,080
诞生在您的床下
born under your very bed?

57
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,240
要我说 这是大吉之兆
Well... I'd read that as a good omen.

58
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,800
呵呵 真是巧舌如簧呢
Ah, you lawyer.

59
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,680
看看谁在圣诞节归来了
Look who's back for Christmas.

60
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,680
这是什么 格雷戈里 总算长胡子了？
What's this, Gregory,some kind of beard?

61
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,180
我在培根的反面 可见过更多的毛
Think I've seen more hair on a side of bacon.

62
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,320
格雷戈里说我们能在大厅里遛狗
Gregory says we can race his dogs up and down the hall.

63
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,900
- 父亲大人  - 欢迎回家 格雷戈里
- Father.   - Welcome home, Gregory.

64
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,400
那是设计完美的棋局
That was a calculation.

65
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,270
可不是随意摆的
It wasn't just where I dropped them.

66
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,760
对不起
Sorry.

67
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,760
您还记得有一年圣诞节
Do you remember that one Christmas

68
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,030
我们的露天晚会上见到了一个巨人吗
when we had the giant in the pageant?

69
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,040
在教区里 我记得
Here in the parish? I do.

70
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,210
"我是个巨人"
"I am a giant."

71
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,090
"我叫马林斯派克"
"My name is Marlinspike."

72
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,070
约翰娜姑母说我们今年不举办主显节宴会了
Aunt Johane says we won't have the Epiphany Feast this year.

73
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,530
没办法
We can't.

74
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,600
没人会赴约的
No-one would come.

75
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,770
因为大主教被罢黜了?
Because of the Cardinal's disgrace?

76
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,040
剑桥的那帮书呆子笑话我的灵缇犬
People in Cambridge are laughing at my greyhounds.

77
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,350
为什么?
Why?

78
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,210
因为它们是黑色的
Because they're black.

79
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,040
但它们本应是白色的
They should be white.

80
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,960
他们说 "只有恶霸才会养能在夜里潜行的黑土狗"
They say, "Only felons have dogs that you can't see at night."

81
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,710
呵呵
Aha.

82
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,970
听着
Look.

83
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,000
"我是个巨人"
"I am a giant.

84
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,380
"我的名字是马林斯派克"
"My name is Marlinspike."

85
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,740
"额啊啊啊啊啊！"
"Grrrr!"

86
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,640
我的狗会伤害这猫的
The dogs will kill it.

87
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,960
你觉得他怕我么?
Do you think he's afraid of me?

88
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,590
为什么要怕你?
Why should he be?

89
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,620
我不清楚
I don't know.

90
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,350
和其他人在一起的时候 他看起来很活跃...
With everybody else,he seems so lively...

91
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,450
而当他看见我的时候...
but when he sees me...

92
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,560
你是个慈爱的父亲
You're a kind father.

93
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,760
也许有点太过溺爱 都惯坏了他
Too much so, I think. You spoil him.

94
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,870
莉兹也经常这么说
That's what Liz always said.

95
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,270
当莉兹和我还是小女孩的时候 我们一无所有
Liz and I had nothing when we were girls.

96
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,040
没有梳子 更别提镜子
Not a comb. Never had a mirror.

97
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,870
我记得他还只是一个襁褓中的婴儿时
I remember when he was a baby and I used to warm his shirt

98
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,200
我经常拿着他的衬衣站在火炉旁烤暖和
for him in front of the fire.

99
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,730
莉兹会跟我说 "别这样 他都被你宠坏了"
Liz would say "Don't do that. He'll expect it every day."

100
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,690
屋里有个婴儿哭闹的日子是一去不复返了
Seems such a long time since there was a baby in the house.

101
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,000
别盯着我看
Don't look at me.

102
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:43,360
难道约翰 威廉姆森没有同你行夫妻之事吗?
Does John Williamson not do his duty by you?

103
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,680
和他同房非我所愿
His duty's not my pleasure.

104
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,580
真不该嘴贱提这事
There's a conversation I shouldn't have had.

105
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,360
我是里奥斯利
Wriothesley.

106
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,600
应该这么拼...
It's spelled W-R-I-O-T- ...

107
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,960
呃...叫我里斯利就好
Just call me Risley.

108
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,880
里斯利学士 我们一直在找前途光明的小伙子
Master Risley, we're always looking for bright young men.

109
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,740
- 你曾替主教效过力吧？ - 是的 先生
-You worked for the Cardinal, I think? -Yes, sir.

110
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,950
但又去跟了史蒂芬 伽迪纳？
But then left with Stephen Gardiner?

111
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,570
只是帮他管帐而已
I'm his clerk.

112
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,770
并不占用我的全部时间
But it doesn't occupy all my time

113
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,740
我一直想有机会能学习经商之道 先生
and I'm keen to learn something of business, sir.

114
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,550
呵呵 我们奥斯汀兄弟会 一直都忙着做买卖 是不 孩子们
Oh, we're all business here at Austin Friars... aren't we, boys?

115
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,520
你早知道伽迪纳 会派他来监视我们的吧
You know Gardiner will have sent him here to spy on us.

116
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,190
他看起来还挺有礼貌的
Well, he seems obliging.

117
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,800
也许我们可以试试反间计
Perhaps we could send him back to spy on Gardiner.

118
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,270
他怎么样了
How's he been?

119
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,550
他一直在鞭笞自己？
He's whipping himself?

120
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,360
几个修道士给他的
The monks who come to him brought it.

121
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,120
我的上帝啊！
Body of Christ.

122
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,750
这些到底是谁做的
Who makes these things?

123
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,520
能将荆棘和马鬃系在一起
Who ties a thorn to horse hair?

124
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,810
做这玩意儿真是太屈才了
People ought to be found better jobs.

125
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,120
决定了 我们要赶紧带他离开这
That settles it, we have to get him out of here.

126
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,000
天呐
Oh, oh, God.

127
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,150
在约克郡他的处境会好很多
He'd be better off in Yorkshire.

128
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,420
但我们会承受什么代价呢
But how would we pay for it?

129
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,510
不过要是你能见到国王...
If only you would see the King...

130
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,830
帮我传个口信给沃尔西 好吗
Take a message for me to Wolsey, will you?

131
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,350
有个布里多尼[法国地名]的商人抱怨说 八年前他的船
There's a Breton merchant who's complaining that his ship

132
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,290
被没收了 至今尚未得到赔偿
was seized eight years ago and he still hasn't received compensation.

133
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,060
当时的笔录文件找不到了
No-one can find the paper work.

134
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,190
我记得这是主教当时负责的案子
The Cardinal would have handled the case.

135
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,840
- 你觉得他还记得吗   - 他一定记得
- Do you think he'll remember it?  - I'm sure he will.

136
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,640
应该是那艘舱室中满载着
That'll be the one with powdered pearls for ballast

137
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,440
珍珠粉还藏有独角兽角的船
and unicorns' horns in its hold.

138
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,970
是 就是那艘船
Yes, that'll be the one.

139
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,770
陛下 如果这件案子有疑点的话 我可以跟进案情吗
If the case is in doubt, sir, may I look into it?

140
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,260
我不认为你有这个资格
I don't think you have a locus standi in the matter.

141
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,760
亨利 让他去吧
God, let him, Harry.

142
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,210
等这家伙结案了 那个布里多尼人可还要付大笔酬谢费的
By the time this fellow's finished, the Breton'll be paying you.

143
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
说些为你好的话
I'll say this for you.

144
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,380
你是主教的附属品
You stick by your man.

145
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,210
除了主教的恩情 我一无所有
I never had anything but kindness from the Cardinal.

146
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,140
你没有别的依靠了？
You have no other master?

147
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,520
一千英镑?
1,000 pounds?

148
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,920
不要说出去
Don't tell anyone.

149
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,420
我只能帮到这儿了
It's the best I can do.

150
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,110
接受我的好意去吧
Take it with my blessing.

151
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,290
也请他为我祈祷
And ask him to pray for me.

152
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,600
我无时无刻不在想念着约克大主教
Every day, I miss the Cardinal of York.

153
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,500
一个能从国王那里拿到一千英镑的人...
A man who can get ￡1,000 from the King...

154
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,740
噢 比起过去十年他亏欠主教的 还不到九牛一毛
Oh, it's only a tenth of what he's owed the Cardinal for over a decade.

155
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,190
花这点钱就罢黜了一个红衣主教 对他很值了
And not so much when you have a cardinal to move.

156
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,220
你自己又倒贴了多少进去呢
How much of your own money will you put into this?

157
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,300
帐不是这么算的
Some debts are not to be reckoned.

158
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,610
我最近倒是听到了关于某个你认识的人的流言
I heard a rumour recently about someone you know.

159
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,960
托马斯 怀特
Thomas Wyatt.

160
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,540
怀特和安妮夫人
Wyatt and the Lady Anne.

161
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,220
老生常谈了
It's an old story.

162
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,080
老生常谈吗 那国王怎么从未听过这个故事?
If it's such an old story, why hasn't the King heard it?

163
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,680
也许经国治世之道 就是明白何时充耳不闻
Part of the art of ruling, perhaps. Know when to shut your ears.

164
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,170
英国人可真是奇怪
Aren't the English odd?

165
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,910
谁说不是呢
Christ, aren't they?!

166
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,480
哈
Hmm.

167
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,990
不过你是懂的吧？
But you understand, I think?

168
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,820
她对你感兴趣
She interests you?

169
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,760
一个安妮都能成为王后的混乱世界里
A world where Anne can be queen

170
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,150
那克伦威尔能成为...？
is a world where Cromwell can be...?

171
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,870
亨顿和罗伊斯顿 亨廷顿 彼得伯勒（英国东部城市）
Hendon and Royston, Huntingdon, Peterborough.

172
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,390
我已经让车马辎重现行 一切都会为你打点好的
I've sent riders on ahead so everything will be ready for you.

173
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,710
这只是战术性撤退
This is a tactical retreat.

174
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,000
并不是投降
Not a surrender.

175
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,000
想赢回亨利的重用 安妮夫人才是关键
Lady Anne is the key to winning back Henry.

176
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,060
嗯..
Mm-hm..

177
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,830
汤姆 你要想办法赢得她的信任
Find a way into her confidence, Tom.

178
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,230
想办法哄她开心
Work a device to please her.

179
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,590
唯一能让安妮夫人开心的办法 就是为她戴上英格兰王后的宝冠
The only way to please that lady is to crown her Queen of England.

180
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,580
- 你会到北边来吗？ - 嗯哼
- Will you come north?  - Mm-hm.

181
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,530
只要国王传召您回来 我会亲身去接您回来 他一定会的
I'll come and fetch you, as soon as he summons you back. And he will.

182
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,040
上帝保佑你...
God bless you...

183
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:43,180
我挚爱的克伦威尔
mine own entirely beloved Cromwell.

184
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,640
托马斯？
Thomas?

185
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,610
我离开之后再看
Oh, er, when I'm gone.

186
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,300
把主教宫殿里的所有东西都搬走
I want the whole of the Archbishop's palace scrubbed out.

187
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,940
大人只习惯睡自己的床
My lord will be bringing his own bed.

188
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,160
厨房员工从国王近侍中挑选
Draft in kitchen staff from the King's Arms.

189
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,910
算了 还是我亲自去吧
I think I should go myself.

190
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,490
不不 我们可以做好的
No, we can do it.

191
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,200
好吧 检查...帮我拿一下
Well, check... Can you take this?

192
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,960
去检查下马厩
Check the stabling.

193
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,400
再请些乐师来
And get in musicians.

194
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:47,240
上次我经过时 那还有些柴垛还是猪圈什么的
Last time I passed through, there were some pigsties

195
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,300
还有一些不应该存在于宫殿之内的东西
or something against the palace wall.

196
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,400
- 看看是谁的 打点一下 全部清除   - 先生...
- Find the owner, pay him off, knock 'em down.  -Sir...

197
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,890
是时候让主教离开了
It's time to let the cardinal go.

198
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,750
记得我们初次见面时
You know the first time we met,

199
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,610
你还是个年轻的学生
was when you were a young student.

200
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,000
- 在哪来着？ - 兰贝斯宫
- Where was this?  - Lambeth Palace.

201
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,110
我叔叔约翰 曾是那里的厨师
My uncle John was the cook there

202
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,800
我在那儿也做过几天帮工
and I worked some days in the kitchens.

203
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,040
有一次是为你服务的
I served you once.

204
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,790
我都没什么印象了
I don't think so.

205
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,500
我记得有天晚上 我们在踢球
I remember, one evening we were playing football

206
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,710
突然 我听到有人在演奏竖笛...
and I heard a recorder playing...

207
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,170
我的另一位客人
Ah, my other guest...

208
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,260
你先抱着...
Now, you carry on...

209
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,790
亨利 别打扰伽迪纳大人
Now, Henry, leave Master Gardiner alone.

210
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,640
跟我回屋里面去 走吧 快点
You come along to the house. Come on, come on.

211
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,070
走吧 快进屋里
Let's go, let's go to the house.

212
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,030
好了好了
There.

213
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,490
关于里奥斯利学士...
About Master Wriothesley...

214
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,780
也祝你晚上好 史蒂芬
And a good evening to you, Stephen.

215
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,280
跟我提个醒 他是为我干活还是你?
Remind me, is he working for me, or for you?

216
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,630
我觉得他是你的人
For you, I would have thought?

217
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,460
那他为什么总在你家出没?
Then why is he always at your house?

218
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,920
他又不是学徒
Well, he's not a bound apprentice.

219
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,680
他想来就来 想走就走
He can come and go as he pleases.

220
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,450
我猜他想发大财
He thinks he'll make his fortune, I suppose.

221
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,420
大家都知道你富甲一方
Everyone knows money sticks to your hands.

222
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,860
他想从你这个...不管你怎么称呼自己...
He wants to know what he can learn from...

223
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,720
学到点小花招
whatever it is you call yourself these days.

224
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,000
我只是一个普通人而已
A person.

225
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,680
诺尔福克公爵说我只是一个普通人
The Duke of Norfolk says I'm a person.

226
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,550
那个就是他的傻儿子吗?
Is that his fool?

227
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:50,410
他本该是从教堂屋顶摔下来 头先着地
He's supposed to have fallen off a church roof and landed on his head.

228
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,570
- "本该是"?  C 如果那件事不是意外的话 就更让人糟心了
- Supposed to?  - It would be just like More to keep a fool who wasn't.

229
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,320
只会让人愈加尴尬
Just to embarrass people.

230
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,160
亨利 帕丁森 今晚好像特别激动呢
Henry Pattinson is excitable tonight.

231
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,710
希望他吃的别那么油腻
I hope his diet has not been too rich.

232
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,730
我就不担心油腻的问题...
No anxieties on that score...

233
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:22,400
他们说汀代尔在汉堡[德国城市]一直在被监视着
Tyndale has been sighted in Hamburg, they say.

234
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,270
如果你看到他 你能认出来吧
You'd know him, if you saw him, I suppose?

235
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,280
你也一样吧
So would you, I suppose?

236
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,150
我希望能找到个办法对付他
I hope to get the means to proceed against him

237
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,600
针对他书里的那些反叛言论
for sedition in his writing.

238
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,210
你真的在汀代尔的书中看到了反叛言论吗
Have you found sedition in Tyndale's writing?

239
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,030
很好
Very good.

240
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,760
你听见了吗 史蒂芬
You hear that, Stephen?

241
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,210
无名小律师才会说 "我读了汀代尔的书
A lesser lawyer would have said, "I have read Tyndale,

242
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,410
没发现什么不对劲的地方呀"
"and I find no fault there."

243
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,280
但托马斯可没有这么好骗哦
But Thomas will not be tripped, will he?

244
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,880
我承认 我读过汀代尔的书
Well, I admit, I have read Tyndale.

245
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,280
还逐字推敲了他那所谓的译文
I have picked apart his so-called translations.

246
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,660
我也读过路德的书[马丁 路德 德国基督神学家]
I have also read Luther.

247
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,600
路德就是坨翔

248
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,900
他的嘴就像菊花一样 屎臭世间

249
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,220
你的拉丁语说的非常优雅
You have such a pretty way with Latin.

250
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,370
那么 "近墨者黑"
So, "He that toucheth pitch shall be defiled."

251
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,440
除非此人是托马斯 莫尔
Unless his name is Thomas More.

252
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,410
呵 沃尔西总说你是《圣经》的狂热崇拜者
There you are, Wolsey always told me you were a man of the Bible.

253
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,150
托马斯 克伦威尔 你为什么没有再娶妻了呢
Thomas Cromwell, why don't you marry again?

254
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,800
没人看得上我 爱丽丝夫人
No-one will have me, Lady Alice.

255
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,270
胡说 你的主人也许是垮台了 但你并不穷啊
Nonsense. Your master may be down, but you're not poor.

256
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,080
而且你的一切现在都还算井然有序 不是吗
And you've got everything below in good working order, haven't you?

257
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,290
爱丽丝! 我跟你说喝酒时要注意什么来着?
Alice! What have I told you about drinking wine?

258
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,830
你都喝的红光满面了!
Your nose is glowing!

259
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,190
我为什么要带你去威斯敏斯特来着
Why am I bringing you to Westminster?

260
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,920
我要去见安妮夫人
I'm off to see Lady Anne.

261
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,760
你之前可没这么说
You didn't say so.

262
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,450
我不会把所有计划都告诉你的 史蒂芬
I can't tell you all my plans, Stephen.

263
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,750
不然年轻的里奥谢思利 可就没事做了
What would young Wriothesley have to do, then?

264
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,480
噢 天哪 我要饿死了!
Oh, dear God, I'm starving!

265
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,710
真希望那小白兔还在 我就能把它生吞活剥了
I wish I'd lain hands on the white rabbit, I'd eat it raw.

266
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,760
你知道莫尔每晚九点准时入睡吗
Did you know that More goes to bed at nine o'clock every night?

267
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,710
和爱丽丝一起?
With Alice?

268
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,940
当然不是
Apparently not.

269
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,200
你从未想过结婚吗 史蒂芬
Don't you ever think of getting married, Stephen?

270
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,690
我是神职人员
I'm in holy orders.

271
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,770
得了吧 你肯定有女人的
Oh, come on. You must have women.

272
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,860
没有过？！
Don't you?

273
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,290
你这简直是个毫无意义的反问！
What kind of a... Putney enquiry is that?!

274
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,160
啊 是你
Ah, it's you.

275
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,810
我喜欢你这身...灰色天鹅绒
I like your... grey velvet.

276
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,420
你在哪买的?
Where did you get it?

277
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:12,350
意大利
Italy.

278
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,300
能给我买点吗?
Can you get me some?

279
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,920
我很久没有新衣服了
It's been so long since I had new clothes.

280
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,990
如果你是在等她 我得提醒你 她正在大发雷霆
If you're waiting for HER, I should warn you, she's in a temper.

281
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,050
- 啊哈  C安妮嫌她上位的速度太慢了
- Ah-ha.  - Nothing happens quickly enough for Anne.

282
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,860
你觉得她会开心
You'd think she'd be happy.

283
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,240
你知道 当国王第一次注意到她时 国王想的是
You know, when the king first turned his attention to her, he thought,

284
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,000
她既然那么了解法国的那些事
knowing how things are done in France,

285
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,040
那她会接受宫里的一个特定的位置[情妇]
that she might accept a certain... position at court.

286
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,820
但那对安妮来说 却不知足
But that wasn't enough for Anne.

287
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,050
你知道她对我说过什么吗
You know what she said to me?

288
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:51,660
她说 "这不是法国 而我也没你这么傻 玛丽"
She said, "This isn't France, and I'm not a fool like you, Mary."

289
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,210
嗯...
Hm.

290
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,710
因为她...
Because she...

291
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,400
- 因为她知道我曾是亨利的情妇...  - 嗯...
- Because she knows I was Henry's mistress... - Hm.

292
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,280
...而且她也见证了我是怎么被抛弃的 她从中吸取了很多教训
.. and she sees how I am left. And she takes a lesson from it.

293
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,960
她发誓要嫁给他 而且无论安妮想要什么 她就一定要得到
She's vowed that she'll marry him. And what Anne wants, she'll have.

294
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,700
- 那你呢?  - 我?
- And you? - Me?

295
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,750
我只是一个被人玩弄过抛弃了的女人
I am to be swept out after supper like the old rushes.

296
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,290
我父亲说我是吃白饭的
My father says I'm a mouth to feed

297
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,150
我叔父诺尔福克说我是个贱女人
and my uncle Norfolk says I'm a whore.

298
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,720
我需要丈夫 来阻止他们的那些外号
I need a husband, to stop them calling me names.

299
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,260
要我说的话...
Well...

300
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,080
...你值得找一个年轻有为的英俊丈夫
.. you should ask for someone young and handsome.

301
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,780
自己不去争取 怎么能找到如意郎君呢
Don't ask, don't get.

302
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,130
不 我想找的是一个能膈应死他们的丈夫
No, what I want is a husband who upsets them.

303
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,280
而且不会因此丧命的丈夫
And who won't die.

304
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,450
是你说的要争取 我现在争取了
Don't ask, don't get.

305
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,950
他们会杀了你的
They'd kill you.

306
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,910
你说的对 他们会的
You're right. They would.

307
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,680
如果她传召你
If she's sent for you,

308
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,200
其实她是想讨好你
she means to flatter you.

309
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,750
她会让你从些许小事开始帮她的忙
She's going to ask you to do some little thing for her.

310
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,760
然后让你为她所用 听我的话
And then she'll make you hers. Take my advice.

311
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:47,400
在她有所行动之前 快逃走吧
Before she does, turn around and walk the other way.

312
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,240
弄点欢快的音乐好嘛
Cheer it up, can't you?

313
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,310
你刚刚做了什么?
What did you just do?

314
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,150
我就碰了马克 史密顿一下
I hit Mark Smeaton.

315
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,950
- 只用了一根手指而已   - 谁？
- But only with one finger. - Who?

316
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,840
噢 原来乐师叫这名字
Oh. Is that his name?

317
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,580
你去哪了
Where've you been?

318
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,920
乌托邦
Utopia.

319
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,070
噢 谈的怎么样
Oh. What was the talk?

320
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,010
女人的阴暗面
The vices and follies of women.

321
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,540
我想你应该聊的很开心吧
I suppose you joined in?

322
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,950
我的牧师 克莱姆
My chaplain. Dr Cranmer.

323
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,310
他躲在一边 因为没什么好消息
Hiding. Because there's no good news.

324
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,770
他刚从罗马回来
He's just back from Rome.

325
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,150
我听说罗马会颁布教令 要求国王离开我
I hear that Rome will issue a decree telling the king to part from me?

326
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,360
- 那是罗马犯的错   - 必须是的
- That would be a mistake on Rome's part. - Yes, it would.

327
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,910
他也不会听之任之的
Because he won't be told.

328
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,830
当他是什么了 一小屁孩儿吗
What is he? Some child?

329
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,820
我读过汀代尔的书
I've read Tyndale.

330
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,220
国民必须绝对服从国王 就如他会听从上帝一样
The subject must obey his king as he would God.

331
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,990
你说我理解的准确吗
Do I have the sense of it?

332
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,420
教皇会清楚他的地位的
The Pope will learn his place.

333
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,310
您传召我来什么事呢
Why did you send for me?

334
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,130
我有东西给你看...
I've something to show you...

335
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,400
- 拜托 不要把它... - 拿出来！
- Oh, please, don't give it currency...  - Give it!

336
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,380
这在我床上发现的
This was in my bed.

337
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,640
那个白脸下人给我换床单的时候发现的
The sickly milk-faced creeper had turned down the sheet.

338
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,980
当然 我从她身上什么也没问出来
Of course, I can't get any sense out of her,

339
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,820
她连被别人斜眼盯着都受不了
she cries if you look at her sideways,

340
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,020
所以我不知道是谁把这玩意放在我床上的
so I don't know who put it there.

341
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,450
看到了吗 那是凯瑟琳王后
That's the Queen, Katherine, you see?

342
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,950
而这个是我
And that's me.

343
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,520
无头的安妮
Anne sans tete.

344
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,870
我总听说沃尔西之所以留着你
I am told that Wolsey kept you

345
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,500
是因为伦敦的八卦消息都逃不出你的耳朵
because you always knew the London gossip.

346
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:17,550
如果你能查出这事是谁做的 希望你能如实禀告我
If you find out who is responsible for this, I want you to tell me.

347
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,860
我有了一个新的座右铭 你知道吗
I have a new motto. Did you know?

348
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,410
(法语)"Ainsi sera, Groigne qui groigne."

349
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:41,280
"任谁怨声载道 我亦一往无前"
"Never mind who grudges it, this will happen."

350
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,270
我注定要得到国王的心
I mean to have him.

351
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:11,560
这就是容易被吓哭的那位 别斜眼盯着她看
I think this is the one that cries,so don't look at her sideways.

352
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,450
- 克伦威尔大人 - 好久没见了
-Master Cromwell.-I haven't seen you for a long time.

353
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,800
你一直都在干嘛 都去哪了
What have you been doing? Where have you been?

354
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,470
缝纫
Sewing.

355
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,950
在我被遣送的地方
Where I'm sent.

356
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,560
还有监视别人 对吧
And spying, too, I think?

357
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,380
我可不擅长监视 而且也不会说法语
I'm not very good at it. I don't speak French.

358
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,340
所以您就别拷问我了 我没什么可报告的
So, please, don't you. It gives me nothing to report.

359
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,330
那你认识克莱姆牧师吗
You know Dr Cranmer?

360
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,260
- 不认识  - 不不...
- No.  - No...

361
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,560
- 我是说...这位是克莱姆牧师  - 噢...
- This is Doctor Cranmer.  - Oh...

362
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,460
现在你该要自报家门了
Now, you're supposed to say who you are.

363
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,920
约翰 西摩的女儿 来自狼厅
John Seymour's daughter, from Wolf Hall.

364
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,880
祝你好运吧 我尽量只用英语来进行这对话
Well, good luck. I'll try to keep the conversations in English.

365
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,780
真的万分感激呢
I would be obliged.

366
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,260
你现在要回剑桥吗
You're going back to Cambridge now?

367
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,570
很遗憾不能久留 博林一家希望我呆在他们身边
Sadly, not to stay. The Boleyn family likes to have me close.

368
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,450
呃 诺尔福克公爵怎么样了
How, erm, how is the Duke of Norfolk?

369
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,170
他正在气头上
He's in a fury.

370
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,050
为什么
About what?

371
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,920
他听说红衣大主教阁下已经到了索斯维尔
He heard your cardinal has reached Southwell

372
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,600
人们从各地涌来就为了看他一眼
and the crowds have come flocking from far and wide just to see him.

373
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,100
简直像一支凯旋归来的军队
As if it were a triumphal procession.

374
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,210
他应该...也许...
He should... perhaps...

375
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,650
更加小心谨慎点
be more cautious.

376
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,800
如果国王能生一次气
If the king was offended once,

377
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,120
就还会有第二次
he can be offended again.

378
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,300
她长什么样呢
So, what's she like?

379
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,720
安妮夫人
The Lady Anne?

380
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,300
高还是矮
Tall or short?

381
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,290
不高不矮
Neither.

382
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,910
他们说她舞跳得很好
They say she dances well.

383
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,960
我们没跳过
We didn't dance.

384
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
她牙齿好吗
Are her teeth good?

385
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,670
等她用它们咬我的时候
When she sinks them into me,

386
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,660
我会告诉你的
I'll let you know.

387
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,670
似乎你已经靠她很近了
Sounds like you've got close enough.

388
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,900
为何上帝要如此考验我们?
Why does God test us?

389
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,960
我也不认为我们能通过考验
I don't think we'll pass.

390
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,340
条件还有待提高
Conditions could be better.

391
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,770
他希望你可以送点鹌鹑过去
Um, he wondered if you could send quails?

392
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,360
- 那儿的食物太难吃了  - 我提醒过他了
- The food is deplorable up there.  - I did warn him.

393
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,300
托马斯 无论走到哪 人们都蜂拥而来
Everywhere he goes, Thomas, they flock to see him.

394
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,060
成千上万的人
Thousands of them!

395
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
他的昔日雄风又回来了
You can see his old spirit returning.

396
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:49,040
他在北部教堂召开了教士会议
He's called a convocation of the northern church.

397
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,330
没有通知国王吗
Without informing the king?

398
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,220
他说 "呵 乔治 他们没必要知道"
He said, "Ah, George, why do they need to know."

399
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,540
这是独立的信号 没别的意思
It's a signal of independence, that's all.

400
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,970
有人会说这是傲慢自负的信号
Some might say a signal of pride.

401
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,450
我知道
I know.

402
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,440
我知道人们在议论什么
I know what people are saying.

403
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,850
说我现在一个人单干了
That I'm working for myself now,

404
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,640
说我被收买了
that I've been bought out.

405
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,310
如果你能去向他解释 那么所有疑虑都...
If you came and spoke to him, any doubts that he has...

406
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,160
这里需要我
I'm needed here.

407
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:39,250
来保护他
To protect him.

408
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,550
来说服国王
To persuade the king.

409
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,480
他仍喜欢我的 乔治
He likes me, George.

410
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,730
我能感受的到
I feel it.

411
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,640
当他能听进我的话 主教就会被召回
And when I have his ear, the cardinal will be recalled.

412
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,560
我保证
I promise you.

413
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,360
如果他不幸去世怎么办?
What if he dies?

414
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,300
如果他摔下马脖子折了怎么办?
What if he falls off his horse and breaks his neck?

415
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,930
几年前 一个负责国王的饮食起居的小伙
Few years ago, this fella here, charged the king in the lists,

416
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,580
把长矛向国王的头盔刺去...砰...
runs his lance into the king's headpiece...bam...

417
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,880
长矛在离眼睛一英寸的地方碎掉了
lance shatters, an inch, just an inch, from his eye.

418
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,010
一年后 国王带着他的猎鹰外出
Year later, king's out with his hawk,

419
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,120
经过一处沟渠时 撑了一根杆渡渠
comes to a ditch, drives a pole in to help him cross.

420
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,830
走一半那该死的杆子断了
Damn thing breaks and there he is,

421
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,690
他就脸朝下陷进泥潭中 差点淹死
face down in a foot of mud, drowning.

422
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,590
要不是一个仆人救了他 那现在执政的会是谁呢?
If a servant hadn't pulled him out, who would reign, then?

423
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,080
他有一个嫡出的孩子
He has one child born in wedlock.

424
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,520
- 谁 玛丽么 那个小虾米?  - 她总会长大的
- What, Mary? The talking shrimp?   - Well, she'll grow up.

425
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,690
我们还需等待 她的头还只有我指甲这么大
We're still waiting. Head's the size of my fingernail.

426
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,410
一个女人戴上国王王冠可不是自然而然的事
And a woman on the English throne flies in the face of nature.

427
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,600
何况女人无法指挥军队
A woman can't lead an army.

428
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,300
她祖母就这么干过
Her grandmother did.

429
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,750
克伦威尔 你在干什么
Cromwell what are you doing

430
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,060
偷听绅士间的谈话吗
listening to the conversations of gentlemen?

431
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:10,420
那个把国王从泥沼里救出来的仆人
The servant who dragged the king out of the ditch.

432
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,610
是谁?
What was his name?

433
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,890
克伦威尔学士总喜欢打听这些下等人的事哦
Master Cromwell likes to hear of the deeds of those of low birth.

434
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,850
他叫 爱德蒙 莫迪
His name was Edmund Mody.

435
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,350
听着怎么像"烂泥巴"...哈！
"Muddy" more like! Haha!

436
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,100
眼力过人嘛
You've a good eye.

437
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,520
臂力也不错
A good arm.

438
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,590
这个距离...我还可以应付...
Well, at this distance...

439
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,400
我家里面 每周天都会比赛
We have a match every Sunday, my household.

440
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,440
我们和公会成员们碰面
We meet up with our fellow guildsmen,

441
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,690
然后去肉店和杂货店里搞破坏
and we destroy the butchers and the grocers!

442
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,850
不如下次我跟你同去如何
What if I came down with you one week?

443
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,760
只是微服出游?
In disguise?

444
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,800
国王是需要时不时炫耀一下自己的能力的 你觉得呢
A king should show himself sometimes, don't you think?

445
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:19,970
我可以轮替你出场比试射箭
I could shoot for you!

446
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,300
那...那我们肯定会赢的
Well, well, we'd win for sure!

447
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,370
沃尔西曾告诉过我你貌似很厌恶宗教生活
Wolsey told me once that you had a loathing of those in religious life?

448
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,270
这是为什么他觉得你对修道院的监察
That's why he found you so diligent

449
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,140
如此孜孜不倦的原因吗
in your inspection of the monasteries?

450
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,580
不是那个原因
That was not the reason.

451
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,900
- 我能说两句么? - 老天 真是求之不得
- May I speak?  - God, I wish someone would!

452
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,450
如果你问我对修道士的看法
If you ask me about the monks,

453
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,040
我会说说我的经验之谈 而不是偏见
I speak from experience, not prejudice,

454
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:13,220
而我的过往经历来看 他们都腐败且浪费
and my experiences have largely been one of corruption and waste.

455
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,150
我亲眼见他们过得像勋爵大人
I've seen monks who live like great lords

456
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,960
吃着穷人们的救济粮
on the offerings of the poor,

457
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,590
不停接收新的孩子
take children in,

458
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,340
但却不像承诺般一样给他们优良教育
and rather than educating them as they promise,

459
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:27,530
把孩子们当作仆人 几千年来 修道士们已经在历史中
use them as servants. For hundreds of years, the monks have written

460
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,460
记载了我们被夺去的东西
what we take to be our history.

461
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,320
但他们却只是阻碍了真实的历史进程
I think they've suppressed our true history,

462
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,770
只攥写罗马教廷希望看的篇章
and written one which is favourable to Rome.

463
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,460
他们每年进贡给教廷的钱
I could make good use of the money

464
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,160
要是给我 肯定能派上大用处
that flows from them to Rome each year.

465
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,660
弗朗斯瓦国王比我富裕的多
King Francois is richer than I am.

466
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:44,050
他可以随意收税
He taxes his subjects as he pleases.

467
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,260
而我却要召集议会来征求意见 否则就会有暴动
I have to call parliament or there are riots.

468
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,090
恕我直言 陛下 弗朗斯瓦太嗜战
Well, sir, with respect, Francois likes war too much

469
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,410
而无视了贸易的重要性
and trade too little.

470
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,410
若贸易顺利的话 将能征得更多的税收
There are more taxes to be raised when trade is good.

471
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,880
而即使有教会的教令 拒绝纳税
And if taxes are resisted, even by the Church

472
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,360
我们也能有其他的解决办法
other ways can be found.

473
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,290
好吧
All right.

474
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,490
有时间来跟我的律师们坐下来谈谈吧
Sit down with my lawyers to discuss it.

475
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,840
从修道院开始
Begin with the monasteries.

476
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,420
一些人说我应该考虑解除婚姻关系
Some say that I should consider my marriage dissolved

477
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,220
然后我就能尽快娶我真正想要的女人了
and I should remarry as I please. And soon.

478
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,730
- 但还有另一帮人说...  - 我就是那帮人中的一个
- But there are others who say... - I am one of the others.

479
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:04,540
我的天 我不会因这些闲言碎语而怯懦的！
Dear Christ, I shall be unmanned by it!

480
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,720
我还有等多久?!
How long am I supposed to wait?!

481
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,040
安妮说她要离我而去
Anne says she'll leave me.

482
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,720
说她已经有了别的男人
Says there are other men.

483
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,340
说她现在这样是在浪费她的青春
Says she's wasting her youth.

484
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,000
开门！
Open up!

485
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,500
我是国王的人 开门！
It's the king's men. Open up!

486
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,120
发生什么事了 是来抓我们的么
What is it? Is it an arrest?

487
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,230
- 早上好 威廉 布里尔顿   - 随时待命
- Good morning, William Brereton. - I'm here if you need me.

488
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,430
您这是早起还是晚睡 先生? 你带孩子们去睡觉
Are you up early, or down late, sir? Take the girls to bed.

489
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,820
走吧 孩子们
Come, girls.

490
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,050
国王在格林威治 你得现在过去一趟
The king is at Greenwich. You're to come now.

491
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,770
那所有人都上床睡觉去吧
Well, then, everybody, back to bed.

492
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,260
国王请我去格林威治 就肯定不是为了抓我
The king wouldn't invite me to Greenwich in order to arrest me.

493
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,040
逮捕也不是这么个逮捕法
It doesn't happen that way.

494
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,050
他找我要做什么?
What does he want me for?

495
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,780
恕不奉告
I really can't enlighten you.

496
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,760
哈利 诺里斯
Harry Norris.

497
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:37,610
克伦威尔大人 我们总在奇怪的状况下见面
Master Cromwell, we do meet under the strangest circumstances.

498
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,390
你一个人跟我进去
You, only, to come in.

499
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,520
他在等你
He's waiting.

500
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,960
你待在这
You stay here.

501
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,580
我死去的哥哥来找我了
My dead brother came to me.

502
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,360
他看起来还好吗
How did he look?

503
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,280
就像记忆中的那样 不过脸色惨白
As I remember him. But he was pale.

504
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,930
骨瘦如柴
And thin.

505
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,420
而且有一团白色冥火围绕着他
There was a white fire around him.

506
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,250
他逝于勒德落 正值寒冬
He died in Ludlow, in winter.

507
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,690
当时道路不通
The roads were impenetrable.

508
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,700
只能把他的棺材放在牛车上
They had to put his coffin on an ox cart.

509
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,160
我从没有机会瞻仰他的遗容
I never saw him dead.

510
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,640
直到今晚
Until tonight.

511
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,120
死去之人不会托梦回来抱怨葬礼的
The dead don't come back to complain of their burial.

512
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,680
他很悲伤
He was so sad.

513
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:45,060
他回来是为了让我羞愧
He's come back to make me ashamed.

514
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:48,140
抢了他的王座
For taking his kingdom.

515
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:50,820
还利用他的妻子
Using his wife.

516
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,880
如果陛下的哥哥在继位之前就去世了
If Your majesty's brother died before he could reign...

517
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,450
..那便是天意如此
.. then that was God's will.

518
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,650
至于您的婚姻
And as for your supposed marriage,

519
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:08,100
我们都知道是清白的 虽违悖圣经
we all know that that was clean,contrary to the scriptures.

520
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,700
但上帝有灵
But with God,

521
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,740
- 已足够仁慈了... - 那又不是对我仁慈!
- there's mercy enough... - Not for me!

522
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,280
每当我自己做出判断的时候
When I come to my judgment,

523
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:20,480
他就会来反驳我
he will plead against me.

524
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,210
他现在回来是想让我难堪...
He has come to make me ashamed...

525
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,610
...我却孤身一人 默默忍受
.. and I alone must bear it.

526
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,220
我...
I...

527
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,200
我孤身一人
I alone.

528
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,210
您哥哥跟你谈了什么
Did your brother speak to you?

529
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:48,960
有什么暗示吗
Make any sign?

530
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:50,920
没有
No.

531
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,980
那你就是过度揣测你哥哥的想法了
Then you have read into his face something that wasn't there.

532
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,720
听着
Listen to me.

533
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,610
你知道亚瑟王的墓碑上刻着什么吗
You know what's written on Arthur's tomb?

534
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,340
(拉丁语)
"Rex quondam rexque futurus."

535
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:11,130
"一朝为王 永世为王"
"King once, and king to be."

536
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:13,910
你的父亲做到了这句话 他从流放归来
Your father made it sure.He came back from exile,

537
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,390
夺回了失去的权力
claimed his ancient right.

538
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,360
但这王位并不稳当 您得掌控住它
But it's not enough to claim a country, you have to hold it.

539
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,960
并将它世代传承下去
It has to be made secure,in every generation.

540
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,680
如果您哥哥回来好像是在责怪你
If your brother comes back and seems to say

541
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,160
夺了他的王国 他的王位
that you have taken his kingdom, taken his place,

542
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:32,360
那是因为他想让您成为他曾想登上的王位
it's because he wants YOU to become the king he would have been.

543
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,970
他不能世代传承王位
He can't fulfil the prophecy,

544
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,240
因为他是威尔士出身的王子
a prince come out of Wales,

545
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,740
但他希望您能继承王位
but he wills you to do it.

546
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,780
那他现在为什么又回来了?
But why does he come back now?

547
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,120
我都当了20年国王
I have been king for 20 years.

548
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:47,240
因为现在是关键时期
Because now is the vital time.

549
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,530
现在是时候 您表现出王霸之气
Now is the time for you to become the king you should be,

550
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:55,210
表现出唯吾独尊的上位者的气势
the sole and supreme head of your kingdom.

551
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,930
问问安妮
Ask Anne.

552
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,170
她也会这么说
She'll say the same.

553
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,500
确实如此
She does.

554
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,780
她说我们不应臣服于罗马
She says we should not bow to Rome.

555
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,850
如果您父亲也向您托梦
And if your father should come to you in your dream,

556
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,440
您也要这样想
you take it the same way as you take this one.

557
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,420
他们是来辅佐您的
They come to strengthen your hand.

558
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,520
我懂了
I see.

559
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,670
真的都懂了
I understand it all now.

560
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,600
我知道派谁去了
I knew who to send for.

561
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,800
我一直都该知道的
I always do.

562
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,420
发生什么事了
What happened?

563
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,560
国王做了个梦
The king had a dream.

564
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,440
做梦?
A dream?

565
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,350
他半夜把我们叫醒 就因为一个梦?
He got us out of bed for a dream?

566
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:17,790
相信我 他还有别的原因的
Oh, believe me, he gets one out of bed for far less than that.

567
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:21,630
是个噩梦吗
Was it a bad dream?

568
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,370
"是噩梦吗"
"Was it a bad dream?"

569
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,610
他本来是这么认为的
He thought it was.

570
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,900
但现在不是了
It isn't now.

571
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,540
你的孩子们很爱你
Your children love you.

572
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,820
没有这个带头人 我们也都做不成事的
We can't do without the man in charge.

573
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,390
克雷默先生 告诉安娜夫人
Dr Cranmer, tell the Lady Anne

574
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,080
我们今晚替她办了件大好事
we did a good night's work for her tonight.

575
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,380
保持安静
Quietly now.

576
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:03,130
别又把大家吵醒了
Don't wake the house a second time.

577
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:05,930
很好
Well done.

578
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,120
你没事吧
Safe?

579
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,240
嗯
Mm.

580
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,030
我还以为...
I thought...

581
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,650
什么?
What?

582
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:43,290
我还以为要来清算了
I thought it was going to be a reckoning.

583
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,960
清算什么
A reckoning?

584
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:47,230
为了什么
For what?

585
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,600
不知道 所有的这一切吧
I don't know. All the things.

586
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,510
这些画 书 鲁特琴 还有些不认识的东西
The paintings, the books and lutes, and I don't know what.

587
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,080
我们现在所拥有的一切
The things we have now.

588
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,110
先生你真是个罗马乞丐!
You, sir, are a Roman pauper!

589
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,480
先生你真是个佛莱芒大胖子
Sir, you are a fat Fleming,

590
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,610
面包上还抹着黄油
and spread butter on your bread.

591
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,620
先生 愿您的后代都吃蜗牛
Well, sir, may your offspring eat snails.

592
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,920
叫我里斯利！
Call Me Risley!

593
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,660
给你画下来应该很不错 里奥谢思利学士！你在这干嘛
You look fit to be painted, Master Wriothesley! What are you about?

594
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,200
等孩子们 他们今早很有兴致呢
Waiting on the children. They're in high spirits this morning.

595
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,910
啦啦啦啦...啦啦啦...
La la la la, la la la...

596
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,940
哼的那是什么调
What's that?

597
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:29,610
以前我在意大利的时候学的小曲
It's a tune from my days in Italy.

598
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,370
我还记得...
I remember...

599
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,550
他从不说他自己的故事
He never tells stories about himself.

600
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,400
好吧...我...呃...
Well, well... I, erm...

601
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,310
在意大利的时候 我和...
When I was in Italy, me and the...

602
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,670
我和那些波尔蒂纳里家的男孩们
.. me and the Portinari boys,

603
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,000
波尔蒂纳里家的男孩们
the Portinari boys,

604
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,350
我们做了个雕像
we had a statue made,

605
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,600
挥舞着翅膀傻笑的上帝小雕像
a little smirking god with wings.

606
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,430
我们用锤子和链条敲打它 还雇了个骡夫 把雕像运到罗马
We beat it with hammers and chains,hired a muleteer and drove it to Rome

607
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:08,030
还冒充是奥古斯都时期的古董 卖给了一个红衣大主教
and sold it to a cardinal as an antique from the reign of Augustus.

608
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:12,360
我还记得...
I remember...

609
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:17,800
当他付我们钱时 眼里还噙着泪水
he. he had tears in his eyes when he paid us.

610
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,340
当波尔蒂纳里家的男孩们回佛罗伦萨时
And when the Portinari
boys went back to Florence

611
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:24,510
他们因为钱袋太重 路都走不稳了
they were staggering under
the weight of their purses.

612
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,680
- 那你做了什么  - 什么
- What did you do?  - What?

613
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,510
分了我那份钱 留下来接着卖拖鞋 不然呢
Took my cut, and stayed on to sell the mules, what do you think?

614
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,630
（意大利语）? Scaramella会有战争 ?
 (Italian) ? Scaramella va alla guerra ?

615
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,870
（意大利语）? 长矛啊 武器啊 ?
(Italian) ? Colla lancia et la rotella ?

616
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,640
我们还未用完晚餐
We hadn't finished dinner.

617
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:05,930
他们就来了
They came in,

618
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,840
他们从门房那里拿了钥匙
they'd taken the keys from the porter.

619
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:11,790
他们已经在楼梯口设了哨兵
They'd already set sentries on the stairs.

620
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,250
是谁
Who was it?

621
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,320
哈利 珀西
Harry Percy.

622
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:21,790
他浑身发抖
He was shaking.

623
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,600
我就想 "为什么要派他 为什么是哈利 珀西"'
I thought, "Why send him? Why Harry Percy?"'

624
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,510
然后我想起...
Then I thought...

625
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,530
安妮夫人 你还记得吗
Lady Anne, you remember,

626
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,590
她那时只是个女孩
she was just a girl.

627
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:35,370
她想嫁给他
She wanted to marry him.

628
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,400
红衣主教阁下却阻止了
The cardinal stopped it.

629
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,660
这是在复仇
Revenge.

630
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,800
她已经等候多时了
She waited her time.

631
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,290
哈利
Harry,

632
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:53,760
要是知道你来 我会等你共进晚餐的
if I'd known, I would have waited dinner for you.

633
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,100
貌似鱼都快吃光了
I fear we've almost finished the fish.

634
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:02,640
- 我要祈祷奇迹发生吗  - 大人，我以叛国罪逮捕你
- Shall I pray for a miracle?   - My lord, I arrest you for high treason.

635
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,840
逮捕令呢
Your warrant?

636
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,920
我自有王命在身 但非你可看
There are items in my instructions you may not see.

637
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:21,320
如若你不把它展示出来
Well, if you won't show it,

638
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:23,900
恐怕我是不会屈服的
I won't surrender to you.

639
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:27,790
所以...
So...

640
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,600
就是这么个情况
here's a state of affairs!

641
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,930
走吧 乔治
Come, George.

642
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,880
看着我 乔治
Look at me, George.

643
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,760
我不惧怕任何生者
I'm not afraid of any man alive.

644
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,900
呃...
Um...

645
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:22,400
恩...
Er...

646
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:27,580
他们把我们从房子里带走 向南走
They took us from the house, rode south.

647
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:33,360
有一群人在等着见他 举着蜡烛
There were crowds waiting to see him, holding candles.

648
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:37,690
我们以为他们会散去 但他们整晚都站在路中央
We thought they'd disperse, but they just stood all night in the road.

649
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:43,310
他绝食了
He stopped eating.

650
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,720
为什么
Why?

651
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,410
我不知道
I don't know.

652
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:55,470
有人说...有人说他想毁灭自己
Some said... some said he wanted to destroy himself.

653
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,480
一切发生的太快了
It all happened so fast.

654
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,850
之后金斯顿来了
And then Kingston came.

655
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,530
我不得不告诉他 托马斯
I had to tell him, Thomas.

656
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:07,420
我不得不告诉我们大人 象牙塔的那个治安官
I had to tell our lord that the Constable of the Tower

657
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:08,510
已经来带走他了
had come to fetch him.

658
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,270
他只是重复问道"威廉 金斯顿?"
He just kept saying "William Kingston?"

659
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,390
一遍又一遍 好像他不敢相信
over and over, as if he couldn't believe it.

660
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,660
我们抵达莱斯特时
By the time we reached Leicester

661
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,510
他虚弱的站都站不住
he was too ill to stand.

662
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,680
咳出了黑色的血
He voided black blood.

663
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:33,130
我认为...是有人下毒...
I thought... poison...

664
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,280
托马斯...
Thomas...

665
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,490
他马上来了 大人
He's coming, my lord.

666
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:55,050
他在哪儿?
Where... where is he?

667
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:56,280
你知道克伦威尔的 大人
You know Cromwell, my lord.

668
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,920
他说会来 就一定会来的
If he says he'll come, he'll be here.

669
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,680
"对不起 托马斯"
'I'm sorry, Thomas.'

670
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:33,230
"他第二天就去世了"
'He died the next day.'

671
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,890
他们...
They...

672
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,080
他们给了他

1
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,580
Thank you.

2
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,550
I can't talk about the Cardinal.

3
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,760
-Your Majesty... -No. Don't you understand?

4
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,520
I can't talk about him.

5
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,880
Here again.

6
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,440
Stephen.

7
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,970
You been waiting long?

8
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,510
Well, I was under the impression I had an interview with the King.

9
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,020
Again.

10
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,440
Again.

11
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:39,880
Yes.

12
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,740
Elusive, isn't he?

13
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,420
Did you think yourself a special favourite?

14
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,990
A cat has had her litter,

15
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,040
here, in my rooms.

16
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,610
Look at it!

17
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,660
Black as the devil,

18
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,200
born right here, under my very bed.

19
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,520
How's that for a bad omen before a journey?

20
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,920
You shouldn't leave.

21
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,510
Merry Thomas, when Norfolk threatens to bite...

22
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,240
.. it's time to be gone.

23
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,500
You won't like the north.

24
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,440
I am the Archbishop of York.

25
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,550
Yes, but you've never been. I have.

26
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,330
Filthy weather, people, morals.

27
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,320
The King wants me gone.

28
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,670
He wants to humiliate me.

29
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,680
Thinks it sends a sharp message to the Pope.

30
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,000
I feel like Katherine...

31
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,170
.. cast off.

32
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,130
But still, I love him.

33
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,540
What will we do?

34
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,510
Bribe people.

35
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,280
You still have land.

36
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,730
Even if the King takes everything you have, people will ask themselves,

37
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,360
"Can he truly give what belongs to the church?"

38
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,030
No-one will be sure of their title unless you confirm it.

39
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,810
So you see, my Lord, you still...

40
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,380
- You still have cards in your hand. - Yes.

41
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,450
And after all...

42
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,830
.. if he wants to bring a treason...

43
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,520
If the King meant to charge you with treason,

44
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,430
- you'd be in the tower now, wouldn't you?       - Yes.

45
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,720
He misses you.

46
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,410
You'll return to favour.

47
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,640
New life,

48
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,080
born under your very bed?

49
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,240
Well... I'd read that as a good omen.

50
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,800
Ah, you lawyer.

51
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,680
Look who's back for Christmas.

52
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,680
What's this, Gregory,some kind of beard?

53
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,180
Think I've seen more hair on a side of bacon.

54
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,320
Gregory says we can race his dogs up and down the hall.

55
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,900
- Father.   - Welcome home, Gregory.

56
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,400
That was a calculation.

57
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,270
It wasn't just where I dropped them.

58
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,760
Sorry.

59
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,760
Do you remember that one Christmas

60
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,030
when we had the giant in the pageant?

61
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,040
Here in the parish? I do.

62
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,210
"I am a giant."

63
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,090
"My name is Marlinspike."

64
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,070
Aunt Johane says we won't have the Epiphany Feast this year.

65
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,530
We can't.

66
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,600
No-one would come.

67
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,770
Because of the Cardinal's disgrace?

68
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,040
People in Cambridge are laughing at my greyhounds.

69
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,350
Why?

70
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,210
Because they're black.

71
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,040
They should be white.

72
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,960
They say, "Only felons have dogs that you can't see at night."

73
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,710
Aha.

74
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,970
Look.

75
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,000
"I am a giant.

76
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,380
"My name is Marlinspike."

77
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,740
"Grrrr!"

78
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,640
The dogs will kill it.

79
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,960
Do you think he's afraid of me?

80
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,590
Why should he be?

81
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,620
I don't know.

82
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,350
With everybody else,he seems so lively...

83
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,450
but when he sees me...

84
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,560
You're a kind father.

85
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,760
Too much so, I think. You spoil him.

86
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,870
That's what Liz always said.

87
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,270
Liz and I had nothing when we were girls.

88
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,040
Not a comb. Never had a mirror.

89
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,870
I remember when he was a baby and I used to warm his shirt

90
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,200
for him in front of the fire.

91
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,730
Liz would say "Don't do that. He'll expect it every day."

92
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,690
Seems such a long time since there was a baby in the house.

93
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't look at me.

94
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:43,360
Does John Williamson not do his duty by you?

95
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,680
His duty's not my pleasure.

96
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,580
There's a conversation I shouldn't have had.

97
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,360
Wriothesley.

98
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,600
It's spelled W-R-I-O-T- ...

99
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,960
Just call me Risley.

100
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,880
Master Risley, we're always looking for bright young men.

101
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,740
-You worked for the Cardinal, I think? -Yes, sir.

102
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,950
But then left with Stephen Gardiner?

103
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,570
I'm his clerk.

104
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,770
But it doesn't occupy all my time

105
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,740
and I'm keen to learn something of business, sir.

106
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,550
Oh, we're all business here at Austin Friars... aren't we, boys?

107
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,520
You know Gardiner will have sent him here to spy on us.

108
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,190
Well, he seems obliging.

109
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,800
Perhaps we could send him back to spy on Gardiner.

110
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,270
How's he been?

111
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,550
He's whipping himself?

112
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,360
The monks who come to him brought it.

113
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,120
Body of Christ.

114
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,750
Who makes these things?

115
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,520
Who ties a thorn to horse hair?

116
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,810
People ought to be found better jobs.

117
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,120
That settles it, we have to get him out of here.

118
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,000
Oh, oh, God.

119
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,150
He'd be better off in Yorkshire.

120
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,420
But how would we pay for it?

121
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,510
If only you would see the King...

122
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,830
Take a message for me to Wolsey, will you?

123
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,350
There's a Breton merchant who's complaining that his ship

124
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,290
was seized eight years ago and he still hasn't received compensation.

125
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,060
No-one can find the paper work.

126
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,190
The Cardinal would have handled the case.

127
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,840
- Do you think he'll remember it?  - I'm sure he will.

128
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,640
That'll be the one with powdered pearls for ballast

129
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,440
and unicorns' horns in its hold.

130
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,970
Yes, that'll be the one.

131
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,770
If the case is in doubt, sir, may I look into it?

132
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,260
I don't think you have a locus standi in the matter.

133
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,760
God, let him, Harry.

134
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,210
By the time this fellow's finished, the Breton'll be paying you.

135
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
I'll say this for you.

136
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,380
You stick by your man.

137
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,210
I never had anything but kindness from the Cardinal.

138
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,140
You have no other master?

139
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,520
1,000 pounds?

140
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,920
Don't tell anyone.

141
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,420
It's the best I can do.

142
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,110
Take it with my blessing.

143
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,290
And ask him to pray for me.

144
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,600
Every day, I miss the Cardinal of York.

145
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,740
Oh, it's only a tenth of what he's owed the Cardinal for over a decade.

146
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,190
And not so much when you have a cardinal to move.

147
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,220
How much of your own money will you put into this?

148
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,300
Some debts are not to be reckoned.

149
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,610
I heard a rumour recently about someone you know.

150
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,960
Thomas Wyatt.

151
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,540
Wyatt and the Lady Anne.

152
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,220
It's an old story.

153
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,080
If it's such an old story, why hasn't the King heard it?

154
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,680
Part of the art of ruling, perhaps. Know when to shut your ears.

155
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,170
Aren't the English odd?

156
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,910
Christ, aren't they?!

157
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,480
Hmm.

158
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,990
But you understand, I think?

159
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,820
She interests you?

160
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,760
A world where Anne can be queen

161
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,150
is a world where Cromwell can be...?

162
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,870
Hendon and Royston, Huntingdon, Peterborough.

163
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,390
I've sent riders on ahead so everything will be ready for you.

164
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,710
This is a tactical retreat.

165
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,000
Not a surrender.

166
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,000
Lady Anne is the key to winning back Henry.

167
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,060
Mm-hm..

168
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,830
Find a way into her confidence, Tom.

169
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,230
Work a device to please her.

170
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,590
The only way to please that lady is to crown her Queen of England.

171
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,580
- Will you come north?  - Mm-hm.

172
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,530
I'll come and fetch you, as soon as he summons you back. And he will.

173
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,040
God bless you...

174
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:43,180
mine own entirely beloved Cromwell.

175
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,640
Thomas?

176
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,610
Oh, er, when I'm gone.

177
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,300
I want the whole of the Archbishop's palace scrubbed out.

178
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,940
My lord will be bringing his own bed.

179
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,160
Draft in kitchen staff from the King's Arms.

180
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,910
I think I should go myself.

181
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,490
No, we can do it.

182
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,200
Well, check... Can you take this?

183
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,960
Check the stabling.

184
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,400
And get in musicians.

185
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:47,240
Last time I passed through, there were some pigsties

186
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,300
or something against the palace wall.

187
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,400
- Find the owner, pay him off, knock 'em down.  -Sir...

188
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,890
It's time to let the cardinal go.

189
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,750
You know the first time we met,

190
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,610
was when you were a young student.

191
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,000
- Where was this?  - Lambeth Palace.

192
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,110
My uncle John was the cook there

193
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,800
and I worked some days in the kitchens.

194
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,040
I served you once.

195
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,790
I don't think so.

196
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,500
I remember, one evening we were playing football

197
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,710
and I heard a recorder playing...

198
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,170
Ah, my other guest...

199
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,260
Now, you carry on...

200
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,790
Now, Henry, leave Master Gardiner alone.

201
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,640
You come along to the house. Come on, come on.

202
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,070
Let's go, let's go to the house.

203
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,030
There.

204
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,490
About Master Wriothesley...

205
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,780
And a good evening to you, Stephen.

206
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,280
Remind me, is he working for me, or for you?

207
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,630
For you, I would have thought?

208
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,460
Then why is he always at your house?

209
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,920
Well, he's not a bound apprentice.

210
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,680
He can come and go as he pleases.

211
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,450
He thinks he'll make his fortune, I suppose.

212
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,420
Everyone knows money sticks to your hands.

213
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,860
He wants to know what he can learn from...

214
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,720
whatever it is you call yourself these days.

215
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,000
A person.

216
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,680
The Duke of Norfolk says I'm a person.

217
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,550
Is that his fool?

218
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:50,410
He's supposed to have fallen off a church roof and landed on his head.

219
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,570
- Supposed to?  - It would be just like More to keep a fool who wasn't.

220
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,320
Just to embarrass people.

221
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,160
Henry Pattinson is excitable tonight.

222
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,710
I hope his diet has not been too rich.

223
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,730
No anxieties on that score...

224
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:22,400
Tyndale has been sighted in Hamburg, they say.

225
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,270
You'd know him, if you saw him, I suppose?

226
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,280
So would you, I suppose?

227
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,150
I hope to get the means to proceed against him

228
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,600
for sedition in his writing.

229
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,210
Have you found sedition in Tyndale's writing?

230
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,030
Very good.

231
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,760
You hear that, Stephen?

232
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,210
A lesser lawyer would have said, "I have read Tyndale,

233
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,410
"and I find no fault there."

234
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,280
But Thomas will not be tripped, will he?

235
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,880
Well, I admit, I have read Tyndale.

236
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,280
I have picked apart his so-called translations.

237
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,660
I have also read Luther.

238
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,220
You have such a pretty way with Latin.

239
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,370
So, "He that toucheth pitch shall be defiled."

240
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,440
Unless his name is Thomas More.

241
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,410
There you are, Wolsey always told me you were a man of the Bible.

242
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,150
Thomas Cromwell, why don't you marry again?

243
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,800
No-one will have me, Lady Alice.

244
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,270
Nonsense. Your master may be down, but you're not poor.

245
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,080
And you've got everything below in good working order, haven't you?

246
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,290
Alice! What have I told you about drinking wine?

247
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,830
Your nose is glowing!

248
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,190
Why am I bringing you to Westminster?

249
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,920
I'm off to see Lady Anne.

250
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,760
You didn't say so.

251
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,450
I can't tell you all my plans, Stephen.

252
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,750
What would young Wriothesley have to do, then?

253
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,480
Oh, dear God, I'm starving!

254
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,710
I wish I'd lain hands on the white rabbit, I'd eat it raw.

255
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,760
Did you know that More goes to bed at nine o'clock every night?

256
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,710
With Alice?

257
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,940
Apparently not.

258
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,200
Don't you ever think of getting married, Stephen?

259
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,690
I'm in holy orders.

260
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,770
Oh, come on. You must have women.

261
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,860
Don't you?

262
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,290
What kind of a... Putney enquiry is that?!

263
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,160
Ah, it's you.

264
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,810
I like your... grey velvet.

265
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,420
Where did you get it?

266
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:12,350
Italy.

267
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,300
Can you get me some?

268
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,920
It's been so long since I had new clothes.

269
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,990
If you're waiting for HER, I should warn you, she's in a temper.

270
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,050
- Ah-ha.  - Nothing happens quickly enough for Anne.

271
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,860
You'd think she'd be happy.

272
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,240
You know, when the king first turned his attention to her, he thought,

273
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,000
knowing how things are done in France,

274
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,040
that she might accept a certain... position at court.

275
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,820
But that wasn't enough for Anne.

276
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,050
You know what she said to me?

277
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:51,660
She said, "This isn't France, and I'm not a fool like you, Mary."

278
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,210
Hm.

279
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,710
Because she...

280
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,400
- Because she knows I was Henry's mistress... - Hm.

281
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,280
.. and she sees how I am left. And she takes a lesson from it.

282
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,960
She's vowed that she'll marry him. And what Anne wants, she'll have.

283
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,700
- And you? - Me?

284
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,750
I am to be swept out after supper like the old rushes.

285
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,290
My father says I'm a mouth to feed

286
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,150
and my uncle Norfolk says I'm a whore.

287
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,720
I need a husband, to stop them calling me names.

288
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,260
Well...

289
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,080
.. you should ask for someone young and handsome.

290
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,780
Don't ask, don't get.

291
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,130
No, what I want is a husband who upsets them.

292
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,280
And who won't die.

293
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,450
Don't ask, don't get.

294
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,950
They'd kill you.

295
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,910
You're right. They would.

296
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,680
If she's sent for you,

297
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,200
she means to flatter you.

298
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,750
She's going to ask you to do some little thing for her.

299
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,760
And then she'll make you hers. Take my advice.

300
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:47,400
Before she does, turn around and walk the other way.

301
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,240
Cheer it up, can't you?

302
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,310
What did you just do?

303
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,150
I hit Mark Smeaton.

304
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,950
- But only with one finger. - Who?

305
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,840
Oh. Is that his name?

306
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,580
Where've you been?

307
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,920
Utopia.

308
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,070
Oh. What was the talk?

309
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,010
The vices and follies of women.

310
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,540
I suppose you joined in?

311
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,950
My chaplain. Dr Cranmer.

312
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,310
Hiding. Because there's no good news.

313
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,770
He's just back from Rome.

314
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,150
I hear that Rome will issue a decree telling the king to part from me?

315
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,360
- That would be a mistake on Rome's part. - Yes, it would.

316
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,910
Because he won't be told.

317
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,830
What is he? Some child?

318
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,820
I've read Tyndale.

319
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,220
The subject must obey his king as he would God.

320
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,990
Do I have the sense of it?

321
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,420
The Pope will learn his place.

322
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,310
Why did you send for me?

323
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,130
I've something to show you...

324
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,400
- Oh, please, don't give it currency...  - Give it!

325
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,380
This was in my bed.

326
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,640
The sickly milk-faced creeper had turned down the sheet.

327
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,980
Of course, I can't get any sense out of her,

328
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,820
she cries if you look at her sideways,

329
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,020
so I don't know who put it there.

330
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,450
That's the Queen, Katherine, you see?

331
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,950
And that's me.

332
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,520
Anne sans tete.

333
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,870
I am told that Wolsey kept you

334
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,500
because you always knew the London gossip.

335
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:17,550
If you find out who is responsible for this, I want you to tell me.

336
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,860
I have a new motto. Did you know?

337
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:41,280
"Never mind who grudges it, this will happen."

338
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,270
I mean to have him.

339
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:11,560
I think this is the one that cries,so don't look at her sideways.

340
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,450
-Master Cromwell.-I haven't seen you for a long time.

341
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,800
What have you been doing? Where have you been?

342
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,470
Sewing.

343
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,950
Where I'm sent.

344
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,560
And spying, too, I think?

345
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,380
I'm not very good at it. I don't speak French.

346
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,340
So, please, don't you. It gives me nothing to report.

347
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,330
You know Dr Cranmer?

348
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,260
- No.  - No...

349
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,560
- This is Doctor Cranmer.  - Oh...

350
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,460
Now, you're supposed to say who you are.

351
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,920
John Seymour's daughter, from Wolf Hall.

352
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,880
Well, good luck. I'll try to keep the conversations in English.

353
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,780
I would be obliged.

354
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,260
You're going back to Cambridge now?

355
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,570
Sadly, not to stay. The Boleyn family likes to have me close.

356
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,450
How, erm, how is the Duke of Norfolk?

357
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,170
He's in a fury.

358
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,050
About what?

359
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,920
He heard your cardinal has reached Southwell

360
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,600
and the crowds have come flocking from far and wide just to see him.

361
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,100
As if it were a triumphal procession.

362
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,210
He should... perhaps...

363
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,650
be more cautious.

364
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,800
If the king was offended once,

365
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,120
he can be offended again.

366
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,300
So, what's she like?

367
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,720
The Lady Anne?

368
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,300
Tall or short?

369
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,290
Neither.

370
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,910
They say she dances well.

371
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,960
We didn't dance.

372
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
Are her teeth good?

373
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,670
When she sinks them into me,

374
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,660
I'll let you know.

375
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,670
Sounds like you've got close enough.

376
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,900
Why does God test us?

377
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,960
I don't think we'll pass.

378
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,340
Conditions could be better.

379
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,770
Um, he wondered if you could send quails?

380
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,360
- The food is deplorable up there.  - I did warn him.

381
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,300
Everywhere he goes, Thomas, they flock to see him.

382
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,060
Thousands of them!

383
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
You can see his old spirit returning.

384
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:49,040
He's called a convocation of the northern church.

385
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,330
Without informing the king?

386
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,220
He said, "Ah, George, why do they need to know."

387
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,540
It's a signal of independence, that's all.

388
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,970
Some might say a signal of pride.

389
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,450
I know.

390
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,440
I know what people are saying.

391
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,850
That I'm working for myself now,

392
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,640
that I've been bought out.

393
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,310
If you came and spoke to him, any doubts that he has...

394
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,160
I'm needed here.

395
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:39,250
To protect him.

396
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,550
To persuade the king.

397
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,480
He likes me, George.

398
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,730
I feel it.

399
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,640
And when I have his ear, the cardinal will be recalled.

400
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,560
I promise you.

401
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,360
What if he dies?

402
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,300
What if he falls off his horse and breaks his neck?

403
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,930
Few years ago, this fella here, charged the king in the lists,

404
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,580
runs his lance into the king's headpiece...bam...

405
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,880
lance shatters, an inch, just an inch, from his eye.

406
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,010
Year later, king's out with his hawk,

407
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,120
comes to a ditch, drives a pole in to help him cross.

408
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,830
Damn thing breaks and there he is,

409
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,690
face down in a foot of mud, drowning.

410
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,590
If a servant hadn't pulled him out, who would reign, then?

411
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,080
He has one child born in wedlock.

412
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,520
- What, Mary? The talking shrimp?   - Well, she'll grow up.

413
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,690
We're still waiting. Head's the size of my fingernail.

414
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,410
And a woman on the English throne flies in the face of nature.

415
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,600
A woman can't lead an army.

416
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,300
Her grandmother did.

417
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,750
Cromwell what are you doing

418
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,060
listening to the conversations of gentlemen?

419
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:10,420
The servant who dragged the king out of the ditch.

420
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,610
What was his name?

421
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,890
Master Cromwell likes to hear of the deeds of those of low birth.

422
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,850
His name was Edmund Mody.

423
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,350
"Muddy" more like! Haha!

424
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,100
You've a good eye.

425
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,520
A good arm.

426
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,590
Well, at this distance...

427
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,400
We have a match every Sunday, my household.

428
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,440
We meet up with our fellow guildsmen,

429
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,690
and we destroy the butchers and the grocers!

430
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,850
What if I came down with you one week?

431
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,760
In disguise?

432
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,800
A king should show himself sometimes, don't you think?

433
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:19,970
I could shoot for you!

434
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,300
Well, well, we'd win for sure!

435
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,370
Wolsey told me once that you had a loathing of those in religious life?

436
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,270
That's why he found you so diligent

437
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,140
in your inspection of the monasteries?

438
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,580
That was not the reason.

439
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,900
- May I speak?  - God, I wish someone would!

440
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,450
If you ask me about the monks,

441
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,040
I speak from experience, not prejudice,

442
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:13,220
and my experiences have largely been one of corruption and waste.

443
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,150
I've seen monks who live like great lords

444
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,960
on the offerings of the poor,

445
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,590
take children in,

446
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,340
and rather than educating them as they promise,

447
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:27,530
use them as servants. For hundreds of years, the monks have written

448
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,460
what we take to be our history.

449
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,320
I think they've suppressed our true history,

450
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,770
and written one which is favourable to Rome.

451
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,460
I could make good use of the money

452
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,160
that flows from them to Rome each year.

453
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,660
King Francois is richer than I am.

454
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:44,050
He taxes his subjects as he pleases.

455
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,260
I have to call parliament or there are riots.

456
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,090
Well, sir, with respect, Francois likes war too much

457
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,410
and trade too little.

458
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,410
There are more taxes to be raised when trade is good.

459
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,880
And if taxes are resisted, even by the Church

460
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,360
other ways can be found.

461
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,290
All right.

462
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,490
Sit down with my lawyers to discuss it.

463
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,840
Begin with the monasteries.

464
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,420
Some say that I should consider my marriage dissolved

465
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,220
and I should remarry as I please. And soon.

466
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,730
- But there are others who say... - I am one of the others.

467
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:04,540
Dear Christ, I shall be unmanned by it!

468
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,720
How long am I supposed to wait?!

469
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,040
Anne says she'll leave me.

470
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,720
Says there are other men.

471
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,340
Says she's wasting her youth.

472
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,000
Open up!

473
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,500
It's the king's men. Open up!

474
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,120
What is it? Is it an arrest?

475
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,230
- Good morning, William Brereton. - I'm here if you need me.

476
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,430
Are you up early, or down late, sir? Take the girls to bed.

477
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,820
Come, girls.

478
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,050
The king is at Greenwich. You're to come now.

479
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,770
Well, then, everybody, back to bed.

480
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,260
The king wouldn't invite me to Greenwich in order to arrest me.

481
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,040
It doesn't happen that way.

482
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,050
What does he want me for?

483
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,780
I really can't enlighten you.

484
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,760
Harry Norris.

485
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:37,610
Master Cromwell, we do meet under the strangest circumstances.

486
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,390
You, only, to come in.

487
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,520
He's waiting.

488
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,960
You stay here.

489
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,580
My dead brother came to me.

490
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,360
How did he look?

491
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,280
As I remember him. But he was pale.

492
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,930
And thin.

493
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,420
There was a white fire around him.

494
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,250
He died in Ludlow, in winter.

495
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,690
The roads were impenetrable.

496
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,700
They had to put his coffin on an ox cart.

497
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,160
I never saw him dead.

498
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,640
Until tonight.

499
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,120
The dead don't come back to complain of their burial.

500
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,680
He was so sad.

501
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:45,060
He's come back to make me ashamed.

502
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:48,140
For taking his kingdom.

503
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:50,820
Using his wife.

504
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,880
If Your majesty's brother died before he could reign...

505
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,450
.. then that was God's will.

506
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,650
And as for your supposed marriage,

507
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:08,100
we all know that that was clean,contrary to the scriptures.

508
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,700
But with God,

509
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,740
- there's mercy enough... - Not for me!

510
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,280
When I come to my judgment,

511
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:20,480
he will plead against me.

512
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,210
He has come to make me ashamed...

513
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,610
.. and I alone must bear it.

514
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,220
I...

515
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,200
I alone.

516
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,210
Did your brother speak to you?

517
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:48,960
Make any sign?

518
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:50,920
No.

519
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,980
Then you have read into his face something that wasn't there.

520
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,720
Listen to me.

521
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,610
You know what's written on Arthur's tomb?

522
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,340
"Rex quondam rexque futurus."

523
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:11,130
"King once, and king to be."

524
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:13,910
Your father made it sure.He came back from exile,

525
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,390
claimed his ancient right.

526
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,360
But it's not enough to claim a country, you have to hold it.

527
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,960
It has to be made secure,in every generation.

528
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,680
If your brother comes back and seems to say

529
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,160
that you have taken his kingdom, taken his place,

530
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:32,360
it's because he wants YOU to become the king he would have been.

531
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,970
He can't fulfil the prophecy,

532
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,240
a prince come out of Wales,

533
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,740
but he wills you to do it.

534
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,780
But why does he come back now?

535
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,120
I have been king for 20 years.

536
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:47,240
Because now is the vital time.

537
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,530
Now is the time for you to become the king you should be,

538
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:55,210
the sole and supreme head of your kingdom.

539
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,930
Ask Anne.

540
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,170
She'll say the same.

541
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,500
She does.

542
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,780
She says we should not bow to Rome.

543
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,850
And if your father should come to you in your dream,

544
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,440
you take it the same way as you take this one.

545
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,420
They come to strengthen your hand.

546
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,520
I see.

547
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,670
I understand it all now.

548
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,600
I knew who to send for.

549
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,800
I always do.

550
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,420
What happened?

551
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,560
The king had a dream.

552
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,440
A dream?

553
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,350
He got us out of bed for a dream?

554
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:17,790
Oh, believe me, he gets one out of bed for far less than that.

555
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:21,630
Was it a bad dream?

556
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,370
"Was it a bad dream?"

557
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,610
He thought it was.

558
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,900
It isn't now.

559
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,540
Your children love you.

560
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,820
We can't do without the man in charge.

561
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,390
Dr Cranmer, tell the Lady Anne

562
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,080
we did a good night's work for her tonight.

563
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,380
Quietly now.

564
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:03,130
Don't wake the house a second time.

565
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:05,930
Well done.

566
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,120
Safe?

567
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,240
Mm.

568
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,030
I thought...

569
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,650
What?

570
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:43,290
I thought it was going to be a reckoning.

571
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,960
A reckoning?

572
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:47,230
For what?

573
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,600
I don't know. All the things.

574
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,510
The paintings, the books and lutes, and I don't know what.

575
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,080
The things we have now.

576
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,110
You, sir, are a Roman pauper!

577
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,480
Sir, you are a fat Fleming,

578
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,610
and spread butter on your bread.

579
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,620
Well, sir, may your offspring eat snails.

580
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,920
Call Me Risley!

581
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,660
You look fit to be painted, Master Wriothesley! What are you about?

582
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,200
Waiting on the children. They're in high spirits this morning.

583
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,910
La la la la, la la la...

584
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,940
What's that?

585
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:29,610
It's a tune from my days in Italy.

586
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,370
I remember...

587
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,550
He never tells stories about himself.

588
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,400
Well, well... I, erm...

589
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,310
When I was in Italy, me and the...

590
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,670
.. me and the Portinari boys,

591
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,000
the Portinari boys,

592
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,350
we had a statue made,

593
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,600
a little smirking god with wings.

594
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,430
We beat it with hammers and chains,hired a muleteer and drove it to Rome

595
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:08,030
and sold it to a cardinal as an antique from the reign of Augustus.

596
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:12,360
I remember...

597
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:17,800
he. he had tears in his eyes when he paid us.

598
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,340
And when the Portinari
boys went back to Florence

599
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:24,510
they were staggering under
the weight of their purses.

600
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,680
- What did you do?  - What?

601
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,510
Took my cut, and stayed on to sell the mules, what do you think?

602
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,630
(Italian) ? Scaramella va alla guerra ?

603
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,870
(Italian) ? Colla lancia et la rotella ?

604
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,640
We hadn't finished dinner.

605
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:05,930
They came in,

606
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,840
they'd taken the keys from the porter.

607
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:11,790
They'd already set sentries on the stairs.

608
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,250
Who was it?

609
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,320
Harry Percy.

610
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:21,790
He was shaking.

611
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,600
I thought, "Why send him? Why Harry Percy?"'

612
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,510
Then I thought...

613
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,530
Lady Anne, you remember,

614
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,590
she was just a girl.

615
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:35,370
She wanted to marry him.

616
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,400
The cardinal stopped it.

617
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,660
Revenge.

618
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,800
She waited her time.

619
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,290
Harry,

620
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:53,760
if I'd known, I would have waited dinner for you.

621
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,100
I fear we've almost finished the fish.

622
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:02,640
- Shall I pray for a miracle?   - My lord, I arrest you for high treason.

623
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,840
Your warrant?

624
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,920
There are items in my instructions you may not see.

625
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:21,320
Well, if you won't show it,

626
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:23,900
I won't surrender to you.

627
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:27,790
So...

628
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,600
here's a state of affairs!

629
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,930
Come, George.

630
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,880
Look at me, George.

631
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,760
I'm not afraid of any man alive.

632
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,900
Um...

633
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:22,400
Er...

634
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:27,580
They took us from the house, rode south.

635
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:33,360
There were crowds waiting to see him, holding candles.

636
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:37,690
We thought they'd disperse, but they just stood all night in the road.

637
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:43,310
He stopped eating.

638
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,720
Why?

639
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,410
I don't know.

640
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:55,470
Some said... some said he wanted to destroy himself.

641
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,480
It all happened so fast.

642
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,850
And then Kingston came.

643
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,530
I had to tell him, Thomas.

644
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:07,420
I had to tell our lord that the Constable of the Tower

645
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:08,510
had come to fetch him.

646
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,270
He just kept saying "William Kingston?"

647
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,390
over and over, as if he couldn't believe it.

648
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,660
By the time we reached Leicester

649
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,510
he was too ill to stand.

650
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,680
He voided black blood.

651
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:33,130
I thought... poison...

652
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,280
Thomas...

653
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,490
He's coming, my lord.

654
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:55,050
Where... where is he?

655
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:56,280
You know Cromwell, my lord.

656
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,920
If he says he'll come, he'll be here.

657
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,680
'I'm sorry, Thomas.'

658
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:33,230
'He died the next day.'

659
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,890
They...

660
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,080
They gave him

661
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,010
a coffin of plain boards.

662
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:45,980
And the city officials came to view his body

663
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,990
so there couldn't be any false rumours that he'd escaped to France.

664
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:53,900
They... they made jokes.

665
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,970
They made jokes about his low birth!

666
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:09,680
Come, Wolsey! We're fetching you to Hell,

667
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:11,750
where our master, Beelzebub,

668
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,200
is expecting you to supper!

669
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:19,000
Beelzebub would have you joint his venison.

670
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,760
He's heard of your skill as a butcher!

671
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,990
'"I swear to be a true and faithful councillor..."'

672
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,240
"to the King's Majesty as one of His Highness's Privy Council."

673
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,170
I swear to be a true and faithful councillor

674
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,390
to the King's Majesty as one of His Highness's Privy Council.

675
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:05,260
"I shall not know or understand of any manner thing to be attempted,

676
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:08,080
"done, or spoken against His Majesty's person..."

677
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,310
I shall not know or understand of any manner thing

678
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:15,210
to be attempted, done, or spoken against His Majesty's person.

679
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:23,260
'"I swear to uphold the king's authorities.

680
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,870
'"I swear to uphold the king's jurisdictions..."

681
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,690
'I swear to uphold the king's authorities.

682
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:32,970
'I swear to uphold the king's jurisdictions.

683
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,690
'"I swear to uphold the king's heirs and lawful successors."'

684
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,920
I swear to uphold the king's heirs and lawful successors.

685
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:01,770
I knelt by his body...

686
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,770
.. and I wept

687
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,770
and I prayed to God to send vengeance upon them all!

688
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:13,920
There's no need to trouble God, George.

689
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,100
I'll take it in hand.

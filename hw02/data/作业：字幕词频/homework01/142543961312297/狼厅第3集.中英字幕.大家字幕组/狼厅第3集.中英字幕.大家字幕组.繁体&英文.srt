第1季 第3集

7
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
公元1531年 自脅迫教皇失敗后
亨利八世向國會要求賦予他
英格蘭教區內至高無上的權力
以求自行廢除與凱瑟琳王后的婚姻關系

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,560
那些羅馬教廷的死忠 與日漸興起的異端邪說 展開了激烈的斗爭

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,160
其中最主要的死忠是 大法官閣下 托馬斯 莫爾爵士

10
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,260
"從前在百姓中有假先知起來 將來在你們中間
Fuerunt vero et pseudoprophetae in populo,

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,380
也必有假師傅
sicut et in vobis erunt magistri mendaces...

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,340
私自引進害人的異端邪說
..qui introducunt sectas perditionis,

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,340
連買他們的主他們也不承認
et eum qui emit eos, Dominum negant,

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,620
自取速速的滅亡"  [《圣經新約》 - 彼得后書]
superducentes sibi celerem perditionem.

15
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,140
克倫威爾學士？
Master Cromwell?

16
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,380
女士 您女兒應該站站好
Madam, your daughter should sit.

17
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,340
立正站直
Stand up straight.

18
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,500
這位是克倫威爾學士
This is Master Cromwell.

19
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,780
他以前是個放債者 現在負責撰寫所有的法律章程
He used to be a money-lender. Now he writes all the laws.

20
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,220
我聽說你的新議案
I have heard all about your new bill

21
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,980
誘使國王將自己視為英格蘭教區的首腦？
inducing the King to describe himself as the head of the church?

22
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,940
只有教皇冕下一人是全世界教區的最高首腦
The Pope is the head of the church everywhere.

23
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,060
所有政權的合法性都是經過...
The lawfulness of all government flows from the...

24
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,140
經過...
..from...

25
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,060
坐下來吧 瑪麗公主殿下
Will you not sit down, Princess Mary?

26
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,540
這椅子不會涼著您
It's just the heat.

27
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,140
我請求王后您換一下思路
I beg your madam to consider it in this way -

28
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,780
國王陛下只不過是重新定義了一個職位的概念 何況古有先例...
the King has merely defined a position which ancient precedents...

29
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,940
自古而有的先例？
Ancient precedents?

30
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,380
那不過是你這三個月里編出來的先例而已
Precedents that you've invented these last three months.

31
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,300
至于您說"誘使" 王后您是知道的國王陛下是不會輕易被引導的
As for "induced" - Your Highness knows the King cannot be led.

32
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,020
但能被慫恿誘惑
But he can be enticed.

33
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,980
他連一句再見都沒有說 拋棄一切離開了
He has ridden off without saying goodbye.

34
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,060
他以前從未這樣做過 從未有之！
He's never done that before. Never.

35
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,020
這個 我想他是去切特西那邊狩獵幾天而已
Well, I think he means to hunt out of Chertsey for a few days.

36
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,020
是和那個女人一起去
With the woman. The person.

37
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,220
國王陛下去了另外的行宮
Your Highness will be going to another palace.

38
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,580
他挑了在赫特福德郡的莫爾家
He has chosen the More, in Hertfordshire,

39
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,460
您也知道 那里氣候宜人
which as you know is very comfortable.

40
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,620
那曾經是你們某個紅衣主教的宮殿吧
It was one of your cardinal's houses, wasn't it?

41
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,460
所以必定是奢華至極的
So it's bound to be lavish.

42
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,940
希望如此
I expected this.

43
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,220
但我不希望他隨便派個你這樣的人來告訴我
But I didn't expect he would send a man like you to tell me.

44
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,540
我想給你樣東西
I want to give you something.

45
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,020
當作禮物
A present.

46
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,780
任何你想要的東西
Name anything you want.

47
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,220
你想要什么
What is it?

48
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,380
你的那項法案
This bill of yours.

49
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,420
這不是我的法案
It's not my bill.

50
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,060
從主教們身上奪取權力 再賦予亨利為教會首腦
Taking power from the bishops, making Henry head of the church.

51
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,740
你難道不害怕么
Aren't you afraid?

52
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,780
害怕什么
Of what?

53
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,060
有一個叫伊麗莎白 巴頓的女孩做出來預言
There's this girl called Elizabeth Barton making prophecies.

54
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,860
他們管她叫 圣女
They're calling her the Holy Maid.

55
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:02,980
她說如若亨利娶了安妮 他的王位終將不保
She's saying Henry won't reign for a year if he marries Anne.

56
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,380
還有說月亮旁邊新冒出來了一個星星
And there's a new star by the moon, and the...

57
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,820
那不是星星 那是彗星
It's not a star. It's a comet.

58
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,420
上次它出現還是在約翰國王在位時
..and the last time it appeared was under King John

59
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,180
那時萬物凋零 寸草不生
and the cattle stopped breeding and the grass stopped growing

60
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,980
千山鳥飛絕
and the birds fell from the sky.

61
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,500
如果真的發生這些事 我們倒是可以調整政策的方向性了
Well, I'm sure if that happens, we can reverse our policy.

62
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,740
我一點也不信預兆這回事
I don't believe in omens.

63
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,580
他們逮捕了一個律師 詹姆斯 班罕
They've arrested a barrister - James Bainham.

64
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,300
你認識他的吧？
You know him, don't you?

65
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,740
對 他是個好人
Yes. He's a good man.

66
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,860
但他被搜出了英譯版的圣經
He was handing out the gospel in English.

67
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,060
如果他們嚴刑逼供怎么辦
What if they torture Bainham?

68
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,100
如果他供出了你怎么辦
What if he...gives names?

69
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,700
不用擔心我 托馬斯 莫爾早就知道了
What's that to me? Thomas More already knows my name.

70
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,700
同意法案的請站我右手邊 反對的站左手邊
Those for the bill to my right, those against to my left.

71
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,340
我想 法案通過了！ 通過！
I think the "ayes" have it. The "ayes" have it!

72
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,660
國王陛下
Your Majesty.

73
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,700
恭喜你了 我猜這分隊投票是你的主意吧
Congratulations. I take it the division of the house was your idea?

74
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,500
我想這樣才能讓國王陛下一目了然他的追隨者
I thought this way His Majesty could see who was with him

75
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,860
及反對者們
and who against him.

76
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,540
至少也要分清國會中的派別
In the Commons, at least.

77
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,060
我知道斯蒂芬是反對法案的 克倫威爾
I know Stephen is opposed to the bill, Cromwell.

78
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,140
我也不想有個只會應聲附和的仆從
I don't want a servant who will agree with everything.

79
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,380
我需要的是能應付論戰的人才
I need men who aren't afraid of controversy.

80
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,380
我知道你們倆一直爭論不休
Now, I know you two quarrel.

81
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,060
但現在 你們必須要學會通力合作
You must learn to pull together.

82
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,900
這個寒冬 你們倆 軛不離犁 犁不離軛 一起干活
This winter, you have to be yoked to the plough.

83
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,500
你應該知道讓上議院通過法案并不是件易事
You won't find it so easy passing your bill through the House of Lords.

84
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,580
托馬斯 莫爾和古老的家族們都是支持教皇的
Thomas More and the old aristocracy are for the Pope

85
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,260
且并不怕國王知曉
and not afraid to say so.

86
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,060
這個嘛 等著看好了 沃罕大主教
Well, we'll see. Archbishop Warham.

87
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:18,020
那位被你藏在教區里的女先知 伊麗莎白 巴頓
This um, prophetess you harbour in your diocese - Eliza Barton?

88
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,860
她還好嗎
How is she getting on?

89
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,740
你想要干嘛 克倫威爾
What do you want, Cromwell?

90
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,180
我聽說她四處傳播
Well, I hear that she's telling people

91
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,140
如國王娶了安妮夫人 那就不久于王位了
that if the King marries Lady Anne, he has only a year to reign.

92
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,060
我只想知道誰教她這么說的
I just wondered who is controlling her.

93
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,820
她也許只是一個簡單的鄉村姑娘 但她確實天賦異稟
She may be a simple country girl but she has a genuine gift.

94
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,700
是啊 確實是
She does, doesn't she?

95
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,980
我想她也能預知您是因何而亡的
I hear she can tell you where your dead relatives are.

96
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,580
如在天堂 她將更高亢
If it's in Heaven, she speaks with a higher voice,

97
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,700
如在地獄 她將更低沉
if in Hell, with a deep voice.

98
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,420
她也可以一見面
She can also tell what sins

99
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,100
就說出這人的罪行
weigh upon a man as soon as she meets him.

100
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,740
她見到你 會說什么呢
What would she make of you?

101
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,820
安特衛普之行怎么樣 [比利時城市]
How was Antwerp?

102
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,140
很高興到家了
Glad to be home.

103
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,140
噢
Oh.

104
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,340
裝裝樣子的 怕沿途出亂子
For show. In case I got stopped.

105
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,340
嗯
Hmm.

106
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,740
- 嗯哼     - 在中間的夾縫里
- Mm-hmm.  - Centre seam.

107
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,380
- 他說什么?           - 你一直帶著卻沒有讀嗎
- What does he say?   - You carried it without reading it?

108
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,100
為了以防不測 我不想提前知道
I didn't want to know. In case.

109
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,980
如果托馬斯 莫爾 想方設法要接近你的話
If Thomas More came anywhere near you,

110
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,340
我會將他拖出他的威斯敏斯特教區
I'd drag him out of his court in Westminster

111
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,940
然后用鵝卵石上砸他的腦袋 直到把上帝憐愛砸進去
and beat his head on the cobbles until I'd knocked some of God's love into it.

112
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,580
- 汀代爾會回來嗎            - 嗯
- Will Tynedale come back?  - M'hm.

113
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,300
只要國王同意將圣經譯成英文
When the King says yes to the scripture being translated into English.

114
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,260
但即使那樣 他也不會相信莫爾給他安全保證 因為
But even then, he won't trust More to give him safe conduct, because

115
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,460
莫爾曾說 根本不必對一個異教徒的信守承諾
More says you don't have to keep the promise you made to a heretic.

116
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,900
總之 汀代爾仍在嚴詞抗爭國王的離婚案
Anyway, Tynedale still refuses to support the King's divorce.

117
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,020
你也許會想 他作為英格蘭國王的朋友
You'd think he'd bend a point of principle to make

118
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,620
不應該那么堅持原則的
a friend of the King of England.

119
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,780
但其實不然 汀代爾和莫爾 他們倆還真是配
But, no. Tynedale and More - they deserve each other.

120
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,940
倆雜種都裝的像正人君子一樣
These mules who pose as men.

121
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,420
夫人
My lady.

122
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,500
弓有問題
It's the bow.

123
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,140
當然 應該是支架的高度
No doubt. It could be the brace height.

124
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,460
可以幫我們換下弓嗎
Could we swap the bows, please?

125
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,260
她還是和小時候一樣
She was the same in the nursery.

126
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,620
"羅賓漢"在哪  我已將派人找他去了
Where's Robin Hood? I have dispatches.

127
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,220
他到日落時 才會見他們
He won't look at them until sundown.

128
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,580
他之后就不忙了嗎
Won't he be occupied then?

129
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,180
她在一點一點誘惑他
She's selling herself by the inch.

130
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,940
她每露出一截大腿 就要很多現金禮物
She wants a cash present for every advance above her knee.

131
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,620
并且她的腿很長
She's got long legs.

132
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,340
等國王能一搗黃龍時 國家估計也破產了
By the time he reaches her secret part, the nation'll be bankrupt!

133
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,700
我...我聽到了一個謠言...
I er, I had heard a rumour...

134
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,140
她沒懷 否則我會知道的
She isn't. I would know.

135
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,180
如果她把衣服加厚了 我也是要幫她墊衣服的人
If she thickened at all, I'd be the one to have to let out her clothes.

136
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,140
我知道她腰圍的每分每寸
I know her waist by the inch.

137
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,420
而且 她不可能懷的 因為他們還沒有...
Besides, she can't be. Because they still haven't.

138
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,180
- 她會告訴你這些     - 當然
- She'd tell you?    - Of course.

139
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,540
一氣之下說的
Out of spite.

140
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,140
我想要一份工作
I want a job.

141
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,460
正式的職位
An official post.

142
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,060
在珠寶宮殿最好
In the Jewel House, perhaps?

143
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,180
我會告訴她的
I'll tell her.

144
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,940
她讓湯姆 懷特成了一名詩人 哈利 珀西為之瘋狂
She made Tom Wyatt a poet and Harry Percy mad.

145
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,420
我肯定她對你也有些想法
I'm sure she has some idea what to make you.

146
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,220
上周 在格林威治
Last week, at Greenwich,

147
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,220
一個修士給我們傳道
a Friar preached to us

148
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,420
講的是關于一個好國王被一個淫婦所毀的故事
about the good king who was corrupted by the wicked Jezebel.

149
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,220
她建了一座異教徒的寺宇
Apparently she built a pagan temple

150
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,700
并且讓巴爾的信徒進入禮拜  [墮落神 耶和華最大的敵人]
and let the priests of Baal into the palace.

151
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,180
最后她被扔出了窗外
She ended up being thrown out of a window.

152
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,580
現在我成了那個淫婦了 你懂沒 
I'm the Jezebel, you see

153
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,860
而你就是信仰巴爾的教徒
and you're the priests of Baal.

154
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,900
我明白
I see.

155
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,700
莫爾逮捕了一名律師 詹姆斯 班罕
More has arrested a barrister, James Bainham.

156
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,460
- 你想讓我做什么                          - 和國王求求情
- What do you expect me to do about it?   - Talk to the King.

157
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,460
你知道該如何取悅他的
You know how to please him, I suppose?

158
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,740
用我的處女之身換你的律師
My maidenhead for your lawyer?

159
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,460
我保證他會被釋放的
He'll be released.

160
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,620
嗯...
Well...

161
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,700
..小比爾耐就沒有釋放
..Little Bilney wasn't.

162
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,860
他們在諾威奇把他活活燒死了
They burnt him in Norwich.

163
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,820
只要你的律師朋友公開道歉認錯 他就馬上被釋放
Your barrister friend will recant and he'll be released.

164
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,820
如果他不呢
And if he doesn't?

165
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,260
那他就是個傻瓜
Then he's a fool.

166
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:34,540
人不為己 天誅地滅
People should say whatever will keep them alive.

167
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,820
難道你不是嗎
You would, wouldn't you?

168
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,460
你抱的什么
What's that?

169
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,140
啊
Ah.

170
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,540
給一個小女孩的禮物
It's a gift for one of your women.

171
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,540
就是那個經常哭的小女孩
The little girl who always cries.

172
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,300
怎么了
What?

173
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,220
你難道沒聽說嗎
Didn't you hear?

174
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,420
沒有 什么事
No, what?

175
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,340
她的父親 親愛的老約翰 西摩爵士
Her father - dear old Sir John Seymour?

176
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:09,780
在干草棚里 他和他兒子愛德華的妻子 被捉奸了
He was caught in the hayloft with his son Edward's wife.

177
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,660
好像前兩年里 他每周都能和她鬼混
It seems he's had her every week for the last two years.

178
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,860
然后愛德華就把他妻子打發進了尼姑庵去
Edward's put the wife into a nunnery

179
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,140
所以我可不認為我們能很快在議會上看到親愛的老約翰爵士了
and I don't think we'll see dear old Sir John at court soon.

180
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,900
那他女兒 叫珍妮的 對吧
And the daughter? Jane, is it?

181
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,420
那個臉色蒼白的女孩嗎 去了威爾特郡
Pasty-face? Gone to Wiltshire.

182
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,820
其實她最好的選擇也是去尼姑庵
It's her best bet to get into a nunnery too.

183
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,140
現在沒有人想娶這種懦弱的人
No-one want will want to marry the milksop now.

184
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,460
這是什么東西
What is it?

185
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,820
這只是...
It's only...

186
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,500
...一本有著編織圖案的書
..a book of needlework patterns.

187
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,300
你是喜歡她嗎
You don't LIKE her...do you?

188
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,420
因為我不能確定 你送她禮物這事是否合適
Because I'm not sure it's proper for you to send her a present.

189
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,140
哎呀 這又不是什么薄伽丘的童話集
Well, it's not like it's tales from Boccaccio.

190
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,100
噢 他們居然稱薄伽丘那鬼東西叫童話!
Oh, they could tell Boccaccio a tale!

191
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,060
那些身在狼廳的罪人們
Those sinners at Wolf Hall.

192
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,740
嗯哼?
Mm-hmm?

193
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,420
大法官閣下
Lord Chancellor.

194
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,300
你應該先知會我一聲的
You should have warned me.

195
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,900
您要吃些東西嗎
You'll have something to eat?

196
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,500
- 謝謝 不了       - 那要喝點什么 來點酒?
- Thank you, no.  - Something to drink then? Some wine?

197
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,580
你的朋友 班罕
Your friend, Bainham?

198
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,060
他已經拋棄了那些異端邪說
He has recanted his heresy

199
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,500
被釋放了
and been set free.

200
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,900
我覺得你應該先知曉
I thought you should know.

201
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,820
是啊 謝謝你
Well, thank you.

202
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,060
我卻聽說 他被用刑了
I heard that he'd been put to the rack.

203
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,980
為了拯救他的靈魂 我是主張對他用鞭刑的
To save his soul, I would have had him whipped,

204
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,020
我主張將他綁著手腕吊起來與鋼鐵一同燃燒
I'd have had him burnt with irons,

205
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,420
與鋼鐵...一同燃燒
I'd have had him...hung by his wrists.

206
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,540
在過去十年中 土耳其人已經占領了貝爾格萊德
In these last ten years, the Turks have taken Belgrade.

207
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,580
他們已經將營火燒到了布達的大圖書館
They have lit their campfires in the great library at Buda.

208
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,580
這距離他們被困在維也納 不過只有兩年而已
It is only two years since they were at the gates of Vienna.

209
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:14,620
你為什么還要在基督世界中 再搞一次大破壞呢
Why would you want to make another breach in the walls of Christendom?

210
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,940
英格蘭國王 并不是異教徒
The King of England is not an infidel.

211
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,100
- 我也不是    - 你不是嗎
- Nor am I.   - Aren't you?

212
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,100
我認為你的信仰是利益至上
I think your faith is for purchase.

213
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,780
只要出價滿意 你甚至都會去效忠蘇丹[奧斯曼帝國的最高統治者]
I think you would serve the Sultan if the price was right.

214
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,940
不要以為你現在是個小小議員 你就可以背著國王
You think because you're a councillor you can negotiate

215
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,940
跟那些異教徒打交道 你錯了
with heretics behind the King's back. You're wrong.

216
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,260
我已經知道你那些往來的信件了
I know about your letters that come and go.

217
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,740
也知道你一直在和汀代爾保持聯系
I know you are in communication with Tyndale.

218
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,380
你是在威脅我嗎
Are you threatening me?

219
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,580
只是感興趣而已
I'm just interested.

220
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,780
是 是的
Yes. Yes.

221
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,340
這是我一直在做的事
That's precisely what I'm doing.

222
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,500
你還是沒告訴我你想要什么禮物
You still haven't told me what you want as a present.

223
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,340
我媽媽知道了
My mother knows.

224
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,100
我們的事
About us.

225
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,620
我...我想...
I...I think...

226
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,540
我想我們已經做了我們該做的事
I think we've done what we have

227
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,380
因為莉茲去世的時候 我們都很震驚
because when Liz died, we were shocked.

228
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,660
我們很遺憾
We were sorry.

229
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,140
但我認為我們現在都該放下了
I think we have to leave off that now.

230
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,300
如果...如果我丈夫...
If...if my husband had -

231
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,660
上帝寬恕我 但每到冬天我都覺得會是他的最后一段生命
God forgive me but every winter I think is his last -

232
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,980
然后 當然...我想和你... 毫無疑問
then of course, I would, without question.

233
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,820
但是...
But then...

234
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,700
法律不會允許這樣的 所以...
the law wouldn't allow that, so...

235
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,380
如果你想要續娶 梅茜有給你準備一長串名單
If, if you want to marry, Mercy has her list.

236
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:52,380
你也可能有了心儀的人選 也許還是我們不認識的人 所以...
You probably have your own list, with names on it we don't know, so...

237
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,020
莉茲
Liz.

238
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,380
約翰娜
Johane.

239
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,180
佛朗西斯 布萊恩來了 有些不好的事發生了
Francis Bryan is here. It's something bad.

240
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,060
他是安妮的表親 我一定要...
He's Anne's cousin. I'll have to...

241
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,460
珀西的妻子怎么說
What does Percy's wife say?

242
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,820
她說她會去請求國會準許離婚
She says she's going to petition Parliament for divorce.

243
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,060
她說她已經有兩年是自己獨睡的了
She says he hasn't shared her bed for two years,

244
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,260
而且她問他原因時 他說他不能
and when she asked him why he said he couldn't.

245
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,180
那為什么她要等了兩年之后才問
Why has she waited two years to ask?

246
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,580
她一直在問
She has been asking.

247
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,100
昨晚 他終于承認了他做不到
And last night, he finally admitted he can't sleep with her

248
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,100
- 因為他們沒有真正結婚                 - 什么?
- because they're not really married.  - What?

249
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,460
因為哈利 珀西實際上是與安妮 博林結了婚的
Because Harry Percy's actually married to Anne Boleyn.

250
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,780
把它們弄下來!
Bring them down!

251
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,940
我們已經把大部分碎玻璃渣掃干凈了
We've swept up most of the broken glass.

252
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,700
關上門 佛朗西斯 別讓任何人進來
Shut the door, Francis and don't let anybody in.

253
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,780
我建議我們把安妮的東西打包 然后送她去肯特
I suggest we pack Anne's bags and send her to Kent.

254
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,060
國王的怒氣一度...
The King's anger once...

255
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,900
再說一個字 我就揍你
Say one more word and I'll punch you.

256
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,540
國王已經說了必須當著整個議會的面 進行一場審問
The King has said there must be an inquiry, before the whole council.

257
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,140
如果安妮真的隱瞞了一樁秘密婚姻...
If Anne has concealed a secret marriage...

258
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,780
天啊 你閉嘴我真希望我能跟你離婚!
Jesus, I wish I could divorce you!

259
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,500
我真希望你有個婚前契約 但沒這機會了
I wish you'd had a pre-contract. But no chance of that.

260
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,260
在這么下去 這里所有人全完了!
The fields were black with men running the other fucking way!

261
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,860
- 喬治!    - 我否認一切
- George!  - I deny everything.

262
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,980
- 很好    - 哈利 珀西 是說過愛我 我也認同了他的愛情
- Good.   - Harry Percy spoke of love, I'll allow that.

263
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,420
可我們之間根本就沒有任何婚姻契約
But there was no contract.

264
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,500
也沒有行房之事
And no consummation.

265
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,580
我妹妹是個名聲不好的處女
My sister is a notorious virgin.

266
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,100
你跟國王說這事的時候 他態度如何
How was the King when you spoke to him?

267
00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:00,580
如果不告訴克倫威爾大人事實真相  那叫他到這里來干什么
What is the use of calling in Master Cromwell and not telling him what has already occurred?

268
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,340
國王拂袖而去 留她獨自站在那
The King walked out of the room and left her standing.

269
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,020
在我看來 這事有很多解決辦法
It seems to me there are a number of approaches here.

270
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,900
噢 天哪!
Oh, Jesus Christ!

271
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,300
[我實在是不會翻了 有大神 請指點！]
By the thrice-beshitten shroud of Lazarus!

272
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,780
你還在慢慢選你的辦法時 你的女兒
While you're selecting your approach, your daughter, sir,

273
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,900
在被人造謠中傷         - 哈利...   - 國王的思想已經被毒害
- is being slandered.  - Harry...  - The King's mind is poisoned,

274
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,140
而這個家族的財富 也會在你眼前灰飛煙滅!
and this family's fortune is unmaking before your fucking eyes!

275
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,820
能讓我說句話么
Will you let me speak?

276
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,580
哈利 佩西曾被強制去忘記他的誓詞
Harry Percy was persuaded once to forget his claim.

277
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,380
-如果他能再被強制一次...     - 的確如此 不過那時有紅衣主教能壓制他
- If he was fixed once...    - Yes. But the Cardinal fixed him then.

278
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,300
但很不幸 紅衣主教現在死了
And unfortunately the Cardinal is dead.

279
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,060
安妮夫人
Lady Anne,

280
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,700
如果連教皇冕下都不能阻止您登上王后寶座
if the Pope cannot stop you becoming Queen -

281
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,060
當然 我也不認為他具備這樣的能力
and I don't think he can -

282
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,700
那么 哈利 珀西就更沒能力能阻攔您了
I don't see why Harry Percy should be allowed to stand in your way.

283
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,060
所以就直接把他趕回去唄
So shift him out of it.

284
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,620
做去吧
Do it.

285
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,140
真他媽想打爆他腦袋
Beat his fucking skull in.

286
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,060
上來玩玩啦
Why don't you come up?!

287
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,540
要找女人玩玩嗎
Looking for a woman?

288
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,740
呵 我就猜到你會來了 
Oh, God, yes, I thought you'd come.

289
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,820
嘿 出去
Hey  out.

290
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,380
你現在就是在浪費時間 安妮對我做過保證
Well, you're wasting your time. I was pledged to Anne.

291
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,660
我能陪她享受這閑暇時光 
She allowed me such freedom with herself

292
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,860
做一個訂婚的女人該做的事
as only a betrothed woman would allow.

293
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,940
那次紅衣主教恐嚇我 不許說任何事
The Cardinal bullied me out of saying anything last time,

294
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,580
現在我也不怕說出真相了
but I'm not afraid to speak the truth now.

295
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,260
閣下 你已經說了你該說的話了 
My lord, you've said what you have to say.

296
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,020
現在 該輪到我說了
Now listen to me.

297
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,940
你是個一窮二白的人
You're a man whose money is almost spent.

298
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,420
我也對你了如指掌
I'm a man who knows how you've spent it.

299
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,660
你在全歐洲都已經是債臺高筑了
You're a man who has borrowed all over Europe.

300
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,820
我也恰好知道你所有的欠債人姓甚名誰
I'm a man who knows your creditors.

301
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,500
只要我一句話 欠債條能瞬間把你淹沒
One word from me, and all your debts will be called in.

302
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,740
他們能做什么呢 銀行家可沒有軍隊
What are they going to do? Bankers don't have armies.

303
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,860
分文沒有的你 又拿什么保護自己
Neither will you, without any money.

304
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,500
閣下 國王賜予你伯爵爵位 
My lord, you hold your earldom from the King.

305
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,940
是想讓你為他守護北部邊防 幫他抵御蘇格蘭的侵略
Your task is to secure the north, to defend us against Scotland.

306
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,220
如果你讓他失望的話 國王毫無疑問 會收回你的封地和頭銜
If you cannot ensure these things, the King will take your land

307
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,100
轉而賞給那些
and your titles and give them

308
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,580
能力遠在你之上的臣子
to someone who will do the job that you cannot do.

309
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,820
不 他不會的 他很尊重這些自古流傳下來的家族頭銜
No, he won't. He respects all ancient titles.

310
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,140
我該怎么向你解釋呢
How can I explain this to you...?

311
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,500
這個世界已經不再是你所認為的那樣了
The world is not run from where you think it is.

312
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,380
從邊疆堡壘
From border fortresses.

313
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,300
甚至從白宮
Even from Whitehall.

314
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,860
從安特衛普 佛羅倫薩 里斯本
The world is run from Antwerp, from Florence, from Lisbon.

315
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:43,620
從那些商船們西行的揚帆之地開始 都變了
From wherever the merchant ships set sail off into the west.

316
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,540
不再是城堡的高晼A從數量有限的馬匹開始
Not from castle walls, from counting houses.

317
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:51,180
從那些刮花本票的鋼筆開始
From the pens that scrape out your promissory notes.

318
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,060
請相信我所說的
So believe me when I say

319
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,500
我會和我那些銀行的朋友們一起 毀了你的人生
that my banker friends and I will rip your life apart.

320
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,820
然后 當你失去財產和頭銜開始  是的  我都可以想象的出
And then, when you are without money and title, yes, I can picture you

321
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,740
你身處山洞 身著布衣的畫面
living in a hovel, wearing homespun,

322
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,100
打回一只野兔 晚餐煮湯喝
bringing home a rabbit for the pot.

323
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,380
安妮 博林 你的合法妻子 為兔子剝皮 填料 
Your lawful wife, Anne Boleyn, skinning and jointing that rabbit.

324
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,140
就是這樣了 希望你幸福快樂
Yes, I wish you all happiness.

325
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,340
你從來都不會有所察覺
You were never pre-contracted.

326
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,180
只相信自己心里所想 可事實上 事與愿違
Any understanding you think you have, you didn't have it.

327
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,620
如果你認為 安妮夫人是真的愛你
And if you think Lady Anne loves you

328
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,420
你大錯特錯了
you couldn't be more mistaken.

329
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,820
我剛從她那兒過來
I've just come from her.

330
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,860
她很厭惡你
She hates you.

331
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,340
瞧不起你
She despises you.

332
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,780
恨不得你立馬消失
She wants you gone.

333
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:51,980
所以 如果你再說一句和安妮夫人享受自由的話
So if you say one more word about Lady Anne's "freedom" with you,

334
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,260
你是在自掘墳墓
I will come and drag you out of whatever hole

335
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,860
而諾爾福克公爵也會把你的臭嘴撕裂
you are cowering in and the Duke of Norfolk will bite your bollocks off.

336
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,100
閣下 我這么解釋 你應該明白了吧
I do hope that's clear, my lord?

337
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,980
來 你們隨意偷看偷聽吧
Yes, you can all peer in again.

338
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,020
他來了
There he is.

339
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:35,020
在他一連數月無政績被免職之后 我和叔叔就來到這里工作
My uncle and I work for his removal for months without success

340
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,940
現在 他卻辭職了
and now he resigns.

341
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,260
結算了工資
Over this bill.

342
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,180
他前途無量
His great protest.

343
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,060
英格蘭對于他 只是一個小舞臺
England is just a stage to him.

344
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,420
誰能會接替他的職位
Who should replace him?

345
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,100
想辦法讓國王任命 奧德利
Put it in the King's mind to appoint Audley.

346
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,180
他人不錯 而且我想 他也很懂我的心思
He's a good man. And he understands me, I think.

347
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,300
根本沒人了解
Do you think that someone does?

348
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,780
身為大主教的克蘭麥
Cranmer as Archbishop,

349
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,460
身為大法官的奧德利
Audley as Lord Chancellor.

350
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,620
很快 哪里都有你的人了
Soon you'll have friends everywhere.

351
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,260
那你自己呢
And for yourself?

352
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,860
我想 也許是珠寶宮殿的看守員吧
I thought perhaps Keeper of the Jewel House?

353
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,380
辦公室的鎖鏈在哪 他應該是要交接的
Where's the chain of office? He's supposed to hand it over.

354
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,700
在那袋子里
In the bag.

355
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,700
所以就這樣嗎
So that's it?

356
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,620
莫爾就這樣走了
More is out?

357
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,340
我們要下去么
Shall we go down?

358
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,780
你啊...
You...

359
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,780
你會承受不住的
you can't resist it.

360
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,220
- 你也一樣          - 不會的
- No more can you.  - No.

361
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,180
你現在準備去干什么
What will you do now?

362
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,540
寫書
Write.

363
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,140
禱告
Pray.

364
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:42,020
我的建議  少寫 多祈禱
My recommendation - write only a little and pray a lot.

365
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,180
這算是威脅嗎
Now, is that a threat?

366
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,620
也該輪到我了 是吧
My turn, don't you think?

367
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,140
我們要去加來
We're off to Calais.

368
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:04,620
法國國王已經同意 一道諫言教皇
The King of France had agreed to speak to the Pope

369
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,500
支持我的新婚姻
in favour of my new marriage.

370
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,220
我們要在加來見面 探討談判的內容
We'll meet there to discuss points of a treaty.

371
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,300
上次我們見面時
Last time we met,

372
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,300
沃爾西操辦了所有事
Wolsey arranged everything.

373
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:23,780
這次我想你來安排
I thought perhaps you could help organise things this time?

374
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,220
靠著我 陛下
Lean on me, Your Majesty.

375
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,500
我們會帶著大隊人馬到坎特伯雷
We'll take mass at Canterbury.

376
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,180
讓人們朝見一下他們的國王
Let the people see their king.

377
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,780
你認識這個女人嗎
Do you know this woman?

378
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,260
以前認識
I used to.

379
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,060
她讓我想起了很久以前在安特衛普
She reminds me of someone I knew long ago.

380
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,660
認識的人
In Antwerp.

381
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,220
她叫什么名字
What was her name?

382
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,820
安賽姆
Anselma.

383
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,940
你知道什么是激情嗎 克倫威爾
You've known passion, Cromwell.

384
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:19,460
和安妮...時 我會渾身顫抖
With Anne... I shake.

385
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,860
你明白我的意思？
Do you understand?

386
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,220
我顫抖了
I shake.

387
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,740
我也試過其他女人
I've tried other women,

388
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:34,580
想讓她們激起我的強烈的欲望...
tried them just to try to take the edge off the lust...

389
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,700
但全都失敗了
but I failed with all of them.

390
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,500
我做不到
Couldn't do it.

391
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,820
你不覺得這恰好是證明嗎
Which is proof, don't you think?

392
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,580
證明我的追求是對的
Proof of the rightness of my pursuit.

393
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:59,100
我只追逐著一個女人
I hunt only one hind -

394
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,060
她引領我由幽徑到達叢林深處...
and she takes me from the path and into the woods...

395
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,700
現在 回我們的冷被窩里去吧
Now, away to our cold beds.

396
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,060
還是只是我一個人的冷被窩
Or is that just mine?

397
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,180
你有的忙活了
There's work to do.

398
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,820
我有一項新職位給你
I have a new post for you.

399
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,220
我要你負責看管我的珍寶宮殿
I want you to be my Keeper of the Jewel House.

400
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,700
陛下
Your Majesty.

401
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,740
為什么不行 誰說我不可以？
Why not? Why shouldn't I?

402
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:46,180
誰說我不可以任用一個忠誠無二的鐵匠的兒子
Who says I shouldn't employ the son of an honest blacksmith!

403
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,740
你的一切
Everything that you are,

404
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,620
你擁有的一切
everything that you have,

405
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,820
我都能賜予你
will come from me.

406
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,420
陛下！
Majesty!

407
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,860
陛下！
Majesty!

408
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,540
這是那個圣女 讓我見見她
This is the Holy Maid. Let me see her.

409
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,460
女士 你有什么想對我說的嗎
Madam, you have something to say to me?

410
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,860
您應該燒死身邊的那些異教分子
The heretics you have around you must be put into a great fire.

411
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,060
您如果不這么做 被燒死的會是您自己
If you don't do it, you'll burn yourself.

412
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:53,660
什么異教分子？ 我的人里面沒有異端分子
What heretics? I keep no heretics about my person.

413
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:58,460
她就是 如果您和她結婚 您的王位在七個月之內將不保
Here's one. If you marry this one, you won't reign seven months.

414
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,420
你的謊話就不能編的像樣點嗎
Couldn't you at least round it up?

415
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,300
我見到了您的母親 被幽冥鬼火包圍著
I see your mother - surrounded by pale fires.

416
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,220
- 我母親 在哪？         - 她瘋了 應該把她鞭笞至死
- My mother? Where?     - She's mad. She should be whipped!

417
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,940
她可是圣女  她說的話只受上帝指引
She's a very holy person. Her speech is inspired by heaven.

418
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,740
你會遭雷劈的
Lightning will strike you!

419
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,700
在我踹死她前
Drag her back to the whorehouse

420
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,140
把她給我拖到妓院去！
before she feels my boot on her arse!

421
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,460
把她帶走！帶走！
Take her away! Take her away!

422
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,660
小姐？
Mistress?

423
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,140
我曾是已故的沃爾西主教的仆從
I was a servant of the late Cardinal Wolsey.

424
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,140
我知道你可以和死去的靈魂交流
I understand you can converse with the souls of the dead.

425
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,620
所以想知道您是否可以替我尋到他
Wondered if you would search for him for me.

426
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,620
您可以隨便開價
I would be happy to make an offering.

427
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,060
那可是要給教堂一大筆捐贈的
It would have to be a generous donation.

428
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,780
沒關系 我很富有
Well, I'm a wealthy man.

429
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,620
我得和博金神父商量一下
I'd have to talk to Father Bocking.

430
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,980
博金神父？
Father Bocking?

431
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,100
他是圣女的心靈導師
He is the lady's spiritual director.

432
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,100
噢
Ah.

433
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,620
下次再來找我問詢吧
Come again and ask me.

434
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,700
嗯哼
Mm-hm.

435
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,180
跟我來
Come with me.

436
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,340
大人
My lord.

437
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,620
把你侄女帶走吧
Fetch your niece away.

438
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,380
她已經外交夠了
She has done enough diplomacy.

439
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,100
她在搞什么...
What the...

440
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,220
請原諒 陛下
By your leave, Highness.

441
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,860
夫人 我們去跳曲舞吧
My lady, we shall dance.

442
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:52,900
西摩大人 你的姐姐珍妮...
Master Seymour, your sister Jane...?

443
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,220
脾氣很古怪對吧
Odd little creature, isn't she?

444
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,980
她多大了
How... old would she be?

445
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,580
不知道 二十歲左右？
I don't know. 20 or so?

446
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,540
她一直在狼廳周圍四處走動 
She keeps walking around Wolf Hall saying

447
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,660
還說這些都是托馬斯 克倫威爾的爪牙
these are Thomas Cromwell's sleeves.

448
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:18,780
沒人知道她在說什么
No-one knows what she's talking about.

449
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,980
你父親難道沒為她做媒么？
Has your father made her a match?

450
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,180
有一些議論...
There was some talk of...

451
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,700
你問這個干嗎?
Why do you ask?

452
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,180
安妮想要一本圣經
Anne wants a Bible!

453
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,900
克倫威爾大人能背誦整個新約
Master Cromwell can recite the whole of the New Testament.

454
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,780
我覺得她是想用圣經起誓
I think she wants to swear on it.

455
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,220
噢 那我可能就不能去效勞了
Ah, then I probably won't do.

456
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,580
你怎么做到的?
How did you do that?

457
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,940
你
You.

458
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,220
我
Me.

459
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,180
她現在躺在他的臂彎里
She's in his arms.

460
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,540
全身赤裸 像剛出生嬰兒一樣
Naked as she was born.

461
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,340
她現在已經不能回頭了
She can't change her mind now.

462
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,340
我以為他們剛剛是在吵架
I thought they were quarrelling.

463
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,900
的確是 他們喜歡爭吵
They were. They like to quarrel.

464
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,140
那她要圣經做什么?
What did she want the Bible for?

465
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:40,940
讓他在上帝的見證下起誓 他做了鄭重承諾
To swear him. Before witnesses. He made her a binding promise.

466
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,340
他們在上帝的見證下結婚了
They are married in God's sight.

467
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,660
他也發誓說 一回到英格蘭會再舉行一次婚禮 為她戴上王后冠冕
And he swears he'll marry her again in England and crown her queen.

468
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,980
好吧 好吧 好吧
Well, well, well.

469
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:53,300
現在問題就是看他能不能把安妮吃掉了
So now it's just a question of whether he can do the deed.

470
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,020
看在上帝的份上 瑪麗 別嚇我
For God's sake, Mary, don't frighten me.

471
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,180
別擔心 如果他膽怯了 安妮知道該怎么如愿
Don't worry. If he's shy, Anne will know how to help.

472
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,180
我已經教過她了
I've coached her.

473
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,820
是嗎?
Have you?

474
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,980
那我們現在怎么辦?
Now what about us?

475
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:15,860
為了讓他們倆在一起 也算是經歷了漫長的斗爭
It's been a long struggle to bring them together.

476
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,980
我想我們已經得到消遣了
I think we've earned our recreation.

477
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,100
你不會還在怕我的叔叔 諾爾福克吧?
You're not still afraid of my Uncle Norfolk?

478
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:34,140
-我很害怕你的那個諾爾福克叔叔          - 但這不是原因 到底因為什么?
- I'm terrified of your Uncle Norfolk. - But it's not that. What is it?

479
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,100
另一個嗎?
Another?

480
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,980
你差點殺了威廉 斯塔福德
You almost murdered William Stafford.

481
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,300
威廉 我還以為你不會來了
William, I thought you weren't coming.

482
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,860
看來你已經有備胎了啊
It seems you had a reserve ready, just in case.

483
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,260
你根本不懂一個女人的生活是怎樣的！
You don't know what a woman's life is like!

484
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,620
你以為你已經跟一個男人有了些感情 但他卻沒出現
You think you've fixed something with a man, and he doesn't turn up!

485
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,220
祝你晚安
Give you good night.

486
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,620
不 別走
No, don't go.

487
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:15,420
我...呃...我該去禱告了
I, er... I think it's time I said my prayers.

488
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:42,420
你一直在信件往來切斯特
You've been writing letters up to Chester.

489
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,340
是關于陛下的事情 為什么這么問?
On his Majesty's business. Why?

490
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,500
我就說這一次 克倫威爾
I'll tell you this once, Cromwell.

491
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,540
別插手我的家事 不然我就要你好看
You keep out of my family's affairs or you'll have me to deal with.

492
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,860
而且你根本想象不到 你會變得有多糟糕
And you'll come off worse than you can possibly imagine.

493
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,220
你不該恐嚇我的 閣下
You made a mistake threatening me, sir.

494
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,940
太初有道 道與神同在 道就是神
In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God,

495
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,900
這道太初與神同在
and the Word was God.

496
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,140
萬有是藉著他而成的
The same was in the beginning with God.

497
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,140
凡所成的
All things were made by it

498
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,740
沒有一樣不是藉著他而成的
and without it was made nothing that was made.

499
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,220
生命在他里面
In it was life

500
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,100
這生命就是人的光   [圣經 - 約翰福音]
and the life was the light of men.

501
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:53,580
我必須這樣做 托馬斯 我無法再背負著我所做之事活下去了
I had to, Thomas. I couldn't live with what I'd done.

502
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,740
那當你被宣判的時候呢...
When you're examined...

503
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:00,060
在最終宣判前 我會說出我該說的
I'll say what I will say before my last judge -

504
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,820
圣餐只不過是面包 我們沒必要懺悔
that the Eucharist is only bread, we have no need of penance

505
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:07,420
煉獄也只是圣經中所創造的無稽之談
and Purgatory is an invention ungrounded in scripture.

506
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:27,100
如果有人來 讓你跟他們走 我希望你跟他們走
If some men come and tell you to go with them, I want you go with them.

507
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,940
那會是我派來的人
They'll be my men.

508
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:35,620
你覺得你能把我從倫敦塔里救出去嗎?
You think you can get me out of the Tower?

509
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,980
汀代爾的圣經中說"有上帝在 萬物皆存有可能"
Tyndale's Bible says "with God, nothing is impossible."

510
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,980
但那又有什么意義呢 托馬斯
But what would be the point, Thomas?

511
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,020
我只需要走到保羅的十字架前
I'd only have to walk to Paul's cross

512
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,060
在倫敦人民面前說出我想說的話
and say before the Londoners what I've already said.

513
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,540
我不能不相信我的信仰
I cannot unbelieve what I believe.

514
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:13,700
所以 男性和女性之間確實有不相同 對嗎
Therefore, is it not the same for the male sex and the female sex?

515
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:19,580
一方面 他們在一些
If on the one hand they appear different

516
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:26,140
技能或其他"職業"上 呈現出不同
with regard to some skill or other - employment?

517
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,220
職業
Occupation.

518
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,260
讓我們單獨聊聊 女兒
Leave us, daughter.

519
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,420
我可不想讓你跟這個惡魔呆著
I won't have you in this devil's company.

520
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,340
我聽說你不能出席加冕禮
I hear you can't come to the coronation

521
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,460
是因為你買不起一件新外套
because you can't afford a new coat.

522
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,620
伽迪納會給你買件新外套的
Gardiner will buy you a new coat himself

523
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,180
- 如果你那天出現的話    - 他會嗎?
- if you'll show your face on the day.  - Will he?

524
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:52,900
確實 能從他那兒拿走十磅都很不容易
Indeed. I'll relish taking the ten pounds from him.

525
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,700
那你要穿什么?
And what will you wear?

526
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,700
噢 他們正給我做新衣服呢 梅格
Oh, they're making me something, Meg.

527
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,380
我能不被嘲笑 就已經萬幸了
If I avoid getting laughed at, it'll be enough.

528
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,820
我聽說了圣女 那個姓巴頓的姑娘 來拜訪過你
I heard the Holy Maid - the Barton girl - has been to visit you.

529
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,660
她的確來過 但是我們不會收留她的
She has. But we wouldn't receive her.

530
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:11,820
她還受艾可賽特夫人之邀 拜訪過她家
She has also been to visit the Lady Exeter. At her invitation.

531
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:14,580
艾可賽特夫人 不過一介愚昧不堪且又野心勃勃的婦人
Lady Exeter is a foolish and ambitious woman.

532
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,660
巴頓告訴她 她有朝一日將會是英格蘭的王后
Barton told her she'd be Queen of England.

533
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,980
仍執我見
I repeat my comment.

534
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,100
你也不相信她的眼力嗎
You don't believe in her visions, then?

535
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,500
不相信 因為她是故意那么做的
I don't. She does it for attention.

536
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,540
我已經寫信給她 建議她少伴在位高權重的人身邊
I've written to her advising her to avoid the company

537
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:28,860
而是老實呆在家里禱告
of powerful men and women and to stay at home and pray.

538
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,620
我們所有人都該如此 以您為榜樣
As should we all. Follow your example.

539
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,980
阿門 我猜您應該保留了一份副本吧
Amen. I suppose you've kept a copy?

540
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,900
梅格 去拿給他 否則他永遠不會離開的
Get it, Meg. Otherwise he might never leave.

541
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,020
詹姆斯 班罕
James Bainham.

542
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,020
他將被施以火刑
He's to be burnt.

543
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:13,260
去求見亨利吧 他會像歡迎迷途浪子一樣歡迎你歸來
Ask to see Henry. He'll welcome you back like a lost child.

544
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:17,260
我不是讓你支持詹姆斯的觀點
I'm not asking you to agree with James.

545
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:21,540
如果他的信仰有誤 你可以勸他回去 回羅馬去
If his doctrine is false, you can talk him back, back to Rome.

546
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:25,260
你能言善辯
You're an eloquent man.

547
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:29,620
是我們這個時代最卓越的辯論家
You're the great persuader of our age.

548
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,820
但如果他駕鶴西征 你永遠不會知道
But if he dies, you'll never know, will you?

549
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,220
你是否能夠救贖他的靈魂 對吧
Whether you could have saved his soul.

550
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,900
你不能進去 她尚未更衣
You can't come in. She's in a state of undress.

551
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,580
讓他進來吧
Let him in.

552
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:01,300
國王陛下說您此時美過往昔
The King says you've never looked more beautiful.

553
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,940
他讓我轉達一個吻 我說他還是應該親自送達為好
And he sends a kiss, which I told him he should deliver himself.

554
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,580
你穿的這是什么？
What are you wearing?

555
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:11,740
我說過不要穿黑色的
I said no black.

556
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:12,940
這是深紅色
It's scarlet.

557
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,940
是深的發黑的紅
It's a very black scarlet.

558
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,700
佛朗西斯 布萊恩說我看起來就像一塊會行走的淤青腫塊
Francis Bryan says I look like a walking bruise.

559
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,980
你聽到他們為我歡呼了么
Did you hear them cheer for me?

560
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,900
所有的言論都在說人們愛戴凱瑟琳
All this talk of people loving Katherine.

561
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,060
我認為他們不過是憐憫她而已
I think they just pity her.

562
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,900
噢不 他們愛戴她
Oh, no, they love her

563
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,140
因為她是兩位受膏的君主之女〔在國王登基儀式或授予神職儀式上涂膏油于人使其神圣化 〕
because she is the daughter of two anointed sovereigns.

564
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:41,820
他們永遠不會像愛戴凱瑟琳一樣愛戴您的 至多...
They'll never love you like that Madam, any more than...

565
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,620
就像愛戴這個克倫威爾一樣而已
Cromwell here.

566
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,700
您最好也能接受這點 我認為...
You may as well make your mind to it. I think...

567
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,140
夠了 珍妮
That's enough, Jane.

568
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,580
他們說巴頓小女孩已經預言了
They say the Barton girl has prophesied

569
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:54,140
那個所謂的瑪麗公主以后會成為女王
that so-called Princess Mary will be queen.

570
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,820
凱瑟琳正與艾可賽特以及波爾密謀 
Katherine is plotting with Exeter and Pole -

571
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,540
她們都曾是金雀花王朝的人
all the old Plantagenets.

572
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,900
- 您不要徒增煩惱  - 我不是自尋煩惱
- Don't distress yourself. - I'm not distressed.

573
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,620
這些人巴不得我死
These people want me dead.

574
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:12,900
但一旦我兒子出生 他們就都無能為力了
But when my son is born, they'll all be powerless.

575
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,500
克倫威爾大人
Master Cromwell?

576
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,180
我想要感謝您
I wanted to thank you.

577
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,660
收到了您的禮物
From your present.

578
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:31,340
托馬斯 克倫威爾的袖子
Thomas Cromwell's sleeves.

579
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:35,180
狼廳的事情如何了
How do things stand at Wolf Hall?

580
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:41,540
愛德華憤怒至極 我母親也咬牙切齒暗自生氣
Edward is angry, my mother is grinding her teeth.

581
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,500
我想要離開
I would like to leave.

582
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,180
好吧 如果我是你父親...
Well, if I were your father...

583
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:54,300
如果我建議的話 建議你留下
If I were to advise you, it would be to stay

584
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:58,380
效忠你們的新王后
in the service of your new queen.

585
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:02,100
謙遜恭順總是適宜的 而且她總是確保我們如此
Well, it's good to be humble. And she makes sure we are.

586
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:08,220
我相信她會變溫和的 如今她內心已經有了渴望
I think she'll soften, now she has her heart's desire.

587
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:13,420
我謙遜恭順時就是這樣的
This is my humble face.

588
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,660
可以么
Will it serve?

589
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,020
我覺得它讓你到哪 都如魚得水的
I think it would take you anywhere.

590
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,860
它是今天送來的
It came for you today.

591
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,820
國王賞賜您的禮物
A present from the King.

592
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:48,260
王后準備開始閉居
The Queen is setting off to begin her confinement.

593
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:50,620
我們只是想確認一下
We just wanted to check.

594
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:53,140
我們應該說"宣布一位王子的誕生"
Are we saying "announcing the birth of a prince"

595
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,340
還是只是說一個"孩子"的誕生
or just the birth of a "child?"

596
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:22,020
- 我們所有人的命運都系在這夫人身上了
- All of our fortunes depend on this lady now

597
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,260
看她能否誕下繼承人了
and whether she can provide an heir,

598
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:27,740
我們都知道一個尚在腹中的孩子 和一個已經安然躺在嬰兒床里的孩子
and we all know it's a long road between a child in the womb

599
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,420
不可同日而語
and one safely in the crib.

600
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:34,820
你看起來很高興
You look happy.

601
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,660
你高興么
Are you happy?

602
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,460
開心
Yes.

603
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,060
因為這孩子
Because of this.

604
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,900
過去我總是想要很多
I was always desired.

605
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,620
但是現在我很知足 你知道么?
But now I'm valued, you see?

606
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:56,740
而這孩子就是不同之處
And that's different.

607
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:57,740

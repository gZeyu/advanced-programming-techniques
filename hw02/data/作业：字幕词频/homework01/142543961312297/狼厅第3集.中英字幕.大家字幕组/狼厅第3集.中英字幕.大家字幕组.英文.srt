1
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,260
Fuerunt vero et pseudoprophetae in populo,

2
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,380
sicut et in vobis erunt magistri mendaces...

3
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,340
..qui introducunt sectas perditionis,

4
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,340
et eum qui emit eos, Dominum negant,

5
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,620
superducentes sibi celerem perditionem.

6
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,140
Master Cromwell?

7
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,380
Madam, your daughter should sit.

8
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,340
Stand up straight.

9
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,500
This is Master Cromwell.

10
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,780
He used to be a money-lender. Now he writes all the laws.

11
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,220
I have heard all about your new bill

12
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,980
inducing the King to describe himself as the head of the church?

13
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,940
The Pope is the head of the church everywhere.

14
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,060
The lawfulness of all government flows from the...

15
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,140
..from...

16
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,060
Will you not sit down, Princess Mary?

17
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,540
It's just the heat.

18
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,140
I beg your madam to consider it in this way -

19
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,780
the King has merely defined a position which ancient precedents...

20
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,940
Ancient precedents?

21
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,380
Precedents that you've invented these last three months.

22
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,300
As for "induced" - Your Highness knows the King cannot be led.

23
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,020
But he can be enticed.

24
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,980
He has ridden off without saying goodbye.

25
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,060
He's never done that before. Never.

26
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,020
Well, I think he means to hunt out of Chertsey for a few days.

27
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,020
With the woman. The person.

28
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,220
Your Highness will be going to another palace.

29
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,580
He has chosen the More, in Hertfordshire,

30
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,460
which as you know is very comfortable.

31
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,620
It was one of your cardinal's houses, wasn't it?

32
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,460
So it's bound to be lavish.

33
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,940
I expected this.

34
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,220
But I didn't expect he would send a man like you to tell me.

35
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,540
I want to give you something.

36
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,020
A present.

37
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,780
Name anything you want.

38
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,220
What is it?

39
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,380
This bill of yours.

40
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,420
It's not my bill.

41
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,060
Taking power from the bishops, making Henry head of the church.

42
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,740
Aren't you afraid?

43
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,780
Of what?

44
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,060
There's this girl called Elizabeth Barton making prophecies.

45
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,860
They're calling her the Holy Maid.

46
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:02,980
She's saying Henry won't reign for a year if he marries Anne.

47
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,380
And there's a new star by the moon, and the...

48
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,820
It's not a star. It's a comet.

49
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,420
..and the last time it appeared was under King John

50
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,180
and the cattle stopped breeding and the grass stopped growing

51
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,980
and the birds fell from the sky.

52
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,500
Well, I'm sure if that happens, we can reverse our policy.

53
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,740
I don't believe in omens.

54
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,580
They've arrested a barrister - James Bainham.

55
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,300
You know him, don't you?

56
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,740
Yes. He's a good man.

57
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,860
He was handing out the gospel in English.

58
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,060
What if they torture Bainham?

59
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,100
What if he...gives names?

60
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,700
What's that to me? Thomas More already knows my name.

61
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,700
Those for the bill to my right, those against to my left.

62
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,340
I think the "ayes" have it. The "ayes" have it!

63
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,660
Your Majesty.

64
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,700
Congratulations. I take it the division of the house was your idea?

65
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,500
I thought this way His Majesty could see who was with him

66
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,860
and who against him.

67
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,540
In the Commons, at least.

68
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,060
I know Stephen is opposed to the bill, Cromwell.

69
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,140
I don't want a servant who will agree with everything.

70
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,380
I need men who aren't afraid of controversy.

71
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,380
Now, I know you two quarrel.

72
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,060
You must learn to pull together.

73
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,900
This winter, you have to be yoked to the plough.

74
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,500
You won't find it so easy passing your bill through the House of Lords.

75
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,580
Thomas More and the old aristocracy are for the Pope

76
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,260
and not afraid to say so.

77
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,060
Well, we'll see. Archbishop Warham.

78
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:18,020
This um, prophetess you harbour in your diocese - Eliza Barton?

79
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,860
How is she getting on?

80
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,740
What do you want, Cromwell?

81
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,180
Well, I hear that she's telling people

82
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,140
that if the King marries Lady Anne, he has only a year to reign.

83
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,060
I just wondered who is controlling her.

84
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,820
She may be a simple country girl but she has a genuine gift.

85
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,700
She does, doesn't she?

86
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,980
I hear she can tell you where your dead relatives are.

87
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,580
If it's in Heaven, she speaks with a higher voice,

88
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,700
if in Hell, with a deep voice.

89
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,420
She can also tell what sins

90
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,100
weigh upon a man as soon as she meets him.

91
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,740
What would she make of you?

92
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,820
How was Antwerp?

93
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,140
Glad to be home.

94
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,140
Oh.

95
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,340
For show. In case I got stopped.

96
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,340
Hmm.

97
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,740
- Mm-hmm.  - Centre seam.

98
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,380
- What does he say?   - You carried it without reading it?

99
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,100
I didn't want to know. In case.

100
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,980
If Thomas More came anywhere near you,

101
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,340
I'd drag him out of his court in Westminster

102
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,940
and beat his head on the cobbles until I'd knocked some of God's love into it.

103
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,580
- Will Tynedale come back?  - M'hm.

104
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,300
When the King says yes to the scripture being translated into English.

105
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,260
But even then, he won't trust More to give him safe conduct, because

106
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,460
More says you don't have to keep the promise you made to a heretic.

107
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,900
Anyway, Tynedale still refuses to support the King's divorce.

108
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,020
You'd think he'd bend a point of principle to make

109
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,620
a friend of the King of England.

110
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,780
But, no. Tynedale and More - they deserve each other.

111
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,940
These mules who pose as men.

112
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,420
My lady.

113
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,500
It's the bow.

114
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,140
No doubt. It could be the brace height.

115
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,460
Could we swap the bows, please?

116
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,260
She was the same in the nursery.

117
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,620
Where's Robin Hood? I have dispatches.

118
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,220
He won't look at them until sundown.

119
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,580
Won't he be occupied then?

120
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,180
She's selling herself by the inch.

121
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,940
She wants a cash present for every advance above her knee.

122
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,620
She's got long legs.

123
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,340
By the time he reaches her secret part, the nation'll be bankrupt!

124
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,700
I er, I had heard a rumour...

125
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,140
She isn't. I would know.

126
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,180
If she thickened at all, I'd be the one to have to let out her clothes.

127
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,140
I know her waist by the inch.

128
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,420
Besides, she can't be. Because they still haven't.

129
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,180
- She'd tell you?    - Of course.

130
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,540
Out of spite.

131
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,140
I want a job.

132
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,460
An official post.

133
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,060
In the Jewel House, perhaps?

134
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,180
I'll tell her.

135
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,940
She made Tom Wyatt a poet and Harry Percy mad.

136
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,420
I'm sure she has some idea what to make you.

137
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,220
Last week, at Greenwich,

138
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,220
a Friar preached to us

139
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,420
about the good king who was corrupted by the wicked Jezebel.

140
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,220
Apparently she built a pagan temple

141
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,700
and let the priests of Baal into the palace.

142
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,180
She ended up being thrown out of a window.

143
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,580
I'm the Jezebel, you see

144
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,860
and you're the priests of Baal.

145
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,900
I see.

146
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,700
More has arrested a barrister, James Bainham.

147
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,460
- What do you expect me to do about it?   - Talk to the King.

148
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,460
You know how to please him, I suppose?

149
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,740
My maidenhead for your lawyer?

150
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,460
He'll be released.

151
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,620
Well...

152
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,700
..Little Bilney wasn't.

153
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,860
They burnt him in Norwich.

154
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,820
Your barrister friend will recant and he'll be released.

155
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,820
And if he doesn't?

156
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,260
Then he's a fool.

157
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:34,540
People should say whatever will keep them alive.

158
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,820
You would, wouldn't you?

159
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,460
What's that?

160
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,140
Ah.

161
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,540
It's a gift for one of your women.

162
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,540
The little girl who always cries.

163
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,300
What?

164
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,220
Didn't you hear?

165
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,420
No, what?

166
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,340
Her father - dear old Sir John Seymour?

167
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:09,780
He was caught in the hayloft with his son Edward's wife.

168
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,660
It seems he's had her every week for the last two years.

169
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,860
Edward's put the wife into a nunnery

170
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,140
and I don't think we'll see dear old Sir John at court soon.

171
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,900
And the daughter? Jane, is it?

172
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,420
Pasty-face? Gone to Wiltshire.

173
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,820
It's her best bet to get into a nunnery too.

174
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,140
No-one want will want to marry the milksop now.

175
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,460
What is it?

176
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,820
It's only...

177
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,500
..a book of needlework patterns.

178
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,300
You don't LIKE her...do you?

179
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,420
Because I'm not sure it's proper for you to send her a present.

180
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,140
Well, it's not like it's tales from Boccaccio.

181
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,100
Oh, they could tell Boccaccio a tale!

182
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,060
Those sinners at Wolf Hall.

183
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,740
Mm-hmm?

184
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,420
Lord Chancellor.

185
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,300
You should have warned me.

186
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,900
You'll have something to eat?

187
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,500
- Thank you, no.  - Something to drink then? Some wine?

188
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,580
Your friend, Bainham?

189
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,060
He has recanted his heresy

190
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,500
and been set free.

191
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,900
I thought you should know.

192
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,820
Well, thank you.

193
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,060
I heard that he'd been put to the rack.

194
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,980
To save his soul, I would have had him whipped,

195
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,020
I'd have had him burnt with irons,

196
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,420
I'd have had him...hung by his wrists.

197
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,540
In these last ten years, the Turks have taken Belgrade.

198
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,580
They have lit their campfires in the great library at Buda.

199
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,580
It is only two years since they were at the gates of Vienna.

200
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:14,620
Why would you want to make another breach in the walls of Christendom?

201
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,940
The King of England is not an infidel.

202
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,100
- Nor am I.   - Aren't you?

203
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,100
I think your faith is for purchase.

204
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,780
I think you would serve the Sultan if the price was right.

205
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,940
You think because you're a councillor you can negotiate

206
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,940
with heretics behind the King's back. You're wrong.

207
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,260
I know about your letters that come and go.

208
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,740
I know you are in communication with Tyndale.

209
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,380
Are you threatening me?

210
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,580
I'm just interested.

211
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,780
Yes. Yes.

212
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,340
That's precisely what I'm doing.

213
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,500
You still haven't told me what you want as a present.

214
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,340
My mother knows.

215
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,100
About us.

216
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,620
I...I think...

217
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,540
I think we've done what we have

218
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,380
because when Liz died, we were shocked.

219
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,660
We were sorry.

220
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,140
I think we have to leave off that now.

221
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,300
If...if my husband had -

222
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,660
God forgive me but every winter I think is his last -

223
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,980
then of course, I would, without question.

224
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,820
But then...

225
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,700
the law wouldn't allow that, so...

226
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,380
If, if you want to marry, Mercy has her list.

227
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:52,380
You probably have your own list, with names on it we don't know, so...

228
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,020
Liz.

229
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,380
Johane.

230
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,180
Francis Bryan is here. It's something bad.

231
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,060
He's Anne's cousin. I'll have to...

232
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,460
What does Percy's wife say?

233
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,820
She says she's going to petition Parliament for divorce.

234
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,060
She says he hasn't shared her bed for two years,

235
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,260
and when she asked him why he said he couldn't.

236
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,180
Why has she waited two years to ask?

237
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,580
She has been asking.

238
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,100
And last night, he finally admitted he can't sleep with her

239
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,100
- because they're not really married.  - What?

240
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,460
Because Harry Percy's actually married to Anne Boleyn.

241
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,780
Bring them down!

242
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,940
We've swept up most of the broken glass.

243
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,700
Shut the door, Francis and don't let anybody in.

244
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,780
I suggest we pack Anne's bags and send her to Kent.

245
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,060
The King's anger once...

246
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,900
Say one more word and I'll punch you.

247
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,540
The King has said there must be an inquiry, before the whole council.

248
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,140
If Anne has concealed a secret marriage...

249
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,780
Jesus, I wish I could divorce you!

250
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,500
I wish you'd had a pre-contract. But no chance of that.

251
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,260
The fields were black with men running the other fucking way!

252
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,860
- George!  - I deny everything.

253
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,980
- Good.   - Harry Percy spoke of love, I'll allow that.

254
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,420
But there was no contract.

255
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,500
And no consummation.

256
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,580
My sister is a notorious virgin.

257
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,100
How was the King when you spoke to him?

258
00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:00,580
What is the use of calling in Master Cromwell and not telling him what has already occurred?

259
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,340
The King walked out of the room and left her standing.

260
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,020
It seems to me there are a number of approaches here.

261
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,900
Oh, Jesus Christ!

262
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,300
By the thrice-beshitten shroud of Lazarus!

263
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,780
While you're selecting your approach, your daughter, sir,

264
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,900
- is being slandered.  - Harry...  - The King's mind is poisoned,

265
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,140
and this family's fortune is unmaking before your fucking eyes!

266
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,820
Will you let me speak?

267
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,580
Harry Percy was persuaded once to forget his claim.

268
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,380
- If he was fixed once...    - Yes. But the Cardinal fixed him then.

269
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,300
And unfortunately the Cardinal is dead.

270
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,060
Lady Anne,

271
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,700
if the Pope cannot stop you becoming Queen -

272
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,060
and I don't think he can -

273
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,700
I don't see why Harry Percy should be allowed to stand in your way.

274
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,060
So shift him out of it.

275
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,620
Do it.

276
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,140
Beat his fucking skull in.

277
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,060
Why don't you come up?!

278
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,540
Looking for a woman?

279
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,740
Oh, God, yes, I thought you'd come.

280
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,820
Hey  out.

281
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,380
Well, you're wasting your time. I was pledged to Anne.

282
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,660
She allowed me such freedom with herself

283
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,860
as only a betrothed woman would allow.

284
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,940
The Cardinal bullied me out of saying anything last time,

285
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,580
but I'm not afraid to speak the truth now.

286
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,260
My lord, you've said what you have to say.

287
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,020
Now listen to me.

288
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,940
You're a man whose money is almost spent.

289
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,420
I'm a man who knows how you've spent it.

290
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,660
You're a man who has borrowed all over Europe.

291
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,820
I'm a man who knows your creditors.

292
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,500
One word from me, and all your debts will be called in.

293
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,740
What are they going to do? Bankers don't have armies.

294
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,860
Neither will you, without any money.

295
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,500
My lord, you hold your earldom from the King.

296
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,940
Your task is to secure the north, to defend us against Scotland.

297
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,220
If you cannot ensure these things, the King will take your land

298
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,100
and your titles and give them

299
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,580
to someone who will do the job that you cannot do.

300
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,820
No, he won't. He respects all ancient titles.

301
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,140
How can I explain this to you...?

302
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,500
The world is not run from where you think it is.

303
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,380
From border fortresses.

304
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,300
Even from Whitehall.

305
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,860
The world is run from Antwerp, from Florence, from Lisbon.

306
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:43,620
From wherever the merchant ships set sail off into the west.

307
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,540
Not from castle walls, from counting houses.

308
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:51,180
From the pens that scrape out your promissory notes.

309
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,060
So believe me when I say

310
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,500
that my banker friends and I will rip your life apart.

311
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,820
And then, when you are without money and title, yes, I can picture you

312
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,740
living in a hovel, wearing homespun,

313
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,100
bringing home a rabbit for the pot.

314
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,380
Your lawful wife, Anne Boleyn, skinning and jointing that rabbit.

315
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,140
Yes, I wish you all happiness.

316
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,340
You were never pre-contracted.

317
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,180
Any understanding you think you have, you didn't have it.

318
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,620
And if you think Lady Anne loves you

319
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,420
you couldn't be more mistaken.

320
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,820
I've just come from her.

321
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,860
She hates you.

322
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,340
She despises you.

323
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,780
She wants you gone.

324
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:51,980
So if you say one more word about Lady Anne's "freedom" with you,

325
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,260
I will come and drag you out of whatever hole

326
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,860
you are cowering in and the Duke of Norfolk will bite your bollocks off.

327
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,100
I do hope that's clear, my lord?

328
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,980
Yes, you can all peer in again.

329
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,020
There he is.

330
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:35,020
My uncle and I work for his removal for months without success

331
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,940
and now he resigns.

332
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,260
Over this bill.

333
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,180
His great protest.

334
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,060
England is just a stage to him.

335
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,420
Who should replace him?

336
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,100
Put it in the King's mind to appoint Audley.

337
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,180
He's a good man. And he understands me, I think.

338
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,300
Do you think that someone does?

339
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,780
Cranmer as Archbishop,

340
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,460
Audley as Lord Chancellor.

341
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,620
Soon you'll have friends everywhere.

342
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,260
And for yourself?

343
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,860
I thought perhaps Keeper of the Jewel House?

344
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,380
Where's the chain of office? He's supposed to hand it over.

345
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,700
In the bag.

346
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,700
So that's it?

347
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,620
More is out?

348
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,340
Shall we go down?

349
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,780
You...

350
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,780
you can't resist it.

351
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,220
- No more can you.  - No.

352
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,180
What will you do now?

353
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,540
Write.

354
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,140
Pray.

355
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:42,020
My recommendation - write only a little and pray a lot.

356
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,180
Now, is that a threat?

357
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,620
My turn, don't you think?

358
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,140
We're off to Calais.

359
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:04,620
The King of France had agreed to speak to the Pope

360
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,500
in favour of my new marriage.

361
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,220
We'll meet there to discuss points of a treaty.

362
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,300
Last time we met,

363
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,300
Wolsey arranged everything.

364
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:23,780
I thought perhaps you could help organise things this time?

365
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,220
Lean on me, Your Majesty.

366
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,500
We'll take mass at Canterbury.

367
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,180
Let the people see their king.

368
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,780
Do you know this woman?

369
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,260
I used to.

370
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,060
She reminds me of someone I knew long ago.

371
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,660
In Antwerp.

372
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,220
What was her name?

373
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,820
Anselma.

374
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,940
You've known passion, Cromwell.

375
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:19,460
With Anne... I shake.

376
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,860
Do you understand?

377
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,220
I shake.

378
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,740
I've tried other women,

379
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:34,580
tried them just to try to take the edge off the lust...

380
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,700
but I failed with all of them.

381
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,500
Couldn't do it.

382
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,820
Which is proof, don't you think?

383
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,580
Proof of the rightness of my pursuit.

384
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:59,100
I hunt only one hind -

385
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,060
and she takes me from the path and into the woods...

386
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,700
Now, away to our cold beds.

387
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,060
Or is that just mine?

388
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,180
There's work to do.

389
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,820
I have a new post for you.

390
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,220
I want you to be my Keeper of the Jewel House.

391
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,700
Your Majesty.

392
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,740
Why not? Why shouldn't I?

393
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:46,180
Who says I shouldn't employ the son of an honest blacksmith!

394
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,740
Everything that you are,

395
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,620
everything that you have,

396
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,820
will come from me.

397
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,420
Majesty!

398
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,860
Majesty!

399
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,540
This is the Holy Maid. Let me see her.

400
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,460
Madam, you have something to say to me?

401
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,860
The heretics you have around you must be put into a great fire.

402
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,060
If you don't do it, you'll burn yourself.

403
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:53,660
What heretics? I keep no heretics about my person.

404
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:58,460
Here's one. If you marry this one, you won't reign seven months.

405
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,420
Couldn't you at least round it up?

406
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,300
I see your mother - surrounded by pale fires.

407
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,220
- My mother? Where?     - She's mad. She should be whipped!

408
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,940
She's a very holy person. Her speech is inspired by heaven.

409
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,740
Lightning will strike you!

410
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,700
Drag her back to the whorehouse

411
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,140
before she feels my boot on her arse!

412
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,460
Take her away! Take her away!

413
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,660
Mistress?

414
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,140
I was a servant of the late Cardinal Wolsey.

415
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,140
I understand you can converse with the souls of the dead.

416
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,620
Wondered if you would search for him for me.

417
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,620
I would be happy to make an offering.

418
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,060
It would have to be a generous donation.

419
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,780
Well, I'm a wealthy man.

420
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,620
I'd have to talk to Father Bocking.

421
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,980
Father Bocking?

422
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,100
He is the lady's spiritual director.

423
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,100
Ah.

424
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,620
Come again and ask me.

425
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,700
Mm-hm.

426
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,180
Come with me.

427
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,340
My lord.

428
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,620
Fetch your niece away.

429
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,380
She has done enough diplomacy.

430
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,100
What the...

431
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,220
By your leave, Highness.

432
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,860
My lady, we shall dance.

433
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:52,900
Master Seymour, your sister Jane...?

434
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,220
Odd little creature, isn't she?

435
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,980
How... old would she be?

436
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,580
I don't know. 20 or so?

437
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,540
She keeps walking around Wolf Hall saying

438
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,660
these are Thomas Cromwell's sleeves.

439
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:18,780
No-one knows what she's talking about.

440
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,980
Has your father made her a match?

441
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,180
There was some talk of...

442
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,700
Why do you ask?

443
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,180
Anne wants a Bible!

444
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,900
Master Cromwell can recite the whole of the New Testament.

445
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,780
I think she wants to swear on it.

446
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,220
Ah, then I probably won't do.

447
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,580
How did you do that?

448
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,940
You.

449
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,220
Me.

450
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,180
She's in his arms.

451
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,540
Naked as she was born.

452
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,340
She can't change her mind now.

453
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,340
I thought they were quarrelling.

454
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,900
They were. They like to quarrel.

455
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,140
What did she want the Bible for?

456
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:40,940
To swear him. Before witnesses. He made her a binding promise.

457
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,340
They are married in God's sight.

458
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,660
And he swears he'll marry her again in England and crown her queen.

459
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,980
Well, well, well.

460
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:53,300
So now it's just a question of whether he can do the deed.

461
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,020
For God's sake, Mary, don't frighten me.

462
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,180
Don't worry. If he's shy, Anne will know how to help.

463
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,180
I've coached her.

464
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,820
Have you?

465
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,980
Now what about us?

466
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:15,860
It's been a long struggle to bring them together.

467
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,980
I think we've earned our recreation.

468
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,100
You're not still afraid of my Uncle Norfolk?

469
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:34,140
- I'm terrified of your Uncle Norfolk. - But it's not that. What is it?

470
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,100
Another?

471
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,980
You almost murdered William Stafford.

472
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,300
William, I thought you weren't coming.

473
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,860
It seems you had a reserve ready, just in case.

474
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,260
You don't know what a woman's life is like!

475
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,620
You think you've fixed something with a man, and he doesn't turn up!

476
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,220
Give you good night.

477
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,620
No, don't go.

478
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:15,420
I, er... I think it's time I said my prayers.

479
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:42,420
You've been writing letters up to Chester.

480
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,340
On his Majesty's business. Why?

481
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,500
I'll tell you this once, Cromwell.

482
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,540
You keep out of my family's affairs or you'll have me to deal with.

483
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,860
And you'll come off worse than you can possibly imagine.

484
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,220
You made a mistake threatening me, sir.

485
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,940
In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God,

486
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,900
and the Word was God.

487
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,140
The same was in the beginning with God.

488
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,140
All things were made by it

489
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,740
and without it was made nothing that was made.

490
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,220
In it was life

491
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,100
and the life was the light of men.

492
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:53,580
I had to, Thomas. I couldn't live with what I'd done.

493
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,740
When you're examined...

494
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:00,060
I'll say what I will say before my last judge -

495
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,820
that the Eucharist is only bread, we have no need of penance

496
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:07,420
and Purgatory is an invention ungrounded in scripture.

497
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:27,100
If some men come and tell you to go with them, I want you go with them.

498
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,940
They'll be my men.

499
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:35,620
You think you can get me out of the Tower?

500
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,980
Tyndale's Bible says "with God, nothing is impossible."

501
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,980
But what would be the point, Thomas?

502
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,020
I'd only have to walk to Paul's cross

503
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,060
and say before the Londoners what I've already said.

504
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,540
I cannot unbelieve what I believe.

505
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:13,700
Therefore, is it not the same for the male sex and the female sex?

506
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:19,580
If on the one hand they appear different

507
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:26,140
with regard to some skill or other - employment?

508
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,220
Occupation.

509
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,260
Leave us, daughter.

510
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,420
I won't have you in this devil's company.

511
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,340
I hear you can't come to the coronation

512
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,460
because you can't afford a new coat.

513
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,620
Gardiner will buy you a new coat himself

514
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,180
- if you'll show your face on the day.  - Will he?

515
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:52,900
Indeed. I'll relish taking the ten pounds from him.

516
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,700
And what will you wear?

517
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,700
Oh, they're making me something, Meg.

518
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,380
If I avoid getting laughed at, it'll be enough.

519
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,820
I heard the Holy Maid - the Barton girl - has been to visit you.

520
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,660
She has. But we wouldn't receive her.

521
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:11,820
She has also been to visit the Lady Exeter. At her invitation.

522
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:14,580
Lady Exeter is a foolish and ambitious woman.

523
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,660
Barton told her she'd be Queen of England.

524
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,980
I repeat my comment.

525
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,100
You don't believe in her visions, then?

526
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,500
I don't. She does it for attention.

527
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,540
I've written to her advising her to avoid the company

528
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:28,860
of powerful men and women and to stay at home and pray.

529
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,620
As should we all. Follow your example.

530
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,980
Amen. I suppose you've kept a copy?

531
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,900
Get it, Meg. Otherwise he might never leave.

532
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,020
James Bainham.

533
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,020
He's to be burnt.

534
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:13,260
Ask to see Henry. He'll welcome you back like a lost child.

535
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:17,260
I'm not asking you to agree with James.

536
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:21,540
If his doctrine is false, you can talk him back, back to Rome.

537
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:25,260
You're an eloquent man.

538
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:29,620
You're the great persuader of our age.

539
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,820
But if he dies, you'll never know, will you?

540
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,220
Whether you could have saved his soul.

541
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,900
You can't come in. She's in a state of undress.

542
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,580
Let him in.

543
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:01,300
The King says you've never looked more beautiful.

544
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,940
And he sends a kiss, which I told him he should deliver himself.

545
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,580
What are you wearing?

546
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:11,740
I said no black.

547
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:12,940
It's scarlet.

548
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,940
It's a very black scarlet.

549
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,700
Francis Bryan says I look like a walking bruise.

550
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,980
Did you hear them cheer for me?

551
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,900
All this talk of people loving Katherine.

552
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,060
I think they just pity her.

553
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,900
Oh, no, they love her

554
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,140
because she is the daughter of two anointed sovereigns.

555
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:41,820
They'll never love you like that Madam, any more than...

556
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,620
Cromwell here.

557
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,700
You may as well make your mind to it. I think...

558
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,140
That's enough, Jane.

559
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,580
They say the Barton girl has prophesied

560
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:54,140
that so-called Princess Mary will be queen.

561
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,820
Katherine is plotting with Exeter and Pole -

562
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,540
all the old Plantagenets.

563
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,900
- Don't distress yourself. - I'm not distressed.

564
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,620
These people want me dead.

565
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:12,900
But when my son is born, they'll all be powerless.

566
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,500
Master Cromwell?

567
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,180
I wanted to thank you.

568
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,660
From your present.

569
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:31,340
Thomas Cromwell's sleeves.

570
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:35,180
How do things stand at Wolf Hall?

571
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:41,540
Edward is angry, my mother is grinding her teeth.

572
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,500
I would like to leave.

573
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,180
Well, if I were your father...

574
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:54,300
If I were to advise you, it would be to stay

575
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:58,380
in the service of your new queen.

576
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:02,100
Well, it's good to be humble. And she makes sure we are.

577
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:08,220
I think she'll soften, now she has her heart's desire.

578
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:13,420
This is my humble face.

579
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,660
Will it serve?

580
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,020
I think it would take you anywhere.

581
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,860
It came for you today.

582
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,820
A present from the King.

583
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:48,260
The Queen is setting off to begin her confinement.

584
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:50,620
We just wanted to check.

585
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:53,140
Are we saying "announcing the birth of a prince"

586
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,340
or just the birth of a "child?"

587
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:22,020
- All of our fortunes depend on this lady now

588
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,260
and whether she can provide an heir,

589
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:27,740
and we all know it's a long road between a child in the womb

590
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,420
and one safely in the crib.

591
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:34,820
You look happy.

592
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,660
Are you happy?

593
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,460
Yes.

594
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,060
Because of this.

595
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,900
I was always desired.

596
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,620
But now I'm valued, you see?

597
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:56,740
And that's different.

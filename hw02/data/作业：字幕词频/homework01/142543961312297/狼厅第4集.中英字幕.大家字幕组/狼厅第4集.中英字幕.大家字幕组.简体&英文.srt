00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,900
狼・厅

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,120
她身体健康吗
Healthy?

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,020
很健康 陛下
Yes, Your Majesty.

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,740
为她冠名 伊丽莎白
Call her Elizabeth.

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,920
取消骑士们的竞技比武
Cancel the jousts.

15
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,930
- 他只字未问王后的情况如何  - 现在已经无关紧要了 不是吗
- He didn't ask how the Queen was.  - Hardly matters now, does it?

16
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,960
我觉得她是饿了
I think she was hungry.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,490
我女儿要去住在哈特菲尔德
My daughter is to live at Hatfield.

18
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,520
是的
Yes.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,600
我觉得西班牙人玛丽的家庭应该被拆分开
I think Spanish Mary's household should be broken up.

20
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,330
她能成为我女儿家里的一份子
She can become a member of my daughter's household.

21
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,980
作为什么样的存在
In the capacity of?

22
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,470
作为我女儿的女佣
In the capacity of my daughter's servant.

23
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,980
不然她还能是什么
What else can she be?

24
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,480
没必要有伪装的平等
There can be no pretence of equality.

25
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,030
玛丽态度傲慢且令人讨厌
Mary is a bastard.

26
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,960
废物要利用 事态主次顺序也要维护
Waste can be saved and the proper order of things asserted.

27
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,910
与此同时 我要你去一趟法国
Meanwhile, I want you to go to France.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,800
我要为我的女儿和一位法国王子定亲
I want a marriage contract for my daughter. A French prince.

29
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,000
- 斯蒂芬 伽得纳他... - 你今天对我的话好像有很多意见
- Stephen Gardiner is...  - You're very unwilling today.

30
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,570
你是不喜欢法国吗
You don't like the French?

31
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,300
那或许你会愿意和罗马皇帝去谈结盟
Perhaps you would prefer an alliance with the Emperor?

32
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,750
你和他的亲信关系很好 不是吗
You're very friendly with his man, aren't you?

33
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,300
沙皮？
Chapuys?

34
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,050
没别的事我就告辞了 王后
If that will be all, Your Majesty?

35
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,800
嗯
Hmm.

36
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,020
你为何不把那女孩买下
Why don't you ask for her?

37
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,440
西摩家族很穷
The Seymours are poor.

38
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,240
他们会很乐意将她卖给你的
They'll sell her to you happily.

39
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,110
你误会了我的兴趣所在
You mistake my interest.

40
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,720
呵呵呵 把你的谎话留着在下议院的时候说吧 你骗不到我的
Oh, fah-la-la! Tell your lies to the Commons, not to me.

41
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,000
我能看透很多事情
I see things.

42
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,320
你和我 我们都要特别留心
You and me, we keep our eyes open.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,080
我能留心注意到一些你目不能及的地方
I could keep my eyes open in places you cannot go.

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,020
比如说 安妮的房间里
In Anne's rooms, for example.

45
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,700
每次传召外人的时候 她都在做祷告
When you call you'll find her at prayer,

46
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,840
为乞丐女人缝衣服
sewing a smock for a beggar woman.

47
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,720
可您以为这是事情真相吗
Do you think that's what's really going on?

48
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,650
你觉得她真的能抛弃那些年轻机灵的男宠们吗
Do you think she's given up all her nimble young men?

49
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,240
能抛弃那些赞颂她的美丽的十四行诗吗
All those sonnets in praise of her beauty?

50
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,760
但现在有国王为她赞颂了
She has the King to praise her now.

51
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,760
除非她能再次怀上龙种 否则她将独守深宫了
She'll get no praise from him until she has a ripe belly again.

52
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,920
难道有什么阻碍吗
And what would hinder that?

53
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,990
没事...如果他能让她再次怀上的话
Nothing...if he's up to it.

54
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,280
你说话小心点
Careful.

55
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,430
那个小贱人就这样进进出出宫里的每个房间
And that little sneak is for ever in and out of every room,

56
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,550
像是要为所有年轻男子们做媒一样
acting as a go-between for all the gallants.

57
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,970
- 噢 我看那小男孩挺好的啊  - 他根本不知道自己的处境
- Oh, I see no harm in the boy.  - He doesn't know his place.

58
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,230
他只是个跳梁小丑 在拼命把握机会
He's a jumped-up nobody, taking his chance

59
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,070
因为这是个混乱的时代
because the times are disordered.

60
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,000
呵 我想你也可以完全这么评价我的 罗奇福德夫人
Well, I suppose you could say the same thing about me, Lady Rochford,

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,980
我也想相信你会的
and I'm sure you do.

62
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,380
王后在任何地方都能看到敌人
The Queen sees enemies everywhere.

63
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,160
本就如此
So she should.

64
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,720
所有人都在等着她失势下位
They're waiting for her to fail.

65
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,150
她说她会为亨利生下王子
She's said she'll give Henry a son,

66
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,190
但如果她做不到 所有的古老家族们都会反戈一击
so if she doesn't, all the old families are waiting their turn.

67
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,260
- 我们的圣女怎么样了  - 十分受欢迎
- How's our Holy Maid?  - Popular.

68
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,050
她说抹大拉的玛丽亚给她一封纯金镶裹的信
Mary Magdalene sent her a letter, illuminated in gold.

69
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,250
有访客？
Visitors?

70
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,770
让她进来
Bring her in.

71
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,690
你说你可以在天堂、地狱和炼狱中自由穿梭？
You say that you can roam through Heaven, Hell and Purgatory?

72
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,330
那你一定见过恶魔咯
And have you seen the Devil also?

73
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,940
他长相如何
And how did he look?

74
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,130
像一只大鸟
Like a bird.

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,720
呵 那可真是松了口气
That's a relief.

76
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,550
你太天真了
You think so?

77
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,010
他恶臭难当
He stinks!

78
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,040
他的利爪上血屎斑斑
He's got claws smeared with blood and shit.

79
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,210
他有一次化身年轻的俊美男子
He came to me once as a young man...

80
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,000
勾引我
to tempt me.

81
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,670
占我便宜
Pawing at me.

82
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,560
那你呢 受了勾引没
And were you? Tempted?

83
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,050
我可不会屈服撒旦的
I'm not for Satan.

84
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,600
- 我一拒绝了他 他就向我吐口水 - 他可真没教养
- When I rejected him he spat in my face.  - No manners.

85
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,790
我拿纸巾擦去
I wiped it off with a napkin.

86
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,880
是一团黑色的 冒着地狱恶臭的
It's black, with the stench of Hell...

87
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,160
腐烂物
..something rotting.

88
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,440
那东西现在在哪
And where is it now?

89
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,240
在多姆 爱德华那里
Dom Edwards has it.

90
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,040
- 难道他要让人们买票参观吗  - 是当作祭品
- And does he show it to people for money?  - For offerings.

91
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,160
你说国王一旦娶了安妮夫人
You said that the King wouldn't reign one month

92
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,670
就不会在位超过一个月
after he married Lady Anne.

93
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,480
可是...
Well...

94
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,830
数月过去了 安妮夫人成了王后
the months have passed and the Lady Anne is queen

95
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,120
还给国王生下了孩子
and has given the King a child.

96
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,180
所以呢...你现在还有什么可说的？
So...what do you say now?

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,950
我只能说 在上帝眼中
I say, in the eyes of God,

98
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,960
他已经不再是国王了 甚至比不上这个大主教的地位
he's no more the real king than HE is the real archbishop.

99
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,520
这就是你们叛变的正当理由吗
Then would it be justified to raise a rebellion against him?

100
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,210
暗杀他 再另寻君主？
Assassinate him? Put another in his place?

101
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,740
你觉得呢
What do you think?

102
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,200
在所有可能的金雀花王朝候选家族中
Of the possible Plantagenet claimants to the throne

103
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,360
你选择了考特尼家族 而不是波兰人
you've chosen the Courtenay family, not the Poles.

104
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,400
埃克塞特侯爵 亨利  而不是蒙塔古勋爵 亨利
Henry, Marquis of Exeter, not Henry, Lord Montague,

105
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,350
- 还是你把他们俩搞混了   - 当然没有
- or do you get them mixed up?  - Of course not.

106
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,790
这两位绅士及他们的夫人 我都见过了
I've met both of those gentlemen. I've met their wives.

107
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,900
还见过了费舍尔主教 他们都站在我这边
I've met Bishop Fisher. They all come to me.

108
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,150
考特尼家族是传承自爱德华国王的女儿一脉
Now, Courtenay descends from a daughter of King Edward.

109
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,290
蒙塔古则是传承自他的哥哥
Montague from his brother.

110
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,240
你如何把他们的利益需求安排妥当呢
How would you sort out their claims?

111
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,720
还是说让他们自己争出个结果呢
Or would you let them scrap it out?

112
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,000
如果想掀起一场战争的话
It's good to have a few kings and queens in reserve

113
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,920
多预留几个国王王后是很有必要的 对吗
if you are going to start a war.

114
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,840
噢 没必要嫌弃战争的
Oh, no need of a war.

115
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,320
天将降大祸于英格兰
God is sending a plague to England.

116
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,760
- 不出半年 亨利和那个臭婊子都会命丧黄泉   - 我呢？
- Henry will be dead in six months and so will his whore.  - And me?

117
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,000
不止你 这个屋子里的人 无一幸免
And you. And everyone in this room.

118
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,710
只有你会安然无恙吗
Except you?

119
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,450
那我的侄女 爱丽丝
And my niece, Alice,

120
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,920
谁又能确保你们周全呢
who has done you no harm?

121
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,670
你房子里的所有女人都是异教徒
All the women of your house are heretics.

122
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,280
灾祸将使之灰飞烟灭
The plague will rot them all.

123
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,040
我们太迁就着她了 她在嘲笑我们的懦弱
We're too soft with her. She's laughing at us.

124
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,460
她很快就会坦白了
She's close to confessing.

125
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,840
- 你怎么会知道的    - 我侄女昨晚一直陪着她
- What makes you think that?  - Because my niece is with her at night.

126
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,440
看见她因为每天骗人而暗自哭泣
She cries because she knows she's a fraud.

127
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,680
然后将眼泪从眼皮下拭去
Then she peeps out from under her eyelids

128
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,000
看看她的眼泪里有些什么
to see the effect her tears have had.

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,220
相信我吧 她会坦白的  我打算把她的追随者都带回来
Trust me, she'll confess. I want to start bringing in her followers.

130
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,020
- 托马斯 莫尔？  -不 他没参与这件事
- Thomas More?  - No, he's clear of this.

131
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,320
那她之前提到的其他人呢 费舍尔大主教 埃克塞特夫人 波兰人
The others she mentioned? Bishop Fisher, Lady Exeter, the Poles?

132
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,220
我会处理好的
I'll deal with them myself.

133
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,600
在这片土地上 还有一些很有影响力的人
They are some of the most powerful people in the land.

134
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,520
是嘛 我也会用我最好的态度的
Well, then, I'll be on my best behaviour.

135
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,840
- 大主教阁下  - 本尼迪克特  - 你怎可如此大意？
- My Lord Bishop.  - Benedic...  - Why are you so gullible?

136
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,170
你最好能祈求国王的原谅
You'd better ask the King's forgiveness.

137
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,760
-请他看在你年老体弱的份上 从轻发落  - 我无意冒犯
- Plead old age. Infirmity.  - I don't know my offence.

138
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,920
无论你怎么想 我都没有重头再来的机会了
And, whatever you think, I am not in my second childhood.

139
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,140
我认为你有
I think you are.

140
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,570
为什么你如此愿意相信伊丽莎白 巴顿
Why else would you have given such credence to Elizabeth Barton?

141
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,640
因为当她说出这些话的时候 她有满腔热血
Because when she speaks, she is inspired.

142
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,640
我也看到了抹大拉的玛丽
With my own eyes I have seen a golden letter

143
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,320
发送的金色信件
sent by Mary Magdalene...

144
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,400
抹大拉的玛丽 哈 不过事实上 这是博金教父撰写的
Mary Magdalene, yes. Actually it was written by Father Bocking.

145
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,840
一个叫威廉 霍克赫斯特的僧侣
The gilding is by a monk.

146
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,280
给它镀的金
One William Hawkhurst.

147
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,280
我们还知道 在大人上任之前
And we know that before the Lord goes about his work,

148
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,020
通过周围的仆人们 发布了律己令
he gives a warning of himself through his servants.

149
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,680
阿莫斯先知可都没有做到这样...
For is it not stated by the prophet Amos...

150
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,040
拜托 请不要在我面前称呼阿莫斯为先知
Please, don't prophet Amos me.

151
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,830
巴顿威胁了国王 擅自揣测了他的生死
Barton threatened the King. She foresaw his death.

152
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
预知这结果和渴望着结果 可不是一个概念
Foreseeing is not the same as desiring.

153
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,200
她与国王的敌人为伍
She sat down with the King's enemies

154
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,120
并怂恿他们取国王而代之
and told them they would be king.

155
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,120
如果你指的是埃克塞特  为何你不亲自跟他谈呢
If you mean Exeter, why don't you speak to him?

156
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,600
不过 埃克塞特并没有公开反对国王
Well, Exeter's not been writing against the King.

157
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,320
-你却有   - 证据呢 拿出来看看
- You have.  - Where? Show me?

158
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,510
你在国外的那些印刷匠们 他们很不错 现在正在为我效力了
Your printers abroad, they're very good. They're working for me now.

159
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,240
去年六月 正值王后加冕大庆
In June last year, just after the Queen was crowned,

160
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,080
你的儿子蒙塔古勋爵 和你的儿子杰弗里 波利 与玛丽夫人共进晚餐
your son Lord Montague and your son Geoffrey Pole dined with Lady Mary.

161
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,960
半月之后 又一次进餐
Two weeks later, they dined with her again.

162
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,990
我着实好奇他们谈了些什么
I wonder what they discussed?

163
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,020
你当然会好奇
I'm sure you do.

164
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,970
事实上 我并没有
Actually, no, I don't.

165
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:56,090
在厨房帮忙扛芦笋的孩子 是我的人
The boy who carried in the asparagus, that was my boy.

166
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,240
切杏仁的孩子 也也是我的人
The boy who cut the apricots, he was mine, too.

167
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,480
那时的日子过得是那么自在舒心  不过一去不复返了
Holy simplicity was all very well in its day, but its day is over.

168
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,080
我们现在可是被卷入了战争中
We're at war.

169
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,940
不能仅仅因为国王的士兵们未曾攻陷街道
Just because the Emperor's soldiers aren't running down the street,

170
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,400
就自欺欺人
don't deceive yourself.

171
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,360
这是一场战争 而你 身在敌营
This is a war and you're in the enemy camp.

172
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,000
他们在谈论王位 谈到入侵
They talked about the Emperor, about the invasion,

173
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,630
商讨事半功倍的妙计
about the best way to bring it about.

174
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,760
正如你所见 玛格丽特夫人
So, you see, Lady Margaret...

175
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,440
我对你的一家可谓是仁至义尽了
..your family owes much to my forbearance.

176
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,980
夫人 写信给国王 乞求他的原谅吧
Write to the King, my lady, beg his forgiveness.

177
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,560
告诉他你是那么的天真 那么容易受人欺骗
Tell him you are exceptionally easy to mislead.

178
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,160
告诉他 你脑子里都生虫了
Tell him that you don't have the brain of a flea.

179
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,730
卑躬屈膝去乞求原谅
Grovel.

180
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,950
我现在终于知道沃尔西当初为何要留着你了
I see why Wolsey retained you.

181
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,880
你们都是一丘之貉
You are a ruffian, and so was he.

182
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,800
看你是病的不轻了 回床躺着吧
Fall ill. Take to your bed.

183
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,320
这是我的建议
That's what I recommend.

184
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,400
真是难以置信 他们居然会背叛我
It's hard to believe they'd betray me.

185
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,190
这些人 我对他们了如指掌
These people, I've known them all my life.

186
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,310
我小时候 就已经认识埃克塞特了
Exeter's been a friend of mine since I was a boy.

187
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:24,700
你记得格林威治吗 那次的圣诞节 那场雪仗
Do you remember Greenwich, that Christmas? The snowball fight?

188
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,130
要怪只能怪他老婆
It's the wife who's to blame.

189
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,760
看起来是柔情似水 风骚尤物
She's fickle and weak, like all her sex.

190
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,950
- 但其实满腹心机 蛇蝎心肠  - 原谅她吧 写封信宽慰她
- Easily led into scheming. - Forgive her. Write her a pardon.

191
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,160
让这些人对您充满感激之情
Put these people under a debt of gratitude to you.

192
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,760
这种人要是得到您的原谅 那我们岂不都被当傻子耍吗
If you forgive them, they'll play us for fools.

193
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,400
大人 我可不是这么想
I don't think so, my lord.

194
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,440
- 现在他们的一举一动 都逃不过我的双眼   - 波利家也是吗？
- Everything they do now, they do under my eye.  - And the Poles?

195
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,880
是的 我认为他们也应该得到宽恕
Well, I don't think they should be allowed to assume

196
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,000
- 他们会被宽恕的    -格林威治！
- they'll be pardoned.  - Greenwich!

197
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,560
那年圣诞节  大雪深及膝盖
That Christmas, the snow was knee-deep.

198
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,720
亨利 那时 我们都还年轻着
Christ, we were young then, Harry.

199
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,600
你和那个女孩 漂流到紫杉木下 就找不到方向了 足足半小个小时
You got lost in that drift under the yew tree for half an hour

200
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,960
她叫什么名字来着 谁谁谁的女儿
with that girl. What's her name? So-and-so's daughter.

201
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,120
你打算怎么处置这些控诉
How will you frame the charges?

202
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,850
一般的律师不会和那些说自己能飞
Well, the common law doesn't deal with women who say they can fly

203
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,000
或复活的疯女人打交道
or bring back the dead.

204
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,040
主犯以叛国罪论处
Treason for the principals.

205
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,360
从犯 终身监禁 财产充公 罚款
For the accessories, life imprisonment, confiscations, fines.

206
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,370
我相信国王是仁慈的
I think the King will be merciful.

207
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,480
相比这些 我倒是对那些举报谋反消息的人更感兴趣
I'm more interested in unravelling the plans of these people.

208
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,800
反正我是清白的
Well, I'm clear anyway.

209
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,000
你知道我是清白的对吧
You know I'm clear!

210
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,200
你还记得 你是怎么把国王比喻成一头温顺的狮子吗
Do you remember how you used to compare the King to a tamed lion?

211
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,840
只要你愿意 你可以亲抚他 提拉他的耳朵
You can pet him, you can pull at his ears if you wish.

212
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,600
但你一直以来 都是在自说自话的
But all the time you're thinking to yourself...

213
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,600
它的爪子 看看它的爪子
..those claws, look at those claws.

214
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,480
我们打算提议 继承人发案
We're putting a Bill of Succession forward,

215
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,480
确立安妮为亨利的合法妻子
recognising Anne as Henry's lawful wife

216
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,520
而他们的孩子也将是合法继承人
and their children as the rightful heirs.

217
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,440
如果法案通过的话
If the bill succeeds, and it will,

218
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,720
我们很乐意盖戳 宣誓
we'd like to seal the act with an oath.

219
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,870
什么样的法律需要通过宣誓确立？
What sort of legislation needs to be confirmed by an oath?

220
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,200
好吧 信不信由你
Well, believe it or not,

221
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,990
那些知道该怎样立法的人都会被留在罗马
there are those who will feel such matters should be left to Rome.

222
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,810
我们想明确表示 罗马在英格兰
We want to make it clear that Rome has no legitimate voice

223
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,530
没有合法发言权
here in England.

224
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,240
所以 你为什么不直接去签署誓约呢
So, why don't you sign the oath?

225
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,280
毫无疑问地献上你的忠心
Put your loyalty beyond doubt.

226
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,960
她看起来好像很享受被关注的感觉
She seems to be rather enjoying the attention.

227
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,880
也许那是她一直都想要的
Perhaps that's all she ever wanted.

228
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,880
和我回家吃晚饭
Come home for dinner with me.

229
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,040
如果你只是想款待我吃喝 当然没问题
Well, I would if you only wanted to put food in my mouth.

230
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,800
但恐怕你也更喜欢用你的一堆大道理来款待我吧
But I think you'd like to put words there, too.

231
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,800
你提到了我的死亡
You mention my death.

232
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,440
‘如果亲爱的王后
"If it should happen, your said dear

233
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,750
挚爱的妻子 安妮 升天而去...'
"and beloved wife, Queen Anne, to decease..."

234
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,960
我不能排除这种可能性
I can't exclude the possibility.

235
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,000
你说如果我死了 他就可以另选王后
You say that if I die, he can put another queen in my place.

236
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,160
我无法想象有其他人替代你的场景 亲爱的
I can't imagine anyone else in your place, sweetheart.

237
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,660
这一切只是假设性的
It's notional only.

238
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,840
那如果她有儿子呢
And what if she has a son?

239
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,570
她的儿子会继承王位 那么我的女儿怎么样
That son will inherit. And then what will happen to my daughter

240
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,360
还有她的名号
and her claim?

241
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,910
她仍是英格兰的公主
Well, she would still be Princess of England.

242
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,670
你看 上面说...
Look, it says here...

243
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,200
上面怎么没说西班牙的玛丽是个私生女
And where does it say Spanish Mary is a bastard?

244
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,440
玛丽夫人并没有继承的权利
Lady Mary is out of the line of succession,

245
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,880
所以您的推理是对的 原谅我的措辞
so the inference is clear. Forgive the language.

246
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,150
我们试图公正地编写法律 那样就不会偏向任何人
We try to write the laws sparingly, so that they're not personal.

247
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,280
但这本来就是关乎个人的
This IS personal.

248
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,800
亲爱的 克伦威尔为我们做的很好
Cromwell serves us well, sweetheart.

249
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,450
你不应该责骂他 要责骂也应该骂别人
He's not who you should rail against. There are others.

250
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,230
比如说斯蒂芬 伽德纳
Stephen Gardiner, for one.

251
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,920
他曾经冒犯我
The way he has turned on me.

252
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,400
我讨厌忘恩负义和不忠不义
I hate ingratitude. Hate disloyalty.

253
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,810
托马斯 莫尔是另一个让我失望的人
Thomas More is another one who has disappointed me.

254
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,200
抱歉 我先离开了 陛下
If Your Majesties will excuse me.

255
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,320
你的法案很针对伊丽莎白 巴顿
Your bill against Elizabeth Barton.

256
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,530
你应该把莫尔也加到有罪的名单里
You should add More to the list of the guilty.

257
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,090
陛下 托马斯 莫尔并没有参与其中
Thomas More is not involved, Your Majesty.

258
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,380
巴顿还没被抓时 他就已经投靠我们了
He came to me even before Barton was arrested.

259
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,560
无论如何也要加进去
Do it anyway.

260
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,560
我要让他恐惧 恐惧可以毁掉一个人
I want him frightened. Fright can unmake a man.

261
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,640
我曾见识过
I've seen it happen.

262
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,210
克伦威尔？
Cromwell?

263
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,200
我是不会死的 我也会给陛下生个儿子
I won't die. I'll give the King a son.

264
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,700
我的血脉也会一直延续下去
And I won't die.

265
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,720
你要我为莫尔向陛下求情
You want me to kneel down and beg for More's life?

266
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,200
大人 下议院并不想莫尔出现在名单里
The Commons won't like him being included on the list, my lord.

267
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,910
不然他们也许会反对法案
They could oppose the bill.

268
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,000
而且国王发誓会在他们来之前就到 他很坚持
And the King swears he'll come before them himself and insist.

269
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,890
那样的话国王可能会引起公愤
He could have a very public fall.

270
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,440
大人如果向陛下求情 陛下一定不会拒绝您
If you begged, my lord, the King couldn't refuse you.

271
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,230
陛下还能全身而退
It'll allow His Majesty an honourable way back.

272
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,000
毕竟我们是在让陛下
After all, we're asking him

273
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,560
违背他妻子的意愿
to contradict the wishes of his own wife.

274
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,080
的确 这是我侄女的作风
That's true. This is my niece's work.

275
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,280
专横霸道的女人
Take things personally, women.

276
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,040
我觉得国王很喜欢这样的女人
I think the King takes it personally.

277
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,960
所以说他很无能 他干嘛要关心莫尔对他的看法
Which is weak. Why should he care what More thinks of him?

278
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,560
你说陛下无能？
You call the King weak?

279
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,380
"说陛下无能" "说陛下无能"
"Call the King weak!" "Call the King weak!"

280
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,880
法官大人 你哪怕一次为自己说话好吗
Speaking for yourself for once, Lord Chancellor?

281
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,040
你总是等到克伦威尔发言了
Usually, you wait till Cromwell speaks

282
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,880
才开口 "噢 你说的对 汤姆"
and then it's, "Tweet tweet, whatever you say, Tom!"

283
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,920
我现在要有把弩 就马上把你该死的脑袋射下来
If I had a crossbow, I'd shoot your fucking head off!

284
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,720
我说过不准人进来！
I said no-one in!

285
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,040
托马斯 莫尔的女婿来为他求情 大人
Thomas More's son-in-law is here to plead for him, sir.

286
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,720
哼
Hm.

287
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,760
大人？
My lord?

288
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,660
要让萨尔福克大人代您接见吗
Should we send for my Lord Suffolk instead?

289
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,480
不用 他的儿子快死了 他的唯一继承人
No, his son's dying. His heir.

290
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,960
他得忙着和新任妻子再续香火呢
He'll have to start breeding again with his new wife.

291
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,600
他老婆才14岁 你们知道吗
She's 14, you know?

292
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,270
他才不会让她一个人呆着
He won't leave her alone.

293
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,020
我可不是从他老婆惊吓的表情得知的
Not judging by the startled look on her face.

294
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,050
我要是能摆脱我老婆就好了
If only I could get rid of my wife.

295
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,400
大人 你已经成功经营了20年的婚姻了
My lord, you've been well married these 20 years.

296
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,240
是 我知道
Yes. I know.

297
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,960
就像把自己装在一个灰皮袋里20年一样
It's like placing your person inside a grizzled leather bag.

298
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,320
好了 我去见他女婿 如果克伦威尔和我一起的话
All right, I'll do it. If Cranmer does it, too.

299
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,960
这些门外汉要跪到膝盖烂吗
Why should the laymen wear out their joints?

300
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,840
她要是听到了估计会吐血
She'll spit blood when she hears!

301
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,440
好吧
Very well.

302
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,040
把他名字从法案中除掉吧
Remove his name from the bill.

303
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,840
但是告诉他 必须宣誓
But tell him, he will take the oath.

304
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,500
还以为我要在这多耗一个小时
Thought I'd be stuck there for another hour, entreating

305
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,810
万般恳求呢
and entreating.

306
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,720
克伦威尔！
Cromwell!

307
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,440
王后想她的...
The Queen has missed her...

308
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,620
啊
Ah.

309
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,990
这次 英格兰
This time, for sure.

310
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,880
一定是我们的了
England is ours.

311
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,720
克伦！
Crom!

312
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,040
我不能签誓
I can't take the oath.

313
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,320
但我也不会出声反对它
But I will not speak against it.

314
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,040
也不会阻止任何人宣誓
And I won't try to dissuade anyone else from it.

315
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,640
那是不够的 你知道的
That's not enough, and you know it's not.

316
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,010
这些是已经宣誓的全部的神父名单
These are the names of the priests who have all sworn to the act.

317
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,400
你知道的 国会议员们都...很顺从
You know the members of Parliament are...conformable.

318
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,320
你为什么不呢
So, why not you?

319
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,680
这地方对我们任何人来说都不舒服
This is not a comfortable place for any of us.

320
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,970
比你要去的任何地方都舒服
More comfortable than where you're going.

321
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,760
我相信我不是去地狱的
Well, not Hell. I trust.

322
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,480
那么 如果你签了这个誓约 灵魂就会被诅咒的话
So, if your soul is damned if you sign this oath,

323
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,880
这些人怎么办 难道他们都被诅咒了吗
what about all of these? Are they damned?

324
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,840
还是说因为你的道德品行 要比他们都高尚？
Or is your conscience so much more refined than all of theirs?

325
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,360
我不能谈论他们的道德
I cannot speak for their conscience.

326
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,840
一谈起道德
Well, where it is a question of conscience,

327
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,920
就一定会产生疑惑
there must be some doubt.

328
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,480
当你将为国王服务时
And when you entered the King's service,

329
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,160
你要起誓听命于他
you took an oath to obey him.

330
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:39,400
所以 你难道不会对那样的肯定和宣誓心存疑虑么?
So, won't you set your doubts against that certainty and swear?

331
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,100
你被任命为大主教时 你对罗马起誓
When you were appointed archbishop, you swore an oath to Rome.

332
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,160
但是他们说 整个庆典上 你很少把纸叠起来
But they say, all through the ceremony, you kept a little

333
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,560
说你是极不乐意地起了誓
paper folded up, saying you took the oath under protest.

334
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,930
那也许你也能...
Then perhaps you could...?

335
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,800
当然 你可以那么建议 理查德 里奇
Yes, you would suggest that, Richard Riche.

336
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,600
我记得你年轻时的样子 就是一个无恶不作的家伙
I remember you as a youth and you were ever a creature of vice.

337
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,120
但是 我不会成为那样一个杂耍戏子
But I will not be such a juggler.

338
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,480
我一直敬重你
I have respected you.

339
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,880
从我还是个孩童 我就一直敬重你
Since I was a boy, I have respected you.

340
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,400
但是后来我宁愿眼见自己亲生骨肉被杀 也不愿见你拒绝签署
But I'd sooner see my own son killed, than see you refuse to sign

341
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:29,930
这份誓言 去讨好英格兰的每一个敌人
this oath and give comfort to every enemy of England.

342
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:34,440
噢 格雷戈里是个好小伙
Oh, Gregory is a good boy.

343
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,720
别想他离开
Do not wish him away.

344
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,200
我们不能让你回家
We can't let you go home.

345
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,200
我还能再见到我女儿么?
Will I see my daughter again?

346
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,880
只能再说几句话 就这么多
Just have to say some words, that's all.

347
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,160
啊 就几句话
Ah, just words.

348
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,160
出于好奇 你是行何种恶事的家伙
Out of interest, of what vices are you a creature?

349
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,030
我曾经也只是个小男孩
I was a boy.

350
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,680
但是如今 他见不得我不争取去当牧师
But to this day, he can't see me without trying to make me a sermon.

351
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,930
他至少要给出理由
He should at least give his reasons.

352
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,040
我们知道他的理由 整个欧洲都知道他的理由
We know his reasons. All of Europe knows his reasons.

353
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,240
他反对离婚
He's against the divorce.

354
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,190
他不相信国王能够成为教会的首脑
He doesn't believe the King can be Head of the Church.

355
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,360
他心属罗马 而非英格兰
His heart is with Rome, not with England.

356
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,830
他宁愿看到统治我们的君主强加给我们的一些异邦人
He'd sooner see some foreigner imposed by the Emperor

357
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,120
也不愿支持一个自小就是他挚友的人
ruling us than back a man who has been his friend since childhood

358
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,960
你知道我最恨什么吗?
and do you know what I hate most?

359
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,120
他在撰写一份当前局势的文章让整个欧洲来看
He's writing an account of today for all of Europe to read

360
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,240
文中 我们都是愚昧之人和压迫者
and in it, we'll be the fools and oppressors,

361
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,720
而他是个用精妙的措辞包装起来的可怜受害者
and he'll be the poor victim with the better turn of phrase.

362
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,880
他数年前就写了这个剧
He wrote this play years ago,

363
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,720
每次我台词不顺 他都会嗤笑我
and he sniggers every time I trip over my lines.

364
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,040
你觉得女王的孩子未来如何
Do you think it's already been decided

365
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,700
现在已经能确定吗
what the Queen's baby will be?

366
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,440
还是上帝自由安排
Or does God decide later?

367
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,480
我希望我们能在里面见她 这样我们就能说话了
I wish we could see inside her, so we'd be able to tell.

368
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,160
我倒希望你就呆在威尔特郡
I wish you were down in Wiltshire.

369
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,260
我想要个孩子
I'd like a baby.

370
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,200
注意点 你肚子一旦显形 他们会把你活埋的
Watch yourself. If your belly shows, they'll brick you up alive.

371
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,120
不过 你的家人也许会给你献上祭花的
Although, your family would probably give you a bouquet.

372
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,840
他们不知道在狼厅 应该有怎样的自制力
They don't know what continence is down at Wolf Hall.

373
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,090
我无冒犯之意
I meant no harm.

374
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:15,340
天啊 这就像在引诱一只田鼠 我...
God, it's like baiting a field mouse. I...

375
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,480
王后怎么样了
How is the Queen?

376
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,010
我听说了她孩子没保住
I heard of her loss.

377
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,000
今天必须要做决定
It's a yes or no today.

378
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,400
你必须要开口
You must speak.

379
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,160
如果我对你的誓约说"不" 那么我就置自身于险境
If I say "no" to your oath, I put my body in peril.

380
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,920
如果我说"是" 则是置灵魂于不堪
If I say "yes", my soul.

381
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,980
所以 我什么也不说
So, I say nothing.

382
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,200
费舍尔主教比你更男人
Bishop Fisher is more of a man than you.

383
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,140
他宣布不信奉国教 并承担了后果
He declares his dissent and takes the consequences.

384
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,760
你想当个卖国贼 但是又躲在沉默之中
You want to be a traitor, but hide behind silence.

385
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,480
非也 他想的是成为殉道者
No, what he wants is to be a martyr.

386
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,000
而我只是想回归故里
What I want is to go home.

387
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,040
我永远不懂牺牲和自杀之间
I've never understood where the line is drawn between sacrifice

388
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,280
的界限在哪
and self-slaughter.

389
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,680
基督界定的
Christ drew it.

390
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,520
你没发现这个对比里有什么错么?
You don't find anything wrong in the comparison?

391
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,360
我不伤害任何人
I do nobody harm.

392
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,800
我所言者无害 我所思者亦无害
I say none harm, I think none harm.

393
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,410
如果这还不足以支撑一个人活下去
If this isn't enough to keep a man alive...

394
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:16,030
你不会伤害任何人 那比尔尼呢 拜纳姆呢
You do nobody harm? What about Bilney? What about Bainham?

395
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,630
你还记得你在自己家里折磨的詹姆斯 拜纳姆吗
You remember James Bainham who you had racked in your own home?

396
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,710
那个被你暴打虐待的人
That you had beaten and abused?

397
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,360
他的躯体支离破碎 他们不得不用椅子抬着他
His body was so broken they had to carry him,

398
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,120
到史密斯菲尔德去火化掉
carry him in the chair to Smithfield to be burned!

399
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,800
还有你说 托马斯 莫尔 你不会伤害任何人吗
And you say, Thomas More, you do no-one harm?

400
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,040
你要学会感恩 先生
You just be grateful, sir,

401
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,160
感恩我们没有对你施加 那些你用在别人身上的手段
that we have spared you the methods you use on others.

402
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,010
我们会进行公诉和审讯 国王也很乐意如此的
It's the King's pleasure that we move to indictment and trial.

403
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,680
我在朗伯斯做服务生时 [坎特伯雷大主教官邸]
When I was a serving boy, at Lambeth,

404
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,400
有晚我给你带了面包
I brought you bread one night.

405
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,400
你那时肯定只有14岁左右
You must have been about 14.

406
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,360
他们已经说你是位卓越的学者了
They were already speaking about you being the great scholar.

407
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,920
我记得你当时在看书
You were reading, I remember.

408
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,080
我问你书里有什么
I asked you what was in the book...

409
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,880
...而你说...
..and you said...

410
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,660
"文字...
"Words...

411
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,440
"..文字...
"..words...

412
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,160
"..文字而已"
"..just words."

413
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,360
我已经和你说了 我不记得那时见过你
As I have already told you, I have no recollection of meeting you then.

414
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,760
不 为什么你会不记得
No. Why would you?

415
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
听说你的汀代尔被抓了
Hear your Tyndale's been caught.

416
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,350
他们说有人把他从藏身之处引出来了 一些特工...
They say someone tempted him from his hiding place, some agent...

417
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,370
...然后他被带走了
..and he was taken.

418
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,560
你的人 不 当然不是
Your man? No, of course not.

419
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,040
托马斯 莫尔不会伤害任何人
Thomas More hurts no-one.

420
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,840
开门
Yes.

421
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,710
"都是因为我"
"It's all because of me."

422
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,280
最后当你背叛了莫尔 困扰着他那唯一良心的
When, finally, you have out of More, what troubles his singular

423
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,100
你会发现是他不会对我的女王身份屈膝
conscience, you'll find it's that he won't bend his knee to my queenship.

424
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,280
费舍尔一日不死 我就没有安生日子
I have no peace until Fisher is dead.

425
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,760
莫尔一日不死 我也不得安宁
I have no peace until More is dead.

426
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,840
英格兰将永无宁日
England will have no peace.

427
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,650
托马斯 莫尔 请求罗马君主侵略我们 我知道
Thomas More prays for the Emperor to invade us. I know this.

428
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,760
你知道 他也知道 只是他不会承认
You know this. He knows it, but he won't admit it.

429
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,800
他曾是我朋友
He was my friend.

430
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,500
但是 眼下 当英格兰身处险境
And yet, now, in this time of danger for England,

431
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,600
当你需要他的支持 他却去迎合敌人
when you need his support, he gives comfort to the enemy.

432
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,350
他的沉默 他所依赖的沉默中
This silence of his, on which he relies.

433
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,000
隐藏着叛国野心 所以 逼他开口
It conceals treason. So, MAKE him talk.

434
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,040
不 夫人 我们不必这么做
No, madam, we don't do that.

435
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,320
我的妻子她...
My wife is...

436
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,000
...她的悲伤...
..her grief...

437
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,520
我理解
Yes.

438
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,470
我归咎于凯瑟琳
It's Katherine I blame.

439
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,600
这么些年来她都没有诞下一个子嗣
All those years she couldn't hold a son.

440
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,440
而现在她也在诅咒我
Now, she ill-wishes me.

441
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,800
她冷血的阻拦在我和我爱的女人之间
She lies in between me and the woman I love, with her cold heart...

442
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,040
你知道吗 我连那婴儿是男是女都没看到 就被他们火化了
You know they burnt it before I could see if it was a boy.

443
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,590
这可能真的很难断定 陛下
It may have been impossible to tell, Your Majesty.

444
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,440
毕竟事情发生如此突然
So soon.

445
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,560
这个 额 托马斯 莫尔的这件事
This, erm... This business of Thomas More.

446
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,200
我不怀疑他对罗马的绝对忠心
I don't doubt his loyalty to Rome,

447
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:22,800
也不怀疑他对陛下成为教会首脑的憎恶
or his hatred of Your Majesty's title as Head of the Church.

448
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,160
然而 从合法性上来看 我们的案件很麻烦
However, legally, our case is slender.

449
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,160
不会很容易
It won't be easy.

450
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,040
我留你在这是为了让你解决容易的事么?
Do I keep you for what's easy?

451
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,920
你认为我提拔你是因为你的仪态魅力吗？
Do you think I've promoted you for the charm of your presence?

452
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,040
我让你留在这是因为你是个聪明人
I keep you because you're a serpent.

453
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,360
别反咬一口
Do not be a viper in my bosom.

454
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,040
你知道我的决定 立即执行
You know my decision. Execute it.

455
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,480
壁画上的那个女人
That woman on the wall.

456
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,480
我知道她是谁
I know who she is.

457
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,790
示巴王后
Sheba.

458
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,000
对于你 我明白她在你心中的位置
For you. I know who she is for you.

459
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,920
明白你的目光永远停留在她身上的原因
Why you always look at her.

460
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,040
在安特卫普省他们告诉了我
They told me about her in Antwerp.

461
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,680
克伦威尔爱着的女人
The woman Cromwell loved.

462
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,280
为什么你不回去追求她
Why don't you go back and claim her?

463
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,000
她已嫁做人妇
She's married.

464
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,720
很多年了
It was years ago.

465
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,240
我也变了
I've changed.

466
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,000
呀 你现在很富有
Ja. You're rich now.

467
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,680
我想...
I think...

468
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,990
嗯？
What?

469
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,350
没什么
Nothing.

470
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,720
怎么? 你要把我吊起来直到我开口么?
What? You're going to hang me up by my wrists until I talk?

471
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,280
我想你心中肯定另有佳人了
I think there is another woman in your heart now.

472
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,640
托马斯 莫尔的妻子求见
Thomas More's wife is here to see you.

473
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,420
爱丽丝女士
Lady Alice.

474
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,070
我之前来的时候 这就是个陈旧阴冷的古楼房
When I came here before, this was a musty old place.

475
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,050
我丈夫常和我说 
My husband used to say,

476
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,290
"将托马斯 克伦威尔投进地牢而到傍晚
"Put Thomas Cromwell in a dungeon and by evening,

477
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,980
他就会坐在垫子上 而监狱长还欠着他钱"
"he'll be sitting on cushions, with gaolers owing him money."

478
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,720
他说过要把我投进地牢吗
Did he talk a lot about putting me in dungeons?

479
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,880
他...只是空谈
He... It was only talk.

480
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,640
我想你可以带我去觐见国王
I thought you might take me to see the King.

481
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,320
他对女人都非常友善
I know he's always kind to women.

482
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,240
我做不到 我到希望可以
I can't do that. I wish I could.

483
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,600
你对我们一直都很好 我知道原因
You've always been good to us. I wonder why.

484
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,920
你经常会耍一些伎俩
You always have some trick.

485
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,000
天生的小伎俩是帮不了忙的
Born tricky. Can't help it.

486
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,880
爱丽丝 为什么你的丈夫那么冥顽不固
Alice, why is your husband so stubborn?

487
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,480
我对他的了解 不比对三位一体了解的多
I no more understand him than I do the Holy Trinity.

488
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,440
他担心他太冷漠
I worry he's cold.

489
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,080
他什么都不和我讲
He tells me nothing.

490
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,370
他所有的信都是给他的宝贝梅格
All his letters are to his precious Meg.

491
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,080
当然也不要认为我们之间没有了温情
Don't think there's no tenderness between us.

492
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,440
我们有交易的 虽然时间说不定
We had dealings, one time or another.

493
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,700
当那既成事实 你根本没法帮上忙只能为他担心
And when that's true, you can't help but worry about a man,

494
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,390
想想...
wonder if...

495
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,560
想想如果他感情淡漠时
wonder if he's feeling cold.

496
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,960
当你和他谈话 问问他我的事
When you talk to him, ask him from me...

497
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,120
问他 孤身一人离开发妻当真明智么
Ask him, does he think it's clever to leave his wife without company,

498
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,280
他的儿子无所忠告 他的女儿无所庇护
his son without advice, his daughter without protection?

499
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,360
我们所有人听凭于像他一样的人
And all of us at the mercy of a man like yourself?

500
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,680
我们必须带走你所有的笔 纸还有你的书籍
We have to take away your pens and papers and your books.

501
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,440
好吧 如果你一定要带走他们 就现在吧
Very well. If you must take them, take them now.

502
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,240
爱丽丝来见我 她希望你回家
Alice came to see me. She wants you home.

503
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,400
你所需要做的事就是签了这个字 梅格已经签过了
All you have to do, is sign this. Meg has signed it.

504
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,480
你最爱的女儿
Your own beloved daughter.

505
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,910
快签了这个吧 国王会为此高兴的
Just sign the paper and the King will be happy.

506
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,280
我会安排我的船 将你送回切尔西
I'll send my barge to row you back to Chelsea,

507
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,800
回到你的家园 你的孩子身边 回到爱丽丝夫人身边
back to your garden, your children, back to Dame Alice

508
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,920
那个一直等你归家 独守空闺的女人
who will be waiting to bear you up to your own bed.

509
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,400
难道你不想吗
Don't you want that?

510
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,360
难道你不想逃离这个鬼地方吗
Don't you want to be out of this place you're in?

511
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,920
当我们在天堂重相遇时...
When we meet again in Heaven...

512
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,760
...当然 我希望我们可以相遇...
...as I hope we will...

513
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,380
...我们之间所有的差异都荡然无存了
..all our differences will be forgot.

514
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,000
但现在 我们还不能忽视差异的存在
But, for now, we cannot wish them away.

515
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,400
我现在仅有的 就是我所站立的这片土地
All I have, all I own is the ground I stand upon.

516
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,800
这片土地是我托马斯 莫尔的
That ground is Thomas More.

517
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,160
如果你想占有它 你必须将它从我这里夺走
If you want it, you must take it.

518
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,160
我也不会轻易将它舍弃的
I will not yield it.

519
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,550
当你上庭前你来到这里
When you come before the court,

520
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,600
将你沐浴在王的仁慈之下
throw yourself upon the King's mercy.

521
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,610
陛下并不是一个凶残的人 你知道的
He's not a cruel man, you know that.

522
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,440
我怎么知道
Do I?

523
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,760
最起码他不是一直如此的
He didn't used to be.

524
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,200
虽然他后来更换了他的随从们
But then he's changed the company he keeps.

525
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,610
随便吧
Anyway...

526
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,290
折磨我的肢体什么的都不重要了
It's not important what happens to my body.

527
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,380
难道你不害怕疼痛吗
Are you not afraid of the pain?

528
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,010
噢 当然 我很害怕
Oh, yes. I'm very much afraid.

529
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:35,520
我并不是一个强壮 有精力的人 就像你一样
I am not a strong and robust man, such as yourself.

530
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,080
我无能为力 只能在脑海里想象
I cannot help but rehearse it in my mind.

531
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,400
但也只感受了一小会儿
But I will only feel it for a moment,

532
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,960
而后上帝也不会让我记住这感受的
and God will not let me remember it afterwards.

533
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,240
我将离你而去 你知道吗
I would have left you, you know...

534
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,640
远离你的生活之外
..to live out your life...

535
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,160
为你的残酷赎罪
..to repent your cruelties...

536
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,240
如果我是国王的话
..if I were king.

537
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,780
带走他的书籍
Take away his books.

538
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,200
我将会送给别人
I'll send someone.

539
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,680
不 理查德 我想让你亲自去做
No, Richard, I'd like you to do it yourself.

540
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,160
如果陪审团审判下来 陛下会让我们扒皮抽筋的
If the jury throws it out, the King will skin us alive.

541
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,440
不 王后会的
No. The Queen will.

542
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:49,870
天啊 看起来好像对他施了鞭刑
My God, looks like we've had him whipped.

543
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,320
他说我从不浪费一次骗局
And he says I never miss a trick.

544
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,400
如果他继续保持沉默...
If he stands on his silence...

545
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,480
他的沉默证明不了任何事
His silence proves nothing.

546
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,610
他不用证明什么 大人
He doesn't have to prove anything, my lord.

547
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,360
他的愿望就是他的沉默
His plea is that his silence is consent enough

548
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,040
能让国王足够满意
to the King's desires.

549
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,130
一派胡言
Bollocks.

550
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,640
这是习惯法的准则
It is the maxim of the common law.

551
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,680
还在胡扯
Still bollocks.

552
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,280
他还没有完全噤声
He hasn't been entirely silent.

553
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,880
我过来拿走你的书
I came to take away your books.

554
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,030
我这么做的时候 我试图说服你 这是你最后一次起誓的机会
And as I did so, I tried to convince you one last time to take the oath.

555
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,400
我给你立案了 对吗
I put a case to you, did I not?

556
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:46,160
我问过你 如果议会举行投票并让我做国王...
I asked you, if Parliament had a vote and made me king...

557
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,400
...你会赞同吗
..would you go along with it?

558
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,130
然后你说 "最近议会无论做什么事
And you said, "Nothing that Parliament would do,

559
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:54,920
都不会让我吃惊"
"would surprise me these days.

560
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,080
"但是 如果他们票选 理查德 里奇 成为上帝"
"But, if they voted that Richard Riche should be God,

561
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:00,380
"我就划清界限 到此为止"
"I would draw a line there."

562
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,560
我问你为什么 你还记得你怎么回答的吗
I asked you why? Do you remember your reply?

563
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,080
我对此没有任何记录 没有任何书面材料
I made no record of it, having no writing materials.

564
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,200
你已经把材料从我身边拿走了
You having already taken them from me.

565
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,000
你说"议会不能这么做
You said, "Parliament cannot do it.

566
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,520
法律只能在世俗的世界有效 而不能在天堂"
"It can make laws in the earthly realm, not the heavenly."

567
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,520
所以我说 "这不能使我成为上帝 或者是教会首脑
So I said, "It could not make me God, nor Head of the Church, either,

568
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,640
"但这确实无疑是精神上的管制压迫"
"for surely that is a spiritual jurisdiction?"

569
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,120
你说"不 议会不能那样做"
And you said, "No, Parliament cannot do it."

570
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,400
是什么意思呢
Meaning what?

571
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,960
意思是 如果议会宣布将国王任命为教会首脑
Meaning, if Parliament names the King the Head of the Church,

572
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,280
是不具备法律效力的
it has no effect.

573
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,450
据托马斯爵士所言
According to Sir Thomas.

574
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,240
他否认了国王的头衔
He denied the King's title.

575
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,600
这属于叛国罪
That would be treason.

576
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,760
请大家扪心自问 先生们
Ask yourselves, gentlemen,

577
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,880
我为什么要对理查德 里奇这种人敞开心扉呢
why would I open my mind to a man like Richard Riche?

578
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,910
为什么 当学者和神职人员都恳求我的时候
Why, when the learned and the pious have implored me,

579
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,530
当国王自己因为一些重要的原因来说服我的时候
when the King himself with weighty reasons has sought to persuade me.

580
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:01,130
因为你觉得我不重要
Because you think I don't matter.

581
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,240
这就是你说的
That is what you said.

582
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,490
我会对此起誓的
I will take my oath on it.

583
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:10,040
你起誓？  你的誓言还不如魔鬼的屁!
Your oath? Your oath isn't worth the Devil's fart!

584
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,250
上帝保佑你 里奇 我认识你的时候 你还是个孩子
Christ help you, Riche, I have known you since you were a child,

585
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,680
你的家庭都对你失望了 你是一个赌徒 一个废物
you were the despair of your family, you were a gambler and a waster.

586
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:21,040
我要提醒你 理查德 里奇 现在是律师总管
May I remind you that Richard Riche is Solicitor General,

587
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,280
你不能像对待酒馆侍者一样议论他
and not to be talked to like some pot-boy.

588
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,360
你说的什么可以的话吗?
Did you speak the words alleged?

589
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,200
我对此表示怀疑 如果我说了...
I doubt it, and if I did...

590
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,480
- 如果你说了   - 如果我说了 他们肯定不吝指控我的
- If you did?  - If I did, they were not meant with malice.

591
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,880
所以 法官大人们 你不能认定他们是合理的
And so, masters, you cannot find them treasonable

592
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,060
而且你应当蔑视谣言
and you are bound to disregard such words,

593
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:47,470
无论法庭对你说什么
whatever this court tells you.

594
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,200
罪犯 这个法庭发现你有叛国行为
Prisoner, this court has found you guilty of treason.

595
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,710
你的审判将在...
Your sentence will be...

596
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,640
请原谅我 罪犯还有什么要说的吗
Forgive me. Does the prisoner have anything to say?

597
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,600
我遵从了我的良知
I have followed my conscience.

598
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,000
请你也一定遵从你的良心
You must follow yours.

599
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,170
我已履行的良知 现在我要简单地说两句
My conscience satisfies me and now, I will speak plainly,

600
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,480
你的法令是错误的 你的权力也毫无根基
that your statute is faulty and your authority baseless.

601
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,250
我的良知与大多数人一样
My conscience stands with the majority.

602
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,720
抵制亨利的王朝 我拥有的是基督世界所有王国的支持
Against Henry's kingdom, I have all the kingdoms of Christendom!

603
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,360
你现在已经暴露了你的野心 先生!
Now we see your malice, sir!

604
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,440
反对你的每一个主教...
Against each one of your bishops...

605
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,200
现在我们看到的是 你选择的罗马而不是英格兰!
Now, we see you choose Rome over England!

606
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,240
- 反对你的议会 先生!  - 你这个叛徒!
- Against your Parliament!  - You traitor!

607
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,960
我拥有教会所有委员会
I have all the general councils of the Church,

608
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,160
将在这一切的背后蔓延千年!
stretching back for a thousand years!

609
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,720
这是他最后时刻带在身边的的祈祷书
It's the prayer book he had with him at the end.

610
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,080
您并没有选择 大人
You had no choice, master.

611
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,130
托马斯?
Thomas?

612
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,080
莉兹
Liz.

613
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,080
托马斯 这是乔安娜
Thomas? It's Johane.

614
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,670
你发烧了
You have a fever.

615
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:29,160
莉兹 让我...
Liz, let me...

616
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,760
让我去爱她
Let me love her.

617
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,000
让我去爱她 莉兹
Let me love her, Liz.

618
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,960
快去找巴茨大人来
Fetch Dr Butts.

619
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:11,200
是我在意大利患上的一种发烧症状
It's a fever I got in Italy.

620
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,440
那有条蛇
It was a snake.

621
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,220
就是这样
Let's say it is.

622
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,120
如果我快死了...
If I'm dying...

623
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,320
...找格雷戈里来
..get Gregory.

624
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:38,560
格雷戈里 有些事我要告诉他
Gregory, there's things I need to tell him.

625
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:52,120
慢点 这样我就能看见你是怎么做的了
Slow down, so I can see how you do it.

626
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,760
我不能慢下来
I can't slow down.

627
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:57,200
如果我停下来去想我在怎么做 我就会做不起来
If I stop to think how I'm doing it, I won't be able to do it.

628
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,520

第1季 第4集

00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,900
狼·廳

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,120
她身體健康嗎
Healthy?

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,020
很健康 陛下
Yes, Your Majesty.

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,740
為她冠名 伊麗莎白
Call her Elizabeth.

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,920
取消騎士們的競技比武
Cancel the jousts.

15
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,930
- 他只字未問王后的情況如何  - 現在已經無關緊要了 不是嗎
- He didn't ask how the Queen was.  - Hardly matters now, does it?

16
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,960
我覺得她是餓了
I think she was hungry.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,490
我女兒要去住在哈特菲爾德
My daughter is to live at Hatfield.

18
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,520
是的
Yes.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,600
我覺得西班牙人瑪麗的家庭應該被拆分開
I think Spanish Mary's household should be broken up.

20
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,330
她能成為我女兒家里的一份子
She can become a member of my daughter's household.

21
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,980
作為什么樣的存在
In the capacity of?

22
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,470
作為我女兒的女傭
In the capacity of my daughter's servant.

23
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,980
不然她還能是什么
What else can she be?

24
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,480
沒必要有偽裝的平等
There can be no pretence of equality.

25
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,030
瑪麗態度傲慢且令人討厭
Mary is a bastard.

26
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,960
廢物要利用 事態主次順序也要維護
Waste can be saved and the proper order of things asserted.

27
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,910
與此同時 我要你去一趟法國
Meanwhile, I want you to go to France.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,800
我要為我的女兒和一位法國王子定親
I want a marriage contract for my daughter. A French prince.

29
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,000
- 斯蒂芬 伽得納他... - 你今天對我的話好像有很多意見
- Stephen Gardiner is...  - You're very unwilling today.

30
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,570
你是不喜歡法國嗎
You don't like the French?

31
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,300
那或許你會愿意和羅馬皇帝去談結盟
Perhaps you would prefer an alliance with the Emperor?

32
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,750
你和他的親信關系很好 不是嗎
You're very friendly with his man, aren't you?

33
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,300
沙皮？
Chapuys?

34
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,050
沒別的事我就告辭了 王后
If that will be all, Your Majesty?

35
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,800
嗯
Hmm.

36
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,020
你為何不把那女孩買下
Why don't you ask for her?

37
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,440
西摩家族很窮
The Seymours are poor.

38
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,240
他們會很樂意將她賣給你的
They'll sell her to you happily.

39
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,110
你誤會了我的興趣所在
You mistake my interest.

40
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,720
呵呵呵 把你的謊話留著在下議院的時候說吧 你騙不到我的
Oh, fah-la-la! Tell your lies to the Commons, not to me.

41
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,000
我能看透很多事情
I see things.

42
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,320
你和我 我們都要特別留心
You and me, we keep our eyes open.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,080
我能留心注意到一些你目不能及的地方
I could keep my eyes open in places you cannot go.

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,020
比如說 安妮的房間里
In Anne's rooms, for example.

45
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,700
每次傳召外人的時候 她都在做禱告
When you call you'll find her at prayer,

46
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,840
為乞丐女人縫衣服
sewing a smock for a beggar woman.

47
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,720
可您以為這是事情真相嗎
Do you think that's what's really going on?

48
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,650
你覺得她真的能拋棄那些年輕機靈的男寵們嗎
Do you think she's given up all her nimble young men?

49
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,240
能拋棄那些贊頌她的美麗的十四行詩嗎
All those sonnets in praise of her beauty?

50
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,760
但現在有國王為她贊頌了
She has the King to praise her now.

51
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,760
除非她能再次懷上龍種 否則她將獨守深宮了
She'll get no praise from him until she has a ripe belly again.

52
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,920
難道有什么阻礙嗎
And what would hinder that?

53
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,990
沒事...如果他能讓她再次懷上的話
Nothing...if he's up to it.

54
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,280
你說話小心點
Careful.

55
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,430
那個小賤人就這樣進進出出宮里的每個房間
And that little sneak is for ever in and out of every room,

56
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,550
像是要為所有年輕男子們做媒一樣
acting as a go-between for all the gallants.

57
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,970
- 噢 我看那小男孩挺好的啊  - 他根本不知道自己的處境
- Oh, I see no harm in the boy.  - He doesn't know his place.

58
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,230
他只是個跳梁小丑 在拼命把握機會
He's a jumped-up nobody, taking his chance

59
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,070
因為這是個混亂的時代
because the times are disordered.

60
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,000
呵 我想你也可以完全這么評價我的 羅奇福德夫人
Well, I suppose you could say the same thing about me, Lady Rochford,

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,980
我也想相信你會的
and I'm sure you do.

62
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,380
王后在任何地方都能看到敵人
The Queen sees enemies everywhere.

63
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,160
本就如此
So she should.

64
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,720
所有人都在等著她失勢下位
They're waiting for her to fail.

65
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,150
她說她會為亨利生下王子
She's said she'll give Henry a son,

66
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,190
但如果她做不到 所有的古老家族們都會反戈一擊
so if she doesn't, all the old families are waiting their turn.

67
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,260
- 我們的圣女怎么樣了  - 十分受歡迎
- How's our Holy Maid?  - Popular.

68
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,050
她說抹大拉的瑪麗亞給她一封純金鑲裹的信
Mary Magdalene sent her a letter, illuminated in gold.

69
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,250
有訪客？
Visitors?

70
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,770
讓她進來
Bring her in.

71
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,690
你說你可以在天堂、地獄和煉獄中自由穿梭？
You say that you can roam through Heaven, Hell and Purgatory?

72
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,330
那你一定見過惡魔咯
And have you seen the Devil also?

73
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,940
他長相如何
And how did he look?

74
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,130
像一只大鳥
Like a bird.

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,720
呵 那可真是松了口氣
That's a relief.

76
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,550
你太天真了
You think so?

77
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,010
他惡臭難當
He stinks!

78
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,040
他的利爪上血屎斑斑
He's got claws smeared with blood and shit.

79
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,210
他有一次化身年輕的俊美男子
He came to me once as a young man...

80
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,000
勾引我
to tempt me.

81
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,670
占我便宜
Pawing at me.

82
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,560
那你呢 受了勾引沒
And were you? Tempted?

83
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,050
我可不會屈服撒旦的
I'm not for Satan.

84
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,600
- 我一拒絕了他 他就向我吐口水 - 他可真沒教養
- When I rejected him he spat in my face.  - No manners.

85
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,790
我拿紙巾擦去
I wiped it off with a napkin.

86
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,880
是一團黑色的 冒著地獄惡臭的
It's black, with the stench of Hell...

87
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,160
腐爛物
..something rotting.

88
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,440
那東西現在在哪
And where is it now?

89
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,240
在多姆 愛德華那里
Dom Edwards has it.

90
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,040
- 難道他要讓人們買票參觀嗎  - 是當作祭品
- And does he show it to people for money?  - For offerings.

91
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,160
你說國王一旦娶了安妮夫人
You said that the King wouldn't reign one month

92
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,670
就不會在位超過一個月
after he married Lady Anne.

93
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,480
可是...
Well...

94
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,830
數月過去了 安妮夫人成了王后
the months have passed and the Lady Anne is queen

95
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,120
還給國王生下了孩子
and has given the King a child.

96
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,180
所以呢...你現在還有什么可說的？
So...what do you say now?

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,950
我只能說 在上帝眼中
I say, in the eyes of God,

98
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,960
他已經不再是國王了 甚至比不上這個大主教的地位
he's no more the real king than HE is the real archbishop.

99
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,520
這就是你們叛變的正當理由嗎
Then would it be justified to raise a rebellion against him?

100
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,210
暗殺他 再另尋君主？
Assassinate him? Put another in his place?

101
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,740
你覺得呢
What do you think?

102
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,200
在所有可能的金雀花王朝候選家族中
Of the possible Plantagenet claimants to the throne

103
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,360
你選擇了考特尼家族 而不是波蘭人
you've chosen the Courtenay family, not the Poles.

104
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,400
埃克塞特侯爵 亨利  而不是蒙塔古勛爵 亨利
Henry, Marquis of Exeter, not Henry, Lord Montague,

105
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,350
- 還是你把他們倆搞混了   - 當然沒有
- or do you get them mixed up?  - Of course not.

106
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,790
這兩位紳士及他們的夫人 我都見過了
I've met both of those gentlemen. I've met their wives.

107
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,900
還見過了費舍爾主教 他們都站在我這邊
I've met Bishop Fisher. They all come to me.

108
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,150
考特尼家族是傳承自愛德華國王的女兒一脈
Now, Courtenay descends from a daughter of King Edward.

109
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,290
蒙塔古則是傳承自他的哥哥
Montague from his brother.

110
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,240
你如何把他們的利益需求安排妥當呢
How would you sort out their claims?

111
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,720
還是說讓他們自己爭出個結果呢
Or would you let them scrap it out?

112
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,000
如果想掀起一場戰爭的話
It's good to have a few kings and queens in reserve

113
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,920
多預留幾個國王王后是很有必要的 對嗎
if you are going to start a war.

114
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,840
噢 沒必要嫌棄戰爭的
Oh, no need of a war.

115
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,320
天將降大禍于英格蘭
God is sending a plague to England.

116
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,760
- 不出半年 亨利和那個臭婊子都會命喪黃泉   - 我呢？
- Henry will be dead in six months and so will his whore.  - And me?

117
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,000
不止你 這個屋子里的人 無一幸免
And you. And everyone in this room.

118
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,710
只有你會安然無恙嗎
Except you?

119
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,450
那我的侄女 愛麗絲
And my niece, Alice,

120
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,920
誰又能確保你們周全呢
who has done you no harm?

121
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,670
你房子里的所有女人都是異教徒
All the women of your house are heretics.

122
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,280
災禍將使之灰飛煙滅
The plague will rot them all.

123
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,040
我們太遷就著她了 她在嘲笑我們的懦弱
We're too soft with her. She's laughing at us.

124
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,460
她很快就會坦白了
She's close to confessing.

125
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,840
- 你怎么會知道的    - 我侄女昨晚一直陪著她
- What makes you think that?  - Because my niece is with her at night.

126
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,440
看見她因為每天騙人而暗自哭泣
She cries because she knows she's a fraud.

127
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,680
然后將眼淚從眼皮下拭去
Then she peeps out from under her eyelids

128
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,000
看看她的眼淚里有些什么
to see the effect her tears have had.

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,220
相信我吧 她會坦白的  我打算把她的追隨者都帶回來
Trust me, she'll confess. I want to start bringing in her followers.

130
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,020
- 托馬斯 莫爾？  -不 他沒參與這件事
- Thomas More?  - No, he's clear of this.

131
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,320
那她之前提到的其他人呢 費舍爾大主教 埃克塞特夫人 波蘭人
The others she mentioned? Bishop Fisher, Lady Exeter, the Poles?

132
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,220
我會處理好的
I'll deal with them myself.

133
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,600
在這片土地上 還有一些很有影響力的人
They are some of the most powerful people in the land.

134
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,520
是嘛 我也會用我最好的態度的
Well, then, I'll be on my best behaviour.

135
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,840
- 大主教閣下  - 本尼迪克特  - 你怎可如此大意？
- My Lord Bishop.  - Benedic...  - Why are you so gullible?

136
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,170
你最好能祈求國王的原諒
You'd better ask the King's forgiveness.

137
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,760
-請他看在你年老體弱的份上 從輕發落  - 我無意冒犯
- Plead old age. Infirmity.  - I don't know my offence.

138
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,920
無論你怎么想 我都沒有重頭再來的機會了
And, whatever you think, I am not in my second childhood.

139
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,140
我認為你有
I think you are.

140
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,570
為什么你如此愿意相信伊麗莎白 巴頓
Why else would you have given such credence to Elizabeth Barton?

141
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,640
因為當她說出這些話的時候 她有滿腔熱血
Because when she speaks, she is inspired.

142
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,640
我也看到了抹大拉的瑪麗
With my own eyes I have seen a golden letter

143
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,320
發送的金色信件
sent by Mary Magdalene...

144
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,400
抹大拉的瑪麗 哈 不過事實上 這是博金教父撰寫的
Mary Magdalene, yes. Actually it was written by Father Bocking.

145
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,840
一個叫威廉 霍克赫斯特的僧侶
The gilding is by a monk.

146
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,280
給它鍍的金
One William Hawkhurst.

147
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,280
我們還知道 在大人上任之前
And we know that before the Lord goes about his work,

148
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,020
通過周圍的仆人們 發布了律己令
he gives a warning of himself through his servants.

149
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,680
阿莫斯先知可都沒有做到這樣...
For is it not stated by the prophet Amos...

150
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,040
拜托 請不要在我面前稱呼阿莫斯為先知
Please, don't prophet Amos me.

151
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,830
巴頓威脅了國王 擅自揣測了他的生死
Barton threatened the King. She foresaw his death.

152
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
預知這結果和渴望著結果 可不是一個概念
Foreseeing is not the same as desiring.

153
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,200
她與國王的敵人為伍
She sat down with the King's enemies

154
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,120
并慫恿他們取國王而代之
and told them they would be king.

155
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,120
如果你指的是埃克塞特  為何你不親自跟他談呢
If you mean Exeter, why don't you speak to him?

156
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,600
不過 埃克塞特并沒有公開反對國王
Well, Exeter's not been writing against the King.

157
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,320
-你卻有   - 證據呢 拿出來看看
- You have.  - Where? Show me?

158
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,510
你在國外的那些印刷匠們 他們很不錯 現在正在為我效力了
Your printers abroad, they're very good. They're working for me now.

159
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,240
去年六月 正值王后加冕大慶
In June last year, just after the Queen was crowned,

160
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,080
你的兒子蒙塔古勛爵 和你的兒子杰弗里 波利 與瑪麗夫人共進晚餐
your son Lord Montague and your son Geoffrey Pole dined with Lady Mary.

161
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,960
半月之后 又一次進餐
Two weeks later, they dined with her again.

162
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,990
我著實好奇他們談了些什么
I wonder what they discussed?

163
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,020
你當然會好奇
I'm sure you do.

164
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,970
事實上 我并沒有
Actually, no, I don't.

165
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:56,090
在廚房幫忙扛蘆筍的孩子 是我的人
The boy who carried in the asparagus, that was my boy.

166
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,240
切杏仁的孩子 也也是我的人
The boy who cut the apricots, he was mine, too.

167
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,480
那時的日子過得是那么自在舒心  不過一去不復返了
Holy simplicity was all very well in its day, but its day is over.

168
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,080
我們現在可是被卷入了戰爭中
We're at war.

169
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,940
不能僅僅因為國王的士兵們未曾攻陷街道
Just because the Emperor's soldiers aren't running down the street,

170
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,400
就自欺欺人
don't deceive yourself.

171
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,360
這是一場戰爭 而你 身在敵營
This is a war and you're in the enemy camp.

172
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,000
他們在談論王位 談到入侵
They talked about the Emperor, about the invasion,

173
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,630
商討事半功倍的妙計
about the best way to bring it about.

174
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,760
正如你所見 瑪格麗特夫人
So, you see, Lady Margaret...

175
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,440
我對你的一家可謂是仁至義盡了
..your family owes much to my forbearance.

176
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,980
夫人 寫信給國王 乞求他的原諒吧
Write to the King, my lady, beg his forgiveness.

177
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,560
告訴他你是那么的天真 那么容易受人欺騙
Tell him you are exceptionally easy to mislead.

178
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,160
告訴他 你腦子里都生蟲了
Tell him that you don't have the brain of a flea.

179
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,730
卑躬屈膝去乞求原諒
Grovel.

180
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,950
我現在終于知道沃爾西當初為何要留著你了
I see why Wolsey retained you.

181
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,880
你們都是一丘之貉
You are a ruffian, and so was he.

182
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,800
看你是病的不輕了 回床躺著吧
Fall ill. Take to your bed.

183
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,320
這是我的建議
That's what I recommend.

184
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,400
真是難以置信 他們居然會背叛我
It's hard to believe they'd betray me.

185
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,190
這些人 我對他們了如指掌
These people, I've known them all my life.

186
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,310
我小時候 就已經認識埃克塞特了
Exeter's been a friend of mine since I was a boy.

187
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:24,700
你記得格林威治嗎 那次的圣誕節 那場雪仗
Do you remember Greenwich, that Christmas? The snowball fight?

188
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,130
要怪只能怪他老婆
It's the wife who's to blame.

189
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,760
看起來是柔情似水 風騷尤物
She's fickle and weak, like all her sex.

190
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,950
- 但其實滿腹心機 蛇蝎心腸  - 原諒她吧 寫封信寬慰她
- Easily led into scheming. - Forgive her. Write her a pardon.

191
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,160
讓這些人對您充滿感激之情
Put these people under a debt of gratitude to you.

192
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,760
這種人要是得到您的原諒 那我們豈不都被當傻子耍嗎
If you forgive them, they'll play us for fools.

193
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,400
大人 我可不是這么想
I don't think so, my lord.

194
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,440
- 現在他們的一舉一動 都逃不過我的雙眼   - 波利家也是嗎？
- Everything they do now, they do under my eye.  - And the Poles?

195
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,880
是的 我認為他們也應該得到寬恕
Well, I don't think they should be allowed to assume

196
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,000
- 他們會被寬恕的    -格林威治！
- they'll be pardoned.  - Greenwich!

197
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,560
那年圣誕節  大雪深及膝蓋
That Christmas, the snow was knee-deep.

198
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,720
亨利 那時 我們都還年輕著
Christ, we were young then, Harry.

199
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,600
你和那個女孩 漂流到紫杉木下 就找不到方向了 足足半小個小時
You got lost in that drift under the yew tree for half an hour

200
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,960
她叫什么名字來著 誰誰誰的女兒
with that girl. What's her name? So-and-so's daughter.

201
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,120
你打算怎么處置這些控訴
How will you frame the charges?

202
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,850
一般的律師不會和那些說自己能飛
Well, the common law doesn't deal with women who say they can fly

203
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,000
或復活的瘋女人打交道
or bring back the dead.

204
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,040
主犯以叛國罪論處
Treason for the principals.

205
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,360
從犯 終身監禁 財產充公 罰款
For the accessories, life imprisonment, confiscations, fines.

206
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,370
我相信國王是仁慈的
I think the King will be merciful.

207
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,480
相比這些 我倒是對那些舉報謀反消息的人更感興趣
I'm more interested in unravelling the plans of these people.

208
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,800
反正我是清白的
Well, I'm clear anyway.

209
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,000
你知道我是清白的對吧
You know I'm clear!

210
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,200
你還記得 你是怎么把國王比喻成一頭溫順的獅子嗎
Do you remember how you used to compare the King to a tamed lion?

211
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,840
只要你愿意 你可以親撫他 提拉他的耳朵
You can pet him, you can pull at his ears if you wish.

212
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,600
但你一直以來 都是在自說自話的
But all the time you're thinking to yourself...

213
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,600
它的爪子 看看它的爪子
..those claws, look at those claws.

214
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,480
我們打算提議 繼承人發案
We're putting a Bill of Succession forward,

215
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,480
確立安妮為亨利的合法妻子
recognising Anne as Henry's lawful wife

216
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,520
而他們的孩子也將是合法繼承人
and their children as the rightful heirs.

217
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,440
如果法案通過的話
If the bill succeeds, and it will,

218
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,720
我們很樂意蓋戳 宣誓
we'd like to seal the act with an oath.

219
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,870
什么樣的法律需要通過宣誓確立？
What sort of legislation needs to be confirmed by an oath?

220
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,200
好吧 信不信由你
Well, believe it or not,

221
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,990
那些知道該怎樣立法的人都會被留在羅馬
there are those who will feel such matters should be left to Rome.

222
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,810
我們想明確表示 羅馬在英格蘭
We want to make it clear that Rome has no legitimate voice

223
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,530
沒有合法發言權
here in England.

224
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,240
所以 你為什么不直接去簽署誓約呢
So, why don't you sign the oath?

225
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,280
毫無疑問地獻上你的忠心
Put your loyalty beyond doubt.

226
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,960
她看起來好像很享受被關注的感覺
She seems to be rather enjoying the attention.

227
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,880
也許那是她一直都想要的
Perhaps that's all she ever wanted.

228
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,880
和我回家吃晚飯
Come home for dinner with me.

229
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,040
如果你只是想款待我吃喝 當然沒問題
Well, I would if you only wanted to put food in my mouth.

230
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,800
但恐怕你也更喜歡用你的一堆大道理來款待我吧
But I think you'd like to put words there, too.

231
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,800
你提到了我的死亡
You mention my death.

232
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,440
‘如果親愛的王后
"If it should happen, your said dear

233
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,750
摯愛的妻子 安妮 升天而去...'
"and beloved wife, Queen Anne, to decease..."

234
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,960
我不能排除這種可能性
I can't exclude the possibility.

235
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,000
你說如果我死了 他就可以另選王后
You say that if I die, he can put another queen in my place.

236
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,160
我無法想象有其他人替代你的場景 親愛的
I can't imagine anyone else in your place, sweetheart.

237
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,660
這一切只是假設性的
It's notional only.

238
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,840
那如果她有兒子呢
And what if she has a son?

239
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,570
她的兒子會繼承王位 那么我的女兒怎么樣
That son will inherit. And then what will happen to my daughter

240
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,360
還有她的名號
and her claim?

241
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,910
她仍是英格蘭的公主
Well, she would still be Princess of England.

242
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,670
你看 上面說...
Look, it says here...

243
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,200
上面怎么沒說西班牙的瑪麗是個私生女
And where does it say Spanish Mary is a bastard?

244
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,440
瑪麗夫人并沒有繼承的權利
Lady Mary is out of the line of succession,

245
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,880
所以您的推理是對的 原諒我的措辭
so the inference is clear. Forgive the language.

246
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,150
我們試圖公正地編寫法律 那樣就不會偏向任何人
We try to write the laws sparingly, so that they're not personal.

247
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,280
但這本來就是關乎個人的
This IS personal.

248
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,800
親愛的 克倫威爾為我們做的很好
Cromwell serves us well, sweetheart.

249
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,450
你不應該責罵他 要責罵也應該罵別人
He's not who you should rail against. There are others.

250
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,230
比如說斯蒂芬 伽德納
Stephen Gardiner, for one.

251
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,920
他曾經冒犯我
The way he has turned on me.

252
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,400
我討厭忘恩負義和不忠不義
I hate ingratitude. Hate disloyalty.

253
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,810
托馬斯 莫爾是另一個讓我失望的人
Thomas More is another one who has disappointed me.

254
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,200
抱歉 我先離開了 陛下
If Your Majesties will excuse me.

255
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,320
你的法案很針對伊麗莎白 巴頓
Your bill against Elizabeth Barton.

256
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,530
你應該把莫爾也加到有罪的名單里
You should add More to the list of the guilty.

257
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,090
陛下 托馬斯 莫爾并沒有參與其中
Thomas More is not involved, Your Majesty.

258
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,380
巴頓還沒被抓時 他就已經投靠我們了
He came to me even before Barton was arrested.

259
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,560
無論如何也要加進去
Do it anyway.

260
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,560
我要讓他恐懼 恐懼可以毀掉一個人
I want him frightened. Fright can unmake a man.

261
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,640
我曾見識過
I've seen it happen.

262
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,210
克倫威爾？
Cromwell?

263
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,200
我是不會死的 我也會給陛下生個兒子
I won't die. I'll give the King a son.

264
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,700
我的血脈也會一直延續下去
And I won't die.

265
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,720
你要我為莫爾向陛下求情
You want me to kneel down and beg for More's life?

266
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,200
大人 下議院并不想莫爾出現在名單里
The Commons won't like him being included on the list, my lord.

267
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,910
不然他們也許會反對法案
They could oppose the bill.

268
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,000
而且國王發誓會在他們來之前就到 他很堅持
And the King swears he'll come before them himself and insist.

269
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,890
那樣的話國王可能會引起公憤
He could have a very public fall.

270
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,440
大人如果向陛下求情 陛下一定不會拒絕您
If you begged, my lord, the King couldn't refuse you.

271
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,230
陛下還能全身而退
It'll allow His Majesty an honourable way back.

272
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,000
畢竟我們是在讓陛下
After all, we're asking him

273
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,560
違背他妻子的意愿
to contradict the wishes of his own wife.

274
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,080
的確 這是我侄女的作風
That's true. This is my niece's work.

275
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,280
專橫霸道的女人
Take things personally, women.

276
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,040
我覺得國王很喜歡這樣的女人
I think the King takes it personally.

277
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,960
所以說他很無能 他干嘛要關心莫爾對他的看法
Which is weak. Why should he care what More thinks of him?

278
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,560
你說陛下無能？
You call the King weak?

279
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,380
"說陛下無能" "說陛下無能"
"Call the King weak!" "Call the King weak!"

280
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,880
法官大人 你哪怕一次為自己說話好嗎
Speaking for yourself for once, Lord Chancellor?

281
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,040
你總是等到克倫威爾發言了
Usually, you wait till Cromwell speaks

282
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,880
才開口 "噢 你說的對 湯姆"
and then it's, "Tweet tweet, whatever you say, Tom!"

283
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,920
我現在要有把弩 就馬上把你該死的腦袋射下來
If I had a crossbow, I'd shoot your fucking head off!

284
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,720
我說過不準人進來！
I said no-one in!

285
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,040
托馬斯 莫爾的女婿來為他求情 大人
Thomas More's son-in-law is here to plead for him, sir.

286
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,720
哼
Hm.

287
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,760
大人？
My lord?

288
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,660
要讓薩爾福克大人代您接見嗎
Should we send for my Lord Suffolk instead?

289
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,480
不用 他的兒子快死了 他的唯一繼承人
No, his son's dying. His heir.

290
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,960
他得忙著和新任妻子再續香火呢
He'll have to start breeding again with his new wife.

291
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,600
他老婆才14歲 你們知道嗎
She's 14, you know?

292
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,270
他才不會讓她一個人呆著
He won't leave her alone.

293
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,020
我可不是從他老婆驚嚇的表情得知的
Not judging by the startled look on her face.

294
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,050
我要是能擺脫我老婆就好了
If only I could get rid of my wife.

295
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,400
大人 你已經成功經營了20年的婚姻了
My lord, you've been well married these 20 years.

296
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,240
是 我知道
Yes. I know.

297
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,960
就像把自己裝在一個灰皮袋里20年一樣
It's like placing your person inside a grizzled leather bag.

298
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,320
好了 我去見他女婿 如果克倫威爾和我一起的話
All right, I'll do it. If Cranmer does it, too.

299
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,960
這些門外漢要跪到膝蓋爛嗎
Why should the laymen wear out their joints?

300
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,840
她要是聽到了估計會吐血
She'll spit blood when she hears!

301
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,440
好吧
Very well.

302
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,040
把他名字從法案中除掉吧
Remove his name from the bill.

303
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,840
但是告訴他 必須宣誓
But tell him, he will take the oath.

304
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,500
還以為我要在這多耗一個小時
Thought I'd be stuck there for another hour, entreating

305
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,810
萬般懇求呢
and entreating.

306
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,720
克倫威爾！
Cromwell!

307
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,440
王后想她的...
The Queen has missed her...

308
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,620
啊
Ah.

309
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,990
這次 英格蘭
This time, for sure.

310
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,880
一定是我們的了
England is ours.

311
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,720
克倫！
Crom!

312
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,040
我不能簽誓
I can't take the oath.

313
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,320
但我也不會出聲反對它
But I will not speak against it.

314
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,040
也不會阻止任何人宣誓
And I won't try to dissuade anyone else from it.

315
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,640
那是不夠的 你知道的
That's not enough, and you know it's not.

316
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,010
這些是已經宣誓的全部的神父名單
These are the names of the priests who have all sworn to the act.

317
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,400
你知道的 國會議員們都...很順從
You know the members of Parliament are...conformable.

318
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,320
你為什么不呢
So, why not you?

319
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,680
這地方對我們任何人來說都不舒服
This is not a comfortable place for any of us.

320
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,970
比你要去的任何地方都舒服
More comfortable than where you're going.

321
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,760
我相信我不是去地獄的
Well, not Hell. I trust.

322
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,480
那么 如果你簽了這個誓約 靈魂就會被詛咒的話
So, if your soul is damned if you sign this oath,

323
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,880
這些人怎么辦 難道他們都被詛咒了嗎
what about all of these? Are they damned?

324
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,840
還是說因為你的道德品行 要比他們都高尚？
Or is your conscience so much more refined than all of theirs?

325
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,360
我不能談論他們的道德
I cannot speak for their conscience.

326
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,840
一談起道德
Well, where it is a question of conscience,

327
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,920
就一定會產生疑惑
there must be some doubt.

328
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,480
當你將為國王服務時
And when you entered the King's service,

329
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,160
你要起誓聽命于他
you took an oath to obey him.

330
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:39,400
所以 你難道不會對那樣的肯定和宣誓心存疑慮么?
So, won't you set your doubts against that certainty and swear?

331
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,100
你被任命為大主教時 你對羅馬起誓
When you were appointed archbishop, you swore an oath to Rome.

332
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,160
但是他們說 整個慶典上 你很少把紙疊起來
But they say, all through the ceremony, you kept a little

333
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,560
說你是極不樂意地起了誓
paper folded up, saying you took the oath under protest.

334
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,930
那也許你也能...
Then perhaps you could...?

335
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,800
當然 你可以那么建議 理查德 里奇
Yes, you would suggest that, Richard Riche.

336
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,600
我記得你年輕時的樣子 就是一個無惡不作的家伙
I remember you as a youth and you were ever a creature of vice.

337
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,120
但是 我不會成為那樣一個雜耍戲子
But I will not be such a juggler.

338
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,480
我一直敬重你
I have respected you.

339
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,880
從我還是個孩童 我就一直敬重你
Since I was a boy, I have respected you.

340
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,400
但是后來我寧愿眼見自己親生骨肉被殺 也不愿見你拒絕簽署
But I'd sooner see my own son killed, than see you refuse to sign

341
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:29,930
這份誓言 去討好英格蘭的每一個敵人
this oath and give comfort to every enemy of England.

342
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:34,440
噢 格雷戈里是個好小伙
Oh, Gregory is a good boy.

343
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,720
別想他離開
Do not wish him away.

344
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,200
我們不能讓你回家
We can't let you go home.

345
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,200
我還能再見到我女兒么?
Will I see my daughter again?

346
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,880
只能再說幾句話 就這么多
Just have to say some words, that's all.

347
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,160
啊 就幾句話
Ah, just words.

348
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,160
出于好奇 你是行何種惡事的家伙
Out of interest, of what vices are you a creature?

349
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,030
我曾經也只是個小男孩
I was a boy.

350
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,680
但是如今 他見不得我不爭取去當牧師
But to this day, he can't see me without trying to make me a sermon.

351
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,930
他至少要給出理由
He should at least give his reasons.

352
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,040
我們知道他的理由 整個歐洲都知道他的理由
We know his reasons. All of Europe knows his reasons.

353
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,240
他反對離婚
He's against the divorce.

354
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,190
他不相信國王能夠成為教會的首腦
He doesn't believe the King can be Head of the Church.

355
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,360
他心屬羅馬 而非英格蘭
His heart is with Rome, not with England.

356
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,830
他寧愿看到統治我們的君主強加給我們的一些異邦人
He'd sooner see some foreigner imposed by the Emperor

357
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,120
也不愿支持一個自小就是他摯友的人
ruling us than back a man who has been his friend since childhood

358
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,960
你知道我最恨什么嗎?
and do you know what I hate most?

359
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,120
他在撰寫一份當前局勢的文章讓整個歐洲來看
He's writing an account of today for all of Europe to read

360
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,240
文中 我們都是愚昧之人和壓迫者
and in it, we'll be the fools and oppressors,

361
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,720
而他是個用精妙的措辭包裝起來的可憐受害者
and he'll be the poor victim with the better turn of phrase.

362
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,880
他數年前就寫了這個劇
He wrote this play years ago,

363
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,720
每次我臺詞不順 他都會嗤笑我
and he sniggers every time I trip over my lines.

364
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,040
你覺得女王的孩子未來如何
Do you think it's already been decided

365
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,700
現在已經能確定嗎
what the Queen's baby will be?

366
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,440
還是上帝自由安排
Or does God decide later?

367
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,480
我希望我們能在里面見她 這樣我們就能說話了
I wish we could see inside her, so we'd be able to tell.

368
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,160
我倒希望你就呆在威爾特郡
I wish you were down in Wiltshire.

369
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,260
我想要個孩子
I'd like a baby.

370
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,200
注意點 你肚子一旦顯形 他們會把你活埋的
Watch yourself. If your belly shows, they'll brick you up alive.

371
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,120
不過 你的家人也許會給你獻上祭花的
Although, your family would probably give you a bouquet.

372
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,840
他們不知道在狼廳 應該有怎樣的自制力
They don't know what continence is down at Wolf Hall.

373
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,090
我無冒犯之意
I meant no harm.

374
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:15,340
天啊 這就像在引誘一只田鼠 我...
God, it's like baiting a field mouse. I...

375
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,480
王后怎么樣了
How is the Queen?

376
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,010
我聽說了她孩子沒保住
I heard of her loss.

377
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,000
今天必須要做決定
It's a yes or no today.

378
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,400
你必須要開口
You must speak.

379
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,160
如果我對你的誓約說"不" 那么我就置自身于險境
If I say "no" to your oath, I put my body in peril.

380
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,920
如果我說"是" 則是置靈魂于不堪
If I say "yes", my soul.

381
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,980
所以 我什么也不說
So, I say nothing.

382
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,200
費舍爾主教比你更男人
Bishop Fisher is more of a man than you.

383
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,140
他宣布不信奉國教 并承擔了后果
He declares his dissent and takes the consequences.

384
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,760
你想當個賣國賊 但是又躲在沉默之中
You want to be a traitor, but hide behind silence.

385
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,480
非也 他想的是成為殉道者
No, what he wants is to be a martyr.

386
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,000
而我只是想回歸故里
What I want is to go home.

387
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,040
我永遠不懂犧牲和自殺之間
I've never understood where the line is drawn between sacrifice

388
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,280
的界限在哪
and self-slaughter.

389
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,680
基督界定的
Christ drew it.

390
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,520
你沒發現這個對比里有什么錯么?
You don't find anything wrong in the comparison?

391
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,360
我不傷害任何人
I do nobody harm.

392
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,800
我所言者無害 我所思者亦無害
I say none harm, I think none harm.

393
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,410
如果這還不足以支撐一個人活下去
If this isn't enough to keep a man alive...

394
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:16,030
你不會傷害任何人 那比爾尼呢 拜納姆呢
You do nobody harm? What about Bilney? What about Bainham?

395
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,630
你還記得你在自己家里折磨的詹姆斯 拜納姆嗎
You remember James Bainham who you had racked in your own home?

396
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,710
那個被你暴打虐待的人
That you had beaten and abused?

397
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,360
他的軀體支離破碎 他們不得不用椅子抬著他
His body was so broken they had to carry him,

398
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,120
到史密斯菲爾德去火化掉
carry him in the chair to Smithfield to be burned!

399
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,800
還有你說 托馬斯 莫爾 你不會傷害任何人嗎
And you say, Thomas More, you do no-one harm?

400
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,040
你要學會感恩 先生
You just be grateful, sir,

401
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,160
感恩我們沒有對你施加 那些你用在別人身上的手段
that we have spared you the methods you use on others.

402
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,010
我們會進行公訴和審訊 國王也很樂意如此的
It's the King's pleasure that we move to indictment and trial.

403
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,680
我在朗伯斯做服務生時 [坎特伯雷大主教官邸]
When I was a serving boy, at Lambeth,

404
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,400
有晚我給你帶了面包
I brought you bread one night.

405
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,400
你那時肯定只有14歲左右
You must have been about 14.

406
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,360
他們已經說你是位卓越的學者了
They were already speaking about you being the great scholar.

407
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,920
我記得你當時在看書
You were reading, I remember.

408
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,080
我問你書里有什么
I asked you what was in the book...

409
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,880
...而你說...
..and you said...

410
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,660
"文字...
"Words...

411
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,440
"..文字...
"..words...

412
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,160
"..文字而已"
"..just words."

413
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,360
我已經和你說了 我不記得那時見過你
As I have already told you, I have no recollection of meeting you then.

414
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,760
不 為什么你會不記得
No. Why would you?

415
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
聽說你的汀代爾被抓了
Hear your Tyndale's been caught.

416
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,350
他們說有人把他從藏身之處引出來了 一些特工...
They say someone tempted him from his hiding place, some agent...

417
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,370
...然后他被帶走了
..and he was taken.

418
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,560
你的人 不 當然不是
Your man? No, of course not.

419
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,040
托馬斯 莫爾不會傷害任何人
Thomas More hurts no-one.

420
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,840
開門
Yes.

421
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,710
"都是因為我"
"It's all because of me."

422
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,280
最后當你背叛了莫爾 困擾著他那唯一良心的
When, finally, you have out of More, what troubles his singular

423
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,100
你會發現是他不會對我的女王身份屈膝
conscience, you'll find it's that he won't bend his knee to my queenship.

424
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,280
費舍爾一日不死 我就沒有安生日子
I have no peace until Fisher is dead.

425
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,760
莫爾一日不死 我也不得安寧
I have no peace until More is dead.

426
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,840
英格蘭將永無寧日
England will have no peace.

427
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,650
托馬斯 莫爾 請求羅馬君主侵略我們 我知道
Thomas More prays for the Emperor to invade us. I know this.

428
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,760
你知道 他也知道 只是他不會承認
You know this. He knows it, but he won't admit it.

429
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,800
他曾是我朋友
He was my friend.

430
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,500
但是 眼下 當英格蘭身處險境
And yet, now, in this time of danger for England,

431
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,600
當你需要他的支持 他卻去迎合敵人
when you need his support, he gives comfort to the enemy.

432
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,350
他的沉默 他所依賴的沉默中
This silence of his, on which he relies.

433
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,000
隱藏著叛國野心 所以 逼他開口
It conceals treason. So, MAKE him talk.

434
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,040
不 夫人 我們不必這么做
No, madam, we don't do that.

435
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,320
我的妻子她...
My wife is...

436
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,000
...她的悲傷...
..her grief...

437
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,520
我理解
Yes.

438
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,470
我歸咎于凱瑟琳
It's Katherine I blame.

439
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,600
這么些年來她都沒有誕下一個子嗣
All those years she couldn't hold a son.

440
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,440
而現在她也在詛咒我
Now, she ill-wishes me.

441
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,800
她冷血的阻攔在我和我愛的女人之間
She lies in between me and the woman I love, with her cold heart...

442
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,040
你知道嗎 我連那嬰兒是男是女都沒看到 就被他們火化了
You know they burnt it before I could see if it was a boy.

443
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,590
這可能真的很難斷定 陛下
It may have been impossible to tell, Your Majesty.

444
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,440
畢竟事情發生如此突然
So soon.

445
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,560
這個 額 托馬斯 莫爾的這件事
This, erm... This business of Thomas More.

446
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,200
我不懷疑他對羅馬的絕對忠心
I don't doubt his loyalty to Rome,

447
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:22,800
也不懷疑他對陛下成為教會首腦的憎惡
or his hatred of Your Majesty's title as Head of the Church.

448
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,160
然而 從合法性上來看 我們的案件很麻煩
However, legally, our case is slender.

449
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,160
不會很容易
It won't be easy.

450
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,040
我留你在這是為了讓你解決容易的事么?
Do I keep you for what's easy?

451
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,920
你認為我提拔你是因為你的儀態魅力嗎？
Do you think I've promoted you for the charm of your presence?

452
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,040
我讓你留在這是因為你是個聰明人
I keep you because you're a serpent.

453
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,360
別反咬一口
Do not be a viper in my bosom.

454
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,040
你知道我的決定 立即執行
You know my decision. Execute it.

455
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,480
壁畫上的那個女人
That woman on the wall.

456
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,480
我知道她是誰
I know who she is.

457
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,790
示巴王后
Sheba.

458
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,000
對于你 我明白她在你心中的位置
For you. I know who she is for you.

459
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,920
明白你的目光永遠停留在她身上的原因
Why you always look at her.

460
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,040
在安特衛普省他們告訴了我
They told me about her in Antwerp.

461
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,680
克倫威爾愛著的女人
The woman Cromwell loved.

462
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,280
為什么你不回去追求她
Why don't you go back and claim her?

463
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,000
她已嫁做人婦
She's married.

464
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,720
很多年了
It was years ago.

465
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,240
我也變了
I've changed.

466
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,000
呀 你現在很富有
Ja. You're rich now.

467
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,680
我想...
I think...

468
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,990
嗯？
What?

469
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,350
沒什么
Nothing.

470
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,720
怎么? 你要把我吊起來直到我開口么?
What? You're going to hang me up by my wrists until I talk?

471
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,280
我想你心中肯定另有佳人了
I think there is another woman in your heart now.

472
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,640
托馬斯 莫爾的妻子求見
Thomas More's wife is here to see you.

473
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,420
愛麗絲女士
Lady Alice.

474
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,070
我之前來的時候 這就是個陳舊陰冷的古樓房
When I came here before, this was a musty old place.

475
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,050
我丈夫常和我說 
My husband used to say,

476
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,290
"將托馬斯 克倫威爾投進地牢而到傍晚
"Put Thomas Cromwell in a dungeon and by evening,

477
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,980
他就會坐在墊子上 而監獄長還欠著他錢"
"he'll be sitting on cushions, with gaolers owing him money."

478
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,720
他說過要把我投進地牢嗎
Did he talk a lot about putting me in dungeons?

479
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,880
他...只是空談
He... It was only talk.

480
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,640
我想你可以帶我去覲見國王
I thought you might take me to see the King.

481
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,320
他對女人都非常友善
I know he's always kind to women.

482
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,240
我做不到 我到希望可以
I can't do that. I wish I could.

483
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,600
你對我們一直都很好 我知道原因
You've always been good to us. I wonder why.

484
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,920
你經常會耍一些伎倆
You always have some trick.

485
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,000
天生的小伎倆是幫不了忙的
Born tricky. Can't help it.

486
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,880
愛麗絲 為什么你的丈夫那么冥頑不固
Alice, why is your husband so stubborn?

487
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,480
我對他的了解 不比對三位一體了解的多
I no more understand him than I do the Holy Trinity.

488
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,440
他擔心他太冷漠
I worry he's cold.

489
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,080
他什么都不和我講
He tells me nothing.

490
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,370
他所有的信都是給他的寶貝梅格
All his letters are to his precious Meg.

491
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,080
當然也不要認為我們之間沒有了溫情
Don't think there's no tenderness between us.

492
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,440
我們有交易的 雖然時間說不定
We had dealings, one time or another.

493
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,700
當那既成事實 你根本沒法幫上忙只能為他擔心
And when that's true, you can't help but worry about a man,

494
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,390
想想...
wonder if...

495
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,560
想想如果他感情淡漠時
wonder if he's feeling cold.

496
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,960
當你和他談話 問問他我的事
When you talk to him, ask him from me...

497
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,120
問他 孤身一人離開發妻當真明智么
Ask him, does he think it's clever to leave his wife without company,

498
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,280
他的兒子無所忠告 他的女兒無所庇護
his son without advice, his daughter without protection?

499
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,360
我們所有人聽憑于像他一樣的人
And all of us at the mercy of a man like yourself?

500
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,680
我們必須帶走你所有的筆 紙還有你的書籍
We have to take away your pens and papers and your books.

501
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,440
好吧 如果你一定要帶走他們 就現在吧
Very well. If you must take them, take them now.

502
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,240
愛麗絲來見我 她希望你回家
Alice came to see me. She wants you home.

503
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,400
你所需要做的事就是簽了這個字 梅格已經簽過了
All you have to do, is sign this. Meg has signed it.

504
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,480
你最愛的女兒
Your own beloved daughter.

505
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,910
快簽了這個吧 國王會為此高興的
Just sign the paper and the King will be happy.

506
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,280
我會安排我的船 將你送回切爾西
I'll send my barge to row you back to Chelsea,

507
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,800
回到你的家園 你的孩子身邊 回到愛麗絲夫人身邊
back to your garden, your children, back to Dame Alice

508
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,920
那個一直等你歸家 獨守空閨的女人
who will be waiting to bear you up to your own bed.

509
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,400
難道你不想嗎
Don't you want that?

510
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,360
難道你不想逃離這個鬼地方嗎
Don't you want to be out of this place you're in?

511
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,920
當我們在天堂重相遇時...
When we meet again in Heaven...

512
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,760
...當然 我希望我們可以相遇...
...as I hope we will...

513
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,380
...我們之間所有的差異都蕩然無存了
..all our differences will be forgot.

514
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,000
但現在 我們還不能忽視差異的存在
But, for now, we cannot wish them away.

515
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,400
我現在僅有的 就是我所站立的這片土地
All I have, all I own is the ground I stand upon.

516
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,800
這片土地是我托馬斯 莫爾的
That ground is Thomas More.

517
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,160
如果你想占有它 你必須將它從我這里奪走
If you want it, you must take it.

518
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,160
我也不會輕易將它舍棄的
I will not yield it.

519
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,550
當你上庭前你來到這里
When you come before the court,

520
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,600
將你沐浴在王的仁慈之下
throw yourself upon the King's mercy.

521
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,610
陛下并不是一個兇殘的人 你知道的
He's not a cruel man, you know that.

522
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,440
我怎么知道
Do I?

523
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,760
最起碼他不是一直如此的
He didn't used to be.

524
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,200
雖然他后來更換了他的隨從們
But then he's changed the company he keeps.

525
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,610
隨便吧
Anyway...

526
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,290
折磨我的肢體什么的都不重要了
It's not important what happens to my body.

527
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,380
難道你不害怕疼痛嗎
Are you not afraid of the pain?

528
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,010
噢 當然 我很害怕
Oh, yes. I'm very much afraid.

529
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:35,520
我并不是一個強壯 有精力的人 就像你一樣
I am not a strong and robust man, such as yourself.

530
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,080
我無能為力 只能在腦海里想象
I cannot help but rehearse it in my mind.

531
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,400
但也只感受了一小會兒
But I will only feel it for a moment,

532
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,960
而后上帝也不會讓我記住這感受的
and God will not let me remember it afterwards.

533
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,240
我將離你而去 你知道嗎
I would have left you, you know...

534
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,640
遠離你的生活之外
..to live out your life...

535
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,160
為你的殘酷贖罪
..to repent your cruelties...

536
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,240
如果我是國王的話
..if I were king.

537
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,780
帶走他的書籍
Take away his books.

538
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,200
我將會送給別人
I'll send someone.

539
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,680
不 理查德 我想讓你親自去做
No, Richard, I'd like you to do it yourself.

540
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,160
如果陪審團審判下來 陛下會讓我們扒皮抽筋的
If the jury throws it out, the King will skin us alive.

541
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,440
不 王后會的
No. The Queen will.

542
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:49,870
天啊 看起來好像對他施了鞭刑
My God, looks like we've had him whipped.

543
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,320
他說我從不浪費一次騙局
And he says I never miss a trick.

544
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,400
如果他繼續保持沉默...
If he stands on his silence...

545
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,480
他的沉默證明不了任何事
His silence proves nothing.

546
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,610
他不用證明什么 大人
He doesn't have to prove anything, my lord.

547
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,360
他的愿望就是他的沉默
His plea is that his silence is consent enough

548
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,040
能讓國王足夠滿意
to the King's desires.

549
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,130
一派胡言
Bollocks.

550
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,640
這是習慣法的準則
It is the maxim of the common law.

551
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,680
還在胡扯
Still bollocks.

552
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,280
他還沒有完全噤聲
He hasn't been entirely silent.

553
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,880
我過來拿走你的書
I came to take away your books.

554
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,030
我這么做的時候 我試圖說服你 這是你最后一次起誓的機會
And as I did so, I tried to convince you one last time to take the oath.

555
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,400
我給你立案了 對嗎
I put a case to you, did I not?

556
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:46,160
我問過你 如果議會舉行投票并讓我做國王...
I asked you, if Parliament had a vote and made me king...

557
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,400
...你會贊同嗎
..would you go along with it?

558
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,130
然后你說 "最近議會無論做什么事
And you said, "Nothing that Parliament would do,

559
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:54,920
都不會讓我吃驚"
"would surprise me these days.

560
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,080
"但是 如果他們票選 理查德 里奇 成為上帝"
"But, if they voted that Richard Riche should be God,

561
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:00,380
"我就劃清界限 到此為止"
"I would draw a line there."

562
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,560
我問你為什么 你還記得你怎么回答的嗎
I asked you why? Do you remember your reply?

563
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,080
我對此沒有任何記錄 沒有任何書面材料
I made no record of it, having no writing materials.

564
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,200
你已經把材料從我身邊拿走了
You having already taken them from me.

565
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,000
你說"議會不能這么做
You said, "Parliament cannot do it.

566
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,520
法律只能在世俗的世界有效 而不能在天堂"
"It can make laws in the earthly realm, not the heavenly."

567
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,520
所以我說 "這不能使我成為上帝 或者是教會首腦
So I said, "It could not make me God, nor Head of the Church, either,

568
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,640
"但這確實無疑是精神上的管制壓迫"
"for surely that is a spiritual jurisdiction?"

569
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,120
你說"不 議會不能那樣做"
And you said, "No, Parliament cannot do it."

570
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,400
是什么意思呢
Meaning what?

571
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,960
意思是 如果議會宣布將國王任命為教會首腦
Meaning, if Parliament names the King the Head of the Church,

572
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,280
是不具備法律效力的
it has no effect.

573
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,450
據托馬斯爵士所言
According to Sir Thomas.

574
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,240
他否認了國王的頭銜
He denied the King's title.

575
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,600
這屬于叛國罪
That would be treason.

576
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,760
請大家捫心自問 先生們
Ask yourselves, gentlemen,

577
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,880
我為什么要對理查德 里奇這種人敞開心扉呢
why would I open my mind to a man like Richard Riche?

578
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,910
為什么 當學者和神職人員都懇求我的時候
Why, when the learned and the pious have implored me,

579
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,530
當國王自己因為一些重要的原因來說服我的時候
when the King himself with weighty reasons has sought to persuade me.

580
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:01,130
因為你覺得我不重要
Because you think I don't matter.

581
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,240
這就是你說的
That is what you said.

582
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,490
我會對此起誓的
I will take my oath on it.

583
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:10,040
你起誓？  你的誓言還不如魔鬼的屁!
Your oath? Your oath isn't worth the Devil's fart!

584
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,250
上帝保佑你 里奇 我認識你的時候 你還是個孩子
Christ help you, Riche, I have known you since you were a child,

585
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,680
你的家庭都對你失望了 你是一個賭徒 一個廢物
you were the despair of your family, you were a gambler and a waster.

586
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:21,040
我要提醒你 理查德 里奇 現在是律師總管
May I remind you that Richard Riche is Solicitor General,

587
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,280
你不能像對待酒館侍者一樣議論他
and not to be talked to like some pot-boy.

588
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,360
你說的什么可以的話嗎?
Did you speak the words alleged?

589
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,200
我對此表示懷疑 如果我說了...
I doubt it, and if I did...

590
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,480
- 如果你說了   - 如果我說了 他們肯定不吝指控我的
- If you did?  - If I did, they were not meant with malice.

591
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,880
所以 法官大人們 你不能認定他們是合理的
And so, masters, you cannot find them treasonable

592
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,060
而且你應當蔑視謠言
and you are bound to disregard such words,

593
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:47,470
無論法庭對你說什么
whatever this court tells you.

594
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,200
罪犯 這個法庭發現你有叛國行為
Prisoner, this court has found you guilty of treason.

595
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,710
你的審判將在...
Your sentence will be...

596
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,640
請原諒我 罪犯還有什么要說的嗎
Forgive me. Does the prisoner have anything to say?

597
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,600
我遵從了我的良知
I have followed my conscience.

598
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,000
請你也一定遵從你的良心
You must follow yours.

599
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,170
我已履行的良知 現在我要簡單地說兩句
My conscience satisfies me and now, I will speak plainly,

600
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,480
你的法令是錯誤的 你的權力也毫無根基
that your statute is faulty and your authority baseless.

601
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,250
我的良知與大多數人一樣
My conscience stands with the majority.

602
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,720
抵制亨利的王朝 我擁有的是基督世界所有王國的支持
Against Henry's kingdom, I have all the kingdoms of Christendom!

603
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,360
你現在已經暴露了你的野心 先生!
Now we see your malice, sir!

604
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,440
反對你的每一個主教...
Against each one of your bishops...

605
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,200
現在我們看到的是 你選擇的羅馬而不是英格蘭!
Now, we see you choose Rome over England!

606
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,240
- 反對你的議會 先生!  - 你這個叛徒!
- Against your Parliament!  - You traitor!

607
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,960
我擁有教會所有委員會
I have all the general councils of the Church,

608
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,160
將在這一切的背后蔓延千年!
stretching back for a thousand years!

609
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,720
這是他最后時刻帶在身邊的的祈禱書
It's the prayer book he had with him at the end.

610
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,080
您并沒有選擇 大人
You had no choice, master.

611
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,130
托馬斯?
Thomas?

612
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,080
莉茲
Liz.

613
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,080
托馬斯 這是喬安娜
Thomas? It's Johane.

614
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,670
你發燒了
You have a fever.

615
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:29,160
莉茲 讓我...
Liz, let me...

616
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,760
讓我去愛她
Let me love her.

617
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,000
讓我去愛她 莉茲
Let me love her, Liz.

618
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,960
快去找巴茨大人來
Fetch Dr Butts.

619
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:11,200
是我在意大利患上的一種發燒癥狀
It's a fever I got in Italy.

620
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,440
那有條蛇
It was a snake.

621
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,220
就是這樣
Let's say it is.

622
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,120
如果我快死了...
If I'm dying...

623
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,320
...找格雷戈里來
..get Gregory.

624
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:38,560
格雷戈里 有些事我要告訴他
Gregory, there's things I need to tell him.

625
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:52,120
慢點 這樣我就能看見你是怎么做的了
Slow down, so I can see how you do it.

626
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,760
我不能慢下來
I can't slow down.

627
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:57,200
如果我停下來去想我在怎么做 我就會做不起來
If I stop to think how I'm doing it, I won't be able to do it.

628
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,520

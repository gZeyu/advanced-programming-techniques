1
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,120
Healthy?

2
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,020
Yes, Your Majesty.

3
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,740
Call her Elizabeth.

4
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,920
Cancel the jousts.

5
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,930
- He didn't ask how the Queen was.  - Hardly matters now, does it?

6
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,960
I think she was hungry.

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,490
My daughter is to live at Hatfield.

8
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,520
Yes.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,600
I think Spanish Mary's household should be broken up.

10
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,330
She can become a member of my daughter's household.

11
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,980
In the capacity of?

12
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,470
In the capacity of my daughter's servant.

13
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,980
What else can she be?

14
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,480
There can be no pretence of equality.

15
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,030
Mary is a bastard.

16
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,960
Waste can be saved and the proper order of things asserted.

17
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,910
Meanwhile, I want you to go to France.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,800
I want a marriage contract for my daughter. A French prince.

19
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,000
- Stephen Gardiner is...  - You're very unwilling today.

20
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,570
You don't like the French?

21
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,300
Perhaps you would prefer an alliance with the Emperor?

22
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,750
You're very friendly with his man, aren't you?

23
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,300
Chapuys?

24
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,050
If that will be all, Your Majesty?

25
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,800
Hmm.

26
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,020
Why don't you ask for her?

27
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,440
The Seymours are poor.

28
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,240
They'll sell her to you happily.

29
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,110
You mistake my interest.

30
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,720
Oh, fah-la-la! Tell your lies to the Commons, not to me.

31
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,000
I see things.

32
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,320
You and me, we keep our eyes open.

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,080
I could keep my eyes open in places you cannot go.

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,020
In Anne's rooms, for example.

35
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,700
When you call you'll find her at prayer,

36
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,840
sewing a smock for a beggar woman.

37
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,720
Do you think that's what's really going on?

38
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,650
Do you think she's given up all her nimble young men?

39
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,240
All those sonnets in praise of her beauty?

40
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,760
She has the King to praise her now.

41
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,760
She'll get no praise from him until she has a ripe belly again.

42
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,920
And what would hinder that?

43
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,990
Nothing...if he's up to it.

44
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,280
Careful.

45
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,430
And that little sneak is for ever in and out of every room,

46
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,550
acting as a go-between for all the gallants.

47
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,970
- Oh, I see no harm in the boy.  - He doesn't know his place.

48
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,230
He's a jumped-up nobody, taking his chance

49
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,070
because the times are disordered.

50
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, I suppose you could say the same thing about me, Lady Rochford,

51
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,980
and I'm sure you do.

52
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,380
The Queen sees enemies everywhere.

53
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,160
So she should.

54
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,720
They're waiting for her to fail.

55
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,150
She's said she'll give Henry a son,

56
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,190
so if she doesn't, all the old families are waiting their turn.

57
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,260
- How's our Holy Maid?  - Popular.

58
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,050
Mary Magdalene sent her a letter, illuminated in gold.

59
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,250
Visitors?

60
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,770
Bring her in.

61
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,690
You say that you can roam through Heaven, Hell and Purgatory?

62
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,330
And have you seen the Devil also?

63
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,940
And how did he look?

64
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,130
Like a bird.

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,720
That's a relief.

66
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,550
You think so?

67
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,010
He stinks!

68
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,040
He's got claws smeared with blood and shit.

69
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,210
He came to me once as a young man...

70
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,000
to tempt me.

71
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,670
Pawing at me.

72
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,560
And were you? Tempted?

73
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,050
I'm not for Satan.

74
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,600
- When I rejected him he spat in my face.  - No manners.

75
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,790
I wiped it off with a napkin.

76
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,880
It's black, with the stench of Hell...

77
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,160
..something rotting.

78
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,440
And where is it now?

79
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,240
Dom Edwards has it.

80
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,040
- And does he show it to people for money?  - For offerings.

81
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,160
You said that the King wouldn't reign one month

82
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,670
after he married Lady Anne.

83
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,480
Well...

84
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,830
the months have passed and the Lady Anne is queen

85
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,120
and has given the King a child.

86
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,180
So...what do you say now?

87
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,950
I say, in the eyes of God,

88
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,960
he's no more the real king than HE is the real archbishop.

89
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,520
Then would it be justified to raise a rebellion against him?

90
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,210
Assassinate him? Put another in his place?

91
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,740
What do you think?

92
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,200
Of the possible Plantagenet claimants to the throne

93
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,360
you've chosen the Courtenay family, not the Poles.

94
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,400
Henry, Marquis of Exeter, not Henry, Lord Montague,

95
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,350
- or do you get them mixed up?  - Of course not.

96
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,790
I've met both of those gentlemen. I've met their wives.

97
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,900
I've met Bishop Fisher. They all come to me.

98
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,150
Now, Courtenay descends from a daughter of King Edward.

99
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,290
Montague from his brother.

100
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,240
How would you sort out their claims?

101
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,720
Or would you let them scrap it out?

102
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,000
It's good to have a few kings and queens in reserve

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,920
if you are going to start a war.

104
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,840
Oh, no need of a war.

105
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,320
God is sending a plague to England.

106
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,760
- Henry will be dead in six months and so will his whore.  - And me?

107
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,000
And you. And everyone in this room.

108
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,710
Except you?

109
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,450
And my niece, Alice,

110
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,920
who has done you no harm?

111
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,670
All the women of your house are heretics.

112
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,280
The plague will rot them all.

113
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,040
We're too soft with her. She's laughing at us.

114
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,460
She's close to confessing.

115
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,840
- What makes you think that?  - Because my niece is with her at night.

116
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,440
She cries because she knows she's a fraud.

117
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,680
Then she peeps out from under her eyelids

118
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,000
to see the effect her tears have had.

119
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,220
Trust me, she'll confess. I want to start bringing in her followers.

120
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,020
- Thomas More?  - No, he's clear of this.

121
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,320
The others she mentioned? Bishop Fisher, Lady Exeter, the Poles?

122
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,220
I'll deal with them myself.

123
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,600
They are some of the most powerful people in the land.

124
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,520
Well, then, I'll be on my best behaviour.

125
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,840
- My Lord Bishop.  - Benedic...  - Why are you so gullible?

126
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,170
You'd better ask the King's forgiveness.

127
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,760
- Plead old age. Infirmity.  - I don't know my offence.

128
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,920
And, whatever you think, I am not in my second childhood.

129
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,140
I think you are.

130
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,570
Why else would you have given such credence to Elizabeth Barton?

131
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,640
Because when she speaks, she is inspired.

132
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,640
With my own eyes I have seen a golden letter

133
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,320
sent by Mary Magdalene...

134
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,400
Mary Magdalene, yes. Actually it was written by Father Bocking.

135
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,840
The gilding is by a monk.

136
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,280
One William Hawkhurst.

137
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,280
And we know that before the Lord goes about his work,

138
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,020
he gives a warning of himself through his servants.

139
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,680
For is it not stated by the prophet Amos...

140
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,040
Please, don't prophet Amos me.

141
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,830
Barton threatened the King. She foresaw his death.

142
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
Foreseeing is not the same as desiring.

143
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,200
She sat down with the King's enemies

144
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,120
and told them they would be king.

145
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,120
If you mean Exeter, why don't you speak to him?

146
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,600
Well, Exeter's not been writing against the King.

147
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,320
- You have.  - Where? Show me?

148
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,510
Your printers abroad, they're very good. They're working for me now.

149
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,240
In June last year, just after the Queen was crowned,

150
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,080
your son Lord Montague and your son Geoffrey Pole dined with Lady Mary.

151
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,960
Two weeks later, they dined with her again.

152
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,990
I wonder what they discussed?

153
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,020
I'm sure you do.

154
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,970
Actually, no, I don't.

155
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:56,090
The boy who carried in the asparagus, that was my boy.

156
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,240
The boy who cut the apricots, he was mine, too.

157
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,480
Holy simplicity was all very well in its day, but its day is over.

158
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,080
We're at war.

159
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,940
Just because the Emperor's soldiers aren't running down the street,

160
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,400
don't deceive yourself.

161
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,360
This is a war and you're in the enemy camp.

162
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,000
They talked about the Emperor, about the invasion,

163
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,630
about the best way to bring it about.

164
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,760
So, you see, Lady Margaret...

165
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,440
..your family owes much to my forbearance.

166
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,980
Write to the King, my lady, beg his forgiveness.

167
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,560
Tell him you are exceptionally easy to mislead.

168
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,160
Tell him that you don't have the brain of a flea.

169
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,730
Grovel.

170
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,950
I see why Wolsey retained you.

171
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,880
You are a ruffian, and so was he.

172
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,800
Fall ill. Take to your bed.

173
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,320
That's what I recommend.

174
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,400
It's hard to believe they'd betray me.

175
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,190
These people, I've known them all my life.

176
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,310
Exeter's been a friend of mine since I was a boy.

177
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:24,700
Do you remember Greenwich, that Christmas? The snowball fight?

178
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,130
It's the wife who's to blame.

179
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,760
She's fickle and weak, like all her sex.

180
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,950
- Easily led into scheming. - Forgive her. Write her a pardon.

181
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,160
Put these people under a debt of gratitude to you.

182
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,760
If you forgive them, they'll play us for fools.

183
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,400
I don't think so, my lord.

184
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,440
- Everything they do now, they do under my eye.  - And the Poles?

185
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,880
Well, I don't think they should be allowed to assume

186
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,000
- they'll be pardoned.  - Greenwich!

187
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,560
That Christmas, the snow was knee-deep.

188
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,720
Christ, we were young then, Harry.

189
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,600
You got lost in that drift under the yew tree for half an hour

190
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,960
with that girl. What's her name? So-and-so's daughter.

191
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,120
How will you frame the charges?

192
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,850
Well, the common law doesn't deal with women who say they can fly

193
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,000
or bring back the dead.

194
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,040
Treason for the principals.

195
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,360
For the accessories, life imprisonment, confiscations, fines.

196
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,370
I think the King will be merciful.

197
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,480
I'm more interested in unravelling the plans of these people.

198
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,800
Well, I'm clear anyway.

199
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,000
You know I'm clear!

200
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,200
Do you remember how you used to compare the King to a tamed lion?

201
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,840
You can pet him, you can pull at his ears if you wish.

202
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,600
But all the time you're thinking to yourself...

203
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,600
..those claws, look at those claws.

204
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,480
We're putting a Bill of Succession forward,

205
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,480
recognising Anne as Henry's lawful wife

206
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,520
and their children as the rightful heirs.

207
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,440
If the bill succeeds, and it will,

208
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,720
we'd like to seal the act with an oath.

209
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,870
What sort of legislation needs to be confirmed by an oath?

210
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,200
Well, believe it or not,

211
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,990
there are those who will feel such matters should be left to Rome.

212
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,810
We want to make it clear that Rome has no legitimate voice

213
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,530
here in England.

214
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,240
So, why don't you sign the oath?

215
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,280
Put your loyalty beyond doubt.

216
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,960
She seems to be rather enjoying the attention.

217
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,880
Perhaps that's all she ever wanted.

218
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,880
Come home for dinner with me.

219
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,040
Well, I would if you only wanted to put food in my mouth.

220
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,800
But I think you'd like to put words there, too.

221
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,800
You mention my death.

222
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,440
"If it should happen, your said dear

223
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,750
"and beloved wife, Queen Anne, to decease..."

224
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,960
I can't exclude the possibility.

225
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,000
You say that if I die, he can put another queen in my place.

226
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,160
I can't imagine anyone else in your place, sweetheart.

227
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,660
It's notional only.

228
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,840
And what if she has a son?

229
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,570
That son will inherit. And then what will happen to my daughter

230
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,360
and her claim?

231
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,910
Well, she would still be Princess of England.

232
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,670
Look, it says here...

233
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,200
And where does it say Spanish Mary is a bastard?

234
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,440
Lady Mary is out of the line of succession,

235
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,880
so the inference is clear. Forgive the language.

236
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,150
We try to write the laws sparingly, so that they're not personal.

237
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,280
This IS personal.

238
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,800
Cromwell serves us well, sweetheart.

239
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,450
He's not who you should rail against. There are others.

240
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,230
Stephen Gardiner, for one.

241
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,920
The way he has turned on me.

242
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,400
I hate ingratitude. Hate disloyalty.

243
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,810
Thomas More is another one who has disappointed me.

244
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,200
If Your Majesties will excuse me.

245
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,320
Your bill against Elizabeth Barton.

246
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,530
You should add More to the list of the guilty.

247
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,090
Thomas More is not involved, Your Majesty.

248
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,380
He came to me even before Barton was arrested.

249
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,560
Do it anyway.

250
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,560
I want him frightened. Fright can unmake a man.

251
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,640
I've seen it happen.

252
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,210
Cromwell?

253
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,200
I won't die. I'll give the King a son.

254
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,700
And I won't die.

255
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,720
You want me to kneel down and beg for More's life?

256
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,200
The Commons won't like him being included on the list, my lord.

257
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,910
They could oppose the bill.

258
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,000
And the King swears he'll come before them himself and insist.

259
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,890
He could have a very public fall.

260
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,440
If you begged, my lord, the King couldn't refuse you.

261
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,230
It'll allow His Majesty an honourable way back.

262
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,000
After all, we're asking him

263
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,560
to contradict the wishes of his own wife.

264
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,080
That's true. This is my niece's work.

265
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,280
Take things personally, women.

266
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,040
I think the King takes it personally.

267
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,960
Which is weak. Why should he care what More thinks of him?

268
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,560
You call the King weak?

269
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,380
"Call the King weak!" "Call the King weak!"

270
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,880
Speaking for yourself for once, Lord Chancellor?

271
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,040
Usually, you wait till Cromwell speaks

272
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,880
and then it's, "Tweet tweet, whatever you say, Tom!"

273
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,920
If I had a crossbow, I'd shoot your fucking head off!

274
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,720
I said no-one in!

275
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,040
Thomas More's son-in-law is here to plead for him, sir.

276
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,720
Hm.

277
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,760
My lord?

278
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,660
Should we send for my Lord Suffolk instead?

279
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,480
No, his son's dying. His heir.

280
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,960
He'll have to start breeding again with his new wife.

281
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,600
She's 14, you know?

282
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,270
He won't leave her alone.

283
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,020
Not judging by the startled look on her face.

284
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,050
If only I could get rid of my wife.

285
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,400
My lord, you've been well married these 20 years.

286
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,240
Yes. I know.

287
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,960
It's like placing your person inside a grizzled leather bag.

288
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,320
All right, I'll do it. If Cranmer does it, too.

289
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,960
Why should the laymen wear out their joints?

290
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,840
She'll spit blood when she hears!

291
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,440
Very well.

292
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,040
Remove his name from the bill.

293
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,840
But tell him, he will take the oath.

294
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,500
Thought I'd be stuck there for another hour, entreating

295
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,810
and entreating.

296
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,720
Cromwell!

297
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,440
The Queen has missed her...

298
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,620
Ah.

299
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,990
This time, for sure.

300
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,880
England is ours.

301
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,720
Crom!

302
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,040
I can't take the oath.

303
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,320
But I will not speak against it.

304
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,040
And I won't try to dissuade anyone else from it.

305
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,640
That's not enough, and you know it's not.

306
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,010
These are the names of the priests who have all sworn to the act.

307
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,400
You know the members of Parliament are...conformable.

308
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,320
So, why not you?

309
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,680
This is not a comfortable place for any of us.

310
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,970
More comfortable than where you're going.

311
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,760
Well, not Hell. I trust.

312
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,480
So, if your soul is damned if you sign this oath,

313
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,880
what about all of these? Are they damned?

314
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,840
Or is your conscience so much more refined than all of theirs?

315
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,360
I cannot speak for their conscience.

316
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,840
Well, where it is a question of conscience,

317
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,920
there must be some doubt.

318
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,480
And when you entered the King's service,

319
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,160
you took an oath to obey him.

320
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:39,400
So, won't you set your doubts against that certainty and swear?

321
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,100
When you were appointed archbishop, you swore an oath to Rome.

322
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,160
But they say, all through the ceremony, you kept a little

323
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,560
paper folded up, saying you took the oath under protest.

324
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,930
Then perhaps you could...?

325
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,800
Yes, you would suggest that, Richard Riche.

326
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,600
I remember you as a youth and you were ever a creature of vice.

327
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,120
But I will not be such a juggler.

328
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,480
I have respected you.

329
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,880
Since I was a boy, I have respected you.

330
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,400
But I'd sooner see my own son killed, than see you refuse to sign

331
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:29,930
this oath and give comfort to every enemy of England.

332
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:34,440
Oh, Gregory is a good boy.

333
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,720
Do not wish him away.

334
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,200
We can't let you go home.

335
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,200
Will I see my daughter again?

336
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,880
Just have to say some words, that's all.

337
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,160
Ah, just words.

338
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,160
Out of interest, of what vices are you a creature?

339
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,030
I was a boy.

340
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,680
But to this day, he can't see me without trying to make me a sermon.

341
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,930
He should at least give his reasons.

342
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,040
We know his reasons. All of Europe knows his reasons.

343
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,240
He's against the divorce.

344
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,190
He doesn't believe the King can be Head of the Church.

345
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,360
His heart is with Rome, not with England.

346
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,830
He'd sooner see some foreigner imposed by the Emperor

347
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,120
ruling us than back a man who has been his friend since childhood

348
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,960
and do you know what I hate most?

349
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,120
He's writing an account of today for all of Europe to read

350
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,240
and in it, we'll be the fools and oppressors,

351
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,720
and he'll be the poor victim with the better turn of phrase.

352
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,880
He wrote this play years ago,

353
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,720
and he sniggers every time I trip over my lines.

354
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,040
Do you think it's already been decided

355
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,700
what the Queen's baby will be?

356
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,440
Or does God decide later?

357
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,480
I wish we could see inside her, so we'd be able to tell.

358
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,160
I wish you were down in Wiltshire.

359
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,260
I'd like a baby.

360
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,200
Watch yourself. If your belly shows, they'll brick you up alive.

361
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,120
Although, your family would probably give you a bouquet.

362
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,840
They don't know what continence is down at Wolf Hall.

363
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,090
I meant no harm.

364
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:15,340
God, it's like baiting a field mouse. I...

365
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,480
How is the Queen?

366
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,010
I heard of her loss.

367
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,000
It's a yes or no today.

368
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,400
You must speak.

369
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,160
If I say "no" to your oath, I put my body in peril.

370
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,920
If I say "yes", my soul.

371
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,980
So, I say nothing.

372
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,200
Bishop Fisher is more of a man than you.

373
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,140
He declares his dissent and takes the consequences.

374
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,760
You want to be a traitor, but hide behind silence.

375
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,480
No, what he wants is to be a martyr.

376
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,000
What I want is to go home.

377
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,040
I've never understood where the line is drawn between sacrifice

378
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,280
and self-slaughter.

379
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,680
Christ drew it.

380
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,520
You don't find anything wrong in the comparison?

381
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,360
I do nobody harm.

382
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,800
I say none harm, I think none harm.

383
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,410
If this isn't enough to keep a man alive...

384
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:16,030
You do nobody harm? What about Bilney? What about Bainham?

385
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,630
You remember James Bainham who you had racked in your own home?

386
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,710
That you had beaten and abused?

387
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,360
His body was so broken they had to carry him,

388
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,120
carry him in the chair to Smithfield to be burned!

389
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,800
And you say, Thomas More, you do no-one harm?

390
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,040
You just be grateful, sir,

391
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,160
that we have spared you the methods you use on others.

392
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,010
It's the King's pleasure that we move to indictment and trial.

393
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,680
When I was a serving boy, at Lambeth,

394
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,400
I brought you bread one night.

395
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,400
You must have been about 14.

396
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,360
They were already speaking about you being the great scholar.

397
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,920
You were reading, I remember.

398
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,080
I asked you what was in the book...

399
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,880
..and you said...

400
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,660
"Words...

401
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,440
"..words...

402
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,160
"..just words."

403
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,360
As I have already told you, I have no recollection of meeting you then.

404
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,760
No. Why would you?

405
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
Hear your Tyndale's been caught.

406
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,350
They say someone tempted him from his hiding place, some agent...

407
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,370
..and he was taken.

408
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,560
Your man? No, of course not.

409
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,040
Thomas More hurts no-one.

410
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,840
Yes.

411
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,710
"It's all because of me."

412
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,280
When, finally, you have out of More, what troubles his singular

413
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,100
conscience, you'll find it's that he won't bend his knee to my queenship.

414
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,280
I have no peace until Fisher is dead.

415
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,760
I have no peace until More is dead.

416
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,840
England will have no peace.

417
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,650
Thomas More prays for the Emperor to invade us. I know this.

418
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,760
You know this. He knows it, but he won't admit it.

419
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,800
He was my friend.

420
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,500
And yet, now, in this time of danger for England,

421
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,600
when you need his support, he gives comfort to the enemy.

422
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,350
This silence of his, on which he relies.

423
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,000
It conceals treason. So, MAKE him talk.

424
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,040
No, madam, we don't do that.

425
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,320
My wife is...

426
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,000
..her grief...

427
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,520
Yes.

428
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,470
It's Katherine I blame.

429
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,600
All those years she couldn't hold a son.

430
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,440
Now, she ill-wishes me.

431
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,800
She lies in between me and the woman I love, with her cold heart...

432
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,040
You know they burnt it before I could see if it was a boy.

433
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,590
It may have been impossible to tell, Your Majesty.

434
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,440
So soon.

435
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,560
This, erm... This business of Thomas More.

436
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,200
I don't doubt his loyalty to Rome,

437
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:22,800
or his hatred of Your Majesty's title as Head of the Church.

438
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,160
However, legally, our case is slender.

439
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,160
It won't be easy.

440
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,040
Do I keep you for what's easy?

441
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,920
Do you think I've promoted you for the charm of your presence?

442
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,040
I keep you because you're a serpent.

443
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,360
Do not be a viper in my bosom.

444
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,040
You know my decision. Execute it.

445
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,480
That woman on the wall.

446
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,480
I know who she is.

447
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,790
Sheba.

448
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,000
For you. I know who she is for you.

449
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,920
Why you always look at her.

450
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,040
They told me about her in Antwerp.

451
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,680
The woman Cromwell loved.

452
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,280
Why don't you go back and claim her?

453
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,000
She's married.

454
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,720
It was years ago.

455
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,240
I've changed.

456
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,000
Ja. You're rich now.

457
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,680
I think...

458
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,990
What?

459
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,350
Nothing.

460
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,720
What? You're going to hang me up by my wrists until I talk?

461
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,280
I think there is another woman in your heart now.

462
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,640
Thomas More's wife is here to see you.

463
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,420
Lady Alice.

464
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,070
When I came here before, this was a musty old place.

465
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,050
My husband used to say,

466
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,290
"Put Thomas Cromwell in a dungeon and by evening,

467
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,980
"he'll be sitting on cushions, with gaolers owing him money."

468
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,720
Did he talk a lot about putting me in dungeons?

469
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,880
He... It was only talk.

470
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,640
I thought you might take me to see the King.

471
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,320
I know he's always kind to women.

472
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,240
I can't do that. I wish I could.

473
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,600
You've always been good to us. I wonder why.

474
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,920
You always have some trick.

475
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,000
Born tricky. Can't help it.

476
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,880
Alice, why is your husband so stubborn?

477
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,480
I no more understand him than I do the Holy Trinity.

478
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,440
I worry he's cold.

479
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,080
He tells me nothing.

480
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,370
All his letters are to his precious Meg.

481
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,080
Don't think there's no tenderness between us.

482
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,440
We had dealings, one time or another.

483
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,700
And when that's true, you can't help but worry about a man,

484
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,390
wonder if...

485
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,560
wonder if he's feeling cold.

486
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,960
When you talk to him, ask him from me...

487
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,120
Ask him, does he think it's clever to leave his wife without company,

488
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,280
his son without advice, his daughter without protection?

489
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,360
And all of us at the mercy of a man like yourself?

490
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,680
We have to take away your pens and papers and your books.

491
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,440
Very well. If you must take them, take them now.

492
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,240
Alice came to see me. She wants you home.

493
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,400
All you have to do, is sign this. Meg has signed it.

494
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,480
Your own beloved daughter.

495
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,910
Just sign the paper and the King will be happy.

496
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,280
I'll send my barge to row you back to Chelsea,

497
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,800
back to your garden, your children, back to Dame Alice

498
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,920
who will be waiting to bear you up to your own bed.

499
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,400
Don't you want that?

500
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,360
Don't you want to be out of this place you're in?

501
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,920
When we meet again in Heaven...

502
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,760
...as I hope we will...

503
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,380
..all our differences will be forgot.

504
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,000
But, for now, we cannot wish them away.

505
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,400
All I have, all I own is the ground I stand upon.

506
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,800
That ground is Thomas More.

507
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,160
If you want it, you must take it.

508
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,160
I will not yield it.

509
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,550
When you come before the court,

510
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,600
throw yourself upon the King's mercy.

511
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,610
He's not a cruel man, you know that.

512
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,440
Do I?

513
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,760
He didn't used to be.

514
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,200
But then he's changed the company he keeps.

515
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,610
Anyway...

516
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,290
It's not important what happens to my body.

517
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,380
Are you not afraid of the pain?

518
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,010
Oh, yes. I'm very much afraid.

519
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:35,520
I am not a strong and robust man, such as yourself.

520
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,080
I cannot help but rehearse it in my mind.

521
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,400
But I will only feel it for a moment,

522
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,960
and God will not let me remember it afterwards.

523
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,240
I would have left you, you know...

524
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,640
..to live out your life...

525
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,160
..to repent your cruelties...

526
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,240
..if I were king.

527
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,780
Take away his books.

528
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,200
I'll send someone.

529
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,680
No, Richard, I'd like you to do it yourself.

530
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,160
If the jury throws it out, the King will skin us alive.

531
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,440
No. The Queen will.

532
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:49,870
My God, looks like we've had him whipped.

533
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,320
And he says I never miss a trick.

534
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,400
If he stands on his silence...

535
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,480
His silence proves nothing.

536
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,610
He doesn't have to prove anything, my lord.

537
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,360
His plea is that his silence is consent enough

538
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,040
to the King's desires.

539
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,130
Bollocks.

540
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,640
It is the maxim of the common law.

541
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,680
Still bollocks.

542
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,280
He hasn't been entirely silent.

543
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,880
I came to take away your books.

544
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,030
And as I did so, I tried to convince you one last time to take the oath.

545
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,400
I put a case to you, did I not?

546
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:46,160
I asked you, if Parliament had a vote and made me king...

547
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,400
..would you go along with it?

548
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,130
And you said, "Nothing that Parliament would do,

549
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:54,920
"would surprise me these days.

550
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,080
"But, if they voted that Richard Riche should be God,

551
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:00,380
"I would draw a line there."

552
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,560
I asked you why? Do you remember your reply?

553
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,080
I made no record of it, having no writing materials.

554
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,200
You having already taken them from me.

555
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,000
You said, "Parliament cannot do it.

556
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,520
"It can make laws in the earthly realm, not the heavenly."

557
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,520
So I said, "It could not make me God, nor Head of the Church, either,

558
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,640
"for surely that is a spiritual jurisdiction?"

559
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,120
And you said, "No, Parliament cannot do it."

560
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,400
Meaning what?

561
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,960
Meaning, if Parliament names the King the Head of the Church,

562
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,280
it has no effect.

563
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,450
According to Sir Thomas.

564
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,240
He denied the King's title.

565
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,600
That would be treason.

566
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,760
Ask yourselves, gentlemen,

567
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,880
why would I open my mind to a man like Richard Riche?

568
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,910
Why, when the learned and the pious have implored me,

569
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,530
when the King himself with weighty reasons has sought to persuade me.

570
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:01,130
Because you think I don't matter.

571
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,240
That is what you said.

572
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,490
I will take my oath on it.

573
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:10,040
Your oath? Your oath isn't worth the Devil's fart!

574
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,250
Christ help you, Riche, I have known you since you were a child,

575
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,680
you were the despair of your family, you were a gambler and a waster.

576
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:21,040
May I remind you that Richard Riche is Solicitor General,

577
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,280
and not to be talked to like some pot-boy.

578
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,360
Did you speak the words alleged?

579
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,200
I doubt it, and if I did...

580
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,480
- If you did?  - If I did, they were not meant with malice.

581
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,880
And so, masters, you cannot find them treasonable

582
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,060
and you are bound to disregard such words,

583
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:47,470
whatever this court tells you.

584
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,200
Prisoner, this court has found you guilty of treason.

585
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,710
Your sentence will be...

586
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,640
Forgive me. Does the prisoner have anything to say?

587
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,600
I have followed my conscience.

588
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,000
You must follow yours.

589
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,170
My conscience satisfies me and now, I will speak plainly,

590
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,480
that your statute is faulty and your authority baseless.

591
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,250
My conscience stands with the majority.

592
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,720
Against Henry's kingdom, I have all the kingdoms of Christendom!

593
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,360
Now we see your malice, sir!

594
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,440
Against each one of your bishops...

595
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,200
Now, we see you choose Rome over England!

596
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,240
- Against your Parliament!  - You traitor!

597
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,960
I have all the general councils of the Church,

598
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,160
stretching back for a thousand years!

599
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,720
It's the prayer book he had with him at the end.

600
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,080
You had no choice, master.

601
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,130
Thomas?

602
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,080
Liz.

603
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,080
Thomas? It's Johane.

604
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,670
You have a fever.

605
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:29,160
Liz, let me...

606
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,760
Let me love her.

607
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,000
Let me love her, Liz.

608
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,960
Fetch Dr Butts.

609
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:11,200
It's a fever I got in Italy.

610
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,440
It was a snake.

611
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,220
Let's say it is.

612
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,120
If I'm dying...

613
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,320
..get Gregory.

614
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:38,560
Gregory, there's things I need to tell him.

615
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:52,120
Slow down, so I can see how you do it.

616
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,760
I can't slow down.

617
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:57,200
If I stop to think how I'm doing it, I won't be able to do it.

618
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,520
Itinerary for the King's summer progress.

619
00:56:54,800 --> 00:57:01,280
Depart Windsor, then to Reading, Missenden, Abingdon.

620
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,080
We join them at Sudley.

621
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,320
If we leave on the 18th...?

622
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,120
Leave a day earlier. The roads.

623
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:14,700
Yes.Gloucester then to Thornbury.

624
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,210
Iron Acton. Bromham.

625
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:25,440
Late September, Winchester, Bishop's Waltham.

626
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:36,800
Sir?

627
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,000
Before Bromham, add another.

628
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,240
Yes?

629
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,880
Early September.

630
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:58,880
Five days Wolf Hall.

631
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,200
Sir John.

632
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,560
Majesty. Welcome.

633
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,510
Lost my hat riding here.

634
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,880
I'll send servants to find it, Your Highness.

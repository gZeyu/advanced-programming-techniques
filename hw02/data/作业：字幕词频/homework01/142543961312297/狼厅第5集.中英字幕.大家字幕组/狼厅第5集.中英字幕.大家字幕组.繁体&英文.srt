第1季 第5集

7
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:13,090
公元1535年 《至尊法案》宣布亨利八世
為英格蘭教區首腦 但神圣羅馬皇帝及其大使
 尤斯塔斯 沙皮既不承認亨利的頭銜
也不承認他與安妮 博林的婚姻關系

8
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:25,090
克倫威爾病愈后 為國王計劃了出巡路線
其中包括了造訪 簡 西摩 的家族

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,490
即  狼廳

10
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,090
約翰爵士
Sir John.

11
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,250
恭迎陛下
Your Majesty. Welcome.

12
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,320
我騎馬來的路上 遺失了帽子
I lost my hat, riding here.

13
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,750
永遠不會太遲的
It's never too late.

14
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,800
你應該再婚 再組建個新家庭
You should marry again, have another family.

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,960
說不定你在這兒就能找到個新娘呢
Perhaps you'll find a bride, while you're here with us.

16
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,300
弗朗西斯 威斯頓...
Francis Weston...

17
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,780
你應輕觸他一下
I believe your gentlemanly touch is required.

18
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,880
或者我們可以制造點兒噪聲
Perhaps we should make a noise,

19
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,450
讓他自然的醒來
to wake him naturally?

20
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,960
誰來笑兩聲
Someone laugh?

21
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,910
是啊 就這么做吧 湯姆
Yes, do that, Tom.

22
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,780
我并沒睡去
I wasn't asleep.

23
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,820
只是閉目養神而已
Just resting my eyes.

24
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,830
沒時間扭扭捏捏的
This is no time to be shy.

25
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,680
告訴克倫威爾 亨利問了你什么
Tell Cromwell what Henry asked you.

26
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,030
他問我 是否欣賞他
He asked me if I would look kindly on him.

27
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,260
譬如 他若是為我作詩
If he wrote me a poem, for instance.

28
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,000
我說我會的
I said I would.

29
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,320
很好
Good.

30
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,420
但如果他對你有什么別的企圖...
But if he attempts anything on your person...

31
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,250
..你就大叫
..scream.

32
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,840
要是沒人來呢
What if nobody comes?

33
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,480
別大叫
Don't scream.

34
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,820
祈禱...
Pray...

35
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,080
大聲的祈禱
out loud.

36
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,630
去嘗試喚醒陛下的虔誠之心
Something that will appeal to His Majesty's piety

37
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,850
和他的榮譽感
and sense of honour.

38
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,840
我會去翻翻我的禱告書的
I'll get my prayer book.

39
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,210
一定能找到些合適的語句
I'm sure I can find something that will fit the bill.

40
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,210
金博爾頓城堡
被流放的阿拉貢的凱瑟琳的宅邸

41
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,630
托馬斯 克倫威爾 國王的首席秘書大臣
Thomas Cromwell, Secretary to the King.

42
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,610
表明你的來意
Show your colours!

43
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,040
告訴他 放我們進去 別等我踢他屁股
Tell him to let us in, before I show his arse my boot.

44
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,290
好吧...
Well...

45
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,060
..我看起來怎樣
..how do I look?

46
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,780
這不就是他派你來的原因嗎
That's why he sent you, isn't it?

47
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,090
來看看我是不是真的快死了
To see if I really am dying?

48
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,750
他以前稱呼我為他的小花兒
He used to call me his flower.

49
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,080
我的長子出生的時候 是冬天
When my first son was born, it was winter.

50
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,590
嚴寒時根本就沒有開花的植物
There were no blooms to be had.

51
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,750
但他卻送了我七十二朵玫瑰...
He gave me six dozen roses...

52
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,090
用最純白的絲綢包裹著
..made of the purest white silk.

53
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,080
這么多年 我把它們都送給那些曾服侍過我的人了
Over the years, I have given them to those who have done me some service.

54
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,640
你...
Will...

55
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,160
你能讓瑪麗公主來看看我嗎
Will you let the Princess Mary visit me?

56
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,520
這不會對國王有什么傷害的
What harm can it do the King?

57
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,520
沙皮給瑪麗夫人寫了封信
Chapuys has written to the lady Mary,

58
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,190
說他能把她帶出這個國家
saying that he can get her out of the country.

59
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,200
不可能的
Never!

60
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,470
我用我的生命保證
I answer for it with my life.

61
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,680
亨利在想什么呢
What does Henry imagine?

62
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,210
他覺得瑪麗會帶著一支軍隊回來
Mary, returning with an army,

63
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,450
把他從王位上趕下來嗎
turning him out of his Kingdom?

64
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,100
真是可笑
It's laughable.

65
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,120
我可以親身為她的言行意向做擔保
I answer for her intentions with my own person.

66
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,970
那你要做的事可多了 夫人
Your own person has a lot to do, madam -

67
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,160
保證這個 擔保那個
guaranteeing this, answering for that.

68
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,800
但您卻只可死一次的
You can only die once.

69
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,130
當那時刻來臨時...
And when I do...

70
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,000
..我將會為亨利作出榜樣的
..I will set Henry an example,

71
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,790
如何對待自己的死期
for when his own time comes.

72
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,200
你經常想到國王之死嗎
Do you think about the King's death a lot?

73
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,960
我考慮的是他的余生
I think about his afterlife.

74
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,920
那個博林家的女孩怎么樣了
How is Boleyn's daughter?

75
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,740
她的孩子流掉了 我聽說
She lost the child, I am told.

76
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,030
我知道那是什么樣的感覺
I know how that is.

77
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,930
她和國王希望很快之后 再得一子
She and the King have hopes of another child, soon.

78
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,360
是已經有了希望
Particular hope,

79
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,170
還是將來會有點希望
or general hope?

80
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,260
我一直都很信任你的
My thoughts always confided in you.

81
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,450
也希望我們之間不要有嫌隙
I do hope there is no rift.

82
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,500
怎樣 她有了嗎
Well? Is she?

83
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,320
她還是什么都沒說
She's said nothing, still?

84
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,510
當然了 這女人聰明 什么都不會多言的
Of course, the wise woman says nothing

85
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,240
除非她真的能感受到胎動
until she feels the quickening.

86
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,670
有了
Yes.

87
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,960
她之前一直弄錯了...
She's been wrong before...

88
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,550
..不過 終于有了
..but, yes.

89
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,100
國王知道了嗎
Does the King know?

90
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,230
你該去告訴他 他說不準會當場授予你爵位的
You should tell him. He might knight you on the spot.

91
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,320
我覺得很有希望
I suppose it's to be expected.

92
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:16,060
她差不多整個夏天都和國王在一起
She was with the King for much of the summer

93
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,100
并且他不在她身邊時 還會寫情書給她
and when he wasn't with her, he would write her love letters

94
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,160
由哈里 諾里斯親手送達
and sent them by the hand of Harry Norris.

95
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,790
夫人 我得告辭了
My lady, I must leave you.

96
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,000
你之前可都是善于傾聽的人
And you were usually such a good listener.

97
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,230
窗子開著
The window was open.

98
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,180
它是那么的純真無辜
He was such an innocent...

99
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,170
什么樣的禽獸會做這種事
What kind of monster would do such a thing?

100
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,130
也許它不知怎的自己爬上了窗臺
Perhaps he got up on the ledge somehow and...

101
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,320
然后爪子打滑了
then his paws slipped.

102
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,420
- 爪子打滑 你說它爪子打滑    - 走開 瑪麗
- Paws slipped? Paws slipped? - Oh, get away, Mary!

103
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,400
哦 沒錯
Oh, yes -

104
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,000
我又給她重新受洗取名了
I've re-baptised my fool.

105
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,650
說起來...
Well...

106
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,880
國王的女兒差不多是個侏儒 是吧
the King's daughter is almost a dwarf, isn't she?

107
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,100
法國人看見她 會震驚的
The French will have a shock if they ever see her.

108
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,900
- 他們肯定會震驚的  - 沒錯
- They'll have a shock.- Yes.

109
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,080
我知道他們正試圖讓她與法國王子聯姻
I know they're trying for a match between her and the Dauphin.

110
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,750
而我自己的女兒...
While my own daughter...

111
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,840
我說過 讓你到法國去 商談一下她的聯姻之事
I told you to go to France and negotiate her marriage.

112
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,330
- 你卻說自己病了... - 我確實病了
- But you said you were ill...- I was ill.

113
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,740
你從未生過病
You're never ill

114
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,000
除非你在撒謊
unless you want to be.

115
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,280
如今法國人都在背后笑話我
And now the French laugh behind my back.

116
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,990
法國人壓根就不想聯姻
The French never intended a match.

117
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,240
我這女兒的出生簡直就是毫無意義的
It's as if my daughter had never been born.

118
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,960
就好像凱瑟琳還依舊是王后
As if Katherine was still Queen.

119
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,920
就好像我根本不存在
As if I didn't exist.

120
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,040
我不會允許瑪麗與王室聯姻的
I won't let them make a royal match for Mary.

121
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,320
我要你去見見她
I want you to visit her.

122
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,160
帶一個你家的帥小伙一同去
Take one of your handsome young men with you.

123
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,770
她這輩子從沒受過什么贊譽
She's never had a compliment in her life -

124
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,230
勾搭引誘她不會是什么難事
it shouldn't be hard to seduce her.

125
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,280
您希望她被破了處子身嗎
You want me to compromise her?

126
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,050
你要是想 自己上也可以
Do it yourself, if you want.

127
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,380
我聽說她很鐘意你的
I heard she liked you.

128
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,740
反正我只要她在大庭廣眾之下出丑
All that's needed is for her to make a fool of herself in public,

129
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,400
讓她名聲掃地
so she loses her reputation.

130
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,900
不行
No.

131
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,380
不行 你竟然說不行
No? No?

132
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,520
你說什么
What?

133
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,430
那不是我的目標
That's not my aim.

134
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,880
我也不會用那些手段的
Those are not my methods.

135
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,510
我知道你和西摩家關系甚密
I know you're talking to the Seymours.

136
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,000
你以為這是個秘密
You think it's a secret,

137
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,500
但我卻是無所不知的
but nothing is secret from me.

138
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,120
真是難以置信 你竟然把賭注全都壓在她身上
I can't believe you'd put your money on such a bad risk.

139
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,160
夫人 有段時間內 您也對我言聽計從
There was a time, madam, that you would listen to my advice.

140
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,650
現在讓我再給您點建議好嗎
Let me advise you now.

141
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,200
放棄你的所有計劃與圖謀吧
Drop your plans and schemes.

142
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,160
放下所有的包袱與負擔吧
Put down the burden of them.

143
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,660
低調行事做人 直到您的孩子出生
Keep yourself in quietness, until your child is born.

144
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,240
而簡呢
For Jane...

145
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,810
她不過是個分心的瑣事而已
..she's a distraction, that's all.

146
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,600
任她自生自滅去吧
Let it run its course.

147
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,290
- 假裝您從未見過她  - 他永不會棄我于不顧
- Pretend that you don't even see her... - He'll never abandon me.

148
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,540
永遠不會的
Never.

149
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,020
從我的加冕禮之后 英格蘭就進入了嶄新的時代
Since my coronation, there is a new England

150
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,910
我不在的話 這個國家舉步維艱
and it can't subsist without me.

151
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,540
我警告你...
I'm warning you...

152
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,620
在我的孩子出生前 克倫威爾
..make terms with me, Cremuel...

153
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,340
你最好和我達成共識
..before my child is born.

154
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,440
我聽說你要把所有的修女和修道士都趕出去
I hear you're going to put all the nuns and monks out on the road.

155
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,730
沙皮先生
Monsieur Chapuys,

156
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,910
無論我的屬下們去哪
wherever my commissioners go,

157
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,960
都會有一大幫修道士和修女們圍著他們 乞求寬恕
they meet monks and nuns who come to them, begging for their liberty -

158
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,110
聽到那些丑聞之后 我一點都不吃驚
and after the scandals I've heard, I'm not surprised.

159
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:32,240
修道士們將吃剩下的腐肉賣給窮人
Monks selling broken meats from the Last Supper to the poor.

160
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,410
年輕的信徒被年長的修道士們造訪到了床上去
Young novices being visited in their beds by older monks.

161
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,690
他們聲稱自己是"神圣使徒"
They claim they're living the "vita apostolica",

162
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,230
但你找到的卻全都是
but you didn't find the apostles

163
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,080
互摸私處的信徒 對吧
feeling each other's bollocks, did you?

164
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,440
去告訴你的主人 好的宗教應導人向善 而不是退化成獸性
Tell your master I mean good religion to increase, not wither.

165
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,970
我不會向主人撒謊 我只是稟實相告
I won't tell my master lies, if I tell him what I see.

166
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,870
我看到的是不滿
I see discontent.

167
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,200
我看到嚴寒未過 饑荒四起
I see famine, before the spring.

168
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:00,000
你們從帝國的領土上購買玉米
You're buying corn from the territories of the Emperor.

169
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,620
這些交易可是會被禁止的
This trade could be stopped.

170
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,920
把我國的民眾餓死了 對你的主人又有什么好處呢
What could your master possibly gain, by starving my countrymen?

171
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,770
他能看到 這些愚昧的民眾是怎樣被殘酷統治的
He would gain this - he would see how evilly they are governed!

172
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,720
亨利從藐視譏笑教皇開始
Henry begins by mocking the Pope

173
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,850
終將一天會投身
he will end up embracing...

174
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,640
惡魔的懷抱
..the devil.

175
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,540
尤斯塔斯
Eustache...

176
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,840
到底發生了什么
..what's happened?

177
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,400
你這是怎么了
What is this?

178
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,570
金博爾頓城堡傳來了消息
I have news from Kimbolton.

179
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,540
凱瑟琳王后她...
Queen Katherine...

180
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:56,060
她還剩一兩天的命了 我不想她...
She has only one or two days to live and I don't want her to...

181
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,920
托馬斯 我不想她孤獨死去
Thomas, I don't want her to die alone,

182
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,790
竟無愛她之人在側
without anyone who loves her.

183
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,120
恐怕國王也不會允許我去看她
And I'm afraid the King won't let me go.

184
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,030
那你會讓我去嗎
Will you let me go?

185
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,320
沙皮大使的拜訪探望
It would be a kindness

186
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,200
是對她的極大恩寵仁慈
to let her have a visit from Ambassador Chapuys.

187
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
為什么
Why?

188
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,840
這樣他就能更方便的和她密謀了嗎
So he can intrigue with her more conveniently?

189
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:29,000
夫人 她的醫生說 她已時日無多了
Her doctors suggest, Madam, that she will very soon be in her grave.

190
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,630
她就算死了 也會裹著尸布飛出來的
She'd fly out of it, shroud flapping,

191
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,900
來給我找找晦氣
if she thought she could cause me trouble.

192
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,890
陛下 羅馬皇帝也許是一個孝順的侄子
Your Majesty, the Emperor may be a fond nephew,

193
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,540
但他卻不會為了死去的女人和您永遠僵持的
but he won't keep up the quarrel for a dead woman.

194
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,480
這樣和解 對雙方都有好處 免除戰爭 進入和平新世紀
This could mean the end to the threat of war - a new era.

195
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,040
沙皮大使...
Ambassador Chapuys...

196
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,280
沙皮大使...
Ambassador Chapuys...

197
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,400
他從未承認過我的妻子是王后
has never acknowledged my wife as Queen.

198
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,720
除非他當眾拜見王后
Until he is prepared to bow before her, publicly,

199
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,240
否則我是不會接見他的
there will be no diplomacy with that man.

200
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,460
她終于是死了 感謝上帝
At last, God!

201
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,160
早就該死了
Not before time!

202
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,080
她可是非常想要見到她的弟弟呢
She's very much looking forward to seeing her younger brother

203
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,420
是不是啊 小寶貝
aren't you, dumpling?

204
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,300
我也和她一樣的迫切
And I share her impatience.

205
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,000
我也已經等了好久了
It has been a long enough wait.

206
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,860
我想全國民眾都要為她哀悼
I suppose we must expect the country to mourn for her.

207
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,030
她畢竟也曾是王后之尊
She was once given the title of "Queen".

208
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,790
她是錯誤的當上王后的
Mistakenly.

209
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,640
陛下
Majesty,

210
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,990
您是否要下令將尸體運送到圣保羅大教堂
do you wish the body brought to St Paul's?

211
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,100
將她安葬在彼得伯勒吧
We will lay her to rest in Peterborough.

212
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,880
那樣花費少點
It will cost less.

213
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,050
她給我寄了一封信
She sent me a letter.

214
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,320
我不想看
I don't want it.

215
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,380
你處理掉 好嗎
Get rid of it, will you?

216
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,730
理查德 里奇說國王想收回凱瑟琳的餐具和皮革品
Richard Rich says the King wants Katherine's plate and furs.

217
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,120
里奇說 如果她從未成為過他的妻子
Rich had to point out that if she was never, in fact, his wife,

218
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,560
那他無權收回她的遺產
he has no right to her property.

219
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,020
噢 他會收回那些皮革的
Oh, he'll have the furs.

220
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,900
"我將我們的女兒瑪麗鄭重托付給你
"I commend unto you our daughter, Mary...

221
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,870
希望你能擔當起父親的責任
..beseeching you to be a good father to her...

222
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,220
最后
..and lastly,

223
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,600
我在此立誓
I make this vow...

224
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,600
我在天堂之上 也會一直注視著你的作為"
..that mine eyes desire you, above all things."

225
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,140
要是我在你身旁
If I'd been with you,

226
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,840
我一定不會讓你遇到危險的
I could have put you out of danger.

227
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,960
我會用毛毯馬上撲滅這火的
I'd have beat it with a... with a blanket.

228
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,100
謝天謝地 你...
Oh, thank goodness that you...

229
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,280
要是我在就好了...
If I'd been here...

230
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,400
別弄了
Leave it!

231
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,120
別緊張 我的丈夫
Peace, my husband,

232
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,620
我沒有受傷
I am not harmed.

233
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:48,910
夫人
My Lady.

234
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,680
讓我先喝點東西
Let me drink this.

235
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:17,220
“有預言說...”

236
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,570
“...會有個英國王后被火燒死”

237
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,170
“...但我沒想到 ”

238
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,960
“...會是在王后自己的床上 ”

239
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,300
“...火源是一根不起眼的蠟燭 ”

240
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,500
“...不然就是有人故意這樣的 ”

241
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,600
“這蠟燭怎么會無人看管的呢？ ”

242
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,080
這帷幔本來是很好的...
This was a good piece...

243
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,170
怎么了
Yes, what is it?

244
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:58,050
手邊一定要備著水
Water must be kept at hand

245
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,770
每個時段都要讓女仆輪番服侍
and a woman appoin ted on every rota,

246
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,880
保證所有的燈都徹底熄滅
to check that all the lights are being extinguished.

247
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,400
無法想象這件事是怎么發生的
I can't imagine how this could have happened.

248
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,220
第一 這是內廷事務 不在你職權管轄范圍內
First, this is a household matter and not within your remit.

249
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,310
第二 她安然無恙
Second, she was in no danger.

250
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,540
第三 我不知道誰點的那只蠟燭
Third, I don't know who lit the candle.

251
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,800
第四 就算是我干的 我也不會告訴你
Four, if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

252
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,770
第五 沒有人會告訴你是誰干的
Five, no-one will tell you either.

253
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,880
如果 如果發生了
If, as it may happen,

254
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,370
某些人在熄燭之后 還潛入拜訪了王后...
some person visits the Queen after the lights are out...

255
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,250
..那可是件我們要遮掩嚴密的大事了
..then it is an event over which we should draw a veil.

256
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,800
某些人
Some person?

257
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:40,280
某些人 是為縱火而來的
Some person, for the purposes of arson?

258
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,680
或是另有目的
Or the purposes of something else?

259
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,220
羅奇福德夫人...
Lady Rochford...

260
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:57,080
簡 等你放下你的良心包袱的時候
Jane, when the time comes to unburden your conscience,

261
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,570
不要去找牧師
don't go to a priest.

262
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,050
他只會讓你懺悔
He'll give you penance.

263
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,820
而我卻會給你回報
I'll give you a reward.

264
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:17,820
里彭的貴族帶了多少錢貢獻給大主教
How much does the lordship of Ripon bring in to the Archbishop?

265
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,540
260英鎊多一點 陛下
A little over £260, sir.

266
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,110
索斯威爾呢
How much does Southwell bring in?

267
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,970
不到150英鎊
A scant £150.

268
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,800
我以為會更多點呢
Ha? I thought it would be more.

269
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,510
殿下...
Majesty...

270
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:39,080
..今天的比武上
..in the tournament, today?

271
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,620
如果您和我的兒子 格雷戈里 比試的話
If you should run against my son, Gregory,

272
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,370
您會控制自己不把他摔下馬去嗎...
will you forbear to unhorse him...

273
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,820
..如果能忍住的話
..if you can help it?

274
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,510
我們做事常常都是情不自禁的 對吧
We can't help what we do, really.

275
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:55,720
當你對一個人雷霆出手的時候 你無法控制
When you're thundering down at a man, you can't check.

276
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,250
真是一件罕見的事 你知道嗎 克倫
It's a very rare event, you know, Crom...

277
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,240
..打倒敵手的時候
..to bring down your opponent.

278
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,080
如果你是擔心他的表現 就大可不必了
If you're concerned about what showing he'll make, you needn't be.

279
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,250
他很有能力
He's very able.

280
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:26,110
我不在意他的表現
I don't really mind what showing he makes.

281
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,420
我只是不想讓他...
I just don't want him to be...

282
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,200
受到打擊
flattened.

283
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:07,360
你不來看比武了
You can't come.

284
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,020
拉夫回來了
Rafe is back.

285
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,340
我要和他談談他正在調查的修道院
I have to talk to him about some abbeys he's been surveying.

286
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,050
還有些文件要處理...
And there's my papers...

287
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,910
理查德會在這的 代表我
Richard will be here, to represent me.

288
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,880
這是我第一次比武
It's my first joust.

289
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:37,820
梵蒂岡給了亨利三個月的時間再度歸服
The Vatican has given Henry three months to return to obedience,

290
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,450
否則將他逐出教會的聲明
or the bull of excommunication against him

291
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,850
將會傳遍歐洲
will be distributed through Europe.

292
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,280
羅馬皇帝的艦隊已經出發前往阿爾及爾
The Emperor's fleet is set for Algiers

293
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:49,370
率領四萬全副武裝的士兵
with 40,000 armed men.

294
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,540
方坦的修道院長
The Abbot of Fountains

295
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,570
一直在按計劃的清洗自己的財產
has been systematically robbing his own treasury,

296
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,080
議會還有兩周就要舉行了
parliament opens in a fortnight.

297
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,050
國王說你是我們家族里的榮耀
The King says you're a credit to my house.

298
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,000
你也當之無愧
And you are.

299
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,570
好幾年前 還在你出生之前
Some years ago, before you were born,

300
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,940
我在威尼斯遇到了一位葡萄牙老騎士
I met an old Portuguese knight in Venice - one of those men

301
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,220
他是專門在歐洲以騎馬比賽為生的人
who made a career of riding to tournaments, throughout Europe.

302
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,140
我不知道...不知道那話什么意思...
I don't know... For what it's worth...

303
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,970
但他說比武的秘訣就是在你要輕輕松松的坐在馬鞍上
He said the secret to jousting was to sit easily in your saddle,

304
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,370
就像是出門呼吸新鮮空氣一般
like you're going out to take some air.

305
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,800
矛不要握的太緊 直到最后一刻在狠狠抓緊
Carry your lance loose, until the very last moment

306
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,200
最為重要的是...
and above all else...

307
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,050
..戰勝你的求生保命的本能...
..defeat your instincts to...

308
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,880
..去戰斗
..survive.

309
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,820
很好 我想你已經準備好了
Well, you're ready.

310
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,340
你看上去很棒
You look good.

311
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,200
謝謝你
Thank you.

312
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,820
禮物
Present.

313
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,020
你猜一下是什么
You have to guess.

314
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,880
圣阿波洛尼亞的牙嗎
St Appollonia's teeth?

315
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,480
不是
No.

316
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,170
從抹大拉的瑪麗亞的墓里挖出的牙齒
Teeth from the comb of Mary Magdalene?

317
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,910
是圣愛德蒙德的指甲碎屑
St Edmund's nail parings.

318
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,570
將它和其余的指甲們放在一起吧
Tip them in with the rest.

319
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:39,310
這個人肯定是有幾百個手指頭了
The man must have had 500 fingers.

320
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,480
還有什么事
What else?

321
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:49,250
之前梅登 布拉德利聲稱她有羅馬的許可
The prior at Maiden Bradley claims he has a licence, under papal seal,

322
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,480
允許他招妓
allowing him to keep a whore.

323
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,200
威斯敏斯特大教堂買了一頭大象的遺骨
Westminster Abbey bought the bones of a dead elephant.

324
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:58,340
現在告訴我他們想...
Now, tell me what they wanted with...

325
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,970
格雷戈里出事了嗎
Gregory?

326
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:07,020
不 是國王 是亨利
It's the King, it's... it's Henry.

327
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,370
他死了
He's dead.

328
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,710
比武還沒有開始
The tournament hadn't begun.

329
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,080
國王正騎馬跑向那個環 結果馬突然倒下了
The King was running towards the ring and the horse just went down.

330
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,000
他當時身邊沒有一個人 所以也沒有人能受到責備
No-one was near him, no-one to blame.

331
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,940
學士 如果這是真的...
Master, if this is true...

332
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,800
如果他死了...
If he is dead...

333
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,710
我們現在要在他們封堵港口之前逃跑嗎
Should we escape now, before they block the ports?

334
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,570
找菲茲威廉來
Fetch Fitzwilliam.

335
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,760
讓開 讓開
Move, move!

336
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,920
讓開 讓開
Move! Move!

337
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:10,000
- 把鏡子照照他嘴唇  - 已經試過了
- Fetch a mirror to his lips. - It was tried.

338
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,400
那你什么意思 就讓他躺在這里
What do you mean, leaving him lying here,

339
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,680
不得基督的觸碰
untouched by Christian hands?!

340
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,420
上帝啊 克倫威爾 - 你死定了
By God, Cromwell - you're a dead man!

341
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:22,110
諾爾福克大人 諾爾福克大人 王后在哪
My Lord Norfolk, My Lord Norfolk! Where is the Queen?

342
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,310
在看臺上
On the floor.

343
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,200
我已經親自告訴她了
I told her myself.

344
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,850
我的分內之事
My place to do it.

345
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,800
她警告你要聽話的
She warned you to be obedient.

346
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,740
現在她要攝政 你的好日子到頭了
And now she's Regent, your days are finished!

347
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,880
胡說八道
No, no, no!

348
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,110
沒人會讓一個大肚子女人攝政掌權的
No woman with big belly as Regent.

349
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,770
我才應該掌權
Me! Me!

350
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,280
- 格雷戈里 - 財政大臣帶來了
- Gregory!  - We've brought the Master Treasurer.

351
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,050
謝謝你 謝謝
Thank you, thank you.

352
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,310
瑪麗公主 如果她落入博林的手中 她必死無疑
The Princess Mary - if she falls into Boleyn hands, she's dead.

353
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,820
我們得在消息擴散前 快回城去
We have to get up-country before this news does.

354
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,770
快 菲茲威廉 快走
Go, Fitzwilliam. Go quickly.

355
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,850
瑪麗受博林家的人監護 如果他們不放人怎么辦
Mary's keepers are Boleyns. What if they won't yield her?

356
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,140
那她必死無疑
Well, then she's dead.

357
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,540
但如果我們讓她落到天主教徒的手上
We let her fall into the hands of the papists,

358
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,310
他們會擁護她為女王 我也會死
they'll set her up as Queen - and I'm dead.

359
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,020
還會爆發內戰
There'll be civil war.

360
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,050
我不清楚...
I don't know...

361
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,450
女人不能攝政 克倫威爾 女人不可以掌權的
A woman cannot rule, Cromwell! A woman cannot rule!

362
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,200
噢 天吶 我的天
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

363
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,400
陛下有呼吸了 陛下有呼吸了
The King's breathing, the King's breathing!

364
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,640
陛下萬壽無疆
Long live the King!

365
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:27,040
挺住 加油
Come on, come on.

366
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,510
挺住 挺住
Come on, come on.

367
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,170
挺住...醒了 醒了
Come on... There you are, there you are!

368
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,820
你挺過來了 你能看得見我嗎 太好了 沒事了
There you are! Do you see me? That's it, that's it.

369
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,370
散開 退開點 讓他喘口氣
Get back, move away. Let him breathe!

370
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,880
讓他呼吸 讓他呼吸
Let him breathe, let him breathe.

371
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,650
有多少人能說
How many men can say,

372
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,510
"我唯一的摯友是英格蘭的國王"
"My only friend is the King of England?"

373
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,080
你可能認為我擁有一切...
You'd think I have everything...

374
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,740
但如果亨利死了...
..but take Henry away...

375
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,480
我不知道 克倫
I don't know, Crom.

376
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,160
你不是孤立無助的 知道嗎
You're not without support, you know?

377
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,200
原諒我有所質疑
Forgive my scepticism.

378
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,510
我是說 如果你需要支持...
I mean, you would have support...

379
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,940
只要對抗博林家族 就能得到支持
..should you need it, against the Boleyns.

380
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:34,680
可我為什么要支持呢
Well, why should I need that?

381
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,480
畢竟王后和我是完美搭檔
The Queen and I are perfect friends.

382
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,960
原諒我有所質疑
Forgive my scepticism.

383
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,880
這種支持...
This support...?

384
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:59,940
尼古拉斯 克洛爵士說...
Sir Nicholas Carew says he thinks...

385
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,110
他覺得你是個很容易相處的人
you're an easy fellow to get on with.

386
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,880
是嗎
Does he?

387
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,540
也許...
Perhaps...

388
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,250
也許你可以和他一起進餐
Perhaps you should dine with him?

389
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:17,020
克倫 如果陛下沒能醒來...
What would have happened, Crom...

390
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,940
會發生什么
if the king had not recovered?

391
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:22,570
安妮會不擇手段奪取大權
Anne would have all, to rule herself.

392
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,620
盡管她和她的叔夫諾爾福克爭執一番
Though she'd have a fight with her Uncle Norfolk.

393
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,650
他們兩方 我到底該支持誰呢
Between the two of them, which one would I back?

394
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:34,570
我覺得應該支持夫人
The lady, I think.

395
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:38,800
讓安妮夫人攝政
Let the lady be Regent

396
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,800
那么博林家族就會背棄我們
and the Boleyns will walk on our backs.

397
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,620
你的頭會被掛在長釘上
And your head will be on a spike.

398
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,570
但當然 如果她能為國王誕下王子的話
But of course, that will come to pass anyway...

399
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,220
那這一切終將發生
if she gives Henry a son.

400
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:56,200
陛下
My Lord...

401
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,110
我懇求您
I pray

402
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,510
全英格蘭都懇求您
the whole of England prays

403
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,970
不要再參與馬上比武了
that you will never joust again.

404
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:28,000
你騎在我上面的時候 怎么不干脆閹了我
Why not geld me, while you're at it?

405
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,480
那樣你就順心多了吧 女士
That would suit you, wouldn't it, madam?

406
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:33,250
孩子看起來像是男嬰
The child had the appearance of a male

407
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:35,480
大概在孕期15周
and of about 15 weeks' gestation.

408
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,280
什么叫 "看起來像是男嬰"
What do you mean, "the appearance of?"

409
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,710
我只是重復醫生的話...
I only repeat the words of the doctor...

410
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,850
滾開點 臭娘們 你又沒生過
Oh, get away with you, woman! You've never given birth.

411
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,020
你懂什么
What do you know?

412
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,250
她的床畔本該有侍女守著的
There should've been a matron at her bedside -

413
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,340
但是人呢
but oh, no

414
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:55,720
一有災禍降臨 你們博林家的人就蜂擁而至
you Boleyns must all crowd in, whenever disaster strikes.

415
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:22,280
看來上天不會賜予我小王子
I see that God will not give me male children.

416
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,480
如果一個國王沒有嫡子傳承...
If a king cannot have a son...

417
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,650
如果他不能給國家帶來穩定
If he cannot give stability to his realm...

418
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:42,050
那無論他做的任何事都毫無意義了
..then it doesn't matter what else he can do.

419
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,020
戰爭之勝利...
The victories...

420
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,280
法令之公正...
the just laws...

421
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:56,170
法庭之著名...
..the famous courts...

422
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,320
什么都無用
..nothing.

423
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,540
在我看來...
It seems to me...

424
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:16,050
好像是我自己不清不楚的就促成了這段婚姻
that I was dishonestly led into this marriage.

425
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:26,510
怎么叫不清不楚...
How...dishonestly?

426
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:29,250
我感覺像是被引誘了一般...
It seems to me I was seduced...

427
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,620
或許是...
..practised upon...

428
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,650
或許是魅力嗎
..perhaps with charms?

429
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,940
用魔咒什么的 女人就是會做這樣的事的
With spells? Women do such things.

430
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:46,160
要是果真如此的話
And if that were so...

431
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:50,920
這段婚姻應該無效的 對嗎
..the marriage would be null, wouldn't it?

432
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,960
"國王 送給她一個錢袋
"He sent her a purse - the King.

433
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,970
天知道里面裝了多少錢"
Christ knows how much was in it."

434
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,140
她作何反應
What did she do?

435
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,540
她送還回去了
She sent it back.

436
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,770
隨錢包一起送的信呢
And the letter he sent with it?

437
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,220
她沒有打開
She didn't open it.

438
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,910
但是退還前...
But before she returned it...

439
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,620
她吻了一下信上的火漆印
She kissed the seal.

440
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,940
吻了它
Kissed it!

441
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,220
她可真是聰明啊
What genius possessed her?

442
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:44,280
如今亨利四處談論 "善良賢惠的簡"
Now Henry's walking around, talking about "the virtuous and chaste Jane".

443
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,250
對此你怎么看
What do you say to that?

444
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,170
局勢變了 克倫威爾
The game's changed, Cromwell.

445
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,370
既然安妮又一次流產
Now that Anne has failed again,

446
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,280
亨利很可能會再婚
it's possible that Henry may wish to remarry.

447
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:01,020
只要陛下還與現任王后保持婚姻關系
As long as the King holds by the present Queen,

448
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,960
我也一樣會站在她這邊
I will hold by her, too.

449
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,710
那你就沒考慮過自己的利益嗎
So you have no interest of your own in this?

450
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:10,910
我代表國王的利益
I represent the King's interests.

451
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,000
那是我存在的意義
That's what I'm for.

452
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,280
主教大人
My Lord Bishop,

453
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,570
我聽說你要動身去法國了
I hear you're leaving us for France?

454
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,310
我們會想念你的
We shall miss you.

455
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,800
我去了趟帕特尼...
I went down to Putney...

456
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:40,570
..或者準確地說 我派了個仆從去 知道了一些關于你的事情
..or to be accurate, I sent a servant. I learnt things about you.

457
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,540
你曾殺了一個人
You've killed a man.

458
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,170
又不是在你的轄區內
Not in this jurisdiction.

459
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,250
你可真是劣性不改 斯蒂芬
Do your worst, Stephen.

460
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,480
派你的人四處奔走
Put your men on the road,

461
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,650
花錢打探消息
lay out money,

462
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,940
搜查整個歐洲...
search Europe...

463
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:03,200
你只會發現我所有的技能才干 都是英格蘭所需要的
You'll not find any talent I possess that England cannot use.

464
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,000
那個在帕特尼被你砍的家伙 死了
That lad you knifed in Putney died.

465
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,250
辛虧你逃得早 克倫威爾
You did well to run, Cromwell.

466
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,910
那個家族給你下了圈套
The family had a noose for you.

467
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,880
你的父親...用錢打發了他們
Your father...bought them off.

468
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,820
什么
What?

469
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,910
你看看
You see?

470
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,280
我知道一些連你自己都不知道的事
I know things about your life you don't know yourself.

471
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,540
我打擾你了嗎
I am disturbing you?

472
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,850
尤斯塔斯
Eustache?

473
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,940
不 我剛剛只是在回憶
No, I was just remembering.

474
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,910
請坐下吧
Sit down.

475
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:07,480
紅衣主教大人過去常常告訴人們 我是一個孤兒...
The cardinal used to tell people that I was an orphan...

476
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,000
...或者說...
..or else that...

477
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:16,680
我不知道...我是愛爾蘭人
I don't know... I was Irish.

478
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:20,000
最近剛剛從監獄里逃出來
Recently escaped from prison.

479
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:24,280
他說對別人欺瞞你的過去 才是明智的
He said it was wise to deceive others about your past,

480
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,480
即使壓根沒什么可隱瞞的
even if there was nothing to conceal.

481
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,540
但是我在想...
But I was wondering...

482
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,340
是否有可能是在欺騙自己呢
whether it's possible to deceive oneself.

483
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,280
關于什么
About what?

484
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:43,140
你所信仰的你的人生
Something you believed about your life.

485
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,340
你是誰
Who you are...

486
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,910
是什么
What you are.

487
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,480
你參加了葬禮
You attended the funeral?

488
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,850
我拒絕去了
I refused to.

489
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:00,620
她并沒有以王后之尊下葬
She was not buried as a queen.

490
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,420
我聽說那個姘頭穿了一身黃衣來慶賀凱瑟琳的死
I hear the concubine wore yellow, to celebrate Katherine's death?

491
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:07,770
她認為原配逝去 她的地位就能得到改善
She thought her passing would change her position.

492
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,420
也許會變 但也可能不能如其所愿
So it may, but perhaps not in the way she thinks.

493
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,680
聽說有這么一個"西摩"的女孩
There is talk about this "Semer" girl.

494
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,880
我能見見她嗎
May I meet her?

495
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:23,420
我還以為你只是來陪我的
And here I thought you'd come just for my company.

496
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,510
你提到的這個女士叫"西摩"
The lady you refer to is called "Seymour" -

497
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,620
我很驚訝你竟然會對她感興趣
and I'm surprised you take such an interest.

498
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,570
我原本以為你可能更感興趣
I would have thought you were more interested

499
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,280
亨利要娶哪位法國的公主
in which French princess Henry will marry,

500
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,080
他是否該取消當下的安排呢
should he dissolve his current arrangements.

501
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,820
克倫威爾 你曾告訴我那只是個童話故事
Cremuel, you told me that was a fairy tale!

502
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,450
你曾自稱是我主人的朋友
You have expressed yourself a friend of my master.

503
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:43,370
別告訴我 你現在倒支持與法國的聯姻了嗎
Tell me you won't countenance a French match?

504
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:48,680
我可以影響亨利國王 尤斯塔斯...
I have influence on King Henry, Eustache...

505
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:52,050
..但我不會去控制他的
..but I do not claim to govern him.

506
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,050
為了和亨利相處 你就必須投其所好
To succeed with Henry, you have to anticipate his desires.

507
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,450
接著然后...
But then...

508
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:05,650
..如果他改變心意...
..if he changes his mind...

509
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,720
..你站出來...
..you stand out there...

510
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,570
...揭發他 不
..expose, no?

511
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,820
安娜才是你需要害怕的
It's Anne you should fear.

512
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,510
她是不顧一切的 很危險
She is desperate and dangerous.

513
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,200
先發制人 在她打壓你之前
Strike first, before she strikes you.

514
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:24,170
還記得她是怎么扳倒沃爾西的嗎
Remember how she brought down Wolsey.

515
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,050
也許你應該到宮廷中來做彌撒
Perhaps you should come to mass, at court?

516
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,220
克倫威爾!
Cromwell!

517
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,740
你早知道這種事會發生的
You knew this was going to happen.

518
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,310
回避她這么久
After all this time avoiding her,

519
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:03,820
一直不愿意承認她
avoiding having to acknowledge her...

520
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:06,510
這些事都將會傳到皇帝陛下那去
This will get back to the Emperor.

521
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,850
但愿他能理解吧
Let's hope he will understand.

522
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,540
必須要做個了結的 尤斯塔斯
It had to be done, Eustache.

523
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,540
為什么
Why?

524
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,480
王子并不像常人一般思考
Princes do not think as other men do.

525
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:19,200
如今你承認了他的第二次婚姻
Now you have acknowledged his second marriage.

526
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:21,370
現在只要他愿意
Now, if he likes...

527
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,220
..他會就這樣放手的
..he can let it go.

528
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,970
當博林家的人在他身邊時 可憐的家伙
When the Boleyns closed around him - poor fellow.

529
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,940
他看上去像是被奴隸商人拐走一樣
Looked as if he was being carried off by slavers.

530
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,910
他不知道他將在哪個國家醒過來
He didn't know what country he was going to wake up in.

531
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,020
我也不知道
No more do I.

532
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:48,510
我們去找別人聊聊吧 別管他們了
Let's go - find a crust to gnaw on somewhere - leave them to it.

533
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,110
克倫威爾
Cromwell?

534
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:55,140
我的主人 羅馬皇帝希望您能夠同意
My master the Emperor hopes you will look kindly

535
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,650
瑪麗公主與西班牙聯姻
on a Spanish match for Princess Mary.

536
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:00,280
你太自以為是了吧 沙皮
You presume too much, Chapuys!

537
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,200
別裝作你很了解我的原則 大使
Do not presume to know my policy, ambassador!

538
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:07,420
就像是所謂的討價還價 是嗎
So this was all a bargaining tool, was it?

539
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:12,850
- 陛下... - 你向我的妻子鞠躬 然后現在向我來討債了是嗎
- Your Majesty... - You bow to my wife, then you send me the bill?

540
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:16,850
我并沒有忘記 我是如何幫助你的主人對抗法國的
I have not forgotten how I helped your master against the French.

541
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:19,310
他承諾會給我封地
He promised me territory -

542
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,880
接下來我便得知 他竟然和弗朗索瓦一世簽訂了條約
next thing I hear, he's making a treaty with Francois!

543
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:25,200
皇帝視我為兒戲
The Emperor treats me like an infant!

544
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,570
先舍棄我 又討好我 然后又再次舍棄我
First he whips me, then he pets me, then he whips me again!

545
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,910
告訴他 我不是個無知幼嬰
Well, tell him I am not an infant!

546
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,450
告訴他 不要多管我的私家事
And tell him to keep out of my family business!

547
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:37,020
先是干涉我和誰結婚
First he tells me how I should marry,

548
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,450
現在又想干預我的女兒的婚姻
then he wants to show me how to deal with my own daughter!

549
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:48,570
我要求一個正式 公開的道歉
I demand a profound and public apology!

550
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:59,940
我不知道我應該為了什么而道歉
I don't know what I'm supposed to apologise for!

551
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,540
我是誠心誠意來這里
I come here in good faith,

552
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,450
卻要和那個禽獸面對面
I'm tricked into meeting that creature face to face -

553
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:06,850
然后還要被亨利辱罵
and then I'm attacked by Henry!

554
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:09,650
他想要我的主人 他需要我的主人
He wants my master, he needs my master -

555
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,650
可是他卻玩這樣的花招
and instead, he plays these games!

556
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:12,800
放松 冷靜
Peace, peace.

557
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,250
我們會去道歉的 讓他平靜下來
We will do the apologising. Let him cool down.

558
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:18,850
- 別緊張 我們會繼續商談下去的... - 克倫威爾
- Never fear, we can keep the talks going... - Cromwell!

559
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:26,050
我知道你做了什么
I know what you've done.

560
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,970
這件事情你做的太過火了
You have gone too far in this matter.

561
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,250
你對他保證了 是嗎
You've made him promises, haven't you?

562
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,710
你壓根沒有任何權利做保證
Well, you have no authority!

563
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:37,480
你將我的名譽置于險地
You have put my honour in jeopardy!

564
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:40,400
我在想些什么呢
What did I expect?

565
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:43,480
像你這樣的人 怎么會知道公主的名譽有多重要
What would a man like you know about the honour of princess?

566
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,770
你告訴他 你能把國王玩弄于股掌之間了嗎
You've told him you have the king in your pocket?

567
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,250
不要否認
Don't deny it!

568
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:52,740
你整天像教育自己的孩子一般教育我
You would train me up, like one of your boys -

569
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,020
讓我在你每早下樓是 握帽致禮
have me touch my cap when you come down in the morning

570
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,450
然后和你說 "早安 先生"
and say "How do you, sir?"

571
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,800
我現在還真的相信了
Well, I really believe

572
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:01,480
你覺得自己才是真正的國王
you think you are the King...

573
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,450
而我才是鐵匠之子
and I am the blacksmith's boy!

574
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,050
你說是嗎
Don't you?

575
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,110
是不是
Don't you?

576
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:15,250
愿上帝保佑陛下
God preserve Your Majesty.

577
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,620
現在...
And now...

578
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:21,650
恕我失陪...
will you excuse me?

579
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,080
交叉你的手腕
Cross your wrists.

580
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,800
像這樣
Like this.

581
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:15,370
浸在水里
Get it in the water.

582
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,140
保持交叉的姿勢
Keep your wrists crossed.

583
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,970
能減輕點疼痛
Confuses the pain.

584
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,710
我相信你已經得到了教訓
I trust a lesson has been learnt

585
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:10,570
你生來不是貴族
You are not a gentleman born.

586
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,710
你不該越權干涉你力不能及的事務
You should not meddle in affairs of those set above you.

587
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:19,710
陛下可能會想要見你
His Majesty may be pleased to bring you into his presence...

588
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:24,570
來吧 沃爾西 我們來接你進那個
Come, Wolsey! We're fetching you to Hell,

589
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:28,680
等你作餐的魔王們的地獄里去
where Beelzebub is expecting you to supper!

590
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,850
但你應當永遠銘記
But you should always remember who it was

591
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:34,910
自己的地位 得之于誰
that placed you where he could see you.

592
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:42,970
從現在開始 請記住你是為誰而效忠
From now on, remember who you serve.

593
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,110
我從中 "受益匪淺"
I shall profit from this lesson...

594
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:50,400
我向你保證 先生
I assure you, sir.

595
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,310
那就看你表現
See you do.

596
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,920
所以...
And so...

597
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,280
陛下 如果您覺得滿意...
Majesty, if it please you...

598
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,800
懇求您慎重考慮一下...
Look favourably on the Emperor's overtures...

599
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,080
羅馬皇帝的提議
..we beg you.

600
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,200
為了國家和聯邦考慮一下
For the sake of the realm and the commonweal.

601
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:29,040
如果真是為了聯邦著想的話 我...
Well, if it's for the good of the commonweal, I...

602
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:33,240
那我確實應該和沙皮去談判協商
I shall begin negotiations with Chapuys.

603
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:37,600
我猜我得對身邊所有的人都忍辱屈尊才行
I suppose I must swallow any personal insults I have received.

604
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,840
其他的事先暫不考慮
Other topics will not be open for discussion.

605
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:48,050
羅馬皇帝同自己的議員們 談論了瑪麗的事
The Emperor has discussed Mary with his own councillors.

606
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:51,840
他希望她嫁給他的親戚
He'd like her married to his own relatives.

607
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,680
除非她的言行舉止讓我無法忍受
I will in no wise suffer her to leave this country,

608
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:58,920
否則我絕不讓她離開英國受苦
until her behaviour to me is as it should be.

609
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:02,080
于我而言...
Myself...

610
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,960
我提議在國內為她選婿
I'd go up-country -

611
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:05,840
但如果她不同意
and if she would not sign the oath,

612
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:09,480
那我會好好的教育她 直到她順從屈服
I'd beat her head against the wall, till it were soft as a baked apple.

613
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:12,120
多謝 諾爾福克閣下
Thank you for that, my Lord Norfolk.

614
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:15,280
她仍沉浸在她母親的去世之殤中
Her mother's death is still raw with her.

615
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,680
我相信她會在接下來的幾周里
I have no doubt that she will see her duty,

616
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:20,560
意識到自己肩負的責任
in these next weeks.

617
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,170
挺開心終于聽到你說話了 克倫威爾
How pleasing to hear from you at last, Cromwell.

618
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:28,000
我猜你今天的緘默
Are we to assume that this new-found reticence of yours

619
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:30,000
是與昨天的事有關
relates to yesterday's events?

620
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:31,920
如果我沒記錯的話
When His Majesty, if I do recall correctly,

621
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:34,320
就是陛下揭露你野心的那件事
administered a check to your ambition?

622
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:38,740
再次感謝 威爾特閣下
Thank you again, My Lord Wiltshire.

623
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:40,880
瑪麗不會遠嫁異國的
There will be no foreign match for Mary.

624
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,520
務須多言
That is final.

625
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,280
陪我走走可好
Will you walk with me?

626
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:09,680
希望有一天我們能去草原上走走
I wish we would go down to the weald one day -

627
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,160
跟技藝高超的鐵匠們聊聊
talk to the ironmasters.

628
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:18,800
我有很多圖紙 數理圖紙 還有很多建議規劃...
I've had various drawings - mathematical drawings and advices...

629
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:23,140
一起探討如何改進我們的武器裝備 但我...
..concerning how our ordnance can be improved, but I...

630
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,000
我不能...
I can't...

631
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:28,440
我無法做到像你一般出色
I can't make as much of it as you would.

632
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,400
因為...
It's because...

633
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:38,680
嗯...
Well...

634
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,720
因為你是我的左膀右臂 閣下
Because you are my right hand, sir.

635
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,240
那么 還要不要一起繼續走走
So, shall we go down?

636
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,600
就咱倆 一起去看看那些鍋爐可好
You and I, meet the charcoal burners?

637
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,680
當然
Of course.

638
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,000
但今夏就算了 陛下
But not this summer, sir.

639
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:19,160
我覺得你最近實在是太忙了
I think you will be too busy.

640
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:21,840
是啊
Yeah.

641
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,440
我不能再像以前那樣頹廢生活了 克倫威爾
I cannot live as I have lived, Cromwell.

642
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,080
你必須得幫我從安妮的魔爪中...
You must free me from this...

643
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,650
解脫出去
..from Anne.

644
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:49,400
可能她跟哈里 珀西...
Perhaps she and Harry Percy...

645
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,400
他倆關系好的就像夫妻一樣 不是么
They were good as married, weren't they?

646
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:00,360
如果那不能奏效的話 你知道我...
And if that won't run, you know I was...

647
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,510
我曾偶爾和安妮的姐姐 瑪麗 相處...
I was, on occasion, with Anne's sister, Mary?

648
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:14,450
可能走的確實是近了點...
Perhaps having been with kin so near...

649
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,400
不管怎樣...
Anyway...

650
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,600
我相信你的判斷力和能力
I trust in your discretion and your skill.

651
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:27,720
務必秘密行事
Be very secret.

652
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:44,510
西摩小姐的雙手可真是小巧玲瓏
Does not Mistress Seymour have the tiniest hands?

653
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,120
"她有沒有一雙小巧的手"
"Doesn't she have the tiniest hands?"

654
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,480
"她有沒有最白皙的脖頸"
"Does she not have the whitest throat?"

655
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:08,000
她有沒有最濕滑的陰道
Has she not the wettest cunt you've ever groped?

656
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,400
夠了夠了
That's enough.

657
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,560
周圍可是有克倫威爾的眼線耳目的
Cromwell's spy is about.

658
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,800
他們在非議王后
They talk about the Queen.

659
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,720
他們是誰
They?

660
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:28,120
威斯頓 布里頓
Weston, Brereton...

661
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,120
諾里斯也時不時插嘴
sometimes Norris.

662
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:36,080
繼續說
Go on.

663
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,540
王后需要盡快再懷上個孩子
The Queen needs to conceive another child, quickly.

664
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:49,880
可他們卻說 亨利他 "不行"
And they say that Henry cannot be trusted to do the deed, so...

665
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:53,650
他們得"幫幫"他
one of them has to step in and do him a favour.

666
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:58,640
他們討論出什么結論沒
Do they come to any conclusion?

667
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,450
他們只是說說而已的吧 不會做什么的
They wouldn't really do it - none of them. It's just talk.

668
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,560
那到底有沒有討論出結果
So do they come to any conclusion?

669
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,280
我覺得他們都是各執己詞的
I think it's every man for himself.

670
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:18,000
我相信你說得對
Well, I'm sure you're right.

671
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:21,880
聽起來像是說大話
Sounds like idle talk.

672
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:28,050
我想你聽的這些話都不一定能派上用場
I don't think it will be necessary to use this...

673
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,480
不過還是謝謝你 拉夫
..but thank you, Rafe.

674
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,760
問題關鍵是 托馬斯...
Trouble is, Thomas...

675
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,960
國王想另娶新歡
The King wants a new wife.

676
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,640
就給他再找一個吧
Fix him one.

677
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,560
我當初沒能如他愿

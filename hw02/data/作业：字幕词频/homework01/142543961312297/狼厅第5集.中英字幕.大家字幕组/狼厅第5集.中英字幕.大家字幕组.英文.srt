1
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,090
Sir John.

2
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,250
Your Majesty. Welcome.

3
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,320
I lost my hat, riding here.

4
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,750
It's never too late.

5
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,800
You should marry again, have another family.

6
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,960
Perhaps you'll find a bride, while you're here with us.

7
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,300
Francis Weston...

8
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,780
I believe your gentlemanly touch is required.

9
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,880
Perhaps we should make a noise,

10
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,450
to wake him naturally?

11
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,960
Someone laugh?

12
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,910
Yes, do that, Tom.

13
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,780
I wasn't asleep.

14
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,820
Just resting my eyes.

15
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,830
This is no time to be shy.

16
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,680
Tell Cromwell what Henry asked you.

17
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,030
He asked me if I would look kindly on him.

18
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,260
If he wrote me a poem, for instance.

19
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,000
I said I would.

20
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,320
Good.

21
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,420
But if he attempts anything on your person...

22
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,250
..scream.

23
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,840
What if nobody comes?

24
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,480
Don't scream.

25
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,820
Pray...

26
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,080
out loud.

27
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,630
Something that will appeal to His Majesty's piety

28
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,850
and sense of honour.

29
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,840
I'll get my prayer book.

30
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,210
I'm sure I can find something that will fit the bill.

31
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,630
Thomas Cromwell, Secretary to the King.

32
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,610
Show your colours!

33
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,040
Tell him to let us in, before I show his arse my boot.

34
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,290
Well...

35
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,060
..how do I look?

36
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,780
That's why he sent you, isn't it?

37
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,090
To see if I really am dying?

38
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,750
He used to call me his flower.

39
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,080
When my first son was born, it was winter.

40
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,590
There were no blooms to be had.

41
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,750
He gave me six dozen roses...

42
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,090
..made of the purest white silk.

43
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,080
Over the years, I have given them to those who have done me some service.

44
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,640
Will...

45
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,160
Will you let the Princess Mary visit me?

46
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,520
What harm can it do the King?

47
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,520
Chapuys has written to the lady Mary,

48
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,190
saying that he can get her out of the country.

49
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,200
Never!

50
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,470
I answer for it with my life.

51
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,680
What does Henry imagine?

52
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,210
Mary, returning with an army,

53
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,450
turning him out of his Kingdom?

54
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,100
It's laughable.

55
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,120
I answer for her intentions with my own person.

56
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,970
Your own person has a lot to do, madam -

57
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,160
guaranteeing this, answering for that.

58
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,800
You can only die once.

59
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,130
And when I do...

60
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,000
..I will set Henry an example,

61
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,790
for when his own time comes.

62
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,200
Do you think about the King's death a lot?

63
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,960
I think about his afterlife.

64
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,920
How is Boleyn's daughter?

65
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,740
She lost the child, I am told.

66
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,030
I know how that is.

67
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,930
She and the King have hopes of another child, soon.

68
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,360
Particular hope,

69
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,170
or general hope?

70
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,260
My thoughts always confided in you.

71
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,450
I do hope there is no rift.

72
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,500
Well? Is she?

73
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,320
She's said nothing, still?

74
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,510
Of course, the wise woman says nothing

75
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,240
until she feels the quickening.

76
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,670
Yes.

77
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,960
She's been wrong before...

78
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,550
..but, yes.

79
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,100
Does the King know?

80
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,230
You should tell him. He might knight you on the spot.

81
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,320
I suppose it's to be expected.

82
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:16,060
She was with the King for much of the summer

83
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,100
and when he wasn't with her, he would write her love letters

84
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,160
and sent them by the hand of Harry Norris.

85
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,790
My lady, I must leave you.

86
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,000
And you were usually such a good listener.

87
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,230
The window was open.

88
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,180
He was such an innocent...

89
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,170
What kind of monster would do such a thing?

90
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,130
Perhaps he got up on the ledge somehow and...

91
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,320
then his paws slipped.

92
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,420
- Paws slipped? Paws slipped? - Oh, get away, Mary!

93
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,400
Oh, yes -

94
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,000
I've re-baptised my fool.

95
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,650
Well...

96
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,880
the King's daughter is almost a dwarf, isn't she?

97
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,100
The French will have a shock if they ever see her.

98
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,900
- They'll have a shock.- Yes.

99
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,080
I know they're trying for a match between her and the Dauphin.

100
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,750
While my own daughter...

101
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,840
I told you to go to France and negotiate her marriage.

102
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,330
- But you said you were ill...- I was ill.

103
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,740
You're never ill

104
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,000
unless you want to be.

105
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,280
And now the French laugh behind my back.

106
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,990
The French never intended a match.

107
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,240
It's as if my daughter had never been born.

108
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,960
As if Katherine was still Queen.

109
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,920
As if I didn't exist.

110
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,040
I won't let them make a royal match for Mary.

111
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,320
I want you to visit her.

112
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,160
Take one of your handsome young men with you.

113
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,770
She's never had a compliment in her life -

114
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,230
it shouldn't be hard to seduce her.

115
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,280
You want me to compromise her?

116
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,050
Do it yourself, if you want.

117
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,380
I heard she liked you.

118
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,740
All that's needed is for her to make a fool of herself in public,

119
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,400
so she loses her reputation.

120
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,900
No.

121
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,380
No? No?

122
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,520
What?

123
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,430
That's not my aim.

124
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,880
Those are not my methods.

125
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,510
I know you're talking to the Seymours.

126
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,000
You think it's a secret,

127
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,500
but nothing is secret from me.

128
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,120
I can't believe you'd put your money on such a bad risk.

129
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,160
There was a time, madam, that you would listen to my advice.

130
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,650
Let me advise you now.

131
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,200
Drop your plans and schemes.

132
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,160
Put down the burden of them.

133
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,660
Keep yourself in quietness, until your child is born.

134
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,240
For Jane...

135
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,810
..she's a distraction, that's all.

136
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,600
Let it run its course.

137
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,290
- Pretend that you don't even see her... - He'll never abandon me.

138
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,540
Never.

139
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,020
Since my coronation, there is a new England

140
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,910
and it can't subsist without me.

141
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,540
I'm warning you...

142
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,620
..make terms with me, Cremuel...

143
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,340
..before my child is born.

144
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,440
I hear you're going to put all the nuns and monks out on the road.

145
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,730
Monsieur Chapuys,

146
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,910
wherever my commissioners go,

147
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,960
they meet monks and nuns who come to them, begging for their liberty -

148
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,110
and after the scandals I've heard, I'm not surprised.

149
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:32,240
Monks selling broken meats from the Last Supper to the poor.

150
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,410
Young novices being visited in their beds by older monks.

151
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,690
They claim they're living the "vita apostolica",

152
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,230
but you didn't find the apostles

153
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,080
feeling each other's bollocks, did you?

154
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,440
Tell your master I mean good religion to increase, not wither.

155
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,970
I won't tell my master lies, if I tell him what I see.

156
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,870
I see discontent.

157
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,200
I see famine, before the spring.

158
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:00,000
You're buying corn from the territories of the Emperor.

159
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,620
This trade could be stopped.

160
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,920
What could your master possibly gain, by starving my countrymen?

161
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,770
He would gain this - he would see how evilly they are governed!

162
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,720
Henry begins by mocking the Pope

163
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,850
he will end up embracing...

164
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,640
..the devil.

165
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,540
Eustache...

166
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,840
..what's happened?

167
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,400
What is this?

168
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,570
I have news from Kimbolton.

169
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,540
Queen Katherine...

170
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:56,060
She has only one or two days to live and I don't want her to...

171
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,920
Thomas, I don't want her to die alone,

172
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,790
without anyone who loves her.

173
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,120
And I'm afraid the King won't let me go.

174
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,030
Will you let me go?

175
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,320
It would be a kindness

176
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,200
to let her have a visit from Ambassador Chapuys.

177
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
Why?

178
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,840
So he can intrigue with her more conveniently?

179
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:29,000
Her doctors suggest, Madam, that she will very soon be in her grave.

180
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,630
She'd fly out of it, shroud flapping,

181
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,900
if she thought she could cause me trouble.

182
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,890
Your Majesty, the Emperor may be a fond nephew,

183
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,540
but he won't keep up the quarrel for a dead woman.

184
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,480
This could mean the end to the threat of war - a new era.

185
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,040
Ambassador Chapuys...

186
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,280
Ambassador Chapuys...

187
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,400
has never acknowledged my wife as Queen.

188
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,720
Until he is prepared to bow before her, publicly,

189
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,240
there will be no diplomacy with that man.

190
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,460
At last, God!

191
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,160
Not before time!

192
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,080
She's very much looking forward to seeing her younger brother

193
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,420
aren't you, dumpling?

194
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,300
And I share her impatience.

195
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,000
It has been a long enough wait.

196
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,860
I suppose we must expect the country to mourn for her.

197
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,030
She was once given the title of "Queen".

198
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,790
Mistakenly.

199
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,640
Majesty,

200
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,990
do you wish the body brought to St Paul's?

201
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,100
We will lay her to rest in Peterborough.

202
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,880
It will cost less.

203
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,050
She sent me a letter.

204
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,320
I don't want it.

205
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,380
Get rid of it, will you?

206
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,730
Richard Rich says the King wants Katherine's plate and furs.

207
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,120
Rich had to point out that if she was never, in fact, his wife,

208
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,560
he has no right to her property.

209
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,020
Oh, he'll have the furs.

210
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,900
"I commend unto you our daughter, Mary...

211
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,870
..beseeching you to be a good father to her...

212
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,220
..and lastly,

213
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,600
I make this vow...

214
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,600
..that mine eyes desire you, above all things."

215
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,140
If I'd been with you,

216
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,840
I could have put you out of danger.

217
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,960
I'd have beat it with a... with a blanket.

218
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,100
Oh, thank goodness that you...

219
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,280
If I'd been here...

220
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,400
Leave it!

221
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,120
Peace, my husband,

222
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,620
I am not harmed.

223
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:48,910
My Lady.

224
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,680
Let me drink this.

225
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,080
This was a good piece...

226
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,170
Yes, what is it?

227
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:58,050
Water must be kept at hand

228
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,770
and a woman appoin ted on every rota,

229
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,880
to check that all the lights are being extinguished.

230
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,400
I can't imagine how this could have happened.

231
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,220
First, this is a household matter and not within your remit.

232
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,310
Second, she was in no danger.

233
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,540
Third, I don't know who lit the candle.

234
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,800
Four, if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

235
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,770
Five, no-one will tell you either.

236
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,880
If, as it may happen,

237
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,370
some person visits the Queen after the lights are out...

238
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,250
..then it is an event over which we should draw a veil.

239
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,800
Some person?

240
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:40,280
Some person, for the purposes of arson?

241
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,680
Or the purposes of something else?

242
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,220
Lady Rochford...

243
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:57,080
Jane, when the time comes to unburden your conscience,

244
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,570
don't go to a priest.

245
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,050
He'll give you penance.

246
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,820
I'll give you a reward.

247
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:17,820
How much does the lordship of Ripon bring in to the Archbishop?

248
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,110
How much does Southwell bring in?

249
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,800
Ha? I thought it would be more.

250
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,510
Majesty...

251
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:39,080
..in the tournament, today?

252
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,620
If you should run against my son, Gregory,

253
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,370
will you forbear to unhorse him...

254
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,820
..if you can help it?

255
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,510
We can't help what we do, really.

256
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:55,720
When you're thundering down at a man, you can't check.

257
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,250
It's a very rare event, you know, Crom...

258
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,240
..to bring down your opponent.

259
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,080
If you're concerned about what showing he'll make, you needn't be.

260
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,250
He's very able.

261
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:26,110
I don't really mind what showing he makes.

262
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,420
I just don't want him to be...

263
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,200
flattened.

264
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:07,360
You can't come.

265
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,020
Rafe is back.

266
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,340
I have to talk to him about some abbeys he's been surveying.

267
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,050
And there's my papers...

268
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,910
Richard will be here, to represent me.

269
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,880
It's my first joust.

270
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:37,820
The Vatican has given Henry three months to return to obedience,

271
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,450
or the bull of excommunication against him

272
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,850
will be distributed through Europe.

273
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,280
The Emperor's fleet is set for Algiers

274
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:49,370
with 40,000 armed men.

275
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,540
The Abbot of Fountains

276
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,570
has been systematically robbing his own treasury,

277
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,080
parliament opens in a fortnight.

278
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,050
The King says you're a credit to my house.

279
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,000
And you are.

280
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,570
Some years ago, before you were born,

281
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,940
I met an old Portuguese knight in Venice - one of those men

282
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,220
who made a career of riding to tournaments, throughout Europe.

283
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,140
I don't know... For what it's worth...

284
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,970
He said the secret to jousting was to sit easily in your saddle,

285
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,370
like you're going out to take some air.

286
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,800
Carry your lance loose, until the very last moment

287
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,200
and above all else...

288
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,050
..defeat your instincts to...

289
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,880
..survive.

290
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,820
Well, you're ready.

291
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,340
You look good.

292
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,200
Thank you.

293
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,820
Present.

294
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,020
You have to guess.

295
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,880
St Appollonia's teeth?

296
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,480
No.

297
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,170
Teeth from the comb of Mary Magdalene?

298
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,910
St Edmund's nail parings.

299
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,570
Tip them in with the rest.

300
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:39,310
The man must have had 500 fingers.

301
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,480
What else?

302
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:49,250
The prior at Maiden Bradley claims he has a licence, under papal seal,

303
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,480
allowing him to keep a whore.

304
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,200
Westminster Abbey bought the bones of a dead elephant.

305
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:58,340
Now, tell me what they wanted with...

306
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,970
Gregory?

307
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:07,020
It's the King, it's... it's Henry.

308
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,370
He's dead.

309
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,710
The tournament hadn't begun.

310
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,080
The King was running towards the ring and the horse just went down.

311
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,000
No-one was near him, no-one to blame.

312
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,940
Master, if this is true...

313
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,800
If he is dead...

314
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,710
Should we escape now, before they block the ports?

315
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,570
Fetch Fitzwilliam.

316
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,760
Move, move!

317
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,920
Move! Move!

318
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:10,000
- Fetch a mirror to his lips. - It was tried.

319
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,400
What do you mean, leaving him lying here,

320
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,680
untouched by Christian hands?!

321
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,420
By God, Cromwell - you're a dead man!

322
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:22,110
My Lord Norfolk, My Lord Norfolk! Where is the Queen?

323
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,310
On the floor.

324
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,200
I told her myself.

325
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,850
My place to do it.

326
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,800
She warned you to be obedient.

327
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,740
And now she's Regent, your days are finished!

328
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,880
No, no, no!

329
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,110
No woman with big belly as Regent.

330
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,770
Me! Me!

331
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,280
- Gregory!  - We've brought the Master Treasurer.

332
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,050
Thank you, thank you.

333
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,310
The Princess Mary - if she falls into Boleyn hands, she's dead.

334
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,820
We have to get up-country before this news does.

335
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,770
Go, Fitzwilliam. Go quickly.

336
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,850
Mary's keepers are Boleyns. What if they won't yield her?

337
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,140
Well, then she's dead.

338
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,540
We let her fall into the hands of the papists,

339
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,310
they'll set her up as Queen - and I'm dead.

340
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,020
There'll be civil war.

341
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,050
I don't know...

342
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,450
A woman cannot rule, Cromwell! A woman cannot rule!

343
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,200
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

344
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,400
The King's breathing, the King's breathing!

345
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,640
Long live the King!

346
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:27,040
Come on, come on.

347
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,510
Come on, come on.

348
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,170
Come on... There you are, there you are!

349
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,820
There you are! Do you see me? That's it, that's it.

350
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,370
Get back, move away. Let him breathe!

351
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,880
Let him breathe, let him breathe.

352
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,650
How many men can say,

353
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,510
"My only friend is the King of England?"

354
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,080
You'd think I have everything...

355
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,740
..but take Henry away...

356
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,480
I don't know, Crom.

357
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,160
You're not without support, you know?

358
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,200
Forgive my scepticism.

359
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,510
I mean, you would have support...

360
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,940
..should you need it, against the Boleyns.

361
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:34,680
Well, why should I need that?

362
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,480
The Queen and I are perfect friends.

363
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,960
Forgive my scepticism.

364
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,880
This support...?

365
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:59,940
Sir Nicholas Carew says he thinks...

366
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,110
you're an easy fellow to get on with.

367
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,880
Does he?

368
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,540
Perhaps...

369
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,250
Perhaps you should dine with him?

370
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:17,020
What would have happened, Crom...

371
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,940
if the king had not recovered?

372
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:22,570
Anne would have all, to rule herself.

373
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,620
Though she'd have a fight with her Uncle Norfolk.

374
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,650
Between the two of them, which one would I back?

375
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:34,570
The lady, I think.

376
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:38,800
Let the lady be Regent

377
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,800
and the Boleyns will walk on our backs.

378
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,620
And your head will be on a spike.

379
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,570
But of course, that will come to pass anyway...

380
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,220
if she gives Henry a son.

381
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:56,200
My Lord...

382
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,110
I pray

383
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,510
the whole of England prays

384
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,970
that you will never joust again.

385
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:28,000
Why not geld me, while you're at it?

386
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,480
That would suit you, wouldn't it, madam?

387
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:33,250
The child had the appearance of a male

388
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:35,480
and of about 15 weeks' gestation.

389
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,280
What do you mean, "the appearance of?"

390
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,710
I only repeat the words of the doctor...

391
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,850
Oh, get away with you, woman! You've never given birth.

392
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,020
What do you know?

393
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,250
There should've been a matron at her bedside -

394
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,340
but oh, no

395
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:55,720
you Boleyns must all crowd in, whenever disaster strikes.

396
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:22,280
I see that God will not give me male children.

397
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,480
If a king cannot have a son...

398
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,650
If he cannot give stability to his realm...

399
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:42,050
..then it doesn't matter what else he can do.

400
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,020
The victories...

401
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,280
the just laws...

402
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:56,170
..the famous courts...

403
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,320
..nothing.

404
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,540
It seems to me...

405
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:16,050
that I was dishonestly led into this marriage.

406
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:26,510
How...dishonestly?

407
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:29,250
It seems to me I was seduced...

408
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,620
..practised upon...

409
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,650
..perhaps with charms?

410
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,940
With spells? Women do such things.

411
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:46,160
And if that were so...

412
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:50,920
..the marriage would be null, wouldn't it?

413
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,960
"He sent her a purse - the King.

414
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,970
Christ knows how much was in it."

415
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,140
What did she do?

416
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,540
She sent it back.

417
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,770
And the letter he sent with it?

418
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,220
She didn't open it.

419
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,910
But before she returned it...

420
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,620
She kissed the seal.

421
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,940
Kissed it!

422
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,220
What genius possessed her?

423
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:44,280
Now Henry's walking around, talking about "the virtuous and chaste Jane".

424
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,250
What do you say to that?

425
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,170
The game's changed, Cromwell.

426
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,370
Now that Anne has failed again,

427
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,280
it's possible that Henry may wish to remarry.

428
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:01,020
As long as the King holds by the present Queen,

429
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,960
I will hold by her, too.

430
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,710
So you have no interest of your own in this?

431
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:10,910
I represent the King's interests.

432
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,000
That's what I'm for.

433
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,280
My Lord Bishop,

434
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,570
I hear you're leaving us for France?

435
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,310
We shall miss you.

436
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,800
I went down to Putney...

437
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:40,570
..or to be accurate, I sent a servant. I learnt things about you.

438
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,540
You've killed a man.

439
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,170
Not in this jurisdiction.

440
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,250
Do your worst, Stephen.

441
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,480
Put your men on the road,

442
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,650
lay out money,

443
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,940
search Europe...

444
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:03,200
You'll not find any talent I possess that England cannot use.

445
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,000
That lad you knifed in Putney died.

446
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,250
You did well to run, Cromwell.

447
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,910
The family had a noose for you.

448
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,880
Your father...bought them off.

449
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,820
What?

450
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,910
You see?

451
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,280
I know things about your life you don't know yourself.

452
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,540
I am disturbing you?

453
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,850
Eustache?

454
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,940
No, I was just remembering.

455
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,910
Sit down.

456
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:07,480
The cardinal used to tell people that I was an orphan...

457
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,000
..or else that...

458
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:16,680
I don't know... I was Irish.

459
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:20,000
Recently escaped from prison.

460
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:24,280
He said it was wise to deceive others about your past,

461
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,480
even if there was nothing to conceal.

462
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,540
But I was wondering...

463
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,340
whether it's possible to deceive oneself.

464
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,280
About what?

465
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:43,140
Something you believed about your life.

466
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,340
Who you are...

467
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,910
What you are.

468
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,480
You attended the funeral?

469
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,850
I refused to.

470
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:00,620
She was not buried as a queen.

471
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,420
I hear the concubine wore yellow, to celebrate Katherine's death?

472
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:07,770
She thought her passing would change her position.

473
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,420
So it may, but perhaps not in the way she thinks.

474
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,680
There is talk about this "Semer" girl.

475
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,880
May I meet her?

476
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:23,420
And here I thought you'd come just for my company.

477
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,510
The lady you refer to is called "Seymour" -

478
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,620
and I'm surprised you take such an interest.

479
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,570
I would have thought you were more interested

480
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,280
in which French princess Henry will marry,

481
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,080
should he dissolve his current arrangements.

482
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,820
Cremuel, you told me that was a fairy tale!

483
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,450
You have expressed yourself a friend of my master.

484
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:43,370
Tell me you won't countenance a French match?

485
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:48,680
I have influence on King Henry, Eustache...

486
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:52,050
..but I do not claim to govern him.

487
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,050
To succeed with Henry, you have to anticipate his desires.

488
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,450
But then...

489
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:05,650
..if he changes his mind...

490
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,720
..you stand out there...

491
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,570
..expose, no?

492
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,820
It's Anne you should fear.

493
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,510
She is desperate and dangerous.

494
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,200
Strike first, before she strikes you.

495
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:24,170
Remember how she brought down Wolsey.

496
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,050
Perhaps you should come to mass, at court?

497
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,220
Cromwell!

498
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,740
You knew this was going to happen.

499
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,310
After all this time avoiding her,

500
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:03,820
avoiding having to acknowledge her...

501
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:06,510
This will get back to the Emperor.

502
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,850
Let's hope he will understand.

503
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,540
It had to be done, Eustache.

504
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,540
Why?

505
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,480
Princes do not think as other men do.

506
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:19,200
Now you have acknowledged his second marriage.

507
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:21,370
Now, if he likes...

508
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,220
..he can let it go.

509
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,970
When the Boleyns closed around him - poor fellow.

510
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,940
Looked as if he was being carried off by slavers.

511
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,910
He didn't know what country he was going to wake up in.

512
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,020
No more do I.

513
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:48,510
Let's go - find a crust to gnaw on somewhere - leave them to it.

514
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,110
Cromwell?

515
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:55,140
My master the Emperor hopes you will look kindly

516
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,650
on a Spanish match for Princess Mary.

517
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:00,280
You presume too much, Chapuys!

518
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,200
Do not presume to know my policy, ambassador!

519
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:07,420
So this was all a bargaining tool, was it?

520
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:12,850
- Your Majesty... - You bow to my wife, then you send me the bill?

521
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:16,850
I have not forgotten how I helped your master against the French.

522
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:19,310
He promised me territory -

523
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,880
next thing I hear, he's making a treaty with Francois!

524
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:25,200
The Emperor treats me like an infant!

525
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,570
First he whips me, then he pets me, then he whips me again!

526
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,910
Well, tell him I am not an infant!

527
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,450
And tell him to keep out of my family business!

528
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:37,020
First he tells me how I should marry,

529
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,450
then he wants to show me how to deal with my own daughter!

530
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:48,570
I demand a profound and public apology!

531
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:59,940
I don't know what I'm supposed to apologise for!

532
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,540
I come here in good faith,

533
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,450
I'm tricked into meeting that creature face to face -

534
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:06,850
and then I'm attacked by Henry!

535
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:09,650
He wants my master, he needs my master -

536
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,650
and instead, he plays these games!

537
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:12,800
Peace, peace.

538
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,250
We will do the apologising. Let him cool down.

539
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:18,850
- Never fear, we can keep the talks going... - Cromwell!

540
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:26,050
I know what you've done.

541
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,970
You have gone too far in this matter.

542
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,250
You've made him promises, haven't you?

543
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,710
Well, you have no authority!

544
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:37,480
You have put my honour in jeopardy!

545
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:40,400
What did I expect?

546
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:43,480
What would a man like you know about the honour of princess?

547
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,770
You've told him you have the king in your pocket?

548
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,250
Don't deny it!

549
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:52,740
You would train me up, like one of your boys -

550
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,020
have me touch my cap when you come down in the morning

551
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,450
and say "How do you, sir?"

552
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,800
Well, I really believe

553
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:01,480
you think you are the King...

554
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,450
and I am the blacksmith's boy!

555
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,050
Don't you?

556
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,110
Don't you?

557
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:15,250
God preserve Your Majesty.

558
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,620
And now...

559
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:21,650
will you excuse me?

560
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,080
Cross your wrists.

561
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,800
Like this.

562
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:15,370
Get it in the water.

563
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,140
Keep your wrists crossed.

564
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,970
Confuses the pain.

565
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,710
I trust a lesson has been learnt

566
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:10,570
You are not a gentleman born.

567
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,710
You should not meddle in affairs of those set above you.

568
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:19,710
His Majesty may be pleased to bring you into his presence...

569
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:24,570
Come, Wolsey! We're fetching you to Hell,

570
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:28,680
where Beelzebub is expecting you to supper!

571
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,850
But you should always remember who it was

572
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:34,910
that placed you where he could see you.

573
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:42,970
From now on, remember who you serve.

574
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,110
I shall profit from this lesson...

575
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:50,400
I assure you, sir.

576
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,310
See you do.

577
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,920
And so...

578
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,280
Majesty, if it please you...

579
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,800
Look favourably on the Emperor's overtures...

580
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,080
..we beg you.

581
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,200
For the sake of the realm and the commonweal.

582
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:29,040
Well, if it's for the good of the commonweal, I...

583
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:33,240
I shall begin negotiations with Chapuys.

584
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:37,600
I suppose I must swallow any personal insults I have received.

585
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,840
Other topics will not be open for discussion.

586
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:48,050
The Emperor has discussed Mary with his own councillors.

587
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:51,840
He'd like her married to his own relatives.

588
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,680
I will in no wise suffer her to leave this country,

589
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:58,920
until her behaviour to me is as it should be.

590
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:02,080
Myself...

591
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,960
I'd go up-country -

592
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:05,840
and if she would not sign the oath,

593
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:09,480
I'd beat her head against the wall, till it were soft as a baked apple.

594
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:12,120
Thank you for that, my Lord Norfolk.

595
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:15,280
Her mother's death is still raw with her.

596
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,680
I have no doubt that she will see her duty,

597
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:20,560
in these next weeks.

598
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,170
How pleasing to hear from you at last, Cromwell.

599
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:28,000
Are we to assume that this new-found reticence of yours

600
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:30,000
relates to yesterday's events?

601
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:31,920
When His Majesty, if I do recall correctly,

602
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:34,320
administered a check to your ambition?

603
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:38,740
Thank you again, My Lord Wiltshire.

604
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:40,880
There will be no foreign match for Mary.

605
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,520
That is final.

606
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,280
Will you walk with me?

607
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:09,680
I wish we would go down to the weald one day -

608
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,160
talk to the ironmasters.

609
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:18,800
I've had various drawings - mathematical drawings and advices...

610
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:23,140
..concerning how our ordnance can be improved, but I...

611
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,000
I can't...

612
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:28,440
I can't make as much of it as you would.

613
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,400
It's because...

614
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:38,680
Well...

615
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,720
Because you are my right hand, sir.

616
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,240
So, shall we go down?

617
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,600
You and I, meet the charcoal burners?

618
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,680
Of course.

619
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,000
But not this summer, sir.

620
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:19,160
I think you will be too busy.

621
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:21,840
Yeah.

622
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,440
I cannot live as I have lived, Cromwell.

623
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,080
You must free me from this...

624
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,650
..from Anne.

625
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:49,400
Perhaps she and Harry Percy...

626
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,400
They were good as married, weren't they?

627
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:00,360
And if that won't run, you know I was...

628
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,510
I was, on occasion, with Anne's sister, Mary?

629
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:14,450
Perhaps having been with kin so near...

630
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,400
Anyway...

631
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,600
I trust in your discretion and your skill.

632
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:27,720
Be very secret.

633
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:44,510
Does not Mistress Seymour have the tiniest hands?

634
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,120
"Doesn't she have the tiniest hands?"

635
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,480
"Does she not have the whitest throat?"

636
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:08,000
Has she not the wettest cunt you've ever groped?

637
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,400
That's enough.

638
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,560
Cromwell's spy is about.

639
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,800
They talk about the Queen.

640
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,720
They?

641
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:28,120
Weston, Brereton...

642
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,120
sometimes Norris.

643
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:36,080
Go on.

644
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,540
The Queen needs to conceive another child, quickly.

645
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:49,880
And they say that Henry cannot be trusted to do the deed, so...

646
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:53,650
one of them has to step in and do him a favour.

647
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:58,640
Do they come to any conclusion?

648
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,450
They wouldn't really do it - none of them. It's just talk.

649
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,560
So do they come to any conclusion?

650
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,280
I think it's every man for himself.

651
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:18,000
Well, I'm sure you're right.

652
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:21,880
Sounds like idle talk.

653
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:28,050
I don't think it will be necessary to use this...

654
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,480
..but thank you, Rafe.

655
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,760
Trouble is, Thomas...

656
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,960
The King wants a new wife.

657
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,640
Fix him one.

658
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,560
I didn't...

659
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:09,600
..and now I'm dead.

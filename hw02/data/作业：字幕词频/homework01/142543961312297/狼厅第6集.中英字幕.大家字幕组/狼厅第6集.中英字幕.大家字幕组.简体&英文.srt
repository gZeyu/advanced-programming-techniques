公元1536年 亨利八世对安妮・博林由爱转恨再到不信任 
他现在的注意力都移到了简・西摩的身上
亨利暗授克伦威尔助他摆脱他那位第二任王后

8
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:16,400
随着安妮的失宠 
她的敌人们逐渐聚集

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,720
真该死 我们什么时候能开餐 克伦威尔
Damn! When are we going to eat, Cromwell?

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,630
我要饿晕了
I'm famished!

11
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,800
狼・厅

12
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,800
第1季 第6集

13
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,160
你最喜欢哪个呢
Which is your favourite?

14
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,010
小泳帽吗
Swim hat?

15
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,290
特别漂亮是不是
Very pretty, isn't it?

16
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,400
这是刺绣工匠刚呈上的
It's just come from the embroiderer.

17
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,400
是不是很可爱
Isn't it sweet?

18
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,730
戴在她的小脑袋上
For her little head.

19
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,060
克伦威尔
Cremuel?

20
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,260
我听说 当你以为国王驾崩时
I am told that when you thought the King was dead,

21
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,600
你的第一反应竟然是传召那个私生女玛丽
your first action was to send for the bastard Mary.

22
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,660
你竟然没有考虑过我
You did not think of me,

23
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,400
和我的女儿
or my daughter

24
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,530
和我当时身上怀着的宝宝
or the child I was carrying then.

25
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:38,530
我不能把王位交给一个尚在襁褓中的婴儿
I cannot hold the throne for an infant in the cradle.

26
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,800
更不能交给一个尚未出世的孩子
I cannot hold the throne for an unborn baby.

27
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,130
是我提拔的你
I promoted you.

28
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,600
我是你地位提升如此之快的因素
I am responsible for your rise.

29
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,730
可一旦出现了机会 你却背叛了我
And at the first opportunity, you have betrayed me.

30
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,000
夫人 我做的事都不是出于私心的
Madam, nothing here is personal.

31
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,460
你觉得你已羽翼丰满
You think you've grown great.

32
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,930
不再需要我的庇护
You think you no longer need me,

33
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,930
但你却忘记了最为重要的一件事
but you've forgotten the most important thing.

34
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,600
克伦威尔
Cremuel!

35
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:25,000
所有的事情都可以推倒重来
Those who've been made can be unmade.

36
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,930
我不能同意更多
I entirely agree.

37
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,330
我们想驱逐那个姘妇
We want the concubine ousted.

38
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,600
我们知道你也很想这样
We know you want it too.

39
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,260
"我们" 指的是
We?

40
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,730
我有些很觊觎 也与王位有血缘关系的朋友们
My friends in this matter are very near the throne,

41
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,930
爱德华国王一脉的家族
those in the line of old King Edward.

42
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,460
比如埃克塞特大人 考特尼家族
Lord Exeter, the Courtenay family.

43
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,000
蒙塔古大人 他的哥哥 杰弗里・波利  玛格丽特・波利夫人
Lord Montague, his brother, Geoffrey Pole, Lady Margaret Pole.

44
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,530
这些都是我交谈过的最有分量的人了
These are the principal persons on whose behalf I speak.

45
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,130
我还给你提个醒
But, as you will be aware,

46
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,530
大部分英国民众都会很高兴国王罢黜她
the most part of England would rejoice to see the King free of her.

47
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,200
我可不认为大部分英国子民会知道或在意这事
I don't think the most part of England knows or cares.

48
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,330
那你们到底需要我做什么
What do you require of me?

49
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:39,260
我们...需要...你加入我们
We...require...that you join us.

50
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,860
我们想要把西摩家的女儿推上王后之位
We're content to have Seymour's girl crowned.

51
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,200
她因热爱真实的宗教信仰而闻名
She's known to favour true religion

52
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,330
而我们也相信她能让亨利与罗马教廷重归于好
and we believe she will bring Henry back to Rome.

53
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,060
但这也正是我们的难处 克伦威尔
And this is our difficulty, Cromwell.

54
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,930
我们知道 你是个路德会教友
We know you are a Lutheran.

55
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,200
什么 我不是 先生 我只是个银行主
Me? No, sir. I'm a banker.

56
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,730
那你们会怎么处理安妮・博林
What will happen to Anne Boleyn?

57
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,530
我不知道
I don't know.

58
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,860
可能遣送到康文特去吧
Convent?

59
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,930
看这个小可怜哦
Look at this little doggie.

60
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,400
噢 你为什么看上去这么悲伤 马克
Oh, why are you so sad, Mark?

61
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,000
你根本勿须忧伤
You have no business being sad.

62
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,260
你在这里是为了愉悦我们的
You're here to entertain us.

63
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,530
噢 我的天 你给我站好了
Oh, for heaven's sake, stand on your feet.

64
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,000
我给你面子才看你一眼
I do you favour by noticing you at all.

65
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,530
你还指望什么
What do you expect?

66
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,200
你觉得我应该像和绅士一般说话的和你说话吗
Do you think I should talk to you as if you were a gentleman?

67
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,060
但我做不到 马克 你看
But I can't do that, Mark. You see...

68
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,330
因为你本身就是个下等人
because you're an inferior person.

69
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,660
是的 王后
No, madam.

70
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,600
我什么都没有指望的
I don't expect a word.

71
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,260
您看我一眼 已能使我满足
A look suffices me.

72
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,000
是吗
Well?

73
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,400
那你现在是不是要开始赞颂我的眼睛了
Aren't you going to praise my eyes now?

74
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,730
你为什么要鼓励那个男孩
Why do you encourage that boy?

75
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,060
所有有礼貌的宠物都该得到鼓励的
All manner of puppy dogs are encouraged here.

76
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,330
有些时候进来的不合时宜
Some are coming in AND out of season.

77
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,060
你是在引用我的话吗 诺里斯
Are you referring to me, Norris?

78
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,060
要是能一脚踢一下那"宠物"的肚腩 真是要乐死了
I could happily give this puppy dog a kick in his ribs

79
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,130
- 他就永远不会忘了  - 不许在我的宫殿内随便踢 拜托
- that he won't forget.  - No kicking in my chamber, if you please.

80
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,060
他把自己弄得这么焦虑
He gets himself agitated

81
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,530
因为他总觉得我到这里来是想勾搭玛丽夫人的
because he thinks I come here to cast my fancy at Lady Mary.

82
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,200
我们都知道其实是他自己想娶玛丽夫人
We all know he hopes to marry her himself.

83
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,530
但说真的 我到这来 是为了另一个女人的
But really I come here for the sake of another.

84
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,200
- 你知道我是为谁来吗  - 不知道 你告诉我吧
- And do you know who that is?  - No, tell me.

85
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,400
我猜不到
I can't guess.

86
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,530
难道是罗奇福德夫人吗
Is it Lady Rochford here?

87
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,860
肯定不会是年龄这么大的吧
Surely not one so old?

88
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,130
是您 王后
No. It is yourself, Madam.

89
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,060
诺里斯 或许你该踹他一脚
Perhaps you should kick him, Gentle Norris,

90
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,330
以维护英格兰王后的尊严
for the honour of the Queen of England.

91
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,330
来了个我的亲信
Ah! Here's the man for me.

92
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,330
这位威尔・布里尔顿能把弓箭笔直的射出去
Will Brereton is one who shoots his arrow straight.

93
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,130
你们在干嘛呢
What's to do here?

94
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:16,460
每个人都在争吵 起源于那个叫马克的男孩
Everyone's been fighting, and all because of that boy Mark.

95
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,930
我觉得他应该从高空扔下去
I think he should be dropped from a great height.

96
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,000
就像你的那条小狗 博克尔
Just like your dog, Purkoy.

97
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,530
你再扇一次 我就会还手了
Do that again and I will hit you back.

98
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,930
你不是王后 你不过是个骑士的女儿
You're no queen. You're just a knight's daughter

99
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,530
而且你大限将至了
and your time has come.

100
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,930
哈里
Harry?

101
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:02,000
帮我个忙 把我的这位弟妹带走 然后将她溺死
Do me a good turn - take away my brother's wife and drown her.

102
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,130
- 安妮  - 干嘛
- Anne!  - What?

103
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,660
你不是曾发誓说 愿意为我赤脚走路到中国去的吗
Didn't you swear you'd walk barefoot to China for me?

104
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,800
我记得我说的是赤脚走到沃尔辛厄姆
I think it was barefoot to Walsingham I offered.

105
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,930
那或许你能在那边忏悔你的罪孽
Perhaps you can repent your sins there.

106
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:23,800
因为如何国王有任何不测 你会想尽办法得到我的
Because if anything happened to the King, you'd look to have me.

107
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,330
噢 不好意思了 玛丽 你知道他为什么一直不娶你吗
Oh, yes, you see now, Mary, why he hasn't married you yet?

108
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,860
因为他一直爱的都是我 据他所说是这样的
It's because he's in love with me. Or so he claims.

109
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,800
而现在 他也不愿把罗奇福德夫人装进袋子里 扔到河里面
And yet he won't prove it by putting Lady Rochford in a sack

110
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,660
来证明对我的爱了
and dropping her in the river.

111
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,060
那你愿意分享你的全部秘密吗 安妮 还是只有一部分
Will you spill all your secrets, Anne, or only some?

112
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:52,260
把他...把他叫回来
Oh, he... Get him back.

113
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,060
我刚刚是气话 快把他叫回来
It was idle talk. Get him back.

114
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,730
让他回来 他会对着圣经起誓
Get him back and he'll swear on the Bible.

115
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,600
他知道我会是一个好妻子的
He knows me to be a good wife.

116
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,130
快让他回来 哈里
Get him back! Harry!

117
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,000
亨利听说了她和诺里斯之间的争吵
Henry had heard about the fight with Norris.

118
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,400
我们从庭院里都看到了
We could all see from the courtyard.

119
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,130
她把她的手...
She had her hands...

120
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,060
你知道国王最爱的织锦的
You know the King's great tapestry?

121
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,530
王后将它一起握在手上
Where the Queen clasps her hands together?

122
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,130
但国王显然没有被说服
He didn't look persuaded.

123
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,860
你没有去劝慰一下她吗
Did you not go to her to comfort her?

124
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,530
她毕竟是你的女主人
She being your mistress?

125
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,330
没有 我直接来找你商讨了
No. I came looking for you.

126
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,400
在他们结婚之前
Before they were married,

127
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:52,330
安妮曾与亨利练习过
Anne used to practise with Henry.

128
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,730
做一些新奇的玩法
In the French fashion.

129
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,200
你知道我什么意思的
You know what I mean.

130
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,330
罗奇福德夫人 我不知道你的意思
Lady Rochford, I have no idea what you mean.

131
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,400
噢 你以为我会羞耻的不好意思说出我的意思来吗
Oh, you think you can shame me out of saying what I must say?

132
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,530
我可不是一个处女
I'm no virgin girl.

133
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:15,860
她勾引他把他的精子 射到了个不正常的地方
She induced him to put his seed otherwise than he should have.

134
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,600
现在亨利称之为一个肮脏的口
Now Henry calls it a filthy proceeding.

135
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,860
但上帝还是爱他 他不知道那里一开始装的什么
But God love him, he doesn't know where the filth begins.

136
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,000
我的丈夫乔治...
My husband George...

137
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,860
..总是和安妮混在一起
..is always with Anne.

138
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,930
他是她弟弟 这很正常
He's her brother. It's natural.

139
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,530
但乔治没有正常的一面
There's nothing natural in George.

140
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,060
在他眼里 没有什么是不可以做的
And nothing is forbidden.

141
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,660
我曾见过他们接吻
I've seen them kiss.

142
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,730
弟弟亲吻姐姐没什么...
Brothers may kiss their sis...

143
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,460
他的舌头在她的嘴里 她的舌头也在他嘴里
His tongue in her mouth. Hers in his.

144
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,200
你想让我将这件事记录在案吗
You want me to record that?

145
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,260
如果你害怕 这件事你不会记住的
If you're worried you won't remember it.

146
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,660
可她为什么要做出这样的事
Why would she do such a thing?

147
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,060
你知道为什么的 为了更好地统治
You know why. The better to rule.

148
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,600
假如她生下了一个男孩 却而且有着威斯顿的长脸
Suppose she gets a boy and it has Weston's long face?

149
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,530
或者看着像威尔・布里尔顿
Or looks like Will Brereton?

150
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,930
但如果长得像博林家的孩子 就没理由说他是私生子了
But they can't call it a bastard if it looks like a Boleyn.

151
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,930
我衷心建议你
Be advised by me.

152
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,660
千万别告诉任何人
Speak to no-one.

153
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,400
我也衷心建议你
Be advised by me.

154
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,260
去和马克・斯米顿谈谈吧
Speak to Mark Smeaton.

155
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,060
我们可以把那个留在这 马克
We can leave that here, Mark.

156
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,930
我还以为会有一帮人呢
I thought there was to be a great company?

157
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,660
我以为我是负责来愉悦你的
I thought I was going to entertain you.

158
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,330
毫无疑问
Make no doubt of it.

159
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,400
你看 马克
You see, Mark,

160
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,400
我的主人 国王 和我的女主人 王后
my master, the King, and my mistress, the Queen,

161
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,060
发生了分歧
are at odds.

162
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,200
每个人都知道
Everyone knows.

163
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,260
而我最大的心愿就是他们能够和好
And my dearest wish is to reconcile them.

164
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,860
可你在议会上说的话 就好像是你在与王后的敌人为伍
The word at court is you're keeping company with the Queen's enemies.

165
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,000
那不然我怎能察觉出他们的动机图谋
How else am I to find out their practices?

166
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,730
信你才怪
Ah. If only I could believe that.

167
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
我不怪你 马克
I don't blame you, Mark.

168
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,800
在议会上这种恶心的地方 人与人无信任可言
There's such ill-feeling at the court, no-one trusts anyone.

169
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,060
但是我找你来 是因为你和王后的关系密切
But I've come to you because you're close to the Queen,

170
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,530
我也真的很想知道 她为什么如此不高兴
and I'd really love to know why she's so unhappy

171
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,330
有什么事我能做的
and if there's anything that I can do to remedy it.

172
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,330
难怪她不开心
It's no wonder she's unhappy.

173
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,600
她正在热恋中
She's in love.

174
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,660
和谁
With whom?

175
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,800
和我
With me.

176
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,200
你看起来很吃惊
You're amazed.

177
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,000
我...
I'm...

178
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,930
我没有你想象的那么吃惊
I'm not as amazed as you might think.

179
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,260
我知道她是怎么看你的
I've seen how she looks at you.

180
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,800
这不奇怪 任何女人都会被你吸引的
And it's no surprise that any woman would be drawn to you.

181
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,200
你是一个非常英俊的年轻小伙
You're a very handsome young man.

182
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,400
但是我们觉得你是个娈童
But we thought you were a sodomite.

183
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,460
里奇
Rich!

184
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,130
我是和他们一样的男人
I'm as good a man as any of them.

185
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,260
当然 相信王后也会给你一个很好的地位
Of course you are and the Queen would give you good report.

186
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,310
她审视过你 发现你很对她的胃口
She's tried you. Found you to her liking.

187
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,680
我不想讨论这个
I can't discuss it.

188
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,910
不 不 你可以不讨论 但我们可以假设
No, no, you mustn't. But we can assume.

189
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,050
她不是一个没有经验的女人
She's not an inexperienced woman.

190
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:57,650
我想她不会对一个经验少 表现拙劣的人感兴趣的
I think she would not be interested in anything less than a masterly performance.

191
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:01,370
好吧 我会说
Well, I will say this -

192
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,600
我们出身贫寒的人
we men born poor

193
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,910
还做出那样卑贱的行为是不明智的
are in no wise inferior in that way.

194
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,710
很正确
How true.

195
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,850
尽管贵族的绅士们 喜欢对女士们的保留秘密
Though the noble gentlemen like to keep that secret from the ladies.

196
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,710
他们不想要竞争 对吧
They wouldn't want the competition, would they?

197
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,000
如果你的意思是她是否有别的情人 这我不知道
If you mean she has other lovers, I wouldn't know.

198
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,710
我没有问过她
I haven't asked her.

199
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,170
- 但是他们都嫉妒我   - 是吗?
- But they're jealous of me. - Are they?

200
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,510
- 威斯顿和诺里斯 这些大人们
- Weston and Norris, those lords.

201
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,250
他们叫我小男孩 但我知道他们是嫉妒我
They call me boy, but they're jealous.

202
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,570
好吧 也许她也试探了他们 而他们却令人失望了
Well, perhaps she tried them and they were a disappointment.

203
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,400
你则是赢家
And you take the prize.

204
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,770
多久一次
How often?

205
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,480
你已经给我们两个名字了 马克
You've given us two names, Mark.

206
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,540
现在说出其他人的名字吧
Now name the others.

207
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,450
然后回答理查德学士 多久一次
And answer Master Richard. How often?

208
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,770
嗯 也许你不说话是明智的
Perhaps you're wise not to speak.

209
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,820
最好把名单都写下来
Best to have it all written down.

210
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,770
否则议会很难相信它的真实性
The council will hardly believe it otherwise.

211
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,140
他们会为你的成功感到惊讶 甚至嫉妒
They'll be amazed at your success. Jealous.

212
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:21,710
他们会问 "斯米顿 你的秘密是什么"
"Smeaton, what is your secret?" they'll demand.

213
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,310
你会回答 "啊 我不能透露"
And you'll answer, "Ah, I can't impart."

214
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,140
但是你终要说的 马克
But you will impart, Mark.

215
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,540
你会自愿说出来
You'll do it freely.

216
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,770
或者被迫说
Or you'll do it enforced.

217
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,480
坐下吧 俊俏的小男孩
Seat yourself, pretty boy.

218
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,650
我收回我的话 我不会告诉你任何名字的
I take it back. I can't give you any names.

219
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,740
我不知道我怎么会到这来 说我做了什么
I don't know how I came to say what I did.

220
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,170
不 我也是 没有人伤害你或强迫你的 你可以畅所欲言
No, nor do I. No-one hurt you or coerced you. You spoke freely.

221
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,570
这两位先生是我的证人
These two gentlemen are my witnesses.

222
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,000
我收回我说的话
I take it back.

223
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,450
我可不这么认为
I don't think so.

224
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,710
告诉我们 你和王后通奸
Tell us about your adultery with the Queen

225
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,480
还有你所知道的她和其他男人的来往
and what you know about her dealings with the other gentlemen

226
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,770
如果你的供述是真实完整的
and IF your confession is true and full,

227
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,450
说不定国王会怜悯你 饶你一命
perhaps the King will show you mercy.

228
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,020
你愿意和理查德学士在这 独处十分钟吗
Would you like to spend ten minutes alone with Master Richard here?

229
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,620
五分钟就行了
Five would do it.

230
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,970
他会如实写下你所说的 马克
He will write down what you say, Mark.

231
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,170
但他不一定会写下我们所对你做的
But he won't necessarily write down what we do.

232
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,820
噢 天啊
Oh, God!

233
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,420
你听懂了吗
Do you follow me?

234
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,170
圣母玛利亚 救救我
Mother Mary, help me.

235
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,600
我不能告诉你们 我并不知道的事啊
I can't tell you what I don't know.

236
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,020
你不能吗
Can't you?

237
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,570
不能
No.

238
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,220
好吧 那看来你是我们今晚留宿的客人了 马克
Well, then you'll have to be my guest for the night, Mark.

239
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,650
噢 求求你了
Oh! Please.

240
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:00,000
好吧 他们中没有多少人还活着了
Well, there aren't many men alive

241
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,940
他们还真是吓了我一跳
who can say they took me by surprise.

242
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:06,620
常年被贵族们渲染 已经让他变得大言不惭
Years of being despised by lords has made a boaster of him.

243
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,850
有时候我觉得我应该带他来这里
Sometimes I think I should have taken him in here.

244
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,620
我不想伤害他
I don't want him hurt.

245
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:20,450
如果我们必须要像折磨可怜的生物那样 接下来怎么做
If we have to torture sad creatures like that, what next?

246
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,370
踩踏睡鼠
Stamping on dormice?

247
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,020
让里奥谢思利明天过来
Tell Wriothesley to come tomorrow.

248
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,050
这是什么
What is this?

249
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,450
这是幽灵住的地方
It's where the phantom lives.

250
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,970
进去吧
In you go.

251
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,220
拜托
Please!

252
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,220
让我出去 请让我出去吧
Let me out! Please let me out!

253
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,020
让我出去啊
Let me out!

254
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,910
有哈里・诺里斯和佛朗西斯・威斯顿
Henry Norris, Francis Weston.

255
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,400
以及威廉・布里尔顿和佛朗西斯・布莱恩
And William Brereton and Francis Bryan.

256
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:58,570
理查德・朗 沃尔特・沃尔什
Richard Long, Walter Walsh.

257
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,540
你和王后 到底有过多少次苟且之事
You had to do with the Queen - how many times?

258
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,450
得有上千次了 三四次而已
A thousand? Three or four.

259
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,450
三四次而已
Three or four.

260
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,600
理查德
Richard.

261
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,170
去格林威治觐见国王
Go to the King at Greenwich.

262
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,480
他在等着见你
He'll be expecting you.

263
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:31,080
千万不要相信任何一个人
Trust your message to no-one.

264
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,770
要亲自把消息送入他耳里
Put the word in his ear yourself

265
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,710
佩奇
Page!

266
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,200
让哈里・诺里斯从丛林里回来
Tell Henry Norris to retire from the field.

267
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,370
哈里 和我一起骑段路
Ride with me, Harry.

268
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,310
去哪里 陛下
Where to, my lord?

269
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,770
就我们俩 随便聊聊
Let's talk, you and I.

270
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,020
克伦威尔
Cromwell!

271
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,710
我听说玩音乐的小子最后都几乎按照你的调子在唱歌了
I hear the singer sang to your tune.

272
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,940
你对他做了什么啊
What did you do to him?

273
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,820
我有个歌谣要说给你听
There's a pretty ballad for you.

274
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,370
国王在弹琴的时候 他的琴师却在"弹"着王后
The King fingers his lute, while his lutenist fingers his wife.

275
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,570
你带搜查令了吗 大人
You have the warrant, my lord?

276
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,540
或许这样能教育亨利多听听我的
Perhaps this'll teach Henry to listen to me.

277
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,880
叔父
Uncle.

278
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,400
大法官阁下
Lord Chancellor.

279
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,480
财政大臣阁下
Master Treasurer.

280
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,170
还有克伦威尔
And Cremuel.

281
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,800
我亲手栽培出来的男人
The man I created.

282
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,420
不 夫人 是他亲手扶植你上位的
He created you in turn, madam.

283
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,450
我确信他自己也在懊悔的
And be sure he repents of it.

284
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:11,710
但是我先感到遗憾的
Oh, but I was sorry first.

285
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:16,970
也遗憾的更多
And I am sorry more.

286
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,970
准备好出发了吗
Ready to go?

287
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,280
我不知该如何准备
I don't know how to be ready.

288
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,170
只要跟我们走就好
Just come with us.

289
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,680
都怪我
I'm to blame.

290
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,280
我怀疑了她 却无计可施
I suspected her and did nothing.

291
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,740
我...
I...

292
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:16,170
我从未对一个女人 有像对她那样的好印象
I never had a better opinion in a woman than I had in her.

293
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,740
我至今仍不敢相信她有罪
I can't believe she's guilty.

294
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:26,220
只是我知道如果她无罪的话 国王陛下是不会这么做的
Except I know Your Highness would never go so far if she weren't.

295
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,820
她欺骗了我们所有人
She deceived all of us.

296
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,600
我现在回想起来 也都想明白了
When I look back, it all falls into place.

297
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:34,910
失去了那么多的朋友
So many friends lost,

298
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,480
渐行渐远...
alienated...

299
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,000
很是糟心
Worse.

300
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,740
每当我想起沃尔西的时候...
When I think of Wolsey...

301
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:48,680
想起了安妮与他作对的样子
The way she practised against him.

302
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:57,140
她说她是爱我的
She said she loved me.

303
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:00,850
但是其实她一点也不爱我
But she meant the opposite.

304
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,820
我写过一个剧本
I've written a play.

305
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,540
是一个悲剧
A tragedy.

306
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,940
我自己的故事
My own story.

307
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:23,080
您先留着吧 陛下 等我们有足够的闲暇时间来品鉴它
You should keep it sir, till we have more leisure to do it justice.

308
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,080
但我想要让你们看看她的本性
But I want you to see her true nature.

309
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,450
我相信她已经与上百个男人通奸过了
I believe she has committed adultery with 100 men.

310
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,480
但和她的弟弟
But her brother?

311
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,310
真的有可能吗
Is it likely?

312
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,480
我还不相信她能抵挡诱惑
Well, I doubt she could resist!

313
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,540
为何要宽恕呢
Why spare?

314
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,620
明知是破鞋 为何还要穿
Why not drink the cup to its filthy dregs?

315
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,450
来吧 沃尔西 我们领你到地狱来
Come, Wolsey, we're fetching you to Hell,

316
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:12,510
我们的主人 别西卜圣经中的鬼王] 正等着你共进晚餐呢
where our master, Beelzebub, is expecting you to supper!

317
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:18,970
别西卜愿意与你共享鹿肉
Beelzebub would have you joint his venison.

318
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,140
他听说你擅长屠杀
He's heard of your skill as a butcher!

319
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:23,480
我知道为什么我在这里
I know why I'm here.

320
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,970
因为我的妻子
My wife.

321
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,770
她说了什么
What has she said?

322
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:33,080
不管说了什么 你都不能因为一个女人的一面之词而抓我
Whatever it is, you can't hold me on the word of one woman.

323
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,940
也有其他女人说起了
There've been other women who have been recipients

324
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,400
你的风流往事 乔治
of your...gallantry, George.

325
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,880
你一直就觉得女人是可以玩玩就扔的...
You've always regarded women as disposable...

326
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,110
怎么
What?

327
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,050
你要因为我的风流韵事而审讯我吗
You're going to put me on trial for gallantry?

328
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,600
不曾想与一个自愿和我共赴巫山的情人在一起 居然是犯罪
I didn't know it was a crime to spend time with a willing lover.

329
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,620
如果那个女人是你的亲姐姐时 那就是犯罪了
It is when that lover is your sister.

330
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:02,910
我的家族世世代代为英国国王效劳
My family has served the King of England for generations.

331
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,510
我自小就在亨利的左右服侍了
I have been at the side of Henry since I was a boy.

332
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:09,940
我爱他就像爱自己的兄弟一样 我从未忘记过我的荣幸...
I love him like a brother. I would never forget my honour, never...

333
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,800
还需要我把事情挑明了吗 诺里斯
Do you want me to write it on the wall for you, Norris?

334
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:16,680
她不能给他生下个子嗣
She can't give him a son.

335
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,800
他要再娶一个妻子
He wants another wife.

336
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,570
她不会就这样保持沉默的
She won't go quietly.

337
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,080
这样对你来说够简单明了吧
Is that simple enough for your simple tastes?

338
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,770
她需要别人给她施压 我必须要给她压力
She has to be PUSHED. I have to PUSH her.

339
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,940
好吧 反正我是不会认罪的
Well, you'll get no confession from me,

340
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,970
布里尔顿也不会的
or Brereton either.

341
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:39,140
你不会对一位绅士用刑的
You'll not torture gentlemen.

342
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,940
国王是不会同意的
The King wouldn't permit it.

343
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:48,110
那我们可以私底下来做点安排
There don't have to be formal arrangements.

344
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:52,680
我能把我的大拇指插进你的眼中
I can put my thumbs in your eyes

345
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,910
然后你会唱 "冬青树郁郁又葱葱"...
and then you would sing Green Grows The Holly...

346
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,800
我叫你做什么 你就做什么
if I asked you to.

347
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,850
懂了吗
Hmm?

348
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,970
我们再重新谈过
Let's go back.

349
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,370
我记得在红衣主教大人末年
I remember in the late Cardinal's time,

350
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,220
你的一个家人在弓箭比赛上杀了一个人
one of your household killed a man in a bowls match.

351
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,200
你知道刀剑不长眼
Well, the game can get very heated.

352
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,370
红衣主教觉得是时候算算账了
The Cardinal thought it was time for a reckoning,

353
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,080
但是你的家人在调查过程中故意阻挠
but your family impeded the investigation

354
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,280
我就问自己 "打那之后有什么变化吗"
and I ask myself, "Has anything changed since then?"

355
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:40,400
约翰艾顿在最近和你的一个王室成员有过争执
John ap Eyton had a quarrel with one of your household only recently.

356
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,420
所以 这就是我在此的原因吧
So, that's why I'm here.

357
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,050
不全是 但暂且不提你和王后通奸的事
Not entirely, but leave aside your adultery with the Queen,

358
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,540
我们先专注于伊顿
let's concentrate on Eyton.

359
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,880
他在与人互相射箭中 误杀了对方
Blows were exchanged, a man was killed.

360
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,170
伊顿经过审讯被无罪释放了
Eyton was tried and acquitted.

361
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,350
但是你 因为你对法律的不敬...
But you, because you have no respect for the law or...

362
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,460
- 我充分的尊重法律   - 不许打断我
- I have every respect! - Don't interrupt me!

363
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,060
你绑架了那个人并绞死了他
You had the man abducted and hanged.

364
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,860
你以为仅仅只是一个人 无关紧要是吗
You think because it's only one man, it doesn't matter.

365
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:03,060
你以为没有人会记得住 可我记得
You think no-one will remember, but I remember.

366
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:06,130
你以为有诺尔福克罩着你 你就能为所欲为了吗
You think you can do anything because Norfolk favours you...

367
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,800
是国王罩着我的
The King favours me!

368
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,800
是吗 他是罩着你的吗
Does he? Does he?

369
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,730
那你或许能和国王去抱怨一下你的居住环境 对吧
Well, you should complain about your lodgings, then, shouldn't you?

370
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,530
不过后来 佛朗西斯・布莱恩向我解释了
But then, Francis Bryan has been explaining it to me...

371
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,130
布莱恩
Bryan?

372
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,530
- 布莱恩可是我的敌人  - 我也意识到了
- Bryan is an enemy of mine. - And I begin to see it.

373
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:36,130
你怎么会对你姐姐有所了解呢
How a man may hardly know his sister.

374
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,730
毕竟她在法国长大
She grows up in France.

375
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:42,530
成年后才相见 但她很像他
They meet as adults, she is like him, yet not.

376
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,460
她很熟知他
She is familiar,

377
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:47,530
然后 她激起了他的兴趣
and yet, she piques his interest.

378
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,400
直到有一天 弟弟的拥抱 比寻常持续的时间更久
One day, his brotherly embrace lasts a little longer than usual.

379
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,530
从那时起 不正当关系便发生了
The business proceeds from there.

380
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:01,060
或许你们俩从没觉得自己做错任何事
Perhaps neither of you felt you were doing anything wrong.

381
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,730
直到突破了底线
Until some frontier was crossed.

382
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,460
我拒绝回答这个问题
I refuse to answer this.

383
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,730
你们的关系是开始在她与国王的婚礼之前 还是之后
Did it begin before her marriage to the King, or afterwards?

384
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,820
乔治兄弟 你一定很惊诧
Brother George, that must have been a surprise.

385
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:26,040
对立由此而生
Rivalry from that quarter.

386
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:30,400
但是你的绅士品格还是让我惊异
But the morality of you gentlemen astonishes me.

387
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,020
我对乔治没有任何意见
I have no opinion of George.

388
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,620
对近亲通奸也没有意见吗
No opinion of incest?

389
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,660
你说得如此平淡 我想这一定是真的了
You take it so quietly I'm forced to think it must be true...

390
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,170
如果我说是 你就会指责我
If I said it was, you'd only accuse me of trying

391
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,350
在转移你对我的注意力
to divert attention away from myself.

392
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,040
哈里 你真是太了解我了
You've known me too long, Harry.

393
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,440
我曾研究过你
Oh, I've studied you.

394
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,460
也还研究过沃尔西
Studied Wolsey before you.

395
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,880
你曾多么的谨慎 一个国家的忠实仆从
That was politic of you. Such a great servant of the state!

396
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:06,170
到最后又成了个伟大的叛徒
And such a great traitor at the end.

397
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,400
我还记着在法庭上很有趣的一幕 你还记得吗
I remember a certain entertainment at court, do you remember?

398
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:16,480
一场表演秀 红衣主教被恶魔们打倒
A play, in which the late Cardinal was set upon by demons

399
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,110
被扯到地狱里去了
and dragged down to hell.

400
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,200
你就是因为这个记恨我吗
That's why?

401
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,150
它是
It...

402
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,260
那只是一个表演秀而已
It was a play!

403
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,800
只是一个玩笑 你不能...
It was a joke! You can't...

404
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:41,460
- 你不能当真...  - 你要用一生来偿还
- You can't seriously... - Life pays you out.

405
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,060
你没这觉悟吗
Don't you find?

406
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,170
那马克・斯米顿呢
But Mark Smeaton?

407
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,350
- 他对你做了什么  - 不知道
- What has he done to you? - I don't know...

408
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,530
我就是不喜欢他看我的眼神
I just don't like the way he looks at me.

409
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,910
哈里 我需要有罪的人
I need guilty men, Harry.

410
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,400
所以我就尽可能的去寻找有罪之人
So, I've found men who ARE guilty.

411
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,860
虽然他们的罪 还不至于被判刑
Though not necessarily as charged.

412
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,440
早上好
Good morning.

413
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,280
我刚刚结婚
I'm not long married.

414
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,240
你可能不知道 我还有个儿子
I don't know if you know that. I have a son...

415
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,440
你有债务在身 高达一千英镑
You have debts. To the tune of a thousand pounds.

416
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,530
那个魔头为什么要提到这件事
Why the devil bring that up...?

417
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:48,530
没有人奢求像你一样挥霍无度的年轻人 能够勤俭持家
No-one expects a young gallant like yourself to be thrifty,

418
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,200
可是你的债务 远超出你的偿还能力了
but these debts are more than you could reasonably pay.

419
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:54,130
所以你的放纵挥霍的行为 让人们不由得去想
So, your own extravagance gives people to think,

420
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,550
这个年轻的威斯顿到底存着怎样的心思
what expectations did young Weston have?

421
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,800
我们都清楚王后给了你不少钱
We know the Queen gave you money.

422
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,530
如果你能娶了她 一千英磅对你来说根本就不算什么了
A thousand pounds is nothing to you if you hoped to marry her

423
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,460
所以你谋划了国王的谋杀
after you'd contrived the King's death.

424
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,460
当证据呈出时 我才知道了事情的严重性
I see how it'll weigh, when it's given in evidence.

425
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,020
我悔过自新了
I've undone myself.

426
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,820
克伦威尔 我不怪你
I don't blame you, Cromwell.

427
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,130
只是...
It's just...

428
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,460
...我以为还能再活二十年的
..I thought I had another 20 years.

429
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,640
佛朗西斯 我们都知道 你活不过二十小时了
Well, we know not the hour, do we, Francis?

430
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:18,170
你搞定了吗
Are you finished?

431
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,460
他有告发其他人吗
Has he denounced the others?

432
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,400
你想让我们来逼他说吗
Do you want us to make him?

433
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:28,310
怎么 你认为我对年轻人太温柔了吗
What? What, do you think I'm too soft on young men?!

434
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:36,000
- 那你想让我们起草起诉书吗? - 嗯 罪状越多越好
- Do you want us to draw up charges? - Yeah, the more the merrier.

435
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,910
请见谅 我要去方便一下
Forgive me, I have to piss.

436
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,000
叛徒
Traitor!

437
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,570
叛徒
Traitor!

438
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,260
我夫人在陪着她
My wife is with her.

439
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,950
还有她的姨母 谢尔顿夫人
And her aunt, Lady Shelton.

440
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,970
她怎么样了
How is she?

441
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,220
一会儿哭 一会儿笑
Sometimes crying, sometimes laughing.

442
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,370
还在自言自语什么
There's something she said.

443
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,060
我提起这个 只是因为你下令 要报告我所听到的一切事情而已
I only mention it because you told me to report everything I heard.

444
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,510
继续
Go on.

445
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,970
当我告诉她 她要住在
When I told her she would stay in the same room

446
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,620
加冕之前 居住的房子里
she had before her coronation,

447
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,860
她说 "你们对我太好了
she said, "It's too good for me.

448
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,020
耶稣也是在怜悯我"
Jesus have mercy on me."

449
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,860
如果她不值得这一切 因为她有戴罪之人
If she's not worthy, it's because she's guilty.

450
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,460
但是她到底做了什么
But what is it she's done?

451
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:26,570
是我们根本难以想象的吗
Is it something we haven't even imagined yet?'

452
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,200
你喜欢那件带来的毛皮衣服吗
Would you like your furs brought in?

453
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,480
是貂皮的
The ermine.

454
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:01,730
还有我不想看到这群女人 我想要回我的侍女们
And I don't want these women. I want my own women.

455
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,930
金斯顿夫人是
Lady Kingston is...

456
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,130
你的间谍
Your spy.

457
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,080
...是女主人
..your hostess.

458
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,660
那我就是个客人了吗
Am I a guest, then?

459
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,480
那我能离开吗
Am I free to go?

460
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,730
你不该违抗你的姨母的
I didn't think you'd object to your own aunt.

461
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:18,620
她对我满怀怨恨 满耳朵都是她的抱怨声
She has a grudge against me. All I hear is tutting.

462
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,130
那你难道还期望有掌声吗
Do you expect applause?

463
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,020
等我被释放了 你就不敢冲我这样说话了
You won't speak to me that way to me after I'm released.

464
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:28,710
我不清楚国王为什么要把我软禁在这
I don't know why the King is holding me here.

465
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,730
我想这应该是某种考验吧
I suppose it's some sort of test, isn't it?

466
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,420
我想见我的弟弟
I want to see my brother.

467
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,620
在这种情况之下 真是一个愚蠢的要求
That's a foolish demand in the circumstances.

468
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,130
- 那要见我父亲 - 不要期望有人会帮你
- My father. - Don't expect help there.

469
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:55,600
托马斯・博林会一直照看着他
Thomas Boleyn looks after himself first and last.

470
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,280
我知道 因为他是我的哥哥
I should know, he's my brother.

471
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,330
别为难国王了
Help the King.

472
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:15,600
除非他仁慈至极 否则你根本无能为力
Unless he's merciful, there's nothing you can do for yourself.

473
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,970
不过你应当为你的女儿做些事
But you can do something for your daughter.

474
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,970
为伊丽莎白做点事
For Elizabeth.

475
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,420
在整个过程当中 你表现得越悔恨...
The more penitent you show yourself through this whole process...

476
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,020
什么"过程"
The "process"?

477
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:30,440
这个"过程"的最终结果是什么
And what is this process to be?

478
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,080
那个先生的认罪书 已经开始在编写中了
The confessions of the gentlemen are now being compiled.

479
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:35,280
你说什么
What?

480
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:37,020
你听到他说的了
You heard him.

481
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,850
他们是不会袒护你的
They'll not lie for you.

482
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,710
那几位先生将会被集体审讯
The gentlemen are to be tried together.

483
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,220
您和您的弟弟 身为贵族
You and your brother, being ennobled,

484
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,940
将由贵族们一起审判
are to be judged by your peers.

485
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,820
你没有证人
You have no witnesses.

486
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:53,650
当您身处王后之位时 夫人
When you were at liberty, madam,

487
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:58,510
您的侍女们受你胁迫 被迫撒谎
your ladies were intimidated by you, forced to lie for you.

488
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,510
- 但现在她们无需再顾及... - 噢 我想也是
- Now, they are emboldened...- Oh, I'm sure they are.

489
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,370
就像西摩那样
The way Seymour's emboldened.

490
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:09,540
替我转告她 上帝能够直视她的肮脏伎俩
Tell her from me, God sees her tricks.

491
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,220
等等
No!

492
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:29,140
告诉我...你不相信那些污蔑我的故事的 对吗
Just tell me... You don't believe these stories against me, do you?

493
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:33,820
我知道你内心深处是不愿相信的
I know in your heart you don't.

494
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,800
对吗 克伦威尔
Do you, Cremuel?

495
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:58,450
我的脖子很脆弱
I only have a little neck.

496
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:03,020
折断它非常容易
So, it'll be the work of a moment.

497
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,510
你说过 一旦国王逝去
You said, when the King was dead,

498
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,310
你会从这些先生们中选一位当丈夫
you would choose one of these men to be your husband,

499
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:24,050
只是没确定是哪位 你是否说过这样的话
but you can't say which yet. Did you say that?

500
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:28,220
你必须大声作出回答
You must answer a loud.

501
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,910
没有
No.

502
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,400
说说你对我的指控
Read me your charges.

503
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,480
一条一条的说
Put them to me, one by one.

504
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,400
说出详细的地点 约会内容
The places. The dates.

505
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,540
我会辩的你狼狈不堪
I'll confound you!

506
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,370
你是否声明过 你永不会真心的爱国王
Did you not affirm that you could never love the King in your heart?

507
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,820
没有
No.

508
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:59,880
你是否有在不同的时间 地点
Did you not, at various times and places, by kissing, touchings,

509
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,800
通过亲吻 抚摸及身体接触
and other infamous incitations,

510
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:05,880
勾引弗朗西斯・威斯顿 使其成为你的姘夫
induce Francis Weston to be your concubine?

511
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,680
没有
No.

512
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,140
你是否有给国弗朗西斯・威斯顿大笔金钱作为礼物
Did you not make gifts of money to Francis Weston?

513
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:23,200
有
Yes.

514
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:28,400
肃静
Silence!

515
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:36,170
这张纸上记载了 据说是王后对你说过的话
On this page are words the Queen is said to have spoken to you,

516
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,680
而你却散播了这些话语
and which, in turn, you passed on.

517
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:39,940
不要念出声来
Do not read them aloud.

518
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,080
就请告诉法庭 你是否记得这些话
Just tell the court, do you recognise them?

519
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:52,680
"国王无法与女人交媾
"The King cannot copulate with a woman.

520
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,140
他既没技术 也没精力"
He has neither skill, nor vigour."

521
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,280
这些话不是我说的...
I didn't say...

522
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,970
这不是我要说的话
These are not MY words.

523
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,740
不是我的原话
I don't own them!

524
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:14,910
可你刚刚已经说出口了
You do now.

525
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,370
经议会全员表决 现宣判被告
Having been found unanimously

526
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:32,220
有罪...
guilty...

527
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:36,050
再不安静点就宰了你们
I'll do slaughter!

528
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:43,370
尔将被焚于伦敦塔内
Thou shalt be burned here, within the Tower.

529
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:48,800
或 将尔之颅砍去
Or else, to have thy head smitten off...

530
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,910
-...以显国王之大度... - 这不公平
- ..as the King's pleasure... - That's not justice!

531
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,000
- 你们在说什么  - 怎么回事 怎么了?
- What are you talking about?  - What is it? What?

532
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:00,000
这些家伙说我的判决有误
These fellows say I've done it wrong.

533
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:02,800
他们说我只能说"焚"这个字...
They say I have to say "burn" only...

534
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:05,420
这本就是国王的原话
The phrasing is the King's, and don't tell me

535
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,940
也别跟我说哪些能做 哪些不能 这可是我们第一次审判王后
what we can or can't do, we've never tried a queen before.

536
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,680
继续把话说完 你们也坐下吧
Finish what you're saying. Sit down.

537
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:22,170
...将颅砍去
..head smitten off,

538
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:27,420
由此案 更可彰显国王之大度
as the King's pleasure shall be further known of this matter...

539
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:18,910
她为什么一直盯着塔顶看
Why does she keep looking up at the tower?

540
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,710
因为她觉得一切仍有希望
Because she thinks there's still hope.

541
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:16,220
她没办法通过其他官员 告知我此事
So, she will not be able to tell me from the other officials.

542
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:20,000
她很快会解脱的
It will save her alarm.

543
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:45,940
善良的基督教徒们...
Good, Christian people...

544
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,740
..我是到此处来 是来受死的
..I am come hither to die.

545
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:57,600
因为根据法律判决 我被判了死刑
For according to the law, and by the law, I am judged to die -

546
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:58,970
我听不清她的话
I can't hear her.

547
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,310
你认为她是在说临终遗言吗
You'd think she'd speak up for her last words.

548
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,280
我来此处 不为控诉任何人
I am come hither to accuse no man...

549
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,910
..也不为我是因何种控诉
..nor to speak any thing of that

550
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,420
如何判死刑 而辩解
whereof I am accused and condemned to die.

551
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:15,420
但我祈祷上帝来拯救国王...
But I pray God save the King...

552
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,480
..并愿他长寿 让他的王位绵延万世
..and send him long to reign over you.

553
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:24,570
因为从未有哪位王子 像他那般仁慈怜悯
For a gentler nor a more merciful prince was there never.

554
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:31,020
于我而言 他是从未有过的 正直绅士的 至高无上的君主
And, to me, was he ever a good, a gentle and a sovereign lord.

555
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:38,910
若后人想评论我的所作所为 我希望他们能公正评判
And if any person will meddle of my cause, I require them to judge best.

556
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:48,340
就这样 我将告别这世界 告别你们
And thus I take my leave of the world and of you all,

557
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,680
我衷心希望你们能为我祈祷
and I heartily desire you all to pray for me.

558
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,420
主啊 请宽恕我的灵魂
Oh Lord, have mercy on my soul.

559
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,000
上帝 我把灵魂交付于你
To God, I commend my soul.

560
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:25,880
你会怎样行刑
How will you do it?

561
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,650
让她跪下
She kneels.

562
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:30,000
这样就毫无阻碍了
There is no block.

563
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:16,450
基督 仁慈 耶稣 请收下我的灵魂...
Christ have mercy, Jesus receive my soul...

564
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,140
如果她不乱动的话 一下子就完事
If she is steady, it will be over in a moment.

565
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:35,420
一瞬间的事 她甚至都不会有一点痛感的
Between heartbeats. She knows nothing.

566
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:41,020
如果...她不乱动的话
IF...she is steady.

567
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:51,200
我可以确保 她不会乱动的
Well, I can answer for her.

568
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:25,820
把你的手臂放下来
Put your arm down.

569
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:31,880
持剑而来 奉命而归
Apportez l'epee.

570
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:44,170
我们不想让男人碰她的身体
We do not want men to handle her.

571
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:49,370
现在说这话 也太晚了哈 [暗指她乱交]
It's a little late for that!

572
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,220
对了
Right.

573
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,570
我要去告诉西摩家的人 一切都结束了
I'm off to tell the Seymours it's done.

574
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000

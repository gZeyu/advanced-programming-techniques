1
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,720
Damn! When are we going to eat, Cromwell?

2
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,630
I'm famished!

3
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,160
Which is your favourite?

4
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,010
Swim hat?

5
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,290
Very pretty, isn't it?

6
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,400
It's just come from the embroiderer.

7
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,400
Isn't it sweet?

8
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,730
For her little head.

9
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,060
Cremuel?

10
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,260
I am told that when you thought the King was dead,

11
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,600
your first action was to send for the bastard Mary.

12
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,660
You did not think of me,

13
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,400
or my daughter

14
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,530
or the child I was carrying then.

15
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:38,530
I cannot hold the throne for an infant in the cradle.

16
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,800
I cannot hold the throne for an unborn baby.

17
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,130
I promoted you.

18
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,600
I am responsible for your rise.

19
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,730
And at the first opportunity, you have betrayed me.

20
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,000
Madam, nothing here is personal.

21
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,460
You think you've grown great.

22
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,930
You think you no longer need me,

23
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,930
but you've forgotten the most important thing.

24
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,600
Cremuel!

25
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:25,000
Those who've been made can be unmade.

26
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,930
I entirely agree.

27
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,330
We want the concubine ousted.

28
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,600
We know you want it too.

29
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,260
We?

30
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,730
My friends in this matter are very near the throne,

31
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,930
those in the line of old King Edward.

32
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,460
Lord Exeter, the Courtenay family.

33
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,000
Lord Montague, his brother, Geoffrey Pole, Lady Margaret Pole.

34
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,530
These are the principal persons on whose behalf I speak.

35
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,130
But, as you will be aware,

36
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,530
the most part of England would rejoice to see the King free of her.

37
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,200
I don't think the most part of England knows or cares.

38
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,330
What do you require of me?

39
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:39,260
We...require...that you join us.

40
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,860
We're content to have Seymour's girl crowned.

41
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,200
She's known to favour true religion

42
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,330
and we believe she will bring Henry back to Rome.

43
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,060
And this is our difficulty, Cromwell.

44
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,930
We know you are a Lutheran.

45
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,200
Me? No, sir. I'm a banker.

46
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,730
What will happen to Anne Boleyn?

47
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,530
I don't know.

48
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,860
Convent?

49
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,930
Look at this little doggie.

50
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,400
Oh, why are you so sad, Mark?

51
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,000
You have no business being sad.

52
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,260
You're here to entertain us.

53
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,530
Oh, for heaven's sake, stand on your feet.

54
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,000
I do you favour by noticing you at all.

55
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,530
What do you expect?

56
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Do you think I should talk to you as if you were a gentleman?

57
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,060
But I can't do that, Mark. You see...

58
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,330
because you're an inferior person.

59
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,660
No, madam.

60
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,600
I don't expect a word.

61
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,260
A look suffices me.

62
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,000
Well?

63
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,400
Aren't you going to praise my eyes now?

64
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,730
Why do you encourage that boy?

65
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,060
All manner of puppy dogs are encouraged here.

66
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,330
Some are coming in AND out of season.

67
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,060
Are you referring to me, Norris?

68
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,060
I could happily give this puppy dog a kick in his ribs

69
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,130
- that he won't forget.  - No kicking in my chamber, if you please.

70
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,060
He gets himself agitated

71
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,530
because he thinks I come here to cast my fancy at Lady Mary.

72
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,200
We all know he hopes to marry her himself.

73
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,530
But really I come here for the sake of another.

74
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,200
- And do you know who that is?  - No, tell me.

75
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,400
I can't guess.

76
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,530
Is it Lady Rochford here?

77
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,860
Surely not one so old?

78
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,130
No. It is yourself, Madam.

79
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,060
Perhaps you should kick him, Gentle Norris,

80
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,330
for the honour of the Queen of England.

81
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,330
Ah! Here's the man for me.

82
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,330
Will Brereton is one who shoots his arrow straight.

83
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,130
What's to do here?

84
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:16,460
Everyone's been fighting, and all because of that boy Mark.

85
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,930
I think he should be dropped from a great height.

86
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,000
Just like your dog, Purkoy.

87
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,530
Do that again and I will hit you back.

88
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,930
You're no queen. You're just a knight's daughter

89
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,530
and your time has come.

90
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,930
Harry?

91
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:02,000
Do me a good turn - take away my brother's wife and drown her.

92
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,130
- Anne!  - What?

93
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,660
Didn't you swear you'd walk barefoot to China for me?

94
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,800
I think it was barefoot to Walsingham I offered.

95
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,930
Perhaps you can repent your sins there.

96
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:23,800
Because if anything happened to the King, you'd look to have me.

97
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,330
Oh, yes, you see now, Mary, why he hasn't married you yet?

98
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,860
It's because he's in love with me. Or so he claims.

99
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,800
And yet he won't prove it by putting Lady Rochford in a sack

100
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,660
and dropping her in the river.

101
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,060
Will you spill all your secrets, Anne, or only some?

102
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:52,260
Oh, he... Get him back.

103
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,060
It was idle talk. Get him back.

104
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,730
Get him back and he'll swear on the Bible.

105
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,600
He knows me to be a good wife.

106
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,130
Get him back! Harry!

107
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,000
Henry had heard about the fight with Norris.

108
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,400
We could all see from the courtyard.

109
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,130
She had her hands...

110
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,060
You know the King's great tapestry?

111
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,530
Where the Queen clasps her hands together?

112
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,130
He didn't look persuaded.

113
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,860
Did you not go to her to comfort her?

114
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,530
She being your mistress?

115
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,330
No. I came looking for you.

116
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,400
Before they were married,

117
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:52,330
Anne used to practise with Henry.

118
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,730
In the French fashion.

119
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,200
You know what I mean.

120
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,330
Lady Rochford, I have no idea what you mean.

121
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,400
Oh, you think you can shame me out of saying what I must say?

122
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,530
I'm no virgin girl.

123
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:15,860
She induced him to put his seed otherwise than he should have.

124
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,600
Now Henry calls it a filthy proceeding.

125
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,860
But God love him, he doesn't know where the filth begins.

126
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,000
My husband George...

127
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,860
..is always with Anne.

128
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,930
He's her brother. It's natural.

129
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,530
There's nothing natural in George.

130
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,060
And nothing is forbidden.

131
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,660
I've seen them kiss.

132
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,730
Brothers may kiss their sis...

133
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,460
His tongue in her mouth. Hers in his.

134
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,200
You want me to record that?

135
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,260
If you're worried you won't remember it.

136
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,660
Why would she do such a thing?

137
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,060
You know why. The better to rule.

138
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,600
Suppose she gets a boy and it has Weston's long face?

139
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,530
Or looks like Will Brereton?

140
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,930
But they can't call it a bastard if it looks like a Boleyn.

141
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,930
Be advised by me.

142
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,660
Speak to no-one.

143
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,400
Be advised by me.

144
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,260
Speak to Mark Smeaton.

145
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,060
We can leave that here, Mark.

146
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,930
I thought there was to be a great company?

147
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,660
I thought I was going to entertain you.

148
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,330
Make no doubt of it.

149
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,400
You see, Mark,

150
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,400
my master, the King, and my mistress, the Queen,

151
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,060
are at odds.

152
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Everyone knows.

153
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,260
And my dearest wish is to reconcile them.

154
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,860
The word at court is you're keeping company with the Queen's enemies.

155
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,000
How else am I to find out their practices?

156
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,730
Ah. If only I could believe that.

157
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
I don't blame you, Mark.

158
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,800
There's such ill-feeling at the court, no-one trusts anyone.

159
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,060
But I've come to you because you're close to the Queen,

160
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,530
and I'd really love to know why she's so unhappy

161
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,330
and if there's anything that I can do to remedy it.

162
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,330
It's no wonder she's unhappy.

163
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,600
She's in love.

164
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,660
With whom?

165
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,800
With me.

166
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,200
You're amazed.

167
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm...

168
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,930
I'm not as amazed as you might think.

169
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,260
I've seen how she looks at you.

170
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,800
And it's no surprise that any woman would be drawn to you.

171
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,200
You're a very handsome young man.

172
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,400
But we thought you were a sodomite.

173
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,460
Rich!

174
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,130
I'm as good a man as any of them.

175
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,260
Of course you are and the Queen would give you good report.

176
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,310
She's tried you. Found you to her liking.

177
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,680
I can't discuss it.

178
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,910
No, no, you mustn't. But we can assume.

179
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,050
She's not an inexperienced woman.

180
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:57,650
I think she would not be interested in anything less than a masterly performance.

181
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:01,370
Well, I will say this -

182
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,600
we men born poor

183
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,910
are in no wise inferior in that way.

184
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,710
How true.

185
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,850
Though the noble gentlemen like to keep that secret from the ladies.

186
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,710
They wouldn't want the competition, would they?

187
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,000
If you mean she has other lovers, I wouldn't know.

188
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,710
I haven't asked her.

189
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,170
- But they're jealous of me. - Are they?

190
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,510
- Weston and Norris, those lords.

191
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,250
They call me boy, but they're jealous.

192
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,570
Well, perhaps she tried them and they were a disappointment.

193
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,400
And you take the prize.

194
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,770
How often?

195
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,480
You've given us two names, Mark.

196
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,540
Now name the others.

197
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,450
And answer Master Richard. How often?

198
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,770
Perhaps you're wise not to speak.

199
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,820
Best to have it all written down.

200
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,770
The council will hardly believe it otherwise.

201
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,140
They'll be amazed at your success. Jealous.

202
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:21,710
"Smeaton, what is your secret?" they'll demand.

203
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,310
And you'll answer, "Ah, I can't impart."

204
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,140
But you will impart, Mark.

205
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,540
You'll do it freely.

206
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,770
Or you'll do it enforced.

207
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,480
Seat yourself, pretty boy.

208
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,650
I take it back. I can't give you any names.

209
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,740
I don't know how I came to say what I did.

210
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,170
No, nor do I. No-one hurt you or coerced you. You spoke freely.

211
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,570
These two gentlemen are my witnesses.

212
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,000
I take it back.

213
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,450
I don't think so.

214
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,710
Tell us about your adultery with the Queen

215
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,480
and what you know about her dealings with the other gentlemen

216
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,770
and IF your confession is true and full,

217
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,450
perhaps the King will show you mercy.

218
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,020
Would you like to spend ten minutes alone with Master Richard here?

219
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,620
Five would do it.

220
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,970
He will write down what you say, Mark.

221
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,170
But he won't necessarily write down what we do.

222
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,820
Oh, God!

223
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,420
Do you follow me?

224
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,170
Mother Mary, help me.

225
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,600
I can't tell you what I don't know.

226
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,020
Can't you?

227
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,570
No.

228
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,220
Well, then you'll have to be my guest for the night, Mark.

229
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,650
Oh! Please.

230
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:00,000
Well, there aren't many men alive

231
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,940
who can say they took me by surprise.

232
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:06,620
Years of being despised by lords has made a boaster of him.

233
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,850
Sometimes I think I should have taken him in here.

234
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,620
I don't want him hurt.

235
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:20,450
If we have to torture sad creatures like that, what next?

236
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,370
Stamping on dormice?

237
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,020
Tell Wriothesley to come tomorrow.

238
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,050
What is this?

239
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,450
It's where the phantom lives.

240
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,970
In you go.

241
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,220
Please!

242
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,220
Let me out! Please let me out!

243
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,020
Let me out!

244
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,910
Henry Norris, Francis Weston.

245
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,400
And William Brereton and Francis Bryan.

246
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:58,570
Richard Long, Walter Walsh.

247
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,540
You had to do with the Queen - how many times?

248
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,450
A thousand? Three or four.

249
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,450
Three or four.

250
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,600
Richard.

251
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,170
Go to the King at Greenwich.

252
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,480
He'll be expecting you.

253
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:31,080
Trust your message to no-one.

254
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,770
Put the word in his ear yourself

255
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,710
Page!

256
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,200
Tell Henry Norris to retire from the field.

257
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,370
Ride with me, Harry.

258
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,310
Where to, my lord?

259
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,770
Let's talk, you and I.

260
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,020
Cromwell!

261
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,710
I hear the singer sang to your tune.

262
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,940
What did you do to him?

263
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,820
There's a pretty ballad for you.

264
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,370
The King fingers his lute, while his lutenist fingers his wife.

265
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,570
You have the warrant, my lord?

266
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,540
Perhaps this'll teach Henry to listen to me.

267
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,880
Uncle.

268
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,400
Lord Chancellor.

269
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,480
Master Treasurer.

270
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,170
And Cremuel.

271
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,800
The man I created.

272
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,420
He created you in turn, madam.

273
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,450
And be sure he repents of it.

274
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:11,710
Oh, but I was sorry first.

275
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:16,970
And I am sorry more.

276
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,970
Ready to go?

277
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,280
I don't know how to be ready.

278
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,170
Just come with us.

279
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,680
I'm to blame.

280
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,280
I suspected her and did nothing.

281
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,740
I...

282
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:16,170
I never had a better opinion in a woman than I had in her.

283
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,740
I can't believe she's guilty.

284
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:26,220
Except I know Your Highness would never go so far if she weren't.

285
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,820
She deceived all of us.

286
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,600
When I look back, it all falls into place.

287
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:34,910
So many friends lost,

288
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,480
alienated...

289
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,000
Worse.

290
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,740
When I think of Wolsey...

291
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:48,680
The way she practised against him.

292
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:57,140
She said she loved me.

293
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:00,850
But she meant the opposite.

294
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,820
I've written a play.

295
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,540
A tragedy.

296
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,940
My own story.

297
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:23,080
You should keep it sir, till we have more leisure to do it justice.

298
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,080
But I want you to see her true nature.

299
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,450
I believe she has committed adultery with 100 men.

300
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,480
But her brother?

301
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,310
Is it likely?

302
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,480
Well, I doubt she could resist!

303
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,540
Why spare?

304
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,620
Why not drink the cup to its filthy dregs?

305
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,450
Come, Wolsey, we're fetching you to Hell,

306
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:12,510
where our master, Beelzebub, is expecting you to supper!

307
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:18,970
Beelzebub would have you joint his venison.

308
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,140
He's heard of your skill as a butcher!

309
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:23,480
I know why I'm here.

310
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,970
My wife.

311
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,770
What has she said?

312
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:33,080
Whatever it is, you can't hold me on the word of one woman.

313
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,940
There've been other women who have been recipients

314
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,400
of your...gallantry, George.

315
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,880
You've always regarded women as disposable...

316
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,110
What?

317
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,050
You're going to put me on trial for gallantry?

318
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,600
I didn't know it was a crime to spend time with a willing lover.

319
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,620
It is when that lover is your sister.

320
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:02,910
My family has served the King of England for generations.

321
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,510
I have been at the side of Henry since I was a boy.

322
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:09,940
I love him like a brother. I would never forget my honour, never...

323
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,800
Do you want me to write it on the wall for you, Norris?

324
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:16,680
She can't give him a son.

325
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,800
He wants another wife.

326
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,570
She won't go quietly.

327
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,080
Is that simple enough for your simple tastes?

328
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,770
She has to be PUSHED. I have to PUSH her.

329
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,940
Well, you'll get no confession from me,

330
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,970
or Brereton either.

331
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:39,140
You'll not torture gentlemen.

332
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,940
The King wouldn't permit it.

333
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:48,110
There don't have to be formal arrangements.

334
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:52,680
I can put my thumbs in your eyes

335
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,910
and then you would sing Green Grows The Holly...

336
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,800
if I asked you to.

337
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,850
Hmm?

338
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,970
Let's go back.

339
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,370
I remember in the late Cardinal's time,

340
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,220
one of your household killed a man in a bowls match.

341
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,200
Well, the game can get very heated.

342
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,370
The Cardinal thought it was time for a reckoning,

343
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,080
but your family impeded the investigation

344
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,280
and I ask myself, "Has anything changed since then?"

345
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:40,400
John ap Eyton had a quarrel with one of your household only recently.

346
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,420
So, that's why I'm here.

347
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,050
Not entirely, but leave aside your adultery with the Queen,

348
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,540
let's concentrate on Eyton.

349
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,880
Blows were exchanged, a man was killed.

350
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,170
Eyton was tried and acquitted.

351
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,350
But you, because you have no respect for the law or...

352
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,460
- I have every respect! - Don't interrupt me!

353
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,060
You had the man abducted and hanged.

354
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,860
You think because it's only one man, it doesn't matter.

355
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:03,060
You think no-one will remember, but I remember.

356
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:06,130
You think you can do anything because Norfolk favours you...

357
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,800
The King favours me!

358
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,800
Does he? Does he?

359
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,730
Well, you should complain about your lodgings, then, shouldn't you?

360
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,530
But then, Francis Bryan has been explaining it to me...

361
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,130
Bryan?

362
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,530
- Bryan is an enemy of mine. - And I begin to see it.

363
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:36,130
How a man may hardly know his sister.

364
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,730
She grows up in France.

365
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:42,530
They meet as adults, she is like him, yet not.

366
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,460
She is familiar,

367
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:47,530
and yet, she piques his interest.

368
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,400
One day, his brotherly embrace lasts a little longer than usual.

369
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,530
The business proceeds from there.

370
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:01,060
Perhaps neither of you felt you were doing anything wrong.

371
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,730
Until some frontier was crossed.

372
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,460
I refuse to answer this.

373
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,730
Did it begin before her marriage to the King, or afterwards?

374
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,820
Brother George, that must have been a surprise.

375
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:26,040
Rivalry from that quarter.

376
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:30,400
But the morality of you gentlemen astonishes me.

377
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,020
I have no opinion of George.

378
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,620
No opinion of incest?

379
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,660
You take it so quietly I'm forced to think it must be true...

380
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,170
If I said it was, you'd only accuse me of trying

381
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,350
to divert attention away from myself.

382
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,040
You've known me too long, Harry.

383
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,440
Oh, I've studied you.

384
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,460
Studied Wolsey before you.

385
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,880
That was politic of you. Such a great servant of the state!

386
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:06,170
And such a great traitor at the end.

387
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,400
I remember a certain entertainment at court, do you remember?

388
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:16,480
A play, in which the late Cardinal was set upon by demons

389
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,110
and dragged down to hell.

390
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,200
That's why?

391
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,150
It...

392
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,260
It was a play!

393
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,800
It was a joke! You can't...

394
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:41,460
- You can't seriously... - Life pays you out.

395
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,060
Don't you find?

396
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,170
But Mark Smeaton?

397
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,350
- What has he done to you? - I don't know...

398
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,530
I just don't like the way he looks at me.

399
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,910
I need guilty men, Harry.

400
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,400
So, I've found men who ARE guilty.

401
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,860
Though not necessarily as charged.

402
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,440
Good morning.

403
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,280
I'm not long married.

404
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,240
I don't know if you know that. I have a son...

405
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,440
You have debts. To the tune of a thousand pounds.

406
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,530
Why the devil bring that up...?

407
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:48,530
No-one expects a young gallant like yourself to be thrifty,

408
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,200
but these debts are more than you could reasonably pay.

409
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:54,130
So, your own extravagance gives people to think,

410
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,550
what expectations did young Weston have?

411
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,800
We know the Queen gave you money.

412
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,530
A thousand pounds is nothing to you if you hoped to marry her

413
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,460
after you'd contrived the King's death.

414
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,460
I see how it'll weigh, when it's given in evidence.

415
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,020
I've undone myself.

416
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,820
I don't blame you, Cromwell.

417
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,130
It's just...

418
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,460
..I thought I had another 20 years.

419
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,640
Well, we know not the hour, do we, Francis?

420
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:18,170
Are you finished?

421
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,460
Has he denounced the others?

422
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,400
Do you want us to make him?

423
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:28,310
What? What, do you think I'm too soft on young men?!

424
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:36,000
- Do you want us to draw up charges? - Yeah, the more the merrier.

425
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,910
Forgive me, I have to piss.

426
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,000
Traitor!

427
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,570
Traitor!

428
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,260
My wife is with her.

429
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,950
And her aunt, Lady Shelton.

430
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,970
How is she?

431
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,220
Sometimes crying, sometimes laughing.

432
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,370
There's something she said.

433
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,060
I only mention it because you told me to report everything I heard.

434
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,510
Go on.

435
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,970
When I told her she would stay in the same room

436
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,620
she had before her coronation,

437
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,860
she said, "It's too good for me.

438
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,020
Jesus have mercy on me."

439
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,860
If she's not worthy, it's because she's guilty.

440
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,460
But what is it she's done?

441
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:26,570
Is it something we haven't even imagined yet?'

442
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,200
Would you like your furs brought in?

443
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,480
The ermine.

444
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:01,730
And I don't want these women. I want my own women.

445
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,930
Lady Kingston is...

446
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,130
Your spy.

447
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,080
..your hostess.

448
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,660
Am I a guest, then?

449
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,480
Am I free to go?

450
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,730
I didn't think you'd object to your own aunt.

451
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:18,620
She has a grudge against me. All I hear is tutting.

452
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,130
Do you expect applause?

453
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,020
You won't speak to me that way to me after I'm released.

454
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:28,710
I don't know why the King is holding me here.

455
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,730
I suppose it's some sort of test, isn't it?

456
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,420
I want to see my brother.

457
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,620
That's a foolish demand in the circumstances.

458
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,130
- My father. - Don't expect help there.

459
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:55,600
Thomas Boleyn looks after himself first and last.

460
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,280
I should know, he's my brother.

461
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,330
Help the King.

462
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:15,600
Unless he's merciful, there's nothing you can do for yourself.

463
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,970
But you can do something for your daughter.

464
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,970
For Elizabeth.

465
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,420
The more penitent you show yourself through this whole process...

466
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,020
The "process"?

467
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:30,440
And what is this process to be?

468
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,080
The confessions of the gentlemen are now being compiled.

469
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:35,280
What?

470
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:37,020
You heard him.

471
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,850
They'll not lie for you.

472
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,710
The gentlemen are to be tried together.

473
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,220
You and your brother, being ennobled,

474
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,940
are to be judged by your peers.

475
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,820
You have no witnesses.

476
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:53,650
When you were at liberty, madam,

477
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:58,510
your ladies were intimidated by you, forced to lie for you.

478
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,510
- Now, they are emboldened...- Oh, I'm sure they are.

479
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,370
The way Seymour's emboldened.

480
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:09,540
Tell her from me, God sees her tricks.

481
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,220
No!

482
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:29,140
Just tell me... You don't believe these stories against me, do you?

483
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:33,820
I know in your heart you don't.

484
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,800
Do you, Cremuel?

485
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:58,450
I only have a little neck.

486
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:03,020
So, it'll be the work of a moment.

487
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,510
You said, when the King was dead,

488
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,310
you would choose one of these men to be your husband,

489
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:24,050
but you can't say which yet. Did you say that?

490
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:28,220
You must answer a loud.

491
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,910
No.

492
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,400
Read me your charges.

493
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,480
Put them to me, one by one.

494
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,400
The places. The dates.

495
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,540
I'll confound you!

496
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,370
Did you not affirm that you could never love the King in your heart?

497
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,820
No.

498
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:59,880
Did you not, at various times and places, by kissing, touchings,

499
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,800
and other infamous incitations,

500
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:05,880
induce Francis Weston to be your concubine?

501
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,680
No.

502
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,140
Did you not make gifts of money to Francis Weston?

503
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:23,200
Yes.

504
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:28,400
Silence!

505
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:36,170
On this page are words the Queen is said to have spoken to you,

506
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,680
and which, in turn, you passed on.

507
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:39,940
Do not read them aloud.

508
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,080
Just tell the court, do you recognise them?

509
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:52,680
"The King cannot copulate with a woman.

510
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,140
He has neither skill, nor vigour."

511
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,280
I didn't say...

512
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,970
These are not MY words.

513
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,740
I don't own them!

514
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:14,910
You do now.

515
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,370
Having been found unanimously

516
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:32,220
guilty...

517
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:36,050
I'll do slaughter!

518
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:43,370
Thou shalt be burned here, within the Tower.

519
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:48,800
Or else, to have thy head smitten off...

520
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,910
- ..as the King's pleasure... - That's not justice!

521
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,000
- What are you talking about?  - What is it? What?

522
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:00,000
These fellows say I've done it wrong.

523
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:02,800
They say I have to say "burn" only...

524
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:05,420
The phrasing is the King's, and don't tell me

525
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,940
what we can or can't do, we've never tried a queen before.

526
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,680
Finish what you're saying. Sit down.

527
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:22,170
..head smitten off,

528
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:27,420
as the King's pleasure shall be further known of this matter...

529
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:18,910
Why does she keep looking up at the tower?

530
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,710
Because she thinks there's still hope.

531
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:16,220
So, she will not be able to tell me from the other officials.

532
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:20,000
It will save her alarm.

533
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:45,940
Good, Christian people...

534
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,740
..I am come hither to die.

535
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:57,600
For according to the law, and by the law, I am judged to die -

536
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:58,970
I can't hear her.

537
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,310
You'd think she'd speak up for her last words.

538
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,280
I am come hither to accuse no man...

539
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,910
..nor to speak any thing of that

540
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,420
whereof I am accused and condemned to die.

541
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:15,420
But I pray God save the King...

542
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,480
..and send him long to reign over you.

543
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:24,570
For a gentler nor a more merciful prince was there never.

544
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:31,020
And, to me, was he ever a good, a gentle and a sovereign lord.

545
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:38,910
And if any person will meddle of my cause, I require them to judge best.

546
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:48,340
And thus I take my leave of the world and of you all,

547
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,680
and I heartily desire you all to pray for me.

548
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,420
Oh Lord, have mercy on my soul.

549
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,000
To God, I commend my soul.

550
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:25,880
How will you do it?

551
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,650
She kneels.

552
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:30,000
There is no block.

553
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:16,450
Christ have mercy, Jesus receive my soul...

554
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,140
If she is steady, it will be over in a moment.

555
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:35,420
Between heartbeats. She knows nothing.

556
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:41,020
IF...she is steady.

557
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:51,200
Well, I can answer for her.

558
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:25,820
Put your arm down.

559
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:31,880
Apportez l'epee.

560
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:44,170
We do not want men to handle her.

561
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:49,370
It's a little late for that!

562
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,220
Right.

563
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,570
I'm off to tell the Seymours it's done.

564

1
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,230
不不不
No,no,no,no,no!

2
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,760
拜托 我只想正当地谋生
Oh,come on,man! I'm just
trying to make an honest living!

3
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,460
你所做的 哪有正当可言
There's nothing honest
about what you do!

4
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,890
谁供给你迷魂药
Who supplies you with Vertigo?

5
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,660
告诉我 就放你走
Tell me now and you live.

6
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,170
求你了 别杀我
Please! They'll kill me!

7
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,430
不管你是怕谁 你该更怕我
Whoever you fear... Fear me more!

8
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,820
好吧
Okay,okay!

9
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,380
我们叫他伯爵 我只知道这些
We call him The Count,that's all I know.

10
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,040
我发誓
I swear to God!

11
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,510
把我放下来
Get me down from here!

12
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,570
找到你想要的了吗
Find what you're looking for?

13
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,220
解决了三个非法销售迷魂药的 Diggle
Took down three Vertigo
pushers tonight,Diggle.

14
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,460
最后一个可算给出了个名字
Last one finally knew a name.

15
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,730
伯爵
The Count.

16
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,360
伯爵 这名字比帽衫侠还弱
The Count? That's worse than The Hood.

17
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,600
你别再出去了
You're not going back out there.

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,620
今晚还没完事
I'm not done for the night.

19
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,700
不管伯爵是谁 他杀人无数
Whoever this Count is,he has
a lot of blood on his hands,

20
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,110
他要还的账可太多
and it is long past
time he started paying.

21
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,040
慢着 你没抓住重点
Well,slow down,I think
you're missing the point here.

22
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,380
什么
What?

23
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,420
Thea
Thea.

24
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,320
她的听证会还有几小时开始
Her hearing's in a few hours.

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,790
你觉得她更在乎毒枭落网
You think she cares more about some
drug lord getting his just desserts,

26
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,160
还是在她最需要你时 你的陪伴
or you being by her side
when she needs you the most?

27
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,930
我们该走了
Hey,we should get going.

28
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,490
法官可不吃时髦地迟到这套
Judges don't appreciate the
value in being fashionably late.

29
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,610
还有其他提醒吗
Got any other tips?

30
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,030
你自己别插嘴
Let the lawyer do all the talking.

31
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,580
他们会给你便笺簿和纸
但别在上面玩井字棋
They'll give you a pad and paper
but do not play tic tac toe.

32
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,540
法官也不会欣赏这点的
Judges don't appreciate that,either.

33
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,370
好运啊 飞毛腿
Come on,Speedy.

34
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,950
我知道
I know,I know.

35
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:27,560
很想起身就走 但不要这样...
Keep on trying to get up
and go,but... just don't.

36
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,860
真希望爸爸在这
I wish dad were here.

37
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,340
我在呢
I'm here.

38
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,930
我们该走了 Thea
We should leave now,Thea.

39
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,660
Queen小姐
Ms. Queen.

40
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,860
Thea 这里 请解释下
Thea,over here. Can we get a comment?

41
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,560
就解释一句
Just one comment!

42
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,220
Thea 你要去戒毒吗
Thea,are you going into rehab?

43
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,830
Queen小姐 你是被Balliol Prep赶跑了吗
Miss Queen,are you being
dispelled from Balliol Prep?

44
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,070
你担心结果吗
Are you worried about the outcome?

45
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,920
诉讼事件表尾号1-10-5-6
人民诉讼Thea Dearden Queen
Docket ending 1-10-5-6,People
vs. Thea Dearden Queen.

46
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,320
非法持有管制药物
Possession of a controlled substance,

47
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,490
服用管制药物后驾驶
driving under the influence
of a controlled substance.

48
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,230
双方律师 我知道你们达成了认罪协议
Counselors,I understand you've
reached a plea agreement.

49
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,660
是的 法官
We have,Your Honor.

50
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,720
鉴于我的委托人未成年
诉讼人同意执行缓刑
Given that my client is a juvenile,the
people have generously agreed to probation.

51
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,730
未成年
Juvenile?

52
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,010
这写着她18了
Says right here she's 18.

53
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,350
她现在是18了 但被捕时
She is 18 now,Your Honor,but
at the time of arrest,

54
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,990
离18岁生日还差两天
she was still two days
shy of her 18th birthday.

55
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,870
Queen小姐没有前科
Ms. Queen has no priors.

56
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,070
Queen小姐的家人为她销了前科
Well,just because Ms. Queen's family
sweeps her priors under the rug,

57
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,210
不代表没有过前科
doesn't mean they don't exist.

58
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,260
你帮你的委托人脱罪
让老板避免处理
You get your client off,and you help
your boss avoid dealing with the drug

59
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,120
席卷城市的毒品问题
that's sweeping across
our city like the plague.

60
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,480
你们双赢 但输的是斯特林市民
Everyone wins,except us,the
people of Starling City.

61
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,930
- 法官大人 出于尊敬...
- Queen小姐 不管你是否喜欢
- Your Honor,with all due respect...
- Ms. Queen,like it or not,

62
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,830
你是这种威胁的代表
you are now the poster
child for this menace.

63
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,650
可能人们看到Queen一家
使用迷魂药 没逃脱法网
Maybe if people see that the Queen
family can't get away with using Vertigo,

64
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,130
他们在使用时会更谨慎思考
they'll think twice
before using it themselves.

65
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,560
认罪协议被否决
The plea arrangement is denied.

66
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,610
案子将进行庭审
This case will proceed to trial.

67
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,940
他们不能这样
They can't do this.

68
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,210
这人不能把我女儿送进监狱
That man cannot send
my daughter to prison.

69
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,620
我们有何选择
What are our options?

70
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,640
进行中间上诉
An interlocutory appeal.

71
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,010
但庭审法官有权拒绝认罪协议
But trial judges have discretion
to reject plea agreements.

72
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,090
我想你该准备接受
I think you might want to prepare
yourself for the possibility

73
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,180
我们不想看到的结果
that this isn't going to go our way.

74
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,480
抱歉 Queen女士
I'm sorry,Mrs. Queen.

75
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,770
我要去为上诉做准备了
I'll get to work on the appeal.

76
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,690
城中最好的刑事辩护律师也不过如此
Well,so much for the best criminal
defense attorney in the city.

77
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,690
Thea 我们会搞定这个的 我保证
Thea,we will handle this,I promise.

78
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,110
就像你向Walter保证你会忠贞于他吗
Like you promised Walter you'd
always stay faithful to him?

79
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,380
- 这让我感觉好多了
- 够了
- I feel better already.
- That's enough!

80
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,100
别担心 听上去你不用再忍我多久了
Don't worry. Sounds like you won't have
to be putting up with me much longer.

81
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,850
她没意识到事情有多严重吗
What,does she not realize
how serious this is?

82
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,990
她嗑药了
She took drugs.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,130
- 还开车 她可能会害死自己或他人
- 我知道
- She drove. She could have killed someone,or herself.
- I know.

84
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,930
那法官只想杀一儆百
All that judge is looking for
is someone to make an example of.

85
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,370
为什么非要是她
What does it have to be her?

86
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,420
也许不是必须
Maybe it doesn't.

87
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,170
听着 我有些事要做
Listen,I have to go do something.

88
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,570
你会没事的 对吗
Are you going to be okay?

89
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,950
可不是我面临牢狱之灾
I'm not the one facing prison.

90
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,920
你现在为他们工作了吗
You working for them now?

91
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,440
你为什么这么对我
Why are you doing this to me?

92
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,150
我以为我们是朋友
I thought we were friends.

93
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,130
或其他的关系
Or...something.

94
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,290
为什么你要保护我
I mean,why'd you bother keeping me safe

95
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,650
既然你要把我交给他们
if you were just going
to hand me over to them?

96
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,530
把我弄出去
Just get me out of here.

97
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,850
我做不到
I can't.

98
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,230
喂 别把我留在这
Hey! Don't leave me here!

99
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,370
我为了你才回来的
I came back for you!

100
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,200
你听到没
Do you hear me?

101
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,060
我为了你回来的
I came back for you!

102

我来找Hall警官
Hi. Looking for Detective Hall.

106
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,370
他们说他是副警长
I was told he works in Vice.

107
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,950
Oliver
Oliver?

108
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,780
McKenna Hall
McKenna Hall.

109
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,920
我还在找穿廉价西装的中年男子呢
Here I was,expecting a middle
aged guy in a bad suit...

110
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,410
这就是McKenna Hall啊
And I got McKenna Hall.

111
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,880
我常给人惊喜
I live to surprise.

112
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,110
我记得呢
Well,I remember.

113
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,760
那个你害我们被踢出的
俱乐部叫啥来的
What was that club that
you got us kicked out of?

114
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,290
- 帝威俱乐部
- 好吧 我得辩解两句
- The Club Deville?
- Okay,in my defense,

115
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,170
那没有标志特别说 一定要穿好衣服
there was no sign that specifically
said you had to keep your clothes on.

116
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,370
那你是个警察哈
So,a cop?

117
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,080
我猜你不再去参加派对啥的了
I guess you're not hitting
the party circuit anymore.

118
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,140
我还是会去舞会的
I still go to raves.

119
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,280
现在去做卧底
I just go undercover now.

120
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,200
我得穿的稍微多些 藏住徽章和枪
And I have to dress slightly more
appropriately to hide my badge and gun.

121
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,110
没错
Right.

122
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,200
所以你找副警长干啥 Oliver
So what do you need
with a vice cop,Oliver?

123
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,050
迷魂药
Vertigo.

124
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,790
哦对 我在电视上
看到了你妹妹 我很抱歉
Right. I saw your
sister on TV. I'm sorry.

125
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,700
法官想杀一儆百
The judge is trying to
make an example of her.

126
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,210
所以我想 如果我能找到贩毒的人
So I was thinking,if you could
find the person selling the drugs,

127
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,630
也许能为Thea解围
it make take some of the heat off Thea.

128
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,480
说比做容易
Easier said than done.

129
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,840
我做了些调查 得到了个名字
Did some digging and
came up with a name.

130
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,900
伯爵
Um,The Count?

131
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,670
Oliver 几月前我们就知道伯爵了
Oliver,we've known about
The Count for months.

132
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,450
我也希望能有更多信息
但没太多他的资料
I wish this was thicker,but we
really don't have much on him.

133
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,910
希望我们能在你妹妹庭审前抓住他
Love to say we're going to catch
him before your sister's trial,

134
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,240
但不太可能
but it's highly unlikely.

135
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,260
我换岗要迟到了
Oh,I am late for my shift.

136
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:52,970
那你有他的消息 就告诉我好吗
Well,if you hear of anything
about this guy,just...let me know?

137
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,670
我很欣赏你对妹妹的关心
I always loved how much
you cared about your sister.

138
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,650
但让警察去做本职工作吧
But leave the policing
to the police,okay?

139
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,090
好吧
Okay.

140
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,190
Queen想要什么
What did Queen want?

141
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,230
他是个老朋友 妹妹被抓了
He's an old friend,sister's jammed up.

142
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,100
还有别的事吗 警官
Anything else,Sergeant?

143
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,640
没了
No.

144
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,590
你需要找个裁缝了
You need a tailor.

145
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,870
你也知道那帽衫侠
You know about the hood guy.

146
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,920
他逼我走投无路
He just cornered me,man.

147
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,940
帽衫侠
The hood guy?

148
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,050
我什么都没说
I didn't say anything.

149
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,070
我知道
Oh,I know.

150
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,300
你没法泄露不知道的事
You can't divulge
secrets you don't know.

151
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,870
但还是要杀鸡儆猴
But... examples must be made.

152
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,660
纯度最高的迷魂药
Vertigo,in its purest form.

153
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,850
直接注入血液时
When injected directly
into the bloodstream,

154
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,660
会影响脑中的丘脑区
it affects the thalamus
region of your brain.

155
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,090
那是你痛觉感受器接收信息之处
Which is where all of the information
from your pain receptors is collected.

156
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,040
你定会处于极度痛苦的
No doubt you're in excruciating pain.

157
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,910
但实际上 不会
But actually,you're not.

158
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,130
你只是觉得如此
You just think you are.

159
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:28,880
我见过这情况持续多天
直到心脏衰竭
I've seen it last for days,until
finally the heart gives out.

160
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,040
还剩一颗子弹
One bullet left.

161
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,420
你可以将子弹射向我 完成复仇
Now,you can use that bullet to
shoot me and take your revenge,

162
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,650
或者自杀
or...you could shoot yourself.

163
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,270
这是你的选择
It's your choice.

164
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,240
帽衫侠
The Hood.

165
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,280
来找我
Coming for me.

166
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,240
有点意思
Interesting.

167
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,780
我知道你不太喜欢赖床
I'm learning you're not
much of a morning snuggler.

168
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,100
我也知道你不到中午不起床
And I'm learning that you don't like
to wake up at any hour that ends in a.m.

169
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,400
这没错
That's true. Yeah.

170
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:59,300
要是你白天忙于工作
我夜晚打理夜店
So if you're busy being a lawyer all day
and I'm managing a night club all night,

171
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,070
我们什么时候能见面
when exactly do we
get to see each other?

172
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,380
我去开 你别动
I got it. Stay.

173
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,470
Thea怎样
Hey,how... how is Thea holding up?

174
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,650
她还好 谢谢
She's doing okay. Thank you.

175
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,960
其实我想来找Laurel谈谈
Um...Actually,I... I
came to talk to Laurel.

176
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,840
谢谢你昨天出庭
Thank you for coming to court yesterday.

177
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,850
当然
Yeah,of course.

178
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,810
但我觉得法官不会动摇
But I don't think the judge is
willing to move off his position.

179
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,010
坚定打击犯罪 是他的竞选宣言
Taking a hard line against criminals
is a platform for his reelection.

180
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,570
我想让你和你爸谈谈
I need you to talk to your father.

181
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,310
他在这体系内 而且...
He's inside the system,and...

182
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,040
没准他能说服Brackett法官
maybe he cashes in a
chip with Judge Brackett,

183
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,910
让他放过Thea
gets him off throwing the book at Thea.

184
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,300
Oliver 我不...
Oliver,I don't...

185
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,680
Laurel 我竭尽全力了
Laurel,I am working
on something on my end,

186
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,900
要是...我没有成功 你爸爸这边
能帮到我妹妹的希望最大
but... If it doesn't work out,this
is my best chance to help my sister.

187
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,710
求你了
Please.

188
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,450
我尽量吧
I'll see what I can do.

189
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,450
但是不能保证
But no promises.

190
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,300
谢谢你
Thank you.

191
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,530
门都没有
Absolutely not.

192
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,510
爸 我知道和Oliver不对眼
Dad,I know how you feel about Oliver.

193
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,230
那你怎么还开口求我这事
Then why would you
even ask me to do this.

194
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,620
因为Thea 她只有18岁
Because Thea,she's only 18 years old.

195
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,110
所以她是成人了 就要承担责任教训
Which makes her an adult.
She can take her medicine.

196
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,290
是时候让Queen家族好好反省了
It's about time someone
in the Queen family did.

197
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,310
那Lance一家呢
What about the Lance family?

198
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:39,790
年轻女孩放浪形骸 
不计后果 听着耳熟吗
A young girl acting out,engaging in
reckless behavior,does that sound familiar?

199
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,080
Laurel 别说了
Laurel,don't go there.

200
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,540
Thea 就和我记忆中Sarah一样
Thea,she's just like I remember Sarah.

201
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,950
在我印象中你妹妹不是这样
That is not how I remember your sister.

202
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,690
那是因为你只想记住她好的一面
That's because you remember her
the way that you wish she had been,

203
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,760
而不是真实的那面
not the way that she actually was.

204
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,660
她并没有被你教育成圣人
She's not the Saint that
you make her out to be.

205
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,770
我知道她店铺盗窃被捕
但是你帮她遮掩过去了
I know she was arrested for shoplifting
and I know you made it go away.

206
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:04,330
也许当时让她坐牢
她就不会到Queen该死的船上去
Well,maybe if I let her go to jail,Queen
wouldn't have had her on that damn boat.

207
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,830
爸 你说的好像她是被绑去的
Dad,you make it sound
like he kidnapped her.

208
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:13,790
一直以来 我们都将Sarah的死
怪罪于Oliver身上 但Sarah也有错
For so long,you and I have blamed Oliver
for Sarah's death,but Sarah's to blame,too.

209
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,690
当我看着Thea 
我就仿佛看到Sarah的影子
When I look at Thea,I see
Sarah's potential in her.

210
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,920
还有她的瑕疵
And her flaws,too.

211
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,110
是的 Thea犯了错
Yes,Thea made a mistake.

212
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,850
但她已经受了很多苦
But she's been through a lot.

213
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,020
她失去了父亲和兄长
She lost a father and a brother.

214
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,640
她需要的不是监狱
She doesn't need prison.

215
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:38,220
而是帮助 所以求你...
She needs help. So please...

216
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,140
我会打几个电话试试
I'll make some calls.

217
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,890
我在阿富汗就见够了
苏联人留下的鸟文
I've seen a fair amount of Cyrillic back
in Afghanistan left over by the Soviets.

218
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,010
这是俄国人的地方
Is this Russian owned?

219
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,900
这里俄国黑手党在斯特林市
明面意义上的总部
This is the not so hidden headquarters for
the Starling City chapter of the Bratva.

220
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:13,120
Diggle...不管我说什么 
不管发生什么 你都要支持我
Diggle... Whatever I say,whatever
goes down,just go with it.

221
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,720
很高兴再见到你
Zdravstvuyte.

222
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,460
我也是
Good to see you.

223
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,460
许久未见
Long time.

224
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,550
尤其对于黑手党队长来说
Particularly for Bratva captain.

225
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,260
我一直在考虑该投资什么
I was trying to figure out
where to put my interests.

226
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,790
最终决定是药物
I decided on pharmaceuticals.

227
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,160
我说的可不是阿司匹林
I don't mean aspirin.

228
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,870
明智之选
A wise choice.

229
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,640
甲氧麻黄酮 是不错的选择
Mepheodrone would be a
good investment for you.

230
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,130
是最新的货
It's the newest thing.

231
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,340
我想搞 迷魂药
I was thinking Vertigo.

232
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,150
改良后的那种
Newer thing.

233
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,380
迷魂药市场不景气啊
Tough market,Vertigo.

234
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,640
- 只有一位卖家
- 我知道
- Only one seller.
- I know.

235
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,290
我想请你帮我个忙 安排一次会面
I was hoping you could do me
a favor and arrange a meeting.

236
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,300
他是个异类
He's difficult man.

237
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,800
他不喜欢新朋友
And he does not like new friends.

238
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,970
这是警察掌握到他的信息
This is everything
the police have on him.

239
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,000
告诉他是个见面礼
Tell him it's a gift.

240
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,590
我会尽我所能的
I will see what I can do.

241
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,110
你还得帮我个忙
Provided you do favor for me.

242
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,510
悉听差遣
Vse chto ugodno.

243
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:28,250
我们组织中很少见到一个美国人
能拥有如此高的低位
It is unusual for an American to hold such
a position of esteem in our organization.

244
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,260
Queen先生
Mr. Queen.

245
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,680
Anatoli Knyazev
Anatoli Knyazev.

246
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,580
对你高度赞扬
He speaks very highly of you.

247
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:39,450
应该的 我救了他的命
He should. I saved his life.

248
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,490
他做了什么
What did he do?

249
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,280
违背了我的命令
Something I told him not to.

250
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,510
现在可以帮忙了
Now the favor.

251
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:55,650
替我杀了这人 
我就相信你的投资是诚恳的
Kill this man for me,and I will believe
your interest in our organization is genuine.

252
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,660
然后我就会安排你和伯爵见面
And then I will arrange
a meeting with The Count.

253
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,330
- Oliver...
- 闭嘴
- Oliver...
- Hey,shut up!

254
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,960
朋友间不必客气
What are friends for?

255
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,070
终于逃出来了 现在什么情况
I'm out of the gates
now. What's going on?

256
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,990
我们是要离开吗
Are we getting out of here?

257
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,520
你带我去哪
Where are you taking me?

258
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,040
虽然这场比赛是一边倒
While I admit that bout
was particularly one-sided,

259
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,840
还有人想来尝试一下吗
would anybody else
like to give it a try?

260
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:29,740
这次小比试的目的
是加强组织凝聚力
The point of these little gladiatorial
distractions is to strengthen unit cohesion.

261
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,860
为此 我想我们应该给予
To that end,I think our newest recruit

262
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,530
最新招募的成员一次试手的机会
ought to be afforded the
opportunity to try his hand.

263
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,950
难以想象你杀了这个人
I can't believe you
just killed that guy.

264
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,940
你真觉得我就那么点能耐么
You really have a low opinion of me.

265
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,880
哇哦 这个把戏不错
Whoa! That's a neat trick.

266
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,650
什么时候教我
You going to teach me that one day?

267
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,630
- 不教
- 你想干什么
- No.
- What are you doing?

268
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,540
你给这家伙弄个新身份
You need to arrange a
new identity for this guy.

269
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,930
帮他逃出这里
Get him out of the city.

270
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,350
然后俄国佬朋友把伯爵引出来
绿箭侠把他放倒
Right,so your Ruskie pal draws out
The Count,vigilante takes him down.

271
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,690
不 Diggle 那样黑手党
就知道我利用了他们
No,Diggle,because then the Bratva
would know that I used them,

272
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,950
这关系网价值非凡
and that relationship is too valuable.

273
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,230
我得真的亲自见见伯爵
I do the meet with The Count as myself,

274
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,390
让他离开 然后跟踪他到藏身之处
let him leave,then we
follow him to his hideout.

275
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,340
说的真轻松啊
Just that easy,huh?

276
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,410
仍旧需要你的援手
Well,I will still need
my trust bodyguard.

277
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,700
棒极了 真心期待刺激的毒贩生涯
Fantastic. Looking forward to my new
and exciting career as a drug dealer.

278
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,430
他是一名队长
He's a captain.

279
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,530
而且很有钱
And he has money.

280
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,470
你感兴趣吗
Are you interested?

281
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,520
那就...好吧
Let's say...yes.

282
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,420
我爸爸成功的让Brackett法官
放下了强硬立场
My father was able to get Judge
Brackett to back off his hardline stance.

283
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,920
你爸很恨我的
Your father hates me.

284
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,030
- 没有
- 没有
- No.
- No.

285
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,560
我爸爸恨的是他
My father hates him.

286
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,710
- 没有求你参与这事
- 我求了
- Look,nobody asked you to get involved.
- I did.

287
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:21,830
法官同意判决500小时社区服务
The judge has agreed to a sentence
of 500 hours of community service

288
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,670
缓刑2年
and two years of probation.

289
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,500
临时任命一位代替父母
Provisional on the appointment of
someone to act in loco parentis.

290
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,190
代替什么
In loco what?

291
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:35,140
法庭我委派一名你的监护人
It means that the court will appoint an
individual to assume responsibility for you.

292
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,230
我
Me.

293
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,760
谢谢你 但你多管闲事了
I say thanks,but no thanks.

294
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,890
Thea
Thea!

295
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,310
你没有别的选择
You don't actually have a choice.

296
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,950
事实上 我有的选
Oh,actually,I do.

297
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,120
我现在18岁了 我可以自己做决定
See,I'm 18 now and I can
make my own decisions.

298
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:53,660
所以我决定不做你前女友的傀儡
So I decide not to be your
ex-girlfriend's office monkey.

299
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,660
要是你改变主意了 
Well,if you change your mind,then.

300
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,930
谢谢
Thank you.

301
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,700
Thea...你知道问题的严重性吗
Thea... You're in real
trouble,and rightly so.

302
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,170
毒驾
Doing drugs and driving?

303
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,570
这荒唐的没边了 
Laurel为你争取了很好的判决
It is beyond stupid. That is a
good deal that Laurel got you.

304
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,240
你干吗不接受呢
Why aren't you jumping at it?

305
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,650
我已经有妈妈
I already have a mother.

306
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:29,360
所以你要去坐牢 这将毁了你的人生
So... you're going to go to jail and
it will ruin the rest of your life.

307
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,080
不
No.

308
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,600
我要毁了妈妈的生活
I want to ruin mom's life.

309
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,270
她是个骗子 还劈腿
She's a liar and a cheat.

310
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:40,900
承认吧Ollie 你可以假装她是个圣人
I mean,deal with,Ollie. You can pretend
all you want to that she's a saint,

311
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,150
但我恨他 她背叛了爸爸
but I hate her. And she betrayed dad.

312
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,280
所以你去坐牢只是为了报复她
So you're just...you're going
to go to jail to spite her?

313
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:54,490
Thea... 妈妈没有背叛爸
Thea... Mom didn't cheat on dad.

314
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,010
是爸爸出轨了
He cheated on her.

315
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,770
你就只能编这种程度的故事吗
Is that the best you can come up with?

316
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,040
爸爸并非他自己口中那样
Dad wasn't the man he said he was.

317
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:11,880
在他死前承认自己辜负了我们
On "The Queen's Gambit" right before he
died,he admitted to me that he failed us.

318
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:16,400
你 我 还有妈妈
You. Me. And mom.

319
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:22,930
他并非自己口中那般 他甚至希望...
That he wasn't the man he said
he was and that he just wished...

320
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,800
有更多的时间来纠正他的错误
he wished he had more
time to right his wrongs.

321
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,990
我不相信你
I don't believe you.

322
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,480
你信了
Yes,you do.

323
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,900
让我一个人静静
Leave me alone.

324
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,170
你怎么敢
How dare you.

325
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,380
她已经长大了 应该知道真相
She was old enough to know the truth.

326
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,700
Oliver 俄国佬来电话了
Oliver,the Russians called.

327
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,370
会面安排好了
The meet is set.

328
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,000
今晚
It's tonight.

329
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,220
你知道为什么他被称作伯爵吗
You know why they call him The Count?

330
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:15,020
他研发毒品时 拿流浪汉做实验
When he was developing this drug,he
experimented on the homeless.

331
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,360
妓女 流亡者
Prostitutes,runaways.

332
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:23,500
警察发现他们的尸体 
颈部都有穿孔 就像吸血鬼干得
The police would find their bodies,puncture
marks on their neck,like a vampire.

333
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:31,660
你不该这么着急见这个人
You should not be in such
a hurry to meet this man.

334
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,360
谢谢你的礼物
Thank you for this.

335
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,880
但是我一点不在乎警察
But I'm not overly
concerned about the SCPD.

336
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,430
我知道你想要参与快感事业
Now,I understand you gentlemen wish to
participate in the feel good business.

337
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,350
- 是的
- 为什么呢
- Yes.
- And why is that?

338
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,730
因为我要开夜店
Well,I am opening a nightclub,

339
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:03,800
我希望自己顾客享受有一些
额外的玩意
and I'd like my customers to
have a little... something extra.

340
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,850
我也正巧想推广品牌
Well,as it happens,I'm
looking to expand my brand.

341
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,270
好酒的价值在于年份
A good wine's value is
measured by its vintage.

342
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:19,160
取决于发酵的年数
The number of years it took to ferment.

343
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,190
迷魂药则是靠人命发酵的
Vertigo is measured in lives.

344
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,760
56人死于这种极度的快感
56 people died to perfect this high.

345
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:37,600
相信我 他们并非死的没有价值
Believe me when I say that
they did not die for nothing.

346
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,340
警察 放下你们的武器
SCPD! Put your weapons down!

347
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,970
放下
Down!

348
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,010
Oliver
Oliver!

349
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,220
没有目击者哦
No witnesses.

350
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,140
从车里出来
Get out of the car!

351
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,470
- 你没事吧
- 拿着它
- You okay?
- Keep it.

352
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,390
我们得走了 小心脚下
Yeah,we got to go. Steps. Let's go.

353
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,310
Oliver
Oliver!

354
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,300
喝了
Drink.

355
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,260
早上好
Mornin'.

356
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,510
感觉如何
How you feeling?

357
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,000
这是我这辈子最糟的宿醉
I feel like I'm getting the
worst hangover of my life.

358
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,150
你这20几岁都在宿醉的人居然说这样的话
That coming from a guy who spent
most of his twenties in a hangover,

359
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,700
看来这感觉是有够糟的
that's really saying something.

360
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,510
能给我解了吗
You think you can uncuff me?

361
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,320
我不会杀了你
Not going to kill you.

362
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,250
我保证
Promise.

363
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,330
你站起来了
You're standing.

364
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,800
恢复的真快啊
That's pretty impressive.

365
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,310
伯爵只给你注射了一半
The Count only got you with half a dose,

366
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,920
你就流了一地的汗
but you still sweated out a
small swimming pool coming down.

367
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,840
伯爵
The Count.

368
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:03,130
我们的警察朋友抓到了吗
Any chance our friends
in SCPD took him down?

369
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,290
没有 不过我们拿到了这个
None at all,but we
did manage to get this.

370
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,710
可以分析一下
Think we should analyze it.

371
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,350
Oliver 也许你该再休息几个钟头
Listen,Oliver,maybe you
need to give it a few hours.

372
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,750
药量太大 药性没那么快过
A near drug overdose isn't
something you just walk away from.

373
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,070
Thea也一样
Neither is Thea.

374
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,680
怎么回事
What's wrong?

375
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,950
Thea出事了吗
Is everything okay with Thea?

376
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,790
跟你妹没关系 找你呢
This isn't about your
sister,this is about you.

377
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,990
昨晚我们接到线人电话
Last night we got a call from a C.I.,

378
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,520
捣毁了一起大买家和俄国黑帮的交易
busted up a drug sale between a
big time dealer and the Russian mob.

379
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,970
"我们" 你不是负责毒品的吗
"We"? I thought you worked Vice.

380
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,540
联合特遣队 迷魂药的案子调动所有人手
Joint task force. Vertigo's
got everybody holding hands.

381
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:50,870
如我所说 昨晚的毒品交易砸了
Like I said... Last
night,drug deal gone south.

382
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,980
有目击者看到你也在现场
An eyewitness put you at the scene.

383
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,220
不管是谁 肯定看错了
Whoever he is,he's mistaken.

384
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,020
是吗
Yeah?

385
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,780
我可看到你了 Oliver
I saw you,Oliver.

386
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:05,550
你真去了吗
Is this true?

387
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,380
我当时在追查"伯爵"
I was checking into The Count.

388
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,970
他可是卖毒品给Thea的人
He's the guy who sold drugs to Thea.

389
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,210
我以为知道他长相后
And I figured if I could
find out what he looked like,

390
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,180
就能给警局素描师些线索
then I could give your sketch
artist something to go on.

391
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,810
我雇了个俄国口音的混混
So I paid a low-life
with a Russian accent

392
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,710
花了大笔钱 安排会面
an obscene amount of
money to arrange a meeting.

393
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,050
然后呢 看清他了吗
And? Did you get eyes on him?

394
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,610
没
No.

395
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:27,460
你们要起诉我儿子吗
All right,are you pressing
charges against my son?

396
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,110
你若再次涉案 别怪我抓你了
You get involved in this
again,you'll see the inside of a cell,

397
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,200
不会再轻易放过你了
and unlike last time,you
will not see the way out.

398
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,420
警探
Detective.

399
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:42,010
你帮了Thea 我万分感谢
Thank you for what you did for Thea.

400
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,190
我是给我女儿面子
My daughter asked me
for a favor and I did it.

401
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,870
下不为例了
And that's the end of it.

402
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,350
别觉得我出卖了你
Hope you don't think I sold you out.

403
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:59,860
不 职责所在
No. Just doing your job.

404
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,410
你究竟在想什么
What on earth were you thinking?

405
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,640
我只是想帮忙
I was trying to help.

406
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:09,510
跟黑帮毒贩混一起 就算帮忙了吗
By running around with the Russian
mob and a murderous drug dealer?

407
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,730
你疯了吧
Are you out of your mind?!

408
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:15,250
妈妈 真正令你生气的原因
Mom,look,the real reason
that you're upset is

409
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,500
是我告诉Thea 父亲的真面目吧
because I told Thea the truth about dad.

410
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,390
她无需知道那些
She never needed to know that.

411
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:22,030
她无需知道那些
Yes,I did.

412
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:25,750
妈妈 我长大了 足以面对真相了
I'm old enough to know the truth,Mom.

413
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,900
这无关年龄
It wasn't about your age.

414
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:38,290
我不想毁了你心中的父亲
It was about preserving
your memory of your father.

415
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,480
他爱你
He loved you.

416
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,340
过错与否 他都是爱你的
No matter his faults,he loved you.

417
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,280
我曾说 真希望死的是你
I said that I wished you
had died instead of him,

418
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:54,450
可你仍独受委屈 默不作声
but...you still didn't say anything.

419
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,060
为什么这样
Why?

420
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:06,310
待你有幸能有个女儿 就能理解了
One day,I hope you're lucky enough to
have a daughter,and you'll know why.

421
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,500
抱歉我说的那些话
I'm so sorry for what I said.

422
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,500
我知道的
I know,I know.

423
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,100
现在怎么办
Now what?

424
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,020
如你建议 我们分析迷魂药的成分
Like you said,we analyze the Vertigo.

425
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,010
是液态的 说明有水的成分
It's in liquid form,which
means it contains water.

426
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,280
也许我们可以追根溯源 找到伯爵
So maybe we can trace back to
where in the city The Count is...

427
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,950
制造毒品的地方
cooking up this garbage.

428
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,850
等会
Wait!

429
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,960
我自己来
I'll do it.

430
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,690
去医院看看吧
Hey,we need to get you to a hospital.

431
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,600
不用
No.

432
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,210
Oliver 天知道那药什么成分
Oliver,God knows what was in that drug.

433
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,630
可能会造成永久性伤害
It could be causing permanent damage.

434
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,840
Felicity
Felicity.

435
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:52,350
他们说你会在这
Hey,they said you'd be up here.

436
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,800
你邋遢得像是被猫拽进来的
You look like something
the cat dragged in.

437
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,230
我不是说楼里真有猫
Not that there are
cats in this building.

438
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,800
确实进来过猫 警卫处理了
Well,once a cat did get
in,but a guard tazed it.

439
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:04,070
后来整周都有猫毛的味道
It smelled like fur and
static in here for like a week.

440
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,870
你能别靠在窗边吗
Would you mind stepping away
from the window for a moment?

441
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,550
我还没醒酒
I have a little bit of a hangover.

442
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:13,260
你像是需要一杯血腥玛丽和椒盐卷饼
Sounds like you need a
bloody Mary and a pretzel,

443
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,840
而不是信息技术部
not the I.T. Department.

444
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:17,670
实际上 我哥们Kevin开了能量饮料公司
Actually,my buddy Kevin is
starting an energy drink company.

445
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,540
他说那对宿醉有很大帮助
He says it's fantastic
for curing hangovers,

446
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,080
可我对进入身体的东西 比较谨慎
but I am very particular about
what it is I put in my body.

447
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,080
看出来了
I've noticed.

448
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,070
不是 我没注意到
I said,not noticed.

449
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,250
对吧
Right?

450
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,140
我想找出配方
I'm trying to find a secret recipe.

451
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,310
你能对样品进行光谱分析吗
Could you please do a
spectroanalysis of the sample

452
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,440
查出哪里它的制造地
and find out exactly where
in the city it's made?

453
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:45,120
能量饮料干嘛装注射器里
If it's an energy drink,why
is it in a syringe?

454
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:48,210
我没运动水壶
I ran out of sports bottles.

455
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,270
好吧
Okay.

456
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,360
你编的故事越来越狗血了
Your B.S. stories are getting worse.

457
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,880
我知道
I'm well aware.

458
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,890
Felicity应该分析完了
Looks like Felicity came through.

459
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,630
迷魂药样品里的溶剂
The solvent used in the
Vertigo sample was run off water

460
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:14,060
源于东贫民窟和海湾交界处的
十个街区范围内的水
originated within a ten block radius
of where East Glades meets the bay.

461
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,240
那除了三年前废弃的少管所
Nothing there except for an
old juvenile detention center

462
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:19,010
一片荒凉
abandoned about three years ago.

463
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,260
被裁减了
Cutbacks.

464
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,160
可你还是不能去 Oliver
You can't go out there,though,Oliver.

465
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,010
你还受迷魂药的影响
You're still suffering the
after-affects of the Vertigo.

466
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,080
你没听到伯爵说吗
Did you hear The Count?

467
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,220
他要将毒药蔓延至整个城市
He's taking this drug citywide.

468
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,740
现在不阻止 就会成为流行病了
If we don't stop him
now,this becomes an epidemic.

469
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,460
我能阻止你去
I can stop you from leaving.

470
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,490
试试看啊
Try.

471
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,370
Oliver 射中球 就让你去
Oliver,you hit this and you can leave.

472
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,680
想通就好
I'm glad you came to your senses.

473
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,400
记住一件事 Dig
You should always
remember one thing,Dig.

474
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:19,800
什么
What's that?

475
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,590
我不是非弓箭不可
I don't need the bow.

476
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,920
我的线人说的就是这
My C.I. swears this is the place.

477
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,050
带你的人去侧面
Bring your men up on the flank.

478
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,410
- 好 这边
- 跟上
- Okay,this way.
- Follow me.

479
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,890
- 他来了
- 谁来了
- He's here!
- He who?

480
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,690
帽衫男
The Hood!

481
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,650
看样子 今晚不止我们来啊
Looks like we're not the only guests.

482
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,910
你该待在那堕落的金银窝里
You should have stuck
to your depraved elite.

483
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:52,040
人们想要 我就提供
I am merely providing
people with what they want.

484
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,730
我才是人民公仆
I am providing a public service!

485
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,090
我也是
So am I.

486
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:11,390
自食恶果吧
Enjoy the fruits of your labor.

487
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,930
不许动 放下注射器
Freeze! Put down the needle!

488
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,080
否则我就开枪啦
Or I will shoot you!

489
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,650
放下注射器
Put down the syringe.

490
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:32,000
- 他活该
- 这不是法律允许的
- He deserves this!
- Not according to the law.

491
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,630
人们把你当英雄 包括我女儿
The people that think you're
a hero,people like my daughter,

492
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:37,690
若看到你现在 就知道你不是英雄了
if they could see you
now... You're no hero.

493
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:42,730
你就是我常说的 杀手
You're what I always
said you were... a killer.

494
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,600
抓住他
Get him!

495
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,090
叫救护车来 马上
Get me an ambulance. Now!

496
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,870
少年犯来报到了
Juvenile delinquent reporting for duty.

497
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,880
你驾照没了 我五点来接你
Since you lost your driver's
license,I'll pick you up at 5:00.

498
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:08,600
六点吧 今天工作有点多
6:00. We have a lot
of work for her to do.

499
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:11,330
那就七点好了 保险
Well,then,let's say
7:00 just to be safe.

500
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,950
现在反悔 会不会太晚了
Is it too late to choose jail?

501
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,320
- 晚了
- 没错
- Yes.
- Yes.

502
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,120
这些文件 你浏览一遍
I need you to go through these files

503
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:20,260
把07年三月份的文件挑出来
and pull out all the
documents dated March 2007.

504
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,990
你可以的吧
Do you think you could do that?

505
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,270
应该可以
I think I can.

506
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,700
我知道 是我搞砸了
I know I messed up.

507
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,570
你能帮我 万分感谢 Laurel
I really appreciate this,Laurel.

508
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:35,890
我们会帮你抛开过去的 飞毛腿
We are going to make an upstanding
citizen out of you yet,speedy.

509
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,750
谢谢你 有个榜样在身边
Thank you. And this
will be good for her,

510
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,340
对她来说是好事 你比我强多了
having a role model,somebody
better than me.

511
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,270
你也不错啦
Oh,you're not so bad.

512
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,040
更何况 有她作伴 何尝不是好事呢
And besides,it'll be
nice to have her around.

513
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,150
我接个电话 失陪
I got to take this. Excuse me.

514
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,330
你好
Hello?

515
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,650
我们抓到伯爵了
We got The Count.

516
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:59,750
拆了他的实验室 
掌握了他犯罪所有证据
Bust up his lab,got him on everything
from drug trafficking to homicide.

517
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,560
要关很久了
He'll be gone for a long while.

518
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,590
太好了 谢谢你
That's great,thanks.

519
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,200
见到你真好 Oliver
It was great seeing you,Oliver.

520
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,740
我也是
You,too.

521
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,020
回见
See ya.

522
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,040
他还在危险期
He's still critical.

523
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:20,130
我从没见过被注射了这么大量的
迷魂药还活下来的人
I've never seen anyone OD on
this much Vertigo and live.

524
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,880
无法想象他大脑和神经系统
There's just no way of knowing
what kind of damage has been done

525
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,990
经受着多大损伤
to his brain and nervous system.

526
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,110
不知道能不能恢复了
Or if its irreparable.

527
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,680
生存...
Shengeun...

528
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,840
活下去
Survive.

529
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:09,010
谢谢你来见我 去你家我会紧张
Thanks for meeting me. I
was...nervous to come to your house.

530
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,650
好吧...
Okay...

531
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:17,160
这几周 我在纠结是否告诉你
The thing is,I've been debating whether
or not to share this with you for weeks.

532
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,400
我能相信你吗

我不是白痴

534
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,800
你骗我的故事太扯了
You've dropped some fairly
ridiculous lies on me,

535
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:30,100
可我还是觉得能相信你
and...yet I still feel
like I can trust you.

536
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,620
怎么会这样
Why is that?

537
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,590
我长了张正直脸呢
I have one of those faces.

538
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,150
抱歉
Sorry.

你可以相信我
You can trust me.

541
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,680
我有东西给你看
Then I have something to show you.

542
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,490
你之前见过这个吗
Have you ever seen this before?

543
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:16,130
没
No.

544
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:19,880
你哪来的
Where'd you get it?

545
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:22,890
你继父那
From your stepfather.

546
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,750
Walter那里啊
From Walter.

547
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,350
那他是哪来的
Um... Well,where did he get it?

548
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:37,160
他说是在你家找到的
He said he found it in your house.

549
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,880
是你母亲的东西
That it belongs to your mother.

550
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:45,870
Walter觉得她有事瞒他
Walter thought she was hiding something.

551
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:48,900
不止是这些...
Something more,and...

552
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:53,400
他让我查 自己却消失了
He wanted me to look into
it,but then he vanished.

553
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:58,070
这东西或许害了Walter
I think this list might
have cost Walter his life.

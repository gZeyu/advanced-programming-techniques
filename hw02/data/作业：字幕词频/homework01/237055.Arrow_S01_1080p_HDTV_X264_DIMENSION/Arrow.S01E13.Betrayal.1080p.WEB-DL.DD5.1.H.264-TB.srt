1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,340
我叫Oliver Queen
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:09,650
被困在孤岛上5年以来
我只有一个目标...活下去
For five years,I was stranded on an
island with only one goal... survive.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,380
Oliver Queen还活着
Oliver Queen is alive.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,150
现在 我要完成我父亲的夙愿
Now I will fulfill my
father's dying wish...

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:19,270
根据他留给我的名单
除掉那些毒害我城市的人
to use the list of names he left me and
bring down those who are poisoning my city.

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,950
为了完成目标 我必须扮成别人
To do this,I must become someone else.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,060
我必须掩盖身份
I must become something else.

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,380
绿箭侠 前情提要
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,740
下次你女儿和义务警员联系时
我们能一字不漏地监听
Next time your daughter calls the
Vigilante,we'll be able to listen to every word.

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,920
我知道你发誓要抓住他 警长
I know you swore to bring
this guy down,detective,

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:39,200
可用女儿当诱饵 太冷血了吧
but using your own daughter
as bait,that's stone cold.

12
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,240
- 哪来的
- 你继父给我的
- Where'd you get it?
- From your stepfather.

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,870
他从哪得来的
And where did he get it?

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,350
你妈那
Belongs to your mother.

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,710
嗨 George
Hi,George.

16
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,170
- Vanch
- 见到我很惊讶吗
- Vanch...
- Surprised to see me?

17
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,970
我想你应该在观望如何搞砸我的审讯
I imagine you would be,seeing
as how you botched my trial,

18
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,840
Viv说这是在维护我的利益
and from what Viv here tells
me,protecting my interests.

19
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,500
有不可预测的因素介入嘛
There were contingencies
that couldn't be anticipated.

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,640
没错 Vivian和我说了
Yes,Vivian told me.

21
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,440
三合会的头被暴露了
Bertinelli也被抓了
The head of the Triad getting
ventilated,Bertinelli getting collared,

22
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,440
还有那个弓箭手
and,uh,this archer.

23
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,110
是啊
Exactly.

24
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,340
碰到这种事我该怎么办呢
What am I supposed to do in
the face of something like that?

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,710
什么都不用做 Georgie 这么说吧
Absolutely nothing,Georgie.
Tell you what.

26
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,020
啥都不怪你 抱一个
All is forgiven. Give us a hug.

27
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,360
来
Come on.

28
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,160
我可以找个地方待一段时间
缓缓我的晕船 George
You know,I could use a place to stay while
I'm getting my sea legs back under me,George.

29
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,240
你这地方不错
And you got a nice place here.

30
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,220
怎么说 George
What do you say? George?

31
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,880
George
George?

32
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,500
希望George买了食物
I hope George has been food shopping.

33
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,440
我可饿坏了
I'm famished.

34
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,730
这个本子是你在猎捕的人的名单
So this book contains a list of the
names of the guys you've been hunting.

35
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,800
而你妈的这本 有同样的名单
And this book,your mother's,has
the same list of names.

36
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,800
完全一样
It's identical.

37
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,360
你妈是从哪得来的 Oliver
So where'd your mother
get her copy,Oliver?

38
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,380
说到这个 这本是谁给你的
For that matter,who gave it to you?

39
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,460
Felicity Smoak
Felicity Smoak.

40
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,390
她说Walter在他们房间里发现的
She said that Walter
found it in their bedroom.

41
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,940
现在他失踪了
And now he's missing.

42
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,580
她是我妈 Diggle
She's my mother,Diggle.

43
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,190
- 她不是那种能够...
- 让她丈夫消失的人吗
- She's not the kind of person who would...
- Have her husband disappeared?

44
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,340
问题就在这里 Oliver
Because that's really the
question,isn't it,Oliver?

45
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,050
我理解相对于继父你更相信你母亲
I understand why you would believe
your mother over your stepfather,

46
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:06,460
但我更愿相信失踪的那方
或者假设已死的那方
but I tend to believe the innocent party
is whoever's missing... and presumed dead.

47
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,560
动一下我就割了你的喉
Twitch,and I will open your throat.

48
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,230
有多少人跟着你
How many more with you?

49
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,220
什么
What?!

50
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:49,470
给你十秒说服我 不然我就杀了你
You have ten seconds to tell me something
I believe before I cut out your voice box.

51
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,390
等等
Wait,wait,wait.

52
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,570
姚飞让我来这的 我确定你不会杀我的
Yao Fei sent me here,and I'm pretty
sure it wasn't so you could kill me.

53
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,830
什么
What?

54
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,480
姚飞
Yao Fei.

55
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,960
他给了我你飞机的位置
He gave me directions to your... plane.

56
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,310
Frank 你跟我开玩笑吧
Frank,you got be kidding me.

57
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,380
你现在可不能给我别的任务
You can't throw me
another assignment now.

58
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,200
是副官的意思
我很确定他给了我这个权力
It's Lieutenant,and I'm pretty sure
that's what gives me the authority.

59
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,730
帽衫侠的调查日渐清晰了
I'm drawing in on the
Hood investigation.

60
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,400
我能抓到那个混蛋
I am going to get this bastard.

61
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,020
你没想过没人想要你这么做吗
Have you considered the
possibility no one wants you to?

62
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,070
什么
What?

63
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,270
他在圣诞节救了人质
He saved the Christmas hostages.

64
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,460
他拿下了纵火犯和开装甲车的贼
He took down an arsonist
and armored car thieves,

65
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,090
上周他还捣毁了
我们根本抓不到的毒品集团
and just last week,he busted the
Vertigo drug ring when we couldn't.

66
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,830
都市传奇成为英雄了
What was urban legend's becoming heroic.

67
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,530
这人称得上英雄的话
我不知道我身为警察的意义何在
If this man's a hero,I don't know what
my life in this city as a cop means.

68
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,750
那我建议你服从命令
Let me suggest you find
meaning in following orders.

69
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,260
Frank 听着
Frank,listen!

70
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,720
我已经很靠近了
I'm close.

71
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,340
如果我能再查到些...
If my lead comes to something more...

72
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,530
Quentin 拿点有用的来 我们再谈
Come to me with something
real,Quentin,and we'll talk.

73
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,330
同时你还得接新的案子
In the meantime,I'm
assigning you another case.

74
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,950
准备出去吗
Heading out?

75
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,830
是的 和财政规划员的一个会
Oh,yeah,it's a meeting
with the financial planners.

76
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,330
有什么事吗
Are you all right?

77
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,760
我想和你谈一件事
There was something that I
wanted to talk to you about.

78
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,670
想和你谈谈Walter
I want to talk to you about Walter.

79
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:26,540
圣诞节那会 他消失的时候 给了我这个
Right around Christmas,when
he...disappeared,he gave me this.

80
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,370
这是你爸的笔记本
This is your father's notebook.

81
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,590
他把斯特林市所有
欠他人情的人列了个名单
He kept a list of all the people in
Starling City who owed him favors.

82
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,640
我不知道竟然有这么多
I had...no idea there
was so many of them.

83
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:48,300
我在网上查了这些人
他们都不是什么好人
I've just been researching some of those
names online,and,um,they're not good people.

84
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,400
Oliver
我不知道你爸跟这些人有什么关系
Oliver,I have no idea what your
father was involved in or with whom.

85
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,190
你和你妹妹都知道
他其实并没有对我坦诚
And you and your sister both now know
that he wasn't exactly honest with me.

86
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,890
- 那我们就得找出...
- 不
- Then we need to find out...
- no.

87
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,680
如果你说的是真的
这个名单上都是坏人
If what you say is true and this
list is filled with bad people

88
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,540
Walter又在调查 而他现在...
and Walter was looking
into it,and now he...

89
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,150
要让这个家庭安全的唯一办法
The only way to keep this family safe is

90
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,550
就是所有人不许再有任何疑问
包括你 Oliver
for everyone in it to stop asking
questions,including you,Oliver.

91
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,980
答应我
Promise me.

92
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,170
这是真的诶
So this is really happening.

93
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,070
498小时的社区服务
498 hours of community service to go.

94
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,000
499小时 这个报到会不算
499. This orientation doesn't count.

95
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,550
告诉我这不是残酷惩罚
Tell me how this is not
cruel and unusual punishment.

96
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,560
Anastasia 向你介绍下
我们的新实习生 Thea Queen
Anastasia,I'd like you to
meet our new intern,Thea Queen.

97
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,570
实习生是有学校信誉的
我更像法庭派遣的奴隶
Interns get school credit. I'm
more like a court-ordered slave.

98
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,290
我赞同
I can relate.

99
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,330
Anastasia现在是在她律所
给的无偿休假期间
Anastasia is on a one year pro-bono
sabbatical from her law firm.

100
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,600
没有六位数的薪水
And apparently from
my six figure salary.

101
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,380
帮助他人的经历就是酬劳所在
The experience of helping
others is its own reward.

102
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,270
我还没看到任何证据能证明
I have yet to see any evidence of that.

103
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,330
说到缺少证据
Cyrus Vanch被释放了
And speaking a lack of evidence,Cyrus
Vanch was released from Iron Heights.

104
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,690
我们代表维护受害者组织
准备把Vanch再关进去
We represent a victim's advocacy group
who's trying to keep Vanch locked up.

105
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,650
- 我去联系Kate Spencer
- 我已经联系过了
- I'm calling Kate Spencer.
- I already did.

106
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,170
她说没有进一步证据之前
地检也无能为力
She said there's nothing the D.A.'s
office can do without further evidence.

107
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,130
我去她办公室说
Well,then I'm going to her office.

108
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,720
她还说不要去她办公室
And then she also said not
to show up at her office.

109
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,460
Vanch有过人口贩卖 毒品交易 敲诈勒索
Vanch is connected to human
trafficking,drug running,racketeering,

110
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,440
还有至少52项杀人罪
and at least 52 different homicides.

111
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,490
好吧 那你准备怎么办
除非你有私家警队
Ok,so what's the play? Because unless you
have access to some private police force,

112
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,260
Vanch还是能逍遥法外
Vanch will stay free
to roam the streets.

113
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,860
我得接个电话 喂
I have to get this. Hello?

114
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,210
晚上和我还有一堆有名大厨过如何
How does a night with me and
a dozen famous chefs sound?

115
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,540
就像"亿万未婚夫"里的桥段吗
Like an episode of "The Bachelor".

116
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,190
明晚我要面试俱乐部的大厨
I'm auditioning potential chefs
for the club tomorrow night.

117
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,670
我预约了一次试吃
多个人帮忙尝也不错哦
I've arranged a tasting,and I could
use an extra set of taste buds.

118
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,960
我在想办法让一个重犯回监狱
没时间呢
I'm trying to figure out how to get a
vicious criminal back in jail. I can't.

119
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,970
很好啊 像是很饥渴的工作
It's perfect. It
sounds like hungry work.

120
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,410
明晚吧
Tomorrow night?

121
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,300
也许我们能早点完工
Maybe,if we could do it early.

122
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,130
我得挂了
Look,I got to go.

123
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,430
我还要打给另一个人
There's someone I have to call.

124
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,980
晚点见 拜
I'll see you later. Bye.

125
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,390
你没觉得这太轻易了吗
You don't find that a little convenient,

126
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,010
她就这么烧了那本本子
her just so happening
to have burned the book?

127
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,080
她是出于我的安全考虑 Diggle
She did it out of concern
for my safety,Diggle.

128
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,850
或是她自己的 Oliver 你自己说过
Or her own. Oliver,you said it yourself.

129
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,290
列这个名单的人有危险因素
Whoever compiled that list is
involved in something very dangerous.

130
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,080
如果你妈在骗你
And if your mother is lying to you...

131
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,270
她不知道名单上的名字
And she didn't know any
of the names on the list.

132
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,010
她自己说不知道
She said she didn't.

133
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,660
你不用相信她
You don't have to take her word for it.

134
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,200
Oliver 如果另有其人
你现在应该装备起来
Oliver,if this were anybody
else,you'd be hooded up right now

135
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,890
拿着箭和他们说话
on your way to having an
arrow-side chat with them.

136
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,030
这不是别人 是我妈
This isn't anybody
else. This is my mother.

137
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,580
我了解她
And I know her.

138
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,150
那是什么
What's that?

139
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,170
这是我给Lance的手机
好让他联系帽衫侠
That is the phone that I gave to Lance
so that he could contact the Hood.

140
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,930
他现在让你去自首吗
Is he asking to turn yourself in?

141
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,450
他给Laurel了 喂
He gave it to Laurel. Hello?

142
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,840
- 我需要你帮助
- 所以才给你手机
- I need your help.
- That's why you have the phone.

143
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,240
Cyrus Vanch法律上被释放了
Cyrus Vanch was just released
from prison on a technicality.

144
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,670
在他律师家安顿着
Living large in his lawyer's house.

145
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,120
没有不正当行为的证据
There's no evidence of foul play.

146
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,060
但我知道他是Vanch的第一个受害者
也不会是最后一个
But I know he's just Vanch's first
victim,and he won't be his last.

147
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,630
为什么不求助警察
What about the police?

148
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,740
没有新的犯罪活动我们动不了他
They can't move on him without
evidence of new criminal activity.

149
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,320
Laurel 我不是收集证据的
Laurel,obtaining
evidence isn't what I do.

150
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,050
Vanch很危险
Vanch is dangerous.

151
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,720
带着手机 一会再联系
Hold on to the phone,I'll call.

152
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,320
Laurel需要我的帮助
Laurel needs my help.

153
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,780
Oliver 你是赶着去帮她...
还是逃避你母亲的真相
Oliver,are you running to help her...
or away from the truth about your mother?

154
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,840
我有事要忙
I have work to do.

155
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,780
警长
Hey,Detective?

156
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,060
我忙着呢 Kelton
I'm busy,Kelton.

157
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,760
我打赌你想听这消息
I'm pretty sure you're
going to want to hear this.

158
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,670
我在义务警员手机里
安装的窃听器有反应了
The bug I put in that phone
from the Vigilante just lit up.

159
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,810
你女儿又开始给他报信了
Your daughter's playing Maid
Marion to Robin Hood again.

160
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
你去哪里
Where you going?

161
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,470
Pike副队办公室
Lieutenant Pike's office.

162
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,050
她要是去见绿箭侠
If she's meeting with the Hood,

163
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,680
那就必须有特遣小队陪同
there's going to be a task
force there when she does.

164
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,540

167
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,830
我们要把这些看成是一次契机
See,we got to look at all
this as an opportunity.

168
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,720
Triad和Bertinelli集团缺乏领导力
The Triad and the Bertinelli
organization are leaderless.

169
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,590
而他们就像斯特林市的权利吸尘器
The giant sucking sound you're hearing is
the current power vacuum in Starling City,

170
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,750
我将把它掌握在手中
the one that I plan on filling.

171
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,550
你怎么说服 Triad和Bertinelli的员工
How are you going to convince
the Triad and Bertinelli's crew

172
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,510
他们为什么要听从你
that they should sign up with you?

173
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,980
这...是个好问题
Well... that's an excellent question.

174
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,960
我先得示威
I need to do something.

175
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,530
华丽丽的登场
Something spectacular.

176
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,940
以赢得他们的注意以及尊重
To get their attention
and earn their respect.

177
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,290
监狱生活让我学到很多
You know what I learned in prison?

178
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:29,420
如果你想获得尊重
那就先把最强大的人放倒
If you want to be respected,you find the
biggest guy and you put him down permanent.

179
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,330
我想我找到试刀目标了
I think I just found the biggest guy.

180
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,180
这样挺好玩的
This is going to be fun.

181
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,540
我把肥肥裤都穿来了
I even wore my fat pants.

182
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,900
肥肥裤不在我的字典里对吧
I don't want to know
what those are,do I?

183
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,160
是的
Nope.

184
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,390
工作上的事
This is work.

185
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,630
一会就好
It'll just be a second,okay?

186
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,710
- 喂
- 是我 我有消息了
- Hello?
- It's me. I have something.

187
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,690
能见面吗
Can you meet?

188
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,180
好的 哪里
Yeah,where?

189
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,180
Winick大楼楼顶 30分钟后见
Rooftop,Winick building. 30 minutes.

190
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,400
干得好 Kelton
Good work,Kelton.

191
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,230
好了 大伙
Okay,everybody.

192
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,850
都用橡胶子弹 我女儿也在场
Rubber bullets. This
is my daughter here.

193
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,530
她不能受到任何伤害
She cannot come to any harm.

194
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:23,170
除此之外 你们可以无所不用的
把那个射箭男拿下
But outside of that,you do whatever
needs doing to bring that archer down.

195
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,770
你确定吗
You sure about this?

196
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,450
她知道我为了抓这混蛋会不择手段
Look,she knows I'd do
anything to catch this bastard.

197
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,600
这是最好 也是我唯一的机会
And this is the best... it's
the only option I've got.

198
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,790
我和你一样渴望抓到这家伙
Look,I want to get this
guy just as badly as you do.

199
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,390
我只是不希望你们之间产生间隙
I just don't want to see
anything come between you two.

200
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,660
我警告过她 让她离这个疯子远点
I warned her. I said stay
away from this lunatic.

201
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,390
但她没有
She didn't.

202
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:43,100
你不觉得我也很心寒吗
You don't think that
turns a knife in my back?

203
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,080
希望她能想到这层
I hope she sees it that way.

204
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,690
收起这可怜的小眼神
Mmm,put those puppy dog eyes away.

205
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,950
工作上突然有些事
Something's come up at work.

206
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,640
不能明天再做吗
That can't wait until tomorrow?

207
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,170
最多一个小时 我们俱乐部见
It'll only be an hour. I
can meet you at the club.

208
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,400
一个小时
One hour.

209
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,970
最多一个半小时
An hour and a half. Tops.

210
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,360
Ricky做了我6年半的司机
Ricky has been driving
me for six years now.

211
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,600
我都不记得他请过假
I can't remember the
last time he missed a day.

212
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,250
谢谢你主动请缨 Diggle先生
Thank you for offering
to fill in,Mr. Diggle.

213
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,980
乐意效劳  Queen太太 相信我
It's my pleasure,Mrs. Queen. Believe me.

214
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,110
你确定我儿子不会想你吗
Are you sure my son won't miss you?

215
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,360
他说晚上不出门
He said he was staying
in for the evening.

216
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,020
你真的信他了
And you believed him?

217
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,100
我已经认清了
你儿子想要做私事时
It's been my experience when
your son wants some alone time,

218
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,980
我是想拦也拦不住的
there's not much I can do to stop him.

219
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,800
这让我很头疼
Much to my chagrin.

220
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,560
前面停车
You can stop just up ahead.

221
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,420
不用送我进去了
No need to escort me inside.

222
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,020
我一个人没事 Diggle先生
I'm fine on my own,Mr. Diggle.

223
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,210
好的 Queen太太
Of course,Mrs. Queen.

224
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,240
- Diggle先生
- Queen太太
- Mr. Diggle.
- Mrs. Queen.

225
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,750
我只是在找洗手间
I was just,uh,looking for the restroom.

226
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,680
打扰了女士们 生日快乐
Excuse me,ladies. Happy Birthday.

227
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,750
你好 Laurel
Hello,Laurel.

228
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,280
感谢你的帮助
Thank you for helping.

229
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,020
我帮不了太多
I couldn't do much.

230
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,800
Vanch的老巢守卫森严
Vanch's position is
too heavily fortified.

231
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,460
但我拿到了这个
But I did get this.

232
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,890
证明他企图取代Frank Bertinelli
Evidence he's trying to take
over the positions vacated

233
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:23,600
以及Triad位置的证据
by Frank Bertinelli
and... and the Triad.

234
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,680
怎么了
What's wrong?

235
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,220
- 这里还有别人
- 什么
- We're not alone.
- What?!

236
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,470
警察
SCPD!

237
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,350
放下武器 把手放到我们能看见的地方
Get down! Hands where we can see 'em!

238
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,670
- 爸
- 马上
- Dad!
- Do it now!

239
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,970
你要是伤她一根汗毛
You so much as leave a bruise on her,

240
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,930
我发誓一定让你下地狱
and I swear I will drag
you down to hell myself.

241
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,350
Laurel 抱歉
Laurel,I'm sorry.

242
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,300
Quentin 不要
Quentin,don't!

243
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:18,700
我不知道是你骗了我比较糟糕
还是差点害死我更糟
I don't know what's worse... the fact that
you lied to me or nearly got me killed!

244
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,140
你是绝对安全的
You were completely safe.

245
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:24,200
我在楼顶上 被一群人用枪指着脑袋
I was on a rooftop with an army of
men pointing their guns in my face!

246
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,440
你本来就不该出现在那里
Well,you shouldn't have been
on that roof in the first place.

247
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,040
不 你可希望我出现了
No! You wanted me on that roof.

248
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,120
这不是你埋伏的根本所在吗
Wasn't that the whole
point of your little trap?

249
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,320
我这是在抓杀人犯
I'm trying to catch a killer.

250
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,550
你利用了我
You manipulated me.

251
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,180
利用 根本是自己跑去找这家伙的
Manipulated? You
practically ran to this guy.

252
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,580
我跟你说过离他远点 但是你没有
I told you,I said stay away
from him and you did not.

253
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,810
- 那是在你给我电话以前
- 什么
- That was before you gave me the phone!
- What?!

254
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,560
在你意识到可以
用自己的女儿做诱饵之前
That's before you realized that you
could use me as bait. Your own daughter.

255
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,000
是啊 但是你不听我话
Yeah,but you wouldn't listen to me!

256
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,090
你被对他的仇恨蒙蔽了
You are so blinded by your hate for him

257
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,180
以致你看不见这对你的生活
that you don't realize the damage
that it's doing in your own life.

258
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,610
对你家人的伤害
To your family.

259
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,680
你抓到他又怎样
So what happens when you catch him?

260
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,850
然后又怎样呢 爸爸
What happens then,Dad?

261
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:03,110
你就再找一个罪犯
为母亲的离开找个发泄对象
You're going to find another criminal;
somebody else to blame for mom leaving?

262
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,100
还是为Sarah的死 还是你的酗酒
For Sarah dying,for your drinking?

263
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:07,910
够了 Laurel
That's enough,Laurel.

264
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,500
你说得对 的确够了
Yeah,you're damn right,it is.

265
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,330
Laurel
Laurel!

266
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,490
电话
The phone.

267
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,320
电话还给我
Give me the phone.

268
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,310
Laurel可能会受伤 甚至更糟
Laurel could have been hurt,or worse.

269
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,290
大概Lance的错吧
And I suppose that was Lance's fault.

270
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,890
你想说什么 Dig
What's your point,Dig?

271
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,680
只要是Laurel或者你妈妈的事
Just that you don't really see
straight when it comes to Laurel.

272
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,110
你就不能冷静对待
Or your mother.

273
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,770
现在不适合谈这个
This is not the time
to bring this up again.

274
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,930
好吧
Ok. Ok.

275
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,960
但有些话 我还是早说的好
But there's something I should tell you
and it's better I tell you now than later.

276
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,720
我给你妈妈开了好几天车
I'll be driving your mother
around for a few days.

277
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,640
- 你在监视她
- 我只是在尽职调查 Oliver
- You're spying on her?!
- Just doing my due diligence,Oliver.

278
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,660
看看她是否与我们的目标有接触
See if she meets with anyone
we might be interested in.

279
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,990
她不是嫌犯
She's not a suspect.

280
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,020
她是我妈妈
She's my mother.

281
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:07,410
所以才需要有人能客观的调查她
Which is exactly why someone needs
to take a close,objective look at her.

282
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:11,430
Oliver 这座城市背后
有巨大的阴谋 你明白的
Oliver,something's going on
in this city. You know it.

283
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,520
这不能说明她也参与了
That doesn't mean she's involved.

284
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:25,460
那我给她开几天车也没什么问题吧
Then there's no harm in me driving
her around for a few days,is there?

285
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,090
我仍然不敢相信 他把我当作诱饵
I still can't believe
it. He used me as bait!

286
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,440
- 谁
- 我爸
Who? My father.

287
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,430
他想抓住义务警员
He was trying to catch the Vigilante.

288
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,370
他窃听了我们的通话
He eavesdropped on my
phone conversation with him

289
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,260
然后就埋伏在我们约好的地点
and then lied in wait
with his jack boots.

290
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,870
- 今晚的事
- 是的
This was tonight? Yes.

291
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,020
在你工作的时候
While you were working.

292
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,780
这就是工作
This was work.

293
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,790
所以你和这个帽衫男约了见面
So you met up with the
Hood guy? Knowingly?

294
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,110
他以前联系过我
He's contacted me before.

295
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,500
Declan的案子以及Joanna的纵火案
都是他帮了我
He helped me with the Declan case
and Joanna's arson investigation.

296
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,000
Declan的案子是好几个月前了
The Declan case was months ago.

297
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,990
我知道 Tommy 我一直想告诉你
I know,Tommy,I've been
wanting to tell you.

298
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,670
Laurel 他是个杀人犯
Laurel,he's a murderer!

299
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,120
天哪 你这口气好像我爸爸
God. You sound like my father.

300
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,410
虽然我不想这么说 但你爸爸是对的
Well,I hate to break it
to you,but he's right.

301
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,420
你要站在他那边
Are you seriously taking his side?

302
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,760
这几个星期 他一直在骗我
He's been lying to me for weeks!

303
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,460
很不好受 对吧
Yeah,it feels like crap,doesn't it?

304
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,480
Tommy
Tommy!

305
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,370
昨夜斯特林市警方对臭名昭著的义务警员
展开了一场诱捕行动
A sting operation to catch the notorious
Starling City vigilante wreaked havoc last night.

306
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,880
虽然警方未能成功逮捕治安维持者
Despite the police's failed
attempt to apprehend the Vigilante,

307
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,640
警方仍强调 市民需提高警惕
police have continued to insist
that their warnings remain.

308
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,750
该义务警员手持弓箭 极端危险
This archer is to be
considered armed and dangerous.

309
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,230
如果您受到袭击 千万记得报警
Should you find yourself in harm's
way,always always,call 9-1-1.

310
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,070
有意思
Interesting.

311
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,210
用欺骗和恐吓 来扬名天下
Using deception and intimidation
to make a name for himself.

312
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,400
这家伙抄袭我嘛
This guy stole my move.

313
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,760
警署的朋友
I have news.

314
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:01,010
告诉我一个内部消息
From my friend in the police department.

315
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,630
我想我有办法把帽衫男引出来
I think I've figured out a way to
get the Hood out and into the open.

316
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,630
说来听听
Astonish me.

317
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,820
还记得那位律师
Remember that attorney?

318
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,330
Laurel Lance
Laurel Lance?

319
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,480
我没看错吧
Now what's wrong with this picture?

320
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:22,670
你看起来像是...在工作
You look like you're...working.

321
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,380
我正在筛选简历 给夜总会挑个厨师
I'm going over résumes for the
Chef's position at the nightclub.

322
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,960
这个看起来不错
他赢得了"最佳厨师"第六季的冠军
This guy looks pretty good.
He won "Top Chef" Season Six.

323
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:33,500
能上这个节目 厨艺肯定不错
At this point,it is basically a
culinary prerequisite to be on that show.

324
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,130
我可以跟你谈谈吗
Can I talk to you about something?

325
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,070
Tommy...每次你想跟我谈谈
Tommy... Every time you want
to talk to me about something

326
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:41,990
总是关于Laurel
and that something is Laurel,

327
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:45,710
你看起来就像 要告诉我你得绝症了
you look like you're about to tell
me you have a terminal disease.

328
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,260
她一直和帽衫男有合作
She's been working with the Hood guy.

329
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,500
什么
What?

330
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,470
你让她和那个疯子合作
她会因此受伤的 Tommy
You're letting her work with that
crazy person? She could get hurt,Tommy.

331
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,590
我没有"让"她做任何事 好吗
I'm not "letting" her do anything,okay?

332
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,620
我刚刚才发现
I only just found out about it

333
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,370
因为她谎言败露了
because she accidentally slipped
up on one of her many lies.

334
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,580
撒谎 这可不像Laurel的作风
She's lying to you? That
doesn't sound like Laurel.

335
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,450
谎话连篇 不告诉大家 自己跟谁在一起
Lying,keeping secrets about
who she's spending time with...

336
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,660
是不是很像我们认识的谁
does that remind you of anybody we know?

337
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,450
我 每段关系中的我
Me,in every relationship
that I've been in.

338
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,210
我也是 除了这段
Me,too. Except this one.

339
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,940
Laurel有点迷恋上了帽衫男
There's some sort of
infatuation thing going on here.

340
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:29,000
我...我们都知道
I... We both know that she has
a pretty strong track record

341
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,540
她过去常常被危险的人 出格的人吸引
of being attracted to guys who
are dangerous,who break the rules.

342
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,890
谁又能比帽衫男更危险更出格呢
Show me a more dangerous
rule breaker than the Hood.

343
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,540
我觉得你应该跟她好好谈谈
I just think you need to
have an honest chat with her.

344
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,920
找出她撒谎的真正原因
Find out the real reason
she's keeping secrets.

345
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,140
我只是无法相信所有人中
偏偏是Laurel会当着我的面撒谎
I just can't believe that Laurel,of
all people,would lie to my face.

346
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,340
我想...这是因为她是我最亲近的人
I guess that's the way that it is
with the people that you're closest to.

347
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,150
我知道
I know.

348
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,000
不管怎样 在事情变得无法收拾前
But talk to her anyway,and fix this.

349
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,400
跟她好好谈谈 处理好这件事
Before it becomes
something that's unfixable.

350
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,520
生存
Shengcun.

351
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,400
- 这是中文 意思是...
- 生存
- It's Chinese. It means sur...
- Survive.

352
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:20,450
你觉得他是什么意思
除了不要被杀了
What do you think he
meant,besides not getting killed?

353
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,770
十公里外有个机场
There's an airfield 10 clicks from here.

354
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,380
是离开这座岛的关键
It's key off this island.

355
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,330
我和姚飞观察它好几个月了
Yao Fei and I had been
observing it for months,

356
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,920
熟悉他们的行动
familiarizing ourselves
with their operations.

357
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,290
我们本该一起离开这座岛
We were supposed to get
off this island together.

358
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:37,010
但后来姚飞遭突袭 我们走散了
But then Yao Fei was
compromised,and we were separated.

359
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,280
这是做什么
What's this for?

360
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:49,570
姚飞派你过来 可能是...
他觉得我一个人不可能成功
I think Yao Fei sent you because he
knows I cannot take the airstrip alone.

361
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,960
和姚飞口气真像
Sounds like Yao Fei.

362
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:54,570
他可比我心软多了
He is a softer judge
of character than I am.

363
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:00,240
如果你要让我帮你
我得知道你能不能胜任
If you're going to have my back,I
need to know you can cover it.

364
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,460
愣着干嘛
What are you doing?

365
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,640
回击
Fight back.

366
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:16,420
拔出你的剑 千万别放手
Keep your blade up. Always
stay behind your sword.

367
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,940
你没有技巧 没有力量
You have no skill. No strength.

368
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,470
没有受过训练
No training.

369
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,810
说你像个娘们都太抬举你了
To say you fight like a
girl would be a compliment.

370
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,200
告诉过你...我不是士兵
I told you... I'm not a soldier.

371
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:37,120
游艇失事我才来了这
无意中我杀了穿这身制服的人
I was shipwrecked here. I killed the guy
that was wearing this uniform by accident.

372
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,940
姚飞在哪
Where was Yao Fei?

373
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,430
他让我快逃
He told me to run.

374
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,680
所以我逃了
And I did.

375
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,600
嗨 我是Tommy 嘟声之后请留言
Hey,it's Tommy,hit me on the beep.

376
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,860
嗨 又是我
Hey,it's me again.

377
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,670
给我回个电话吧
Please call me back.

378
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,720
我们应该谈谈
I think we should talk.

379
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,000
我正给你留言呢
I was just leaving you a message.

380
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,950
我喜欢有两下子的女人
I love a girl who can
take care of herself.

381
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,080
不过终究躲不过电击枪
But can't block a taser.

382
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,970
Diggle先生 不用下车了
Oh,no need to get out
of the car,Mr. Diggle.

383
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,550
只是去见我的会计师
It's just my accountant.

384
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,410
除了无聊 啥也没有
The only threat is boredom.

385
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,860
没关系 Queen夫人 这是我的职责
Well,it's no problem at
all,Mrs. Queen. It's my job.

386
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,240
嗯 你晚上放假吧
Yes. Well,then,take the night off.

387
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,630
我没事
I'm quite all right.

388
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,220
处理好了
It's taken care of.

389
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,300
我已经把它处理好了
I've taken care of it.

390
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,130
Carl Ballard不是问题了
Carl Ballard will not
be a problem anymore.

391
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,900
你一向小心谨慎
Given your propensity for squeamishness,

392
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,590
我猜Ballard先生 应该还活得好好的
I'm assuming that Mr. Ballard
remains in good health.

393
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:38,110
我让他很清楚地明白了
他的计划妨碍到了我们的大计
I made it clear to him persuasively that
his plans endangered the undertaking.

394
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,950
我没必要威胁他吧
I didn't have to make the usual threats.

395
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,800
很好
Excellent.

396
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,050
现在 还有件事要你办
Now,one more matter to attend to.

397
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:52,360
我要你按这个地址
把里面的东西彻底销毁了
I need you to have to contents of this
address removed and disposed of thoroughly.

398
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:58,090
你存放游艇残骸的仓库
The warehouse where you're storing
the remains of "the Queen's Gambit".

399
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,680
我早告诉过你
我知道Robert的游艇被人动了手脚
I already told you,I knew
Robert's yacht was sabotaged.

400
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,830
其他人知道了蛛丝马迹可不好
And I don't think it serves for
anyone to find evidence of that.

401
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,350
你在做什么
What the hell are you doing?

402
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,540
没什么 只是逛逛
Nothin'. Just hangin'.

403
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,400
我给Queen夫人工作
I work for Mrs. Queen.

404
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,330
我负责她会面的那位先生的安全
And I work security for
the man she's meeting with.

405
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,720
我想我们是一个团队的
I guess that means
we're on the same team.

406
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:26,020
我可不这么想
把你口袋里的东西拿出来
I don't think so. And I'm going to need to
see what you put in your pocket just then.

407
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,740
你是什么人 警察
What are you,man,the police?

408
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,230
把它拿出来
Show it to me.

409
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,000
马上
Do it now.

410
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,090
好的
Right.

411
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,230
我只是想...可以在这抽会烟
Just thought I could come in here
and ruin my lungs a little bit.

412
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,390
我知道 这不是好习惯
I know,it's a filthy habit.

413
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,660
Laurel 是我 我们可以谈谈吗
Laurel,it's me. Can we talk?

414
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,310
Laurel
Laurel?

415
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,130
Laurel
Laurel?

416
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,750
告诉义务警员 尽快
Make sure this message finds
its way to the Vigilante.

417
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,480
他要是不来拜访我一下
当太阳升起的时候
Do it fast,because at sunrise,I'm
going to leave pieces of this girl

418
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,730
我就杀了她
all over Starling City unless
he pays me a little visit.

419
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,160
你知道的 让我彼此了解一下
You know,gives us a chance to
get to know each other better.

420
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,900
我们该怎么办
What do we do?

421
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:42,170
你的行动组...我不知道
他们可以追踪这个吗
Can your CSIs,I don't know,can they
track this or trace it or something?

422
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,250
他们怎么知道Laurel
How did he know about Laurel?

423
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,770
什么
What?

424
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:50,750
这个家伙怎么知道
Laurel和帽衫男有联系
How does this guy know Laurel
is connected to the Hood?

425
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,420
我不知道
I have no idea.

426
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,730
我也是昨晚才知道的
I only found out about
it myself last night.

427
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,350
她...她说你知道
She...she said you knew.

428
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:00,150
只有我和...
Well,just me and...

429
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,230
Lance先生 这个疯子抓住了Laurel
Mr. Lance,this maniac has got Laurel!

430
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,330
你必须召集武装队
我不知道...或者特警
You got to call in posse or
something,I don't know,SWAT teams.

431
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,290
我不能
I can't.

432
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,220
- Lance探长...
- 我要去打个电话
- Detective Lance...
- I got to go make a call.

433
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,010
你能来我很高兴
Thanks for coming.

434
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,310
在你家谈这个不是很方便
It didn't seem like a good idea
to talk about this at your house.

435
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,680
你怎么跟我妈妈解释
Yeah,it would have been
a little awkward for you

436
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,840
你在监视她 这的确有点尴尬
to explain to my mother
that you're spying on her.

437
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,970
不
No,man.

438
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,590
这才是尴尬的地方
Awkward part's coming up.

439
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,210
你窃听了我妈妈
You bugged my mother?

440
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,760
好好听着
Just listen.

441
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,490
处理好了
It's taken care of.

442
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,110
我已经把它处理好了
I've taken care of it.

443
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,450
Carl Ballard不是问题了
Carl Ballard will not
be a problem anymore.

444
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,140
你一向小心谨慎
Given your propensity for squeamishness,

445
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:04,960
我猜Ballard先生 应该还活得好好的
I'm assuming that Mr. Ballard
remains in good health.

446
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:09,440
我让他很清楚地明白了
他的计划妨碍到了我们的大计
I made it clear to him persuasively that
his plans endangered the undertaking.

447
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,250
我没必要威胁他吧
I didn't have to make the usual threats.

448
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,160
很好
Excellent.

449
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,440
现在 还有件事要你办
Now,one more matter to attend to.

450
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:23,120
我要你按这个地址
把里面的东西彻底销毁了
I need you to have to contents of this
address removed and disposed of thoroughly.

451
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,260
你放置游艇残骸的仓库
The warehouse where you're storing
the remains of "the Queen's Gambit".

452
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,980
我告诉过你 我知道Robert的游艇
被动了手脚
I already told you,I knew
Robert's yacht was sabotaged.

453
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,670
我很抱歉
I'm sorry,man.

454
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,570
游艇被动了手脚
The yacht was sabotaged.

455
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,020
有人想要害死我爸
Somebody tried to kill my father.

456
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,560
你妈也参与了
And your mother was involved somehow.

457
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:43,510
你不能确定她有参与 Diggle
You do not know that
she was involved,Diggle!

458
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:49,280
你我都能确定的是 Oliver
她对此有所保密
What I do know Oliver,and so do
you,is that she kept this a secret.

459
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:53,170
要是她无所隐瞒 为何要这么做
Why would she do that if she
didn't have something to hide?

460
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,250
- 那是...
- 对
- Is that...?
- Yeah!

461
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:59,610
给你三秒钟 我便要切断电话
You have three seconds before I have
this line permanently disconnected.

462
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:02,720
Laurel出事了 她被绑架了
It's Laurel. She's been kidnapped.

463
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,090
听着 不管绑匪是谁 他会撕票的
Listen,whoever this is,he's
going to kill my daughter.

464
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,750
请相信我
Please believe me.

465
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,570
抱歉
Sorry.

466
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,940
这无关个人
It's nothing personal.

467
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:27,510
机场是防御重地
The airfield was a very
heavily fortified position.

468
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:30,020
我去过
I've been there.

469
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,610
我自己没法搞定
And I cannot take it on my own.

470
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,570
所以呢
So...so what?!

471
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,460
你要杀了我吗
Huh? You're just going to kill me?

472
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:41,050
我说了 这无关个人
Like I said... It's nothing personal.

473
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,740
但你要是活着 他们就会找你
But if you're alive,they will find you.

474
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,840
找到你 就会拷问你
直到你供出我的所在地
And if they find you,they will torture
you until you give up my location,

475
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,550
我可不能冒这险
and I cannot allow for that to happen.

476
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,170
别走 别这么做行不
Hey,don't leave! No,please
don't do this,all right?!

477
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,600
我不会对他们说...
I'm not going to say anything to that...

478
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:57,220
别难为自己了
Don't make it more
difficult upon yourself.

479
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:01,360
我能让你毫无感觉地死去
I can do this in a way that
you will not feel it at all.

480
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:23,960
- Steve Wilson
- Oliver Queen
- Steve Wilson.
- Oliver Queen.

481
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:30,240
Oliver Queen 可能你是个斗士
Well,Oliver Queen... There might be
a fighter inside of you after all.

482
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,360
探长
Detective.

483
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:51,120
若这还是陷阱 后果很严重
If this is another trick,you
will not like the consequences.

484
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,950
我现在可不太高兴
I'm not particularly happy right now.

485
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,240
我恨你 恨你代表的一切
I hate you. I hate
everything you stand for.

486
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:01,030
但这个疯子绑架了我女儿
But this lunatic has my little girl.

487
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,340
留下一封勒索信
He left this behind as
some kind of ransom note.

488
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,740
他叫Cyrus Vanch
His name is Cyrus Vanch.

489
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:09,100
天呃... 如果他找不到你 就会撕票的
Jeez... He'll kill her
if he doesn't get to you.

490
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,170
怎样他都会撕票
He'll kill her anyway.

491
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,610
为什么来找我
So why come to me?

492
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,990
只有少部分人知道你与我女儿合作
It's a pretty tight circle that knows
about you and my daughter working together.

493
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:21,270
如果Vanch知道 是因为有人说了
If Vanch knows,it's because
someone at the precinct talked.

494
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,210
我不相信别人
There isn't anybody else I could trust.

495
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,100
Vanch在一栋大宅中
Vanch is holed up in a mansion.

496
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,540
那是防御重地
It's a heavily fortified position.

497
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:31,090
我去过 我自己没法搞定
I was there. I can't take it by myself.

498
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,170
需要你帮忙
I need your help.

499
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,300
我们要相互帮忙
Then I need yours.

500
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,370
时间快到了
Time's running out.

501
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,440
你朋友还没来
And still no visit from your friend.

502
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,600
我可能低估他对你的爱了
I might have overestimated
his fondness for you.

503
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,100
故意伤害
Assault with intent.

504
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,810
还有绑架
And kidnapping.

505
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:06,740
你这辈子就在监狱呆着吧
You're going to rot in
prison for life this time.

506
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,820
前提是你的帽衫朋友会来救你
That's assuming your
hooded BFF saves you.

507
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,480
来了也不太可能活着出去
And his chances of
survival are not so great.

508
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,390
他要抵挡住
He's going up against
trained men with their fingers

509
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:21,950
枪手每分钟射出的600发子弹
on the trigger of guns that
fire up to 600 rounds per minute.

510
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:25,590
我不是爱因斯坦 但也知道那挺多的
Now,I'm no Einstein,but
that is a lot of bullets.

511
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:43,340
即使他干掉那些人
房顶还有两名狙击手
And even if he were to take them out,I
have two sharpshooters on the roof.

512
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:56,840
他要是能干掉狙击手
And even if he were to get
by them,what's he going to do

513
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,730
还有名符其实的军队等着他
against the veritable army of sons
of bitches I've got waiting for him?

514
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:16,280
我说过 我不是爱因斯坦
Now,as I said,I'm no Einstein.

515
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,120
但还是能数到24的
But I can count to 24.

516
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,450
要是你好奇 我研究过那些新闻片段
And in case you're wondering... I was
so I studied up on my news footage...

517
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,720
24就是他箭袋中
24 is the exact number of
arrows he carries in his quive

518
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:29,390
箭的数量
and flechettes around his forearm.

519
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,700
缴了他的弓 Merida
Lose the bow,Merida.

520
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,850
摘了帽子
Ventilate him.

521
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,120
她是我女儿 我的小女儿
My daughter! My little girl!

522
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,690
我是义务警员 你是警察
I'm the Vigilante. You're the cop.

523
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,230
这不代表我要宣读他的权利
That doesn't mean I have to read
the bastard his rights,though.

524
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,990
Laurel 你没事吧
Laurel,are you ok?

525
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,180
没事
Yeah.

526
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,660
我没事
I'm ok.

527
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:28,540
好吧 你可以走了
All right,you're good to go.

528
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,720
我送你回家
I'll,uh,I'll take you home now.

529
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,890
我打车就好
I can take a cab.

530
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,130
Laurel 你受了打击 我送你回家
Laurel,you had a trauma.
I'll drive you home.

531
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,570
- 不要
- 怎么了
- No.
- What?

532
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,490
你要跟我保持距离一段时间
I'm going to need you to keep
your distance for a while.

533
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:48,380
- Laurel...
- 爸 我爱你
- Laurel...
- Dad,I love you.

534
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,710
我会永远爱你
I'll always love you.

535
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,410
但我现在不能信你
But what I can't do
right now is trust you.

536
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,380
我只是在做本职工作
I was just doing my job.

537
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,890
我以为你至少会明白这点
I thought you'd
understand at least that.

538
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,670
这部分我明白的
That part I do understand.

539
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:06,530
但骗我 对我撒谎
我现在还不明白
But lying to me,using me...
It's going to take longer.

540
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,750
你没事吧
Are you all right?

541
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,470
要是我说不知道有没有事 你怎么想
What would you think
if I said I didn't know?

542
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,600
说明你很诚实
That you were being honest.

543
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,540
现在我爸拿着那电话
My father has the phone now.

544
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:41,860
我觉得短时间内他不会还给我
And I don't think he'll be
giving it back any time soon.

545
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,710
也许这样不错
Maybe that's good.

546
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,840
我没想到它会给你带来危险
I didn't see how it
would put you in danger.

547
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,270
我不是小孩子了
I'm a big girl.

548
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,140
我了解这有风险
I knew the risks.

549
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,110
现在我也了解了
Now I know them.

550
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,780
我不愿让你担着风险
And I'm not willing
to take them with you.

551
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,260
什么意思
What does that mean?

552
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,690
意思是 就此别过吧
It means good-bye.

553
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,840
Laurel
Laurel!

554
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,190
Laurel
Laurel.

555
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,000
天啊 Laurel
Oh,my God,Laurel.

556
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,170
Laurel 告诉我你没事
Laurel,tell me you are okay,please.

557
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,240
我没事 抱歉
No,no,I'm fine,I'm fine. I'm so sorry.

558
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:17,310
没关系 只要你没事就好
No,no,it doesn't matter,just
as long as you're okay.

559
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:29,880
这不会改变你我的关系
You know,this does not change
anything between you and I.

560
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,450
需要两个人 才能拿下机场
It takes two men to take the air field.

561
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,470
你要是劝我离开岛 我就杀了你
And if you compromise my getting
off this island,I will kill you.

562
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,930
已经给你了第二次机会
You've had your second chance.

563
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:42,330
你我都很需要彼此
You need me just as much as I need you.

564
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,020
下一步做什么
So what's our next step?

565
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:49,760
训练你 好让你不拖后腿
Turning you into something
that won't get us both killed.

566
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,440
选一样武器
Choose a weapon.

567
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,330
现在就开始吗
We're starting now?

568
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,610
那是我的
That's mine.

569
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,540
你就是那个拷打我的疯子
You are the lunatic who tortured me?!

570
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,910
- 不 那是另一个人
- 别骗了
- No,that was another guy.
- Bull!

571
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:27,190
这面具 等于是我们的巴拉克拉法帽
This mask,it's my operational
equivalent to a balaclava.

572
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:31,570
我和搭档带着他们 做任务时保密身份
My partner and I wore them to keep our
identities classified during our missions.

573
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,530
你说谎
You're lying.

574
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:37,690
Fyers告诉我 这疯子是岛上的囚犯
Fyers told me this nutcase
is a prisoner on the island.

575
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:42,620
他对你撒谎了
He lied to you.

576
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:48,000
我和搭档来岛上是为了放走姚飞
My partner and I came here to free
Yao Fei and get him off this island.

577
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:53,180
我们是澳洲机密情报站的
We're A.S.I.S. Australian intelligence.

578
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,560
现在
Now.

579
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,940
你去找你的武器
You are going to find
your silver weapon.

580
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,940
有没有想过用剑
Have you considered a sword?

581
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:02,430
我喜欢剑
I like swords.

582
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:07,540
我向他明确过 他的计划威胁到了任务
I made it clear to him persuasively that
his plans endangered the undertaking.

583
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,060
没必要威胁他
I didn't have to make the usual threats.

584
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,620
我已经听了15次了
I've listened to this 15 times.

585
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:23,820
肯定是她的声音 Diggle
只是我不敢相信
It's definitely her voice,Diggle.
I just... I can't believe it's her.

586
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,750
家人是自己的盲点
We all have blind spots
when it comes to family.

587
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:28,940
是啊 Laurel今晚差点死了
Yeah. Laurel's almost
got her killed tonight.

588
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:33,640
要是Lance没骗她
Vanch绝不会知道她与我的联系
Vanch never would have known about her
connection to me if Lance hadn't have lied to her.

589
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,260
这教给我们 盲目信任 可能会很危险
I guess the lesson here is
blind trust can be dangerous.

590
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:43,990
我向他明确过 他的计划威胁到了任务
I made it clear to him persuasively that
his plans endangered the undertaking.

591
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:48,120
没必要威胁他
I didn't have to make the usual threats.

592
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,680
任务是什么
What's the undertaking?

593
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,070
不知道
I don't know.

594
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,030
但不停提到威胁 肯定不是好事
But with all this talk about
threats,it can't be good.

595
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:59,250
你提醒过我 如果她撒谎
You warned me that if
she was lying would be

596
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:03,460
定是要隐瞒她参与什么危险的事
to cover up her involvement
in something dangerous.

597
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,710
我得知道这任务是什么
I need to know what The Undertaking is.

598
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,960
你要怎么做
What are you going to do?

599
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:21,680
我还得跟我妈谈谈
I need to have another chat with my mom.

600
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,850
工发协调咨委会的合并
要在本周内完成
I'll need the Unidac merger
finalized by the end of the week.

601
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:28,330
我们在赶时间
We're on something of a clock here.

602
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:44,040
Moira Queen 你辜负了这座城市
Moira Queen,you have failed this city.

603
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,560

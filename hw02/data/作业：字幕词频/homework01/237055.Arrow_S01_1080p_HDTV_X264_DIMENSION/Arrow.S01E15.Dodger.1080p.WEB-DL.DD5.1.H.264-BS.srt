00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,340
我叫Oliver Queen
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:09,310
被困在孤岛上5年以来
我只有一个目标...活下去
For 5 years,I was stranded on an
island with only one goal... Survive.

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,230
Oliver Queen还活着
Oliver Queen is alive.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,830
现在 我要完成我父亲的夙愿
Now I will fulfill my
father's dying wish...

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:19,970
根据他留给我的名单
除掉那些毒害我城市的人
to use the list of names he left me and
bring down those who are poisoning my city.

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,270
为了完成目标 我必须扮成别人
To do this,I must become someone else.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,450
我必须掩盖身份
I must become something else.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,750
绿箭侠 前情提要
Previously on "Arrow"...

McKenna Hall
McKenna Hall.

12
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,020
我常给人惊喜
I live to surprise.

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,080
- 我要找到Walter
- 我继父
- I want to find Walter.
- My stepfather.

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,870
我会帮你找到他 就这样
I'll help you rescue him,but that's it.

15
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,980
这是我的要求
That's my offer.

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,100
行
Ok.

17

Jerry
Jerry.

18
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,640
Jerry 你没事吧 看上去有点虚啊
Jerry,you ok? You look
a little peaked,man.

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,110
没事 Hill女士要我们
把狮龙转移到地下室
I'm fine. It's,uh,Mrs. Hill wants us
to move the Sherwood into the vault.

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,680
现在吗 大白天的
Now? It's mid-day.

21
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,610
我知道 她说有安全威胁
I know. She says it's a security threat.

22
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,070
最近抢劫案很多
It's,uh,all the robberies lately.

23
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,130
把这个拿下来行吗
Take this thing off me,all right?

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,800
我照你说的拿到了 给
I got it like you asked. Here.

25
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,860
快解开
Take it off me!

26
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,290
你唬弄我吗 这玩意儿会炸了吗
Were...were you... were you bluffing?
I mean,would the thing have detonated?

27
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,720
要炸会很厉害 不过不用担心
Violently. Don't worry,though.

28
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,080
你完全按我说的做了 
所以你不会有感觉
You did exactly as I asked,so
it's just unconsciousness for you.

29
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,310
不会有感觉
Unconscious?

30
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,490
今晚你要除掉名单上一个人的话
你得放松一下
You might want to take it easy if you plan
on taking someone off that list tonight.

31
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,220
这就是我放松的方式
This is me taking it easy.

32
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,880
今晚是哪个幸运儿
So who's our lucky guy tonight?

33
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,480
Ken Williams 他非法传销数百万
Ken Williams. His pyramid
scheme stole millions.

34
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,620
人们不但没了家 他们的生活也被毁了
People didn't just lose their
homes. Their lives are ruined.

35
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,860
你们早点走吧 我不想搞太麻烦
Why don't you call it in early
tonight,I'm not expecting much trouble.

36
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:06,190
- Felicity 是不是你...
- 电脑改了你的锁
- Felicity! Did you just...
- Computer override your lock.

37
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,990
- 也许改了点
- 你这是干嘛
- Maybe a little.
- What are you doing?

38
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,750
我查了Williams的一些信息
I pulled up some
information on Mr. Williams.

39
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,540
你知道他是一个10岁男孩的单身父亲吗
Did you know he's a widowed
father of a 10-year-old boy?

40
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,600
我说过我只是来帮你找Walter的
I told you. I'm only
in this to help Walter.

41
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,700
不是和你同谋让孩子失去父母的
Not to be an accessory
to orphaning little kids.

42
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,210
我只是去警告他一下
I'm just giving him a warning.

43
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,730
你有没有想过真的为这个城市行点善
Has it ever occurred to you you
could do some real good in the city?

44
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,760
而不只是恢复人们的
股票投资组合和储蓄账户
Beyond just recovering people's stock
portfolios and their saving accounts.

45
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,480
不是只有你知道怎么重启我的系统
You're not the only one who
knows how to reboot my system.

46
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,630
- 我错了
- 想阻止我吗
- I made a mistake.
- Getting in my way?

47
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,900
- 不行
- 不是
- I don't disagree.
- No.

48
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,310
和你结盟 虽然只是暂时
Signing on with you. Even provisionally.

49
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,940
喝下去
Drink.

50
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,240
都是泥
That tastes like dirt.

51
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,010
你得喝水知道吗
You got to stay hydrated,ok?

52
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,040
我不缺水
Hydration is not my problem.

53
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,700
我的问题是用一把钝刀把子弹拿了出来
My problem is getting a bullet dug
out of my arm with a dull blade.

54
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,270
我看看
Let me take a look.

55
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,930
感染了
It's infected.

56
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,400
想想办法
Go figure.

57
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,520
好 我得阻止它扩散
Yeah,uh... I got to stop
that before it spreads.

58
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,650
你想在路过药店找抗生素时
When you swing past the
drugstore for those antibiotics,

59
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,780
再帮我买一份"箴言"或"体育画报"吗
you want to get me a copy of
"Maxim",or maybe a "Sports Illustrated"?

60
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,980
姚飞在山洞里有很好的草药
能治愈一切
Yao Fei had these super herbs back
in the cave that'd heal anything.

61
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,160
我去拿
I'm going to go get them.

62
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,290
你在外面呆不过一小时
You're not going to
last an hour out there.

63
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,050
那你就祈祷我在45分钟内回来吧
Well,I guess you better hope
I get back in 45 minutes,then.

64
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,730

谢谢你能来
Thank you for coming.

68
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,480
见到你真高兴 Frank
It is so good to see you,Frank.

69
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,910
很久没见了
It's been far too long.

70
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,250
是啊 在中国呆的时间比我想的要长
Yes. My interests in China have
kept me away more than I'd like.

71
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,380
跟着事业走
But with The Undertaking approaching,

72
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,580
我想是时候回斯特林市了
I thought a return to
Starling City was in order.

73
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:29,320
Frank 其实我就想和你谈谈这事业
Actually,Frank,it's The Undertaking
that I wanted to talk to you about.

74
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,240
我想退出
I want to get out.

75
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,180
是因为Walter的事吗
Is this because of
what happened to Walter?

76
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,270
因为Walter 因为Robert
With Walter,with Robert.

77
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,620
上周我的孩子们差点失去我
Last week the Vigilante nearly
made my children orphans.

78
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,900
这已经是我的底线了 Frank
I've reached my limit,Frank.

79
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:54,350
你可真信任我呀 Moira
That's,uh,a lot to confide in me,Moira.

80
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,330
Robert也是
Robert did.

81
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,530
我知道他找过你 
别管我应不应该知道
I know he reached out to you; whether
I was supposed to know it or not.

82
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,780
他有过顾虑
He had misgivings.

83
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,690
你们俩互相追查
He sought you out because
he knew you did,too.

84
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,800
但他被害了
But then he was murdered.

85
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,590
这对我们来说是个警告
And that should be a
cautionary tale for both of us.

86
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:20,730
我知道 我一直忍到现在
Yes,I know. And I've gone along with
this for as long as I can stomach it.

87
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,960
Frank 我们这样做
是为了修复林中空地 
We started this to fix the Glades,Frank.

88
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,150
为了拯救城市 不是毁了它
To cure the city,not lay it to waste.

89
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,530
你加入是因为你女儿
You got into this because of
what happened to your daughter.

90
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:39,980
Amanda会让你怎么做呢 Frank 
Frank... What would
Amanda want you to do?

91
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,300
也许我们得晚点再来
Well. Maybe we should come back later.

92
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,620
不 也许我们得等着 Oliver
这个问题很严重
No,maybe we should wait,Oliver.
This is really serious.

93
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,350
下一次她良心不安去报警了怎么办
What if her next attack of conscience
leads her right to the police?

94
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,440
她什么也不会说的
Oh,she won't say anything.

95
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,700
我得在和你发现我时想的一样
I know I had to make the same
calculation when you found out about me.

96
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,420
如果你想错了呢
And what would you have
done if you were wrong,

97
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,900
如果我选择联系Lance警官呢
and I decided to make a
call to detective Lance?

98
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,900
那我就拿箭指着你了
I would have put an arrow in you.

99
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,360
真的 你真会这么做
Really...really...you really
would have done that,really?

100
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,340
我跟自己打了赌 你们会多久过来
I had a bet going with myself on
how quickly you two would visit.

101
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,140
让我不要揭发你
Tell me not to reveal your secret.

102
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,270
看来我赢了
Looks like I won.

103
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,360
Felicity 其实我是来让你改变主意的
Actually,Felicity,I was hoping that
I could get you to change your mind.

104
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,990
昨晚我肾上腺素上脑
I was worked up on
adrenaline last night,

105
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,020
我并没有表现好
and I didn't exactly
put my best foot forward.

106
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,070
希望你现在给我机会说清楚
I was hoping you'd give me
the opportunity to do that now.

107
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,570
那从Ken Williams说起吧
How about you start with Ken Williams?

108
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,440
昨晚他也受你肾上腺素影响了吗
Did he also get to enjoy
your adrenaline last night?

109
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,480
不 为了让他儿子安睡
他及时把偷的钱还了
No,he returned the money that he stole
just in time to put his son to bed.

110
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,200
Felicity 我说了只是警告
Like I said,Felicity,just a warning...

111
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,690
此时我们得提醒公众
At this time,we'd like
to remind the public

112
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,460
由于神偷主要操控欧洲市场
that we are coordinating
our efforts with Interpol

113
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,350
我们在全力与国际刑警组织合作
as the Dodger operates
primarily in Europe,

114
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,150
他们建议我们提醒公众
and they have advised
us to warn the public

115
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,050
神偷有武器并且极其危险
that he is to be considered
armed and extremely dangerous.

116
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,330
我听说过这个人
You know,I heard about this guy.

117
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,920
他们叫他神偷 因为他从不亲自行窃
They call him the Dodger because
he avoids getting his hands dirty.

118
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,600
他用人质帮他行窃
He uses hostages to do
his stealing for him.

119
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,040
- 怎么做到的
- 在他们脖子上绑弹圈
- How?
- Puts a bomb collar around their necks.

120
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,600
去年马德里的一个人没有按他说的做
Last year,a guy in Madrid didn't
steal what the Dodger told him to,

121
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,210
据说被爆头了
and it took his head off. Literally.

122
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,920
现在斯特林市有个精神病人
And now the psycho's in Starling City?

123
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,470
他没在你的名单上真是糟糕
It's too bad his name's
not in your notebook.

124
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,930
我要搞垮的不都是名单上的人
You know,not all the people
that I target are on the list.

125
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,750
偶尔也有例外
Every once in a while,I
make an exception.

126
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,820
比如 劫持人质偷珠宝的贼
A hostage-taking jewel
thief,for example.

127
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,820
来帮我们一起拿下他如何
How about you help us take him down?

128
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,370
他迟到了
He's late.

129
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,750
从不
Never.

130
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,150
为了金融交易我开了瑞士的账户
I maintain a Swiss account
for financial transactions.

131
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,240
这是号码
Here's the number.

132
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,740
谢谢
Thanks.

133
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,500
我会把钱转给你的
I'll wire you the money.

134
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,150
如果我没搞错数字的话
Assuming I don't misplace the numbers.

135
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:21,050
我的记账有点粗糙
My bookkeeping method
is a little sloppy.

136
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,840
是吗
Really?

137
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,460
显然你认为狮龙宝石是可以偷的
Clearly you're under the impression that
you can have the Sherwood Ruby for a steal.

138
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,050
你是新来的
Well,you're new here in town.

139
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,730
在斯特林市我们没这么文雅
We're not as refined in Starling City.

140
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,680
我早有耳闻了
I'm getting that impression.

141
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,940
别担心
Don't worry.

142
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,800
你的人只是失去知觉
Your men are merely unconscious.

143
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:53,210
17分钟后会安然无恙醒来
In about 17 minutes,they'll wake up with the ability to turn
 every other fence in this town.

144
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,230
但我可不是好惹的
But I'm not to be trifled with.

145
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,460
那我怎么办
What about me?

146
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,770
我不知道
I don't know.

147
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,570
你怎么办呢
What about you,indeed.

148
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,370
要抓住这个人 我们得查出他在哪
So to catch this guy,we need to
either figure out where he is,

149
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,530
或者他准备去哪
or where he's going to be.

150
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,050
你们都是这么想办法追踪目标吗
Is this really how you guys
figure out how to get your target?

151
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,390
边吃边谈
Over burgers and shakes?

152
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,050
抱歉 久等了
那边有桌无比闹腾的客人
Sorry it took me so long. I'm waiting on
a bunch of particularly rowdy customers.

153
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,060
用我帮你摆平他们吗
You need me to handle that?

154
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,800
谢谢你的好意 不用把事情闹大
I appreciate it,but I'm a pro by now.

155
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,240
有需要的话就叫我
I'll be here if you need me.

156
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,230
你女朋友吗
Girlfriend?

157
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,080
她算是我弟妹
No,it's my sister in law. Sort of.

158
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,110
Carly嫁给了Dig的弟弟
Carly was married to Dig's brother.

159
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,860
不过他去世了
And he passed away.

160
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,290
她似乎对你有好感啊
Well,looks like she's hot for you.

161
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,880
额 咱能接着说抓罪犯那事吗
Ah. Can we get back to
crime fighting,please?

162
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,390
说真的 Dig 我觉得你应该约她出去
Actually,Dig,I was thinking,you
probably should ask her out.

163
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,460
真的吗
Really?

164
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,950
你敢约McKenna 我立马就去约她
I'll do that just five minutes
after you ask out McKenna.

165
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,620
喔 神偷一案的警探哟
Ooh,the detective on the Dodger case.

166
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,730
- 你喜欢她吗
- 没错
- You have a thing for her?
- Yes.

167
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,040
有本事你就去约Carly啊
I don't see you asking Carly out.

168
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,910
Felicity 这家伙的目标是种特定珠宝
Felicity,this guy,he's targeting
a very specific type of jewel.

169
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,190
我们搞清原因 就能顺藤摸瓜抓到他
We figure out why,and that'll
give us the how to catch him.

170
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,800
我有个想法
I have an idea.

171
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:19,700
你那戴徽章的尤物说过
他们正和国际刑警组织合作
Your crush object with a badge said
they were working with Interpol.

172
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,110
我弄个小窃听器
Why don't I work a
couple of little tech,

173
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,300
你用调情分散她注意力
然后把窃听器安在她手机上
you distract her with a little flirty
flirt,slip said tech onto her phone.

174
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,890
然后我们就能了解她掌控的一切信息了
It'll turn into a micro transmitter,and
boom,we'll learn everything she knows.

175
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,530
我一般不是这么了解信息的
It's not how I typically
get my information.

176
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,110
你一般怎么办
How do you typically do it?

177
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,680
我会找到那人
I find the person.

178
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,010
然后用恐惧撬开他的嘴
And then I put the fear of
God into them until they talk.

179
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,360
不过你的办法值得一试
But we can try your way.

180
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,820
那个 Carly 我不想搞得很奇怪
You know,Carly,I don't
want this to,um,you know,

181
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,660
额 我只是想...
to come off weird or
anything,it's just...

182
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,770
你愿意跟我共进晚餐吗
Would you like to have dinner?

183
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,370
就订在今晚如何
How about tonight?

184
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,740
- 今晚吗
- 怎么 我们等得还不够久吗
- Tonight? What...
- We haven't waited long enough?

185
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,960
怎么没人告诉过我
街边的烤肉这么好吃呢
Who knew street meat
could taste so good?

186
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,750
我一猜你就急需逃离办公室休息一会
I had a feeling you needed
a break from the office.

187
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,710
Hank是我的第一个客户
Hank was my first client.

188
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,570
我让他儿子避免
为非己之罪受牢狱之灾
I kept his son from being sent away
for a mugging that he didn't commit.

189
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,760
他们怎么没奖励终身免费热狗给你呢
And how did that not score
you free hot dogs for life?

190
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,110
国家创新联合会保证
低收入人群受到法律保护
CNRI gives low income people
access to the legal system.

191
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,760
若非如此 他儿子早被送进监狱去了
Without them,his son could
have gone to prison forever.

192
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,170
我也有可能被送进监狱啊
I could have gone to prison,too.

193
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,780
他又雇不起超牛的律师为他辩护
He couldn't afford a dream
team of super lawyers.

194
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,810
所以我该为生在富人家而感到愧疚咯
So I'm supposed to feel guilty because
I'm lucky enough to have a rich family?

195
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,560
不 你确实很幸运
No. You are lucky.

196
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,840
但愿创新联合会会证明给你看
And hopefully CNRI will show you that.

197
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,920
把包还给我们 我们就不报警了
Give us the purse,and we
won't press any charges.

198
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,100
你说得对
Yeah,you're right.

199
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,700
我可真幸运啊
I really do feel lucky.

200
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,700
他跳过栅栏的时候钩住了
This got snagged as he
bolted over the fence.

201
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,120
貌似是他钱包上的链子
Looks like a chain from his wallet.

202
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,860
- 我以为你放弃追捕罪犯了呢
- 什么
- I thought you gave up crime fighting.
- What?

203
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,230
我是指你妹妹那件事 我以为...
Well,the business with
your sister. I figured...

204
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,560
你不会再掺乎警察的工作了
You'd stay out of police precincts.

205
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,110
是啊 我在新闻里看到你
Yeah,I...I saw you on
the news and I realized

206
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,550
我突然发现我还从未你的所作所为
向你道过谢
that I never thanked you for
everything that you did,so.

207
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,030
谢谢你
Thank you.

208
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,000
你升职了啊
So you got promoted.

209
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,360
升到重案组了
Major Crimes.

210
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,430
他们让我负责神偷的案子
And they assigned me to the Dodger case.

211
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,670
他威逼别人为他偷东西
He extorts people into stealing for him.

212
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,080
工作进展得如何
How's that going?

213
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,310
进展很慢啊
Slow.

214
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:23,350
你还是老样子 真好
Well... It was nice seeing you
the last time that I saw you.

215
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,580
是啊 能再见到你真好
Yeah. It's good seeing you,too.

216
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,480
就像重温过去的那些时光
It was like old times.

217
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,270
除了限制级的部分
Except the PG version.

218
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,670
这话是什么意思
How do you mean?

219
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,890
咱俩一向很会找乐子
Well,you and I always knew
how to have a fun time.

220
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,830
我最近的生活恰恰缺了点乐子
Something that's been
missing from my life lately.

221
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,660
你愿意跟我出来喝一杯吗
So how about a drink?

222
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,740
当然不是现在啊
Not now.

223
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,760
你愿不愿意... 我可以带你去...
Would you maybe...
I'll take you for a...

224
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,630
你乐意跟我吃个饭吗 McKenna
would you like to have
dinner with me,McKenna?

225
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,830
不知你听说了没 我在孤岛上渡过了五年
I don't know if you heard,I was
on a deserted island for five years

226
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,260
我对这套词已经不熟悉啊
and I am totally out of
practice with this whole...

227
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,280
好啊 我很乐意跟你吃晚饭
Well...well,dinner would be nice.

228
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,720
今天一整晚我都没事
In fact,I can make myself free tonight.

229
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,090
- 好的
- 嗯
- Yeah.
- Great.

230
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,840
我八点来接你吧
So I'll grab you at eight?

231
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,130
太好了
That's perfect.

232
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,880
- 嗯
- 就这么定了
- All right.
- Ok.

233
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,050
- 不在你这晃悠了 我走了
- 好
- I'm lingering. I'm going to go.
- Ok.

234
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,940
谁在那儿
Who's there?!

235
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,100
救我
Help me.

236
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,460
Lance
Lance.

237
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,640
队长 我是Hall警探
Sergeant,it's Detective Hall.

238
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,600
神偷的案子有了新进展
I have an update on the Dodger case.

239
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,190
艺术馆发现一具被一枪致命的尸体
A body was found in an art
gallery shot point blank.

240
00:15:59,220 --> 00:15:59,980
现场还有其他三人
There were three other men there,

241
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,710
都因被高聚焦电流击中心脏而失去意识
all rendered unconscious by a highly
focused electric current to the heart.

242
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,910
博物馆的守卫也是如此
Same M.O. as that guard at the museum.

243
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,340
查清受害者身份了吗
Got an ID on the vic?

244
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,220
受害人名叫Cass Derenick
His name is Cass Derenick.

245
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,570
暂停
Pause.

246
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,830
Cass Derenick是谁
Who's Cass Derenick?

247
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,290
曾因持有被盗物品被捕
Arrest,possession of stolen goods.

248
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,610
曾因诈骗被捕
Arrest,conspiracy.

249
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,060
曾因倒卖被盗物品被提起诉讼
Conviction,attempted
sale of stolen goods.

250
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,710
这家伙是个买卖赃物的
This guy's a fence.

251
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,140
神偷要出手舍伍德红宝石
The Dodger's looking to
unload the Sherwood Ruby.

252
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,220
他肯定会再找黑市贩子的
Which means he'll be in
the market for a new fence.

253
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,930
找一个还没被杀的
One he hasn't,you know...killed.

254
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,360
找到那赃物贩子就能找到神偷
So we find the fence
and we find the Dodger.

255
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:38,710
我从网上看到你卖带链子的钱包
链子上还有个八号球
Anyway,I saw online that you sell a chain
wallet with an eight ball on the chain.

256
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,240
如果我给你外形的描述
I was wondering if you
could give me a name of

257
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,960
你能记起这是你的哪位客户吗
one of your customers if
I gave you a description?

258
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,760
没问题 你可以给我回电话
Yeah,sure,you can call be back.

259
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,270
就像所有我呼叫过的二手服装店一样
Like every other used clothing and
leather good store I've called today.

260
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,570
怎么回事
What was that about?

261
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,970
穿得这么帅要去干嘛啊
What's up with the fancy fancy?

262
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:00,190
我今天有个约会
What? Oh,um,I have a date.

263
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,210
我的生活才不像别人说的那样无趣呢
Contrary to popular
opinion,I do have a life.

264
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,460
你这么紧张干嘛
Then why do you seem so nervous?

265
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,930
很明显吗
Is it obvious?

266
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,040
做回那个魅力四射的你自己就好
Just be your charming and brooding self.

267
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,580
万千女孩都会为你着迷的
I mean,the girls seem to dig that.

268
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,890
我今天约的这个女孩可与众不同
This girl is different.

269
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,210
我在海难之前就认识她了
She knew me before the
island,before I was...

270
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,760
是创新联合会的电话 我必须得接
That's CNRI. I've got to take this.

271
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,570
我这有个很重要的手包抢劫案
I'm working on a very
important purse snatching case.

272
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,810
好吧
Yeah.

273
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,570
喂
Hello?

274
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,460
他穿着件红色连帽衫
Yeah,he might have been
wearing a red hoodie.

275
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,030
有点阿贝克隆比的感觉
Kind of Abercrombie-looking.

276
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,390
我是说他的脸 不是衣服
His face,not the hoodie.

277
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,480
真的 你们真的记得他的名字吗
Really? You wouldn't
happen to have his name?

278
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,240
太感谢你了
Thank you so much.

279
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,710
嗨 Laurel
Hey,Laurel.

280
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,760
你爸还喜欢抓罪犯吗
Does your dad still like arrest people?

281
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,740
我查出那个抢包的混蛋是谁了
I found the dirt bag.

282
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,590
他叫Roy Harper
His name is Roy Harper.

283
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,720
我都记不清上次来这里是什么时候了
I can't remember the
last time I was here.

284
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,990
真美啊
It's so beautiful.

285
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:12,500
想勾搭高中小女生就带她来这
Yeah,this was the place to
take a girl in high school.

286
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,900
我没那么幸运 能体验那些
Hmm,I was never lucky
enough to experience that.

287
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,920
我那时候戴着牙套 留着难看的刘海
I had braces and
terrible bangs back then.

288
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,810
我相信你那时一定很漂亮
I'm sure you looked amazing.

289
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,450
我很高兴我们终于走到这一步
I'm glad we finally got
around to doing this.

290
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:28,370
我也是
Me,too.

291
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:33,820
Andy讨好女生可有一套
You know,Andy set a pretty high
bar when it came to first dates.

292
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,770
他能制服一个持枪歹徒
You know,he'd face down
armed gunmen for a living

293
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,410
但和你约会前 我从未见过他那么慌张
but I've never seen him as scared as
he was before that first date with you.

294
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,820
哦 Carly 真抱歉
Ohh,Carly,I'm sorry.

295
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,610
初次约会不该说这些对吧
That wasn't good first
date etiquette,was it?

296
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,750
在咱俩正度过一个浪漫的夜晚
提起Andy 这可不太好
Bring up Andy when we are having
a romantic night? Probably not.

297
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,560
Carly 约会很复杂 也很艰难
Look,Carly,this is
difficult and complicated.

298
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,200
又没有指导手册
It's not like there's a manual,you know?

299
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:03,150
你知道吗 有一瞬间
我觉得自己就像个暗恋别人的小女生
You know... For a moment,I...I
felt like a girl who likes a boy,

300
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,300
剩下的都不重要
and nothing else mattered.

301
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:10,240
但如果对你来说 太难 或太复杂
But if this is too hard
for you,or too complicated,

302
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,870
请离开我的世界 因为我已受过太多伤害
then please,just get out now,because
I've already been hurt too much.

303
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,420
- Carly 听着 对不起...
- 带我回家 好么
- Carly,listen,I'm sorry...
- Can you just please take me home?

304
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,300
不是吧 简直太好吃了
No,no,no,no,it is not possible
for something to be this good!

305
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,600
是吧
Right?

306
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,780
- 你肯定没吃过舒芙蕾
- 什么
- So you must have missed souffles.
- What do you mean?

307
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,760
在岛上生活五年 远离人烟
Five years on an island,away
from civilization.

308
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,850
你做什么
Ah,what did you do?

309
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,200
吃什么 睡哪里
What did you eat? Where'd you sleep?

310
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,210
- 怎么熬过来的
- McKenna...
- How did you make it?
- McKenna...

311
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,670
抱歉 我不是想刨根问底
Sorry. Didn't mean to drill you.

312
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,530
没关系
It's ok.

313
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,400
只是我都很久没和
It's just I haven't had a
conversation with a guy in a while

314
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,760
不是罪犯的男人聊过天了
without it resulting in
me reading him his rights.

315
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,850
但这些年 肯定改变了你
So. Yeah,but those years,they
must have changed you.

316
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,470
从以前和我一起狂欢 到现在这个你
From a guy I used to party
with to who you are now.

317
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,540
是啊
Yeah.

318
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,390
因为我要做些艰难的选择
Because I had to make
some tough choices.

319
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,680
你说得对
You're right.

320
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,160
我变了
It changed me.

321
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,110
什么艰难的选择...
What kind of tough choices...

322
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,840
我不想谈论这些经历 McKenna
I don't want to talk about
those experiences,McKenna.

323
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,970
电话解了围哈
Saved by the cell.

324
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,720
Hall
Hall.

325
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,750
把线人告诉你的写在搜查令申请中
Ok,put what the C.I. told you
in the warrant application.

326
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:44,460
我马上就到 工作上的事 我先走了
I'll be right there.
It's work,I got to go.

327
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,590
Felicity 听着
Felicity,listen,please.

328
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,220
启动McKenna手机中的监听器
I need you to activate
the bug in McKenna's phone.

329
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,680
警方似乎有了骗子的线索
I think the police just
got a lead on the Dodger.

330
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,490
好
Ok.

331
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,790
你是谁
Who are you?

332
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,890
我是Alan Durand 一名交换生
My name is Alan Durand.
I'm an exchange student.

333
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,250
我跟班里出去海钓
I was on a fishing
excursion with my class.

334
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,240
我走丢了 船失火了
We got lost and our boat caught fire.

335
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:24,080
出了什么机械故障 我们得跳船
It was some mechanic
malfunction. We had to jump ship.

336
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,820
什么时候
When?

337
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,800
两天前
Two days ago.

338
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,550
太糟了
It was awful.

339
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,600
我以为我要死了
I thought I was going to die.

340
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,040
其他学生呢
Where are the other students?

341
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,350
船员呢
Where's the boats crew,huh?

342
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,420
我觉得只有我活下来了
I think I'm the only one who made it.

343
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,900
我游到了岸边
I managed to get to shore.

344
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,490
以为我很幸运 但...
I thought I was lucky,but...

345
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:53,540
什么 有人找到你了么 士兵还是...
What? Somebody found you? Soldiers,or...

346
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:59,490
对
Yes! Yes.

347
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:03,590
他们头戴面具 打我
They had these masks on and
they attacked me and beat me.

348
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,770
把我丢在这
They left me here!

349
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,910
他们是谁
Who are they?!

350
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,580
你要是能给我松绑就好了
You can untie me at
any point,by the way.

351
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,060
这地方不错啊
Nice place you have here.

352
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,420
谢谢
Oh,thank you.

353
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,530
告诉我 是所有的黑货市场都要雇打手么
Tell me. Does every fence
in this town hire muscle?

354
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:32,880
一听说你对Cass Derenick的所做
我就雇了
I did as soon as I heard about
what you did to Cass Derenick.

355
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,240
对了 Cass啊
Oh,yes,Cass.

356
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,560
愿他安息
God rest his soul.

357
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,340
他可不是善茬
He wasn't a very nice man.

358
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,860
想偷我东西
He tried to steal from me. Oh.

359
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,920
我听说你的判断力不错
I've heard that you have
a better sense of judgment.

360
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,950
能转移这个
And that you have no
trouble in moving this.

361
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:53,760
这只是完璧归赵啊
Well,it's only a
recession for some people.

362
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:00,590
我收15%的佣金
I take a 15% commission off the top.

363
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,100
12% 行吗
Let's call it at 12,shall we?

364
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,820
显然不用我提醒你
Obviously I don't have
to remind you about what

365
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,950
上个耍我的人 下场如何
what happened to the last person
who tried to screw me over.

366
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,400
斯特林城刑警 手放地上
SCPD! Grab the floor!

367
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,050
悄悄过来
Come quietly!

368
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,990
恐怕我得拒绝了
I'm afraid I'll have to decline.

369
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,950
恐怕你不会进监狱了
Then I'm afraid you
won't be going to jail.

370
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:33,680
我听新闻说神偷逃跑了
I heard on the news the Dodger got away.

371
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,650
但愿今晚没白干
Hopefully the night
wasn't a complete waste.

372
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,230
你的约会怎样
Your dates. How'd they go?

373
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,900
- 很好
- 不错
- Great.
- Awesome.

374
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,040
你俩太不会说谎了
You two suck at lying.

375
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,010
我和警方破坏了神偷的交易 他没拿到钱
The police and I busted it up before
the Dodger could get himself paid.

376
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,390
别转移话题
Don't change the subject.

377
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:51,600
你的黑客芯片还有用吗
Is your hacker chip still working?

378
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,580
你俩真没劲
You two are no fun.

379
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,390
有 还能接受到很强的信号
Yeah. Still getting a strong signal.

380
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,470
你该调出警方记录
You should pull up the police records.

381
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,030
所有神偷偷的东西
Everything the Dodger's stolen so far.

382
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:03,570
- 你想什么呢
- 我们知道骗子
- What are you thinking?
- We know the Dodger has a taste

383
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:07,210
爱好特别种类的古物
for a very specific type of antiquity.

384
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,200
看起来都像凶兆十年的产物
These all look like they're
from the ominous decade.

385
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,040
费迪南统治的最后十年
The last ten years of
King Ferdinand's reign.

386
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,430
她还说我们没有无聊
And she says we have no lives.

387
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,970
还有没有其他地方
销售或展示凶兆的东西
Are there any other places that sell
or display items from the ominous thing?

388
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,850
是时期 没有
Decade. Not really.

389
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,320
可能斯特林城市民更喜欢伊丽莎白时代
I guess people in Starling
City prefer the Elizabethan era.

390
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,000
斯特林城癌症协会
The Starling City Cancer Society.

391
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,650
那写着明晚他们要举办募捐拍卖会
It says right there they're holding
a fundraising auction tomorrow night.

392
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,880
我们能引诱他去
We could lure him out into the open.

393
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,340
用什么引诱 赝品吗
With what? A fake?

394
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,690
不 神偷会知道那是赝品的
No. The Dodger clearly has a
trained eye for this sort of thing.

395
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,920
除了真品外 他不会上当的
He's not going to fall for anything
less than the genuine article.

396
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,710
咱去哪找珍贵的西班牙古物
Where are we going to get our
hands on a rare Spanish antiquity?

397
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:48,320
你是真不知道他家有多有钱 是不是
You really have no idea how
rich his family is,do you?

398
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,210
小Roy William Harper
Roy William Harper Jr.

399
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,700
大的在哪
Where's senior?

400
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,600
诺里斯公墓
Norris cemetery.

401
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,560
抱歉
Sorry to hear that.

402
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,800
赌马的人多了
You and an army of bookies.

403
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:16,780
我能走了吗
Can I go?

404
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:20,800
不行 你被指认为一起
钱包盗窃案的嫌疑犯
No. You've been IDed as a
suspect in a purse snatching.

405
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,960
你这前科可真不少啊
It's quite a resume
you've compiled here.

406
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,640
小偷 入室盗窃 抢劫 小偷
Petty theft,B&E,robbery,petty theft.

407
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:30,710
偷车 老变花样啊 小偷
Stolen car. Well,it's nice to change
things up once in a while. And petty theft.

408
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,370
你怎么不抢银行
You got something against banks?

409
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,580
带枪抢劫太费劲了
Well,it is hard to run
with one under your arm.

410
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,350
没准你在监狱里能学两招
Well,maybe you'll learn a
few new skills in prison.

411
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,800
听着 我不想偷窃
Look,I don't want to steal.

412
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,050
好么 我没别的选择
Ok? I don't have any other choice.

413
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:47,410
我妈 她...她有问题
My mother,she... She has a problem.

414
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,410
没错 她儿子是个傻瓜
Yeah,her son's a moron.

415
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,290
不是
No.

416
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,580
致幻剂
Vertigo.

417
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,750
去年她迷上致幻剂
She got hooked on Vertigo last year.

418
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:06,480
她试着戒掉 但毒瘾太深
She kicked it,but I guess
she'd done enough that...

419
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,520
把她折磨得不成人形
It messed her up.

420
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:16,160
她不同于从前 她的医药费账单...
She hasn't been the
same,and her medical bills...

421
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:21,240
听着 我只是想帮她摆脱困境
look,I'm...I'm just trying to
help her get out from under.

422
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,880
听着 我们不像那些人养尊处优
Look,we're not privileged enough
to have as much as other people.

423
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,640
好么
Ok?

424
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,320
好吧
Fine.

425
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,140
让他走吧
Let him go.

426
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,110
不就是个包包吗
It's just a damn purse,right?

427
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,120
他们会和你会见
They'll meet with you.

428
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,930
已经安排好了
It has been arranged.

429
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,220
谢谢
Thank you for this.

430
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:53,390
还有一件事要你帮忙
There's one more thing
I need you to do for me.

431
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,480
只有Malcolm知道Walter被关在哪
Malcolm's the only one who
knows where Walter's being kept.

432
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,300
我需要条线索
I just...I just need a clue.

433
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,490
有线索去追踪
Some lead to follow.

434
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,940
要是计划成功了 
我可不想让它毁了Walter
If our plan works,I can't
let it damn Walter to hell.

435
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,420
不
No.

436
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,760
恐怕我们命该如此
That's the fate that's in
store for us,I'm afraid.

437
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,480
警察也到了
The police are here,too.

438
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,380
你的诱饵至少把他们引来了
Your bait's attracted them,at least.

439
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,510
这可不是我想抓的人
That's not exactly who
I'm looking to catch.

440
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,970
我从胸针的GPS上收到了良好的信号
So I'm getting a good signal from
the GPS I put in your family's broach.

441
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,390
能用手机追踪它
I can track it on my phone.

442
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,010
说到这 你想过如果这没用
Speaking of,have you given any
thought to what might happen

443
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:20,300
神偷还把你的珠宝卷跑了怎么办么
if this doesn't work and the Dodger
absconds with your family jewels?

444
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,230
不好意思 我不该这么说
I'm sorry,that came out very wrong.

445
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,270
仔细盯着就好 Felicity
Let's just keep our eyes open,Felicity.

446
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,790
那不是...
Hey,isn't that...

447
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,020
我还是去抓我的贼吧
I would rather take my chances
with a deadly jewel thief.

448
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,620
也是
Right.

449
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,860
胸针由Queen家族捐赠
That broach was donated
by the Queen family.

450
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,490
想要就得出价
If you want it,you're
going to have to bid.

451
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:08,710
宝贝 我想我可以直接拿走
Actually,love,I thought
I'd just take it.

452
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,610
我还是查看下前门 看安保是否正常
Maybe I should check out front,see if
the security guards had any problems.

453
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:20,500
很好 我去查看下诱饵
That's a good idea. I'm
going to go check on the bait.

454
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,890
我有麻烦了
I think I have a problem.

455
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,480
离开点 它要爆炸了...
Get away from me! If this thing blows...

456
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,850
不会爆的
Not going to happen.

457
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:37,050
神偷说过 报警他就会...
The Dodger said if I
called the police,he'd...

458
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,200
我会是无头鬼吗
I'm going to get decapitated,aren't I?

459
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,320
追踪器在移动
The tracker's on the move.

460
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,040
找到他 就让他帮你打开
If I find him,I can
get him to disarm it.

461
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,390
跟我说着话 要冷静
Talk me in. Stay calm.

462
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,940
来不及的
Too late.

463
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,140
去 快去
Go. Just go. Go,go,go.

464
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:59,810
说话 Felicity
Talk to me,Felicity!

465
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,920
朝亚当斯和奥尼尔大道去了
Heading towards Adams and O'Neil.

466
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,740
看速度 应该是开车的
At the clip he's going,he's
got to be in a vehicle.

467
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,320
嘿 借用你的车
Hey. I need your bike.

468
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,620
- 开玩笑吗 
- 并不是
Are you kidding me? No.

469
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,920
我在追了 他在哪
I'm mobile. Where is he?

470
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,140
快告诉我 Felicity
Talk to me,Felicity.

471
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,080
第一次这么感谢交通摄像头
First time anyone's ever been
grateful for traffic cameras.

472
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,020
他离你一个街区
He's one block from your position.

473
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,930
若从哈里斯广场穿过去 就能追上他
If you cut through Harris
Plaza,you'll end up right behind him.

474
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,250
他现在在哪
Where is he now?

475
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,980
看到了 我看到他了
Got it. I got him,I got him.

476
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:58,610
向北的灰色轿车里 你前面那个红绿灯处
Gray sedan driving north.
At the light ahead of you.

477
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,230
向右急转
Ok,hard right.

478
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,910
别做傻事
Don't do anything stupid.

479
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:22,070
我很有预见性地给一金发妞戴了项圈
她好奇心太重了
I had the foresight to collar up
a particularly inquisitive blonde.

480
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,960
猜你是她朋友
I assume she's a friend of yours.

481
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:28,010
敢碰我一下 她就没命了
Touch one hair on my
head and she loses hers.

482
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,380
你能做出明智的选择吧
You've got quite the
choice to make,don't you?

483
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,720
这次不了
Not this time.

484
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,900
你正中动脉被切断了
Your median artery's been severed.

485
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,530
没法按这个键了
You couldn't push that
button if you tried.

486
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,140
老天
Oh,thank God.

487
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,580
你为何如此
Why are you doing this?

488
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,030
我跟你一样
I'm exactly like you.

489
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,300
我只劫富
I only steal from the rich.

490
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,980
我可不是罗宾汉
I'm not Robin Hood.

491
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,280
我不知道这些人什么时候回来
I don't know when these
men are coming back!

492
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:09,400
相信我 放了我 求你了
You have to believe me. Untie me,please!

493
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:20,570
难道以为他们把我当诱饵安置在这吗
What,do you think these men,they planted
me here,some kind of trap or something?

494
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,810
那他们干嘛绑住你 就一走了之呢
Well,why'd they tie you up like
that and then just leave you?

495
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,250
为什么不直接杀了你
Huh? Why not just kill you?

496
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,740
本来要杀的 后来被叫走了
They were going to! They
got called away at some...

497
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:33,180
因为岛上别处起了争执
some altercation somewhere
else on the island.

498
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,670
他们要是回来 我们全得死
If they come back,they
will kill both of us.

499
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,600
求你了 必须相信我
Please! You have to believe me.

500
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,350
求求你
Please.

501
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,750
好吧 转过身去 转
All right,turn... all right,turn around.

502
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,330
谢谢
Thank you.

503
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,730
谢谢你
Thank you.

504
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:11,590
抱歉 不能放你
I'm sorry... But I can't.

505
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,020
什么 为什么
What? Why?!

506
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,820
为什么不能
Why not?

507
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,650
因为我不认识你
Because I don't know you.

508
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:25,090
你个脑残
Are you out of your mind?!

509
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,360
求你了
Please!

510
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:29,550
你怎么能这样 不能留我在这
You can't do this! You
can't just leave me here!

511
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:39,650
昨一整晚我都在想Andy该有多生气
You know,last night all I could think
about was how pissed off Andy will be;

512
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:44,230
看到我们在一起 会多受伤
how hurt he'll be if he saw us together.

513
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:51,810
可我若是伤害你 他会更难过 Carly
But that's nothing compared to how he'd
be if I did something to hurt you,Carly.

514
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,860
相信我 对我来说 约会比战争难多了
Believe me when I tell you
that war is easier than dating.

515
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:59,780
战争中 不进攻就得死
In a war,you act or you die.

516
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,800
不容置疑自己
No time to think,no time
to second guess yourself.

517
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,220
也许那就是你的问题了
Maybe that's your problem.

518
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,330
和我在一起 你想太多
With me,you're thinking.

519
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,530
却没用心感受
Not feeling.

520
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,390
没错
You're right.

521
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,800
你怎么知道我住这

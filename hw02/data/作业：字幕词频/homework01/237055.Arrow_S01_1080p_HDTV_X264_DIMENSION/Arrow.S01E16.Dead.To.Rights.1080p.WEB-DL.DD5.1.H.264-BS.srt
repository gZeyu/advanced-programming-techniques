1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,250
我叫Oliver Queen
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:09,570
被困在孤岛上5年以来
我只有一个目标...活下去
For 5 years,I was stranded on an
island with only one goal... survive.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,300
Oliver Queen还活着
Oliver Queen is alive.

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,030
现在 我要完成我父亲的夙愿
Now I will fulfill my
father's dying wish...

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:20,110
根据他留给我的名单
除掉那些毒害我城市的人
to use the list of names he left me and
bring down those who are poisoning my city.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,590
为了完成目标 我必须扮成别人
To do this,I must become someone else.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,950
我必须掩盖身份
I must become something else.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,340
绿箭侠 前情提要
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,650
我想让你和我一起调查义务警员
I'd like you to work with me 
on the Vigilante investigation.

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,970
谢谢 长官
Thank you,sir!

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,910
这只是开始 六个月后
It's just beginning. In six months,

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,120
组织对城市的愿景就能实现了
the organization's vision of what
this city should be will be complete.

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,790
成千上万的无辜市民会死于非命
你却毫无感觉
Thousands of innocent people will
be dead and you'll feel nothing.

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,860
不对
That's not true.

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,890
我会有很有成就感
I'll feel a sense of accomplishment.

16
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,940
我们有什么可以帮忙的
So... How can we be of assistance?

17
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,440
我想让你们帮我杀了Malcolm Merlyn
Malcolm Merlyn. I want
you to kill him for me.

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,580
但这些黑箭不是他的作案手法
These black arrows aren't
consistent with his M.O.

19
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,950
有些事没法联系起来
Something doesn't add up.

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,040
直升机要降落了是什么意思
What do you mean,the
chopper's about to touch down?

21
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,670
飞行记录不允许再给他们20分钟
The flight log doesn't have
them due for another 20 minutes!

22
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,650
那就封锁停机坪
Then lock down the heliport!

23
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,780
我刚到斯特林市
I've just landed in Starling City.

24
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:46,610
我们说好抵达时一半
事成后再一半
We agreed... half on arrival,the
other half when the job is done.

25
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,750
总额
a***

26
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,320
谢谢 别担心 这个人...
Gracias. Don't worry.
The man's as good as...

27
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,060
Guillermo Barrera
Guillermo Barrera.

28
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,950
你让这座城市失望了
You have failed this city.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,700
你名气可不小
You've built quite a reputation.

30
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,390
你本该在国外
And you should have stayed overseas.

31
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:16,770
我考虑过 但我想到我也不是吃素的
I thought about it,but then I
remembered... I've got a reputation,too.

32

35
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,230
关键是你要让体重均匀分布
Now the trick is to keep your
weight evenly distributed.

36
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,610
我还以为是避免打架呢
I thought the trick was to
avoid getting into fights.

37
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,040
斯特林市可不是靠讲道理
就能摆脱麻烦的地方
Yeah,well,Starling City's where you can talk
not the kind of place your way out of trouble.

38
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,470
而且你如果想和我们一起干
Besides,if you're going
to be working with us,

39
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,750
要是能保护自己我就更放心了
至少会一点
I'll sleep a lot easier knowing that you
can handle yourself... At least a little bit.

40
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,060
怎么样
How'd it go?

41
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,960
- 他很不幸
- 谁不幸
- Badly for him.
- Who's him?

42
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,060
会用飞刀的雇佣杀手
An assassin for hire with
an affinity for knives.

43
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,660
- 他以前叫Guillermo Barrera
- 以前
- His name was Guillermo Barrera.
- Was?

44
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,430
那我们问不到他的目标了
So we can't ask him
about his intended target?

45
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,100
是的
No.

46
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,060
所以我需要你黑进他的手机
Which is why I need
you to hack his phone.

47
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,350
Barrera是世界级的
Barrera's world class.

48
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,590
他的目标都很高端
He kills high profile targets.

49
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,950
他被雇做的事还没完成
And whatever job he was
hired for isn't finished.

50
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,060
我们得找出他来这要杀谁 得快
We need to figure out who
he was here to kill,and fast.

51
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,870
他们也许还身处险境
They are probably still in danger.

52
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,280
- 行吗
- 好
- Ok?
- Yeah.

53
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,460
我要去见McKenna了
I have to meet McKenna.

54
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,250
还好你们没在停机坪碰到
Good thing she didn't
meet you at the heliport.

55
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,820
最好不要迷恋上一个要抓你的警察
May not be a good idea to fall for
the cop that's hunting you down.

56
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,860
这对我们义务警员来说可是不二选择
Well,it's slim pickings
for us vigilantes.

57
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,140
四个
Four.

58
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,380
我还是比较适合跑步
Well,I'm more of a runner.

59
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,970
为什么那么急着要健身
Why the sudden desire to work out?

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,370
不然还能做什么
What else is there to do?

61
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,430
我们可以想其他办法离开这个岛
Well,we can try to think of
another way off the island.

62
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,850
没有其他办法
There is no other way.

63
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,930
要是有我早想到了
If there was,I would have found it.

64
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,630
我们不能坐以待毙
We can't just sit here and wait
for Fyers to come and kill us.

65
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,300
我是有个想法
I did have one idea.

66
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,660
如果去树林里找足够多的竹子
If you go into the forest and gather
as much bamboo as you can find...

67
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,260
然后呢
Yeah?

68
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,840
我们就能造一个船 就像梦幻岛里一样
We could build ourselves a boat,like
they did on "Gilligan's Island."

69
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,700
这个坏了
That's broken.

70
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,110
坠机的时候摔坏了
It got busted during the crash.

71
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,430
你有试过修吗
Did you try to get it to work?

72
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,900
我更擅长拆东西
I'm better at pulling things apart.

73
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,040
我爸是飞行员 他经常自己修东西
My father was a pilot and he
used to do his own maintenance.

74
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,560
你觉得维修飞机还能遗传吗
So you're hoping aircraft
maintenance is genetic?

75
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,570
不是 我以前一直帮他 
而且我也很喜欢
No,I used to help him and I liked it.

76
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,740
于是我就很擅长了
Then I got pretty good at it.

77
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,240
也许我能修好这个无线电
So maybe I can make the radio work.

78
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,110
你该为即将到来的战争训练自己
You should be training for the
inevitable fight that's looming.

79
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,220
我觉得我更有可能修好无线电
I think I have a better chance
of making the radio work.

80
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,470
抱歉我来晚了
Sorry I'm late.

81
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,290
是我晚了 被困在了办公室
No,I am. I just got
caught up at the office.

82
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,640
我也是
Me,too.

83
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,940
你真漂亮
You look nice.

84
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,890
我们应该进去
We should go inside.

85
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,230
应该
We should.

86
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,660
我们不像是要进去的样子
We don't seem to be going inside.

87
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,330
欢迎
Welcome.

88
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,800
- 生日快乐 兄弟
- 谢谢
- Happy Birthday,buddy.
- Thank you.

89
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,030
这个像教皇新堡
Oh,this feels like a
Chateauneuf de Pape.

90
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,010
味道也像
It's going to taste like one,too.

91
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,620
真了解我 谢谢
You are a true friend. Thank you.

92
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,720
Tommy 你还记得McKenna Hall吧
Tommy,you remember McKenna Hall.

93
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,610
- 时光倒回
- 又回来了
- From back in the day.
- And back again.

94
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,030
Ollie
Ollie.

95
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,200
- Laurel 这是...
- McKenna Hall
- Laurel,this is...
- McKenna Hall.

96
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,800
我们在法庭上认识的
We know each other from the court house.

97
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,280
你好吗 律师
How are you,counselor?

98
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,520
我很好 警官
I'm well,Detective.

99
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,050
- 我要把这开了
- 进来吧
- I'm going to go crack this open.
- Come in.

100
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,190
好漂亮的房子 地方很大
Such a nice apartment. So much space.

101
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,300
这张好有爱
Oh,this is adorable.

102
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,800
你几岁的时候
How old are you here?

103
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,210
这其实是我妹妹Sarah
That's actually my sister Sarah.

104
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,570
噢 抱歉
Oh,I am so sorry.

105
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,050
不 没事
No,no,it's ok.

106
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,330
我不知道我爸为什么给她买金丝雀
I don't know why my father
bought her that canary.

107
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,080
这鸟整天叽叽喳喳 吵得我们快疯了
That thing chirped night
and day. Drove us all nuts.

108
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,340
干杯
A toast.

109
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,990
庆祝这么久以来我的第一个生日
To the first birthday that I
have enjoyed in a long time.

110
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,540
我最好的朋友回来了
I got my best friend back.

111
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,950
还有我终于知道为什么
And... I have finally figured out
why poets have been in business

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,830
诗人在过去几千年一直能立足
for the last few thousand years.

113
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,140
- 生日快乐 亲爱的
- 谢谢
- Happy Birthday,baby.
- Thank you.

114
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,220
干杯
Cheers. Cheers.

115
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,950
- 大概是外卖
- 好
- I think that's the food.
- Oh,ok.

116
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,360
幸亏她没做饭
Oh,thank God,she didn't cook.

117
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,070
是啊
Amen.

118
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,430
Merlyn先生
Mr. Merlyn.

119
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,810
Laurel 我能进来吗
Laurel. Can I come in?

120
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,650
Oliver
Oliver.

121
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,130
Merlyn先生
Mr. Merlyn.

122
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,710
我一直想联系你呢
I've been trying to
get in touch with you.

123
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,520
爸 你怎么来了 
What are you doing here,Dad?

124
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,710
生日快乐 Tommy
Happy Birthday,Tommy.

125
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,230
我们单独谈谈
Just give us a second.

126
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,460
没问题
Of course.

127
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,070
- 我们准备吃饭了
- 我不久留
- We're about to eat.
- I can't stay.

128
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,000
那是 我没邀请你
Well,that works out
because you weren't invited.

129
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,730
我得到了斯特林市政集团的嘉奖
I'm being honored by the
Starling City Municipal Group.

130
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,250
他们授予我年度人道主义奖
They're bestowing me with
their annual Humanitarian Award.

131
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,050
怎么 他们没别人可授予了吗
What,they ran out of
actual humans to give it to?

132
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,300
如果可以我希望你能来
I would like you to
be there,if you could.

133
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,500
我确定我会很忙
I am 100% certain that I'll be busy.

134
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,840
你也许不会相信 我只是希望你快乐
You might not believe this,but all
I ever wanted for you was happiness.

135
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,880
如果这能缓和我们的关系
我还是会让它回到之前的状态
If it will allay this tension between
us,I'll turn the switch back on.

136
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,120
省着你的钱吧 老爸
Save your money,Dad.

137
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,600
我不会再需要了
I don't need it anymore.

138
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,620
我还是希望你能来参加这个活动
I'd still like you to come to the event.

139
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,260
这对我很重要
It would mean a lot to me.

140
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,660
知道吗 爸
You know what,Dad?

141
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:03,240
有时你最期待人 不会出现
Sometimes the people that you
want there the most... Aren't.

142
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,380
这是你教过我
You taught me that.

143
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,100
很多次的
Multiple times.

144
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,650
你好 Lawton
Hello,Lawton.

145
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,560
你的刀刃有点钝了
I see your edge has dulled.

146
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,980
我知道你在那儿
Oh,I knew you were there.

147
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,850
你是否要杀我 我不在乎
I just didn't care if you killed me.

148
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,310
你想怎么样
What do you want?

149
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:58,830
我们组织接了一单活儿 
除掉某位高层人士
My organization has been contracted to
eliminate a certain high profile individual.

150
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,720
那家伙保镖环绕
A very well-guarded target.

151
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,570
别妄想了
Well,forget it.

152
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,020
我已退出江湖
Look,I'm retired.

153
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,640
就为了终日抽烟酗酒
To drink and smoke your life away?

154
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,910
总有一天 我们都会送命
We all got to die some time.

155
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,870
我需要某人死于最佳时机
I need someone to die at the right time.

156
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,190
再说 你的业务最强啊
And no one does it better than you.

157
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:19,530
我的视力 今非昔比了
My vision... ain't
exactly what it used to be.

158
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,680
不
No.

159
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,900
会好转的
It's going to be better.

160
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,870
要我干掉谁
So... Who needs two
bullets in the chest?

161
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,110
Moira
Moira.

162
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,190
是真的吗
Is it happening?

163
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,300
对
Yes.

164
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,940
人道主义奖颁奖礼上
The Humanitarian Award ceremony.

165
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,540
太公开化了点吧
Isn't that a little public?

166
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,120
没人会料到的
No one will expect it.

167
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,950
我有好消息跟大家分享
I have very welcome news
to share with all of you.

168
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,600
多亏Queen集团的应用科学部门
Thanks to Queen Consolidated's
Applied Sciences Division

169
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,860
以及他们近期对Unidac工业的收购
and their recent acquisition
of Unidac Industries,

170
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:06,010
我们定下的目标 只须几个月就可实现
the Undertaking which we set for
ourselves is only months from fruition.

171
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,770
对全市人来说 可以肯定的是
There's hope on the horizon
for everyone in starling.

172
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,090
我们不会让他们失望
We won't fail this city.

173
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:21,050
代表在座各位说一句 
我们支持你 Malcolm
And I think I speak for everyone here
when I say we're all with you,Malcolm.

174
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,240
天呐 真是个偏执狂刺客
Jeez,this is one paranoid assassin.

175
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,400
Barerra的手机加密技术很高明
Barerra's got cobalt-level
encryption on his phone.

176
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,060
很难破解
It's not going to be easy to break.

177
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,060
但是 我小名叫破译者 其实是叫Megan
But codebreaker is my middle
name. Actually,it's Megan...

178
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,880
Felicity 你能挖出什么信息
Felicity,can you get anything off of it?

179
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,190
只有他最后拨打的号码
Just the last number he dialed.

180
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,920
- 打到哪里
- 唐人街的一个餐馆
- Which was?
- A restaurant in China town.

181
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,360
玉龙餐馆 杀手也爱吃我市最好的炒面
A Jade Dragon. I guess even hired
killers enjoy the city's best chow mien.

182
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,550
玉龙餐馆是中国黑帮的幌子
Yeah,Jade Dragon is a
front for the Chinese mafia.

183
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,090
打给餐馆 订一个今晚的两人桌
Call the restaurant,make a
reservation for two for tonight.

184
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,250
你得破解那部手机
You need to decrypt that phone.

185
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,880
我有点馋中餐了
I'm kind of in the mood for Chinese now.

186
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,380
这条鱼真大
That is...that is one big fried fish.

187
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,230
我听说这家川菜是本市最正宗的
I was told this was the most
authentic Szechwan in town.

188
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,420
我希望好好为你庆生
Whatever. I wanted to make sure that your
birthday celebration got its due celebration.

189
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,680
昨晚有点 拘谨
It was a little bit,um,tense last night.

190
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,240
都是因为我爸 气氛才不好的
Well,trust my dad to run all
the smiles out of the room.

191
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:44,360
他确实来过 
貌似他努力想表现得像个老爸
He did come by,and it seemed like he
was trying to act a little bit dad-like.

192
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,890
像个老爸 真是对我爸的精辟概括
Dad-like,that sums up
my father perfectly.

193
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,870
我知道 你俩没完全闹僵
I know the two of you
have never been close,

194
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,400
但你母亲过世后 他也挺不容易的
but it couldn't have been easy
for him after your mom was killed.

195
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,070
别忘了 丧母的我也不易啊
Yeah,I guess he forgot that
there were two of us in that club.

196
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,510
我不是为他辩解 Tommy
I'm not defending him,Tommy.

197
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:06,150
只是 我也曾经历坎坷 痛失亲友
It's... With everything I've been
through,people that I've lost...

198
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,470
我知道那有多难过
I know how hard it can be.

199
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,230
你忘了吧
You probably don't remember this.

200
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,140
那时我们才八岁
We were eight.

201
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,500
我母亲下葬后 他消失达两年之久
But after her funeral,he
left for like two years.

202
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:29,990
回来后 他非常冷漠
And when he did come back,he
was... he was so frickin' cold.

203
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,960
我们几乎没有交流
We barely spoke.

204
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,950
所以我才会常去你家
And that's why I spent so
much time at your house.

205
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:40,860
表面看起来 我有父亲
From the outside,it always
looked like I had a father.

206
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,870
他给我钱花 
我们住在一起 他来保释我
He paid my bills,he lived in
the house,he bailed me out.

207
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,940
但你爸爸带我玩了第一次曲棍球
But your dad took me
to my first hockey game.

208
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,720
你爸爸教我用假绳钓鱼
Your dad taught me how to fly fish.

209
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,590
你爸爸带我们
去看了第一场限制级电影
Your dad took us to
our first R-rated movie.

210
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,710
可他也非完人
but he wasn't perfect.

211
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,200
我爸也曾犯错
My dad made mistakes.

212
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:10,430
我们从未谈及此事
And... We haven't talked about this.

213
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,520
我对他有很多怒气
But I have a lot of anger towards him.

214
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:23,500
但我仍愿付出一切换他一命 因为...
But still,I would give anything
to have him back,because...

215
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,860
毕竟 他...还是你爸爸呀
At the end of the day,your
dad is... Your dad.

216
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,400
昨晚我说的是真心话
I meant what I said last night.

217
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,000
你回来了 我真的很高兴
I'm... really glad that you're back.

218
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,940
我去下洗手间
I got to hit the restroom.

219
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,780
黑帮正阴谋杀害某人
b***

220
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,900
告诉我是谁
c***

221
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,020
我没有替黑帮做事

222
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,830

00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,490
我不知道是谁

224

但你肯定知道点什么

225
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,470
跟我讲

226
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,660

227

不论发生什么事 应该是在明天

228
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,210
他是谁
k***

229
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,120
不知道 听他口音肯定是中国来的
(擦 这坑爹口音能是中国来的吗)
l***

230
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,440
买单
Check,please.

231
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,870
希望你爱吃烤肉
I hope you like barbecue.

232
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,700
不用太过感恩
Well,don't fall over
yourself thanking me

233
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,060
我在树上埋伏了6小时 给你弄了口吃的
for spending six hours
up a tree so you can eat.

234
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,120
你说啥
What?

235
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,420
很好 我一会儿吃
Great. I'll eat later.

236
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,510
你都鼓捣几天了 歇会儿吧
You've been on that for
days. Give it a rest.

237
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,680
我能弄好
It's because I can do this.

238
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,970
是啊 除非母猪会飞
Sure,kid. When pigs fly.

239
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,830
没开玩笑吧
You're kidding me.

240
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,930
声音能调清楚点吗
Can you clean this up?

241
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,370
不知道 我不知道是怎么做到这一步的
I don't know. I don't
know how I got this far!

242
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,180
继续靠近 大喷气机365
Continue approach. Big jet 365.

243
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,150
求救 求救 求救
Mayday,mayday,mayday.

244
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,530
我是楔子325
This is wedgetail 325.

245
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,220
飞行员和乘客已罹难
Pilot and passenger down.

246
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:57,470
2-7跑道就绪 有风 2-7-0度 风速10节
Runway 2-7 right,wind,2-7-0
degrees,10 knots.

247
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:02,680
重复一遍 
飞行员和乘客已于炼狱岛罹难
I repeat...pilot and passenger
down on the island of Lian Yu.

248
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,540
请立即援救
Request immediate rescue.

249
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,950
可以着陆 2-7跑道就绪
Cleared to land,runway 2-7 right.

250
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,250
大喷气机365
Big jet 365.

251
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,600
他们听不见我们说话 我们没法呼救
They can't hear us,and
we can't call out.

252
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,010
我们仍是困兽
We're still trapped.

253
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,430
Lance
Lance.

254
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,410
黑帮雇了个职业杀手
The Triad have hired a contract killer.

255
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,450
是吗 你说停尸房那个
Yeah? You mean the one
you put in the morgue?

256
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,160
恭喜 你又成警察局的谈资了
Congratulations,you're the
talk of the station again.

257
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,200
他们雇了一个 就会再雇一个 探长
They hired one,they're going
to hire another,Detective.

258
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,300
知道会雇谁吗
Who's your target?

259
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,820
我在努力查 但没有线索
I'm trying to find out
but I'm hitting dead ends.

260
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,510
我希望你的人也着手调查
I need you to put your people on it.

261
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,120
我的人可不是你的手下
My people don't work for you.

262
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,240
对了 我也不是你的手下
And come to think of it,neither do I.

263
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,110
这不是你我之间的事 探长
It's not about you and me,Detective.

264
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,030
而是性命攸关的大事
It's about saving a life.

265
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,610
查出是谁了再打给我
Call me back when you got a name.

266
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,440
Hall
Hall.

267
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,500
有何吩咐 长官
Yes,sir?

268
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:55,560
你和我 我们去抓义务警员
You and me. We're going
to catch that Vigilante.

269
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,190
主楼层的5个出口都得堵死
There are five exit routes from the
main floor that need to be cut off.

270
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,670
一旦火警铃响 我们得在30秒内
Once the fire alarm goes
off,we'll have less than 30 seconds

271
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:11,180
解决掉Merlyn的贴身保镖 
迫使他和人流一起出去
to disable Merlyn's private security
and force him outside with the others.

272
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:17,120
等他出去了 
剩下的活儿 Lawton先生来干
Once he's outside... The
rest will be up to Mr. Lawton.

273
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,680
明白
Roger that.

274
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,330
拒绝访问
m***

275
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,330
好帅哦
You look handsome!

276
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,000
不是故意的 哥就是天生丽质嘛
I try not to. It just keeps happening.

277
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,670
干嘛去呀
What's the occasion?

278
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,310
去我爸的颁奖礼
I decided to go to my dad's thing.

279
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,390
真的
Really?

280
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,130
真的想好了
Are you sure?

281
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,010
差不多吧
Oh,mostly.

282
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,230
要我跟你一起去吗
Did you want me to go with you?

283
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,210
不用 不用 你忙你的吧
No,no,no,I know you have work to do.

284
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,710
我保证好好的
I promise I will be fine.

285
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,970
妈
n***

286
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,070
忽略
o***

287
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,980
你真美
You look beautiful.

288
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,130
谢谢
Thank you.

289
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,030
方便的话
我们可以在典礼之后一起进餐
If you're free,maybe after the ceremony,

290
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,040
聊一聊 就像以前那样
we could have dinner
and talk like we used to.

291
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,140
非常乐意
I'd like that.

292
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,910
我该走了
That's my cue.

293
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,300
整晚我都在躲着他
I've been trying to
avoid him all evening.

294
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,270
我们不出现才可疑
If we didn't show,it'd look suspicious.

295
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,850
你怎么能那么镇定
How can you talk to him that way?

296
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,310
跟没事人一样
As if nothing's about to happen?

297
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,060
我都这样五年了
I've been living this
life for five years.

298
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,450
再多五分钟没什么
Five more minutes won't matter.

299
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,300
女士们 先生们 晚上好
Good evening,ladies and gentlemen.

300
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,730
今天的获奖人无需多介绍
Now tonight's honoree needs
very little introduction.

301
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:56,670
撇开他的财富和名誉
It's neither his wealth nor his
name that we celebrate here tonight.

302
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:03,210
他为建造出更好的斯特林城
所付出的努力更为我们称道
But it is his efforts in making Starling
City a better and safer place to live.

303
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:10,680
一起来欢迎本年度
斯特林城的慈善家Malcolm Merlyn先生
So please help me welcome Starling City's
humanitarian of the year,Mr. Malcolm Merlyn.

304
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,950
那是个舞台
And so that's a stage,right.

305
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,550
一般晚上都会有乐队
Most nights we'll have a band.

306
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,970
很酷的那种
Fallout Boy乐队还流行吗
Somebody cool. Is
Fallout Boy still cool?

307
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,500
他们解散了
They broke up.

308
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,370
早就不流行了
And never.

309
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,840
还会有人再把乐队组起来的
So somebody else will pick the bands.

310
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,330
你有烦心事
Something bothering you?

311
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,640
别说没有 你撒谎技术太烂了
Don't say no,'cause
you're a terrible liar.

312
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,690
是吗
Really?

313
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,390
我还以为我技术进步了呢
I thought I was getting better at it.

314
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,280
怎么了
What's wrong?

315
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,730
生活中有好多事啊
There's a lot of stuff
going on in my life.

316
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,720
工作
Work.

317
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,300
朋友
Friends.

318
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:19,270
我正在艰难的思考适应所有的办法
And I'm having a... difficult time
figuring out how to fit it all in.

319
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,800
我对于那些也很纠结啊
I've been struggling with
some of those thoughts,as well.

320
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,950
有什么好主意吗
Do you have any good ideas?

321
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,350
我觉得坦诚对待生活就好
I think we just have to be really honest
about what's going on in our lives.

322
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,970
做得到吗
Think you can do that?

323
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,800
拜托啊
Come on.

324
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,970
进去啦 太好了
I'm in! Yes!

325
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,810
就是这样 Felicity Smoak
Yes! Yes,way to go,Felicity Smoak.

326
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,970
你不说西班牙语吧
You don't happen to
speak Spanish,do you?

327
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:44,970
阿拉伯语
Arabic.

328
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,850
唉
Oh,le sigh.

329
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,810
天啊
Oh,my God.

330
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,130
我在你身边啊
You know I'm there for you.

331
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,400
打扰一下 Queen先生
Excuse me,Mr. Queen.

332
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:03,310
信息技术部门有您要找的东西
The I.T. department has
that item that you requested.

333
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,530
- 稍等
- 好
- One sec.
- Ok.

334
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,060
你找到目标了
You find the target?

335
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,160
Oliver 目标是Tommy的爸爸
Oliver,the target is Tommy's father.

336
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,040
在颁奖典礼
At the awards ceremony?

337
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,480
Tommy在那
Tommy's there.

338
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,240
McKenna Diggle先生送你回家
Um,McKenna,Mr. Diggle is
going to take you home.

339
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,860
我突然有事
I have some unexpected business.

340
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,310
没关系
It's ok.

341
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,560
Lance
Lance.

342
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,140
目标是Malcolm Merlyn
Target is Malcolm Merlyn.

343
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,110
设好防线 保持距离
Establish a perimeter
but keep your distance.

344
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,050
我不希望警察介入
I don't want the police
caught in the crossfire.

345
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:39,210
我家真正的慈善家
是我的妻子Rebecca
The true humanitarian in the
Merlyn family was my wife Rebecca.

346
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,100
在座许多人都知道她
Many of you here knew her.

347
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:46,310
她不辞辛苦的致力于
帮助那些在林间不幸的人
She tirelessly devoted herself to helping
those less fortunate in the glades.

348
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:50,690
毫不夸张的说
假如有人想要谋杀她
I like to think that if the
men who murdered her knew her;

349
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:55,450
当他了解她的所作所为
knew the work that she did,knew
the person that she was...

350
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,950
肯定不会再偷她的钱包再杀了她
He would have helped her to
her car,made sure she was safe,

351
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:03,090
而会将她亲自送回车里
确保她的安全
instead of stealing her
purse and shooting her.

352
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,840
事实上 我为这座城市做的不够多
The truth is,I haven't
done enough for this city.

353
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,600
我的城市
My city.

354
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,460
我辜负了它
I failed it.

355
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,410
但我保证 我还会继续
But I promise you...
I am not finished yet.

356
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:25,640
我保证 这座城市会变得更好
I promise you that this city
will be better for all of us.

357
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:32,810
到那一天 再看到这个华丽的奖杯
我会感到名之所至
And on that day,I will look at this beautiful
award and feel that I have earned it.

358
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:35,630
谢谢大家
I thank you.

359
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,760
Tommy
Tommy!

360
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,160
Merlyn没上钩 改变计划
Merlyn's not taking the
bait. Change of plans.

361
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,020
我讨厌临时改计划
I don't like improvisation.

362
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,550
让他上楼 去他屋顶的办公室
Drive him upstairs to
his penthouse office.

363
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,620
我需要到有利的地方去
I need to switch vantage points.

364
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,710
Tommy
Tommy!

365
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,560
Tommy
Tommy!

366
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,430
跟我来
Come with me.

367
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,270
二楼有一个出口
There's an exit on the second floor.

368
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,680
你安全了我再走
I wasn't leaving until
I knew you were safe.

369
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,880
去安全的地方 我会拖住他们
Go somewhere safe. I'll hold them off.

370
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,460
- 快走
- 走吧
- Go now!
- Come on!

371
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,190
- 去哪
- 上楼
- Where are we going?
- Up.

372
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,590
- 他们是谁
- 不知道
- Who are those guys?
- I don't know.

373
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,800
他们想杀你
They're trying to kill you!

374
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,730
似乎是
Seems that way.

375
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,940
我们就这么不带保镖自己上楼吗
And we're going up,without
any of your bodyguards?

376
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,370
爸 我们得离开这里
Dad! We need to get out of here.

377
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,820
Tommy 深呼吸 相信我
Tommy,take a deep breath and trust me.

378
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,080
我楼上的办公室是间安全房
Upstairs in my office is a panic room.

379
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,050
我们到了那 就关上门
We get there,we seal it off.

380
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,460
Merlyn在往顶层走
Merlyn's headed to the penthouse.

381
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,910
为什么要杀Malcolm Merlyn
Why do you want Malcolm Merlyn dead?

382
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,600
杀你也行
I'll settle for you.

383
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,210
等等
Wait!

384
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,620
- 走
- 你杀了他
- Go!
- You killed him!

385
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,790
因为他可能会杀你
Surely as he would have killed you.

386
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,040
走 走 快走
Move,move,move!

387
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,550
电磁闭锁
Electromagnetic locks.

388
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,670
要是他们关了电源呢
What if they cut the power?

389
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,720
这层楼是完全独立的输电网
This floor is on an
entire separate grid.

390
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,030
万一打碎玻璃呢
The glass?

391
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,340
聚碳酸酯的 防弹的 没事了
Lexan. Bulletproof. It's over.

392
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,800
你怎么会的
How did you know how to do that?

393
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,620
什么
What?

394
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,620
打人
Fight.

395
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:51,190
杀人
Kill.

396
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,160
爸
Dad?

397
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:30,710
不许动 斯特林市警察
Freeze! SCPD.

398
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,290
把弓放下
Put the bow down.

399
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,450
Tommy 你还好吗
Tommy,you ok?

400
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,990
爸
Dad!

401
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,710
爸
Dad?!

402
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,700
慢慢转过身来
Turn around slowly.

403
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,400
爸
Dad.

404
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,240
对不起
I'm sorry.

405
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,370
我没事
I'm ok.

406
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,070
没事
I'm ok.

407
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,980
靠
Damn it.

408
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,250
你在流血啊
You're bleeding. You're bleeding.

409
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:47,770
我没事的 Tom
I'll be fine,Tom.

410
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,830
不要啊 爸
No,no,no,Dad!

411
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,510
别过来
No!

412
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:55,550
退后
Stay back.

413
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,980
我不是来伤害你或者你爸爸的
I'm not here to hurt you or your father.

414
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,780
我说了退后
I said stay back.

415
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,090
是箭毒
Curare.

416
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,520
别再靠近了
Don't come any closer.

417
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,030
你爸中毒了
Your father's been poisoned.

418
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:14,010
一名叫Floyd Lawton的刺客
把他的子弹涂上了箭毒
An assassin named Floyd Lawton
laces his bullets with curare.

419
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,330
我以前处理过这种
I've dealt with this before.

420
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,360
我们需要稀释他血液里的毒
We need to dilute the
poison in his bloodstream.

421
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,800
我让你往后退
I said stay the hell back!

422
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,760
3分钟内他会失去知觉
In three minutes he's paralyzed.

423
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,210
4分钟内他会窒息而亡
In four minutes,he suffocates.

424
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:28,500
如果你不让我帮你
不用等其他人赶来他就死了
If you don't let me help you now,he's
dead before anybody gets here!

425
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,790
帮我 怎么帮
Help. How?

426
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:34,440
新鲜的血液可以让他挺到医院
Fresh blood buys him time
to get to the hospital.

427
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,200
输血吗
A blood transfusion?

428
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,760
太荒唐了
That's insane!

429
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,190
这是唯一的方法
It's the only way.

430
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,720
他需要你输血
He needs your blood.

431
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,960
没时间了
You're out of time.

432
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,390
你必须现在做决定
You need to make a decision right now.

433
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,870
我为什么要相信你
Why should I trust you?!

434
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,710
因为你一直如此
Because you always have.

435
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,210
Oliver
Oliver.

436
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,720
准备好了吗
Ok. Ready?

437
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,940
开始吧
Do it.

438
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,880
托住他的胳膊
Hold his arm.

439
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,970
加油 加油 加油
Come on,come on,come on.

440
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,770
你是义务警员
You're the Vigilante.

441
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,680
为什么
Why?

442
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,800
以后再说
Later.

443
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:17,900
他还需要住院治疗
He's still going to
need medical attention

444
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:21,110
才能完全清除血液里的毒液 明白吗
to fully clean out his
system,you understand?

445
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,080
嗯
Ok.

446
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,800
谢谢
Thank you.

447
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:34,980
Tommy
Tommy.

448
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,800
我在这 爸
I'm right here,Dad.

449
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:47,790
帽衫男跟你说什么了
What did the Hood say to you?

450
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,220
什么都没说
He didn't say anything.

451
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:52,130
你听信一个杀人狂进行现场输血
You let a homicidal maniac talk you
into a homemade blood transfusion

452
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,760
而不是呼叫医务人员
instead of calling the paramedics?

453
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,230
我父亲的生命危在旦夕
My father's life was at stake.

454
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,640
帽衫男先是从绑匪手里救了你和Queen
So first the Hood rescues you
and Queen from those kidnappers,

455
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,940
现在他又救了你父亲
now he saves your old man.

456
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:05,680
但他又不遗余力地扳倒其他大人物
But he's taking down every
other one percenter out there.

457
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:09,450
难道说他是你的朋友 Merlyn
Is this guy a friend of yours,Merlyn?

458
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,760
我根本不认识他
I don't know who the hell he is.

459
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:35,700
如果他们听不见我们说话
那这又有什么用呢
If they can't hear
us,then what's the point?

460
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,680
等等
Wait!

461
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,140
可能还是有点用
You still might have done us some good.

462
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,920
凌晨5点离开我的坐标
0500 hours from my mark.

463
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,420
终极部署准备就绪
Final deployment is five by five.

464
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,080
那是Fyers
That's Fyers!

465
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,880
我将频率调到了部队的波段
I'm tuned into the soldier's frequency.

466
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:51,140
Scylla正在路上 预计早上6点抵达
Scylla is in route. ETA 0600 hours.

467
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,230
在西南海湾
At the southwest bay.

468
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,130
Scylla就位后联系你
I'll call you when Scylla
is in my possession.

469
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,610
Fyers出发了
Fyers out.

470
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,050
Fyers在跟谁说话
Who was Fyers talking to?

471
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,660
不知道
I don't know.

472
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,690
听起来不像是岛上的人
说不定是他的雇主
Sounds like someone off this
island,maybe his benefactor.

473
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,620
更关键的是 Scylla是什么
More importantly,who or what is Scylla?

474
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,260
Scylla和Charibdis
The Scylla and Charibdis.

475
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,960
是奥德赛里的人物 
那章讲述了四大噩梦之一
It's "The Odyssey," from one
of the four nightmare chapters.

476
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,400
Scylla是个怪物
Scylla was a monster.

477
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,540
我想会会这个怪物
I want to meet this monster.

478
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,110
一起去吗
Am I going alone?

479
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,200
救了个大人物 感觉怎么样
So how's it feel to
save a one percenter?

480
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,760
看起来Malcolm Meryln没什么大碍
Looks like Malcolm
Meryln's going to be ok.

481
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,550
他们把他送到了斯特林市总医院
They took him to Starling General.

482
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,710
还好他穿了防弹背心
Good thing he was wearing
a bulletproof vest.

483
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:54,580
他不是因为枪伤才进的医院
He's not in the hospital
because he was shot.

484
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,920
他被箭毒所伤
He was poisoned by curare.

485
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,540
Lawton还活着
Lawton's alive.

486
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:18,090
抱歉 John
I'm sorry,John.

487
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:31,980
这个Lawton找过他麻烦吗
This Lawton kick his dog or something?

488
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,650
没
No.

489
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,100
他杀了John的哥哥
He killed his brother.

490
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,070
什么
What?

491
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,190
那是什么
What is it?

492
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,650
你说对了
You were right.

493
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,180
Scylla确实是个大怪兽
Scylla is a monster.

494
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:57,220
俄罗斯S300防空导弹发射台
A Russian-made S300
anti-aircraft missile launcher.

495
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:03,290
它可以同时追踪100个目标
至少命中1打
It can simultaneously track up to a hundred
targets while engaging with at least a dozen.

496
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,840
我是说 从这他们可以击落一驾商用客机 
甚至于挑起一场战争
I mean,from here,they could shoot down
a commercial airliner,or start a war.

497
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,820
你来了啊
Hey,you're here.

498
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,050
跟我来
Walk with me.

499
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,530
我听说你在事发现场 你还好吗
I heard you were there,are you ok?

500
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,430
我很好
I'm fine. Fine.

501
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:29,540
听着 McKenna 我...
我很抱歉当时匆忙离开了
Listen,McKenna,I'm... I'm really sorry
that I had to run out on you like that.

502
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,430
没关系 5分钟之后 我也得走了
Don't worry. Five more minutes,and
I would have had to run out on you.

503
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:38,080
我们的生活都不简单
Our lives are complicated.

504
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:44,150
尽管如此 如果你愿意的话
But I'm willing to figure us out.

505
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,610
我还是愿意确定我们的关系
If you are.

506
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,360
我很乐意并且能做到
Willing and able.

507
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,370
爸爸
Hey. Hey,Dad.

508
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,720
放轻松
Take it easy.

509
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,830
你中枪了
You were shot.

510
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,890
子弹上有毒
The bullet was laced with poison.

511
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,910
我怎么没死
I should be dead.

512
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,430
我给你输了血
I gave you a blood transfusion.

513
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:21,900
事实上...是义务警员的主意
Actually it was... the Vigilante's idea.

514
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:24,350
他救了你
He saved you.

515
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,050
是吗
He did?

516
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,410
我好害怕就这样失去你
I was worried I was going to lose you.

517
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,880
我哪也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

518
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:36,000
妈妈死了之后 你也是这样说的
You said that after mom died.

519
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,400
但你还是走了
But you left.

520
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,850
你妈妈死了之后 
我没有尽到父亲的责任
I wasn't a very good father to
you after your mother passed away.

521
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,870
我当时好迷茫
I was so lost.

522
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,790
你从没告诉过我 你去哪了
You never told me where you went.

523
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,220
我到了一个叫Nanda Parbat的地方
I found myself in a
place called Nanda Parbat.

524
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,420
在那我遇到了一个人
I met a man there.

525
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,690
他让我对事物有了新的认知
He helped me make sense of things.

526
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,780
他让我找到了人生的目标
He helped me to find
a purpose for my life;

527
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,600
让大家感觉这个城市更加美好
to make this city a
better place for everyone.

528
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,180
尤其是你
Especially for you.

529
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,110
你打算怎么做
How are you going to do that?

530
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,470
Malcolm
Malcolm?

531
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,280
Tommy
Tommy.

532
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,750
我可以和Moira单独谈一下吗
Could I talk to Moira for a minute?

533
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,370
谢天谢地 你还活着
Thank God you're all right.

534
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:57,860
我们中有个叛徒
We have a traitor in our midst.

535
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:00,670
你去把他找出来
I want you to find out who.

536
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,880
他大错特错了
He just made his last mistake.

537
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,810
我爸爸没事 多亏了你
My dad's going to be ok,thanks to you.

538
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,600
多亏你自己
It's thanks to you.

539
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,960
我曾经问过你 在岛上发生了什么
No one's asked you what happened
to you out on that island.

540
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:27,620

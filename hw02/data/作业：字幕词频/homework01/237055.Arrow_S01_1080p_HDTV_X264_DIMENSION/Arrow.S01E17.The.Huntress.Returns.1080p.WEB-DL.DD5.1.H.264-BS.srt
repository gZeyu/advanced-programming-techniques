64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,750
从头说起吧

Oliver是在中国北海的
炼狱岛上被发现的

没人知道她是不是被冲上这些岛了
And nobody would know if she'd
washed up in any one of those.

69
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,450
其实你没有证据证明她还活着
So you don't actually have
any proof that she's alive?

70
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,570
我有
I have proof.

我们的女儿还活着 Quentin
Our daughter's a survivor,Quentin.

74

你这算什么

me,ok? Sarah died on that boat.

78
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,260
我不会相信的
why are you making me re-live this? I'm not doing this.


79
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,680
- 爸
- 别
- Dad...
- No.

80

83
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,940
我们都能带伴儿的吧
We both have plus ones,right?

84
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:50,450
我不知道 你等我一下
Uh,I-I don't know.
Hang on just a second.

85
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,430
小偷也会喝咖啡休息呀
I didn't know purse
snatchers took coffee breaks.

86
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,210
对于骄傲自大的白富美来说

你也花太多时间在林中空地了吧

- 你 会有工作

89
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,430
没错 你也试着找份工作吧
Yeah. You know,you
should try it some time.

90
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,040
不要老在街上游荡抢别人钱包了
Instead of hanging waiting to boost somebody's handbag.
out on a street corner,

91
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,920
听上去不错 但是谁会要一个
Sounds good. Know anyone who's hiring high
school dropouts with a couple of priors,

92
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,900

还有暴力史的高中辍学生呢
no references and a history of violence?

93

你觉得这样好吗 
让我去负责陌生人的车
Do you think it's a good idea?
Me,taking the keys to stranger's cars?

97
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,570
要么接受要么闭嘴
I think it's time you put up or shut up.

98
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,540
找你哥谈
Talk to your brother.

99
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,460
你去哪了
Where you been?

100
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,510
我让自己难得享受了一个早晨
Oh,I thought I'd give
myself a rare morning in.

101

Why would she come back to
Starling City just for him?

112
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,980
他貌似没有尽职

She was just telling me about
your guys' first date-- at Russo's.

127
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,140
好啊 Oliver
Hello,Oliver.

128
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:23,030
Ollie 我有个称不上朋友的人在找工作
Oh,Ollie,I kind of have this pseudo
friend that's looking for a job.

129
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,950
俱乐部还在招人吗
I was wondering if the
club's still hiring?

130
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,390
当然 去找Tommy吧
Yes. Of course. Talk to Tommy.

131
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,640
你现在就可以上楼打电话给他了
As a matter of fact,you can go
upstairs and call Tommy,right now.

132
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,960
好的 你真赞
Great. You rock.

133
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,510
你去哪了
Where you been?

134
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,800
巴塞罗那
Barcelona.

135
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,450
摩纳哥 布达佩斯
Monaco,Budapest.

136
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,440
我想忘了自己是谁 想忘了你
I just needed to forget who I
was. And how much I missed you.

137
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,580
你是想念Gus Sabatoni了吧
Do you mean like you
missed Gus Sabatoni?

138
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,810
Helena 我以为
你和你父亲的组织已经了断了 
I thought you were done with
your father's organization,Helena.

139
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:04,710
他已被判无期徒刑
Because he's serving consecutive
life sentences in Iron Heights prison.

140
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,010
你复仇目的达到了
You got your revenge.

141
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,890
两天后 证人保护组织会给他
一个新名字 一个新生活
He just cut a deal with to testify against
the Justice Department the East Coast family.

142
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,610
他就永远逃离法网无迹可寻了
In 48 hours,Witness Protection a new life,and he'll be off
will give him a new name, the grid forever-- untraceable!

143
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,790
我很抱歉
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

144
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,380
我父亲不该有第二次机会 第二次生命
My father doesn't deserve a
second chance-- a second life.

145
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:30,240
我一个人对付不了这么多警察
And I can't. I can't take on
a phalanx of U.S. marshals.

146
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,600
- 没有帮助的情况下
- 不行
- Not without help.
- No.

147
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:39,540
这是谋杀 不是伸张正义
It's murder. It's not justice.

148
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,090
你在这啊 今晚的开张我有个问题
Oh,there you are. I have a
question about your opening tonight.

149
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,440
你好
Hello.

150
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,390
Oliver 这是你哪个朋友
Oliver,who's your friend?

151
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,540
噢 妈妈 这是Helena
Helena 这是我妈
Oh! Mom,this is Helena.
Helena,this is my mother.

152
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,070
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

153
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,600
- Helena正准备走
- 嗯 我要去家庭聚会了
- Helena was just leaving.
- Yes. I have a family engagement.

154
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,600
- 我等会过来
- 好的
- Excuse us for a minute.
- Of course.

155
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,650
我想我能说服你
I guess I will just have
to be more persuasive.

156
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,550
毕竟你也有家庭 
Fortunately... You have a family,too.

157
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,630
<i>翡翠</i>
<i>ver**</i>

158
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,100
她在我家 摆明了威胁我
She was in my house. She
made a not so veiled threat.

159
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,820
我妈和妹妹必须严加保护
I want extra security
around my mother and sister.

160
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,110
- 早就想到了 兄弟
- 谢谢
- Way ahead of you,man.
- Thank you.

161
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,600
- 这是我的工作
- 别这种口气
- It's my job.
- For not saying,"I told you so."

162
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,490
长夜漫漫
Night's young.

163
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,410
你去哪了 俱乐部四小时后就开张了
Where you been? The
club opens in four hours.

164
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,340
- 我在处理供应商的事情
- 你没有
- I've been dealing with the vendors.
- No,you haven't.

165
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:57,470
Tommy 我们得谈谈
Tommy... We need to talk.

166
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,210
我很抱歉
I'm sorry,all right.

167
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:06,730
我不说是为了保护身边的人
But I kept this a secret to protect
the people that are closest to me.

168
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,630
你以为我关心这个吗
Do you think that's what I care about?

169
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,820
是因为我被伤到了吗
What,that my feelings are hurt?

170
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,190
你是凶手 是杀人犯
You're a murderer. A killer.

171
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:22,990
你是我最好的朋友
可我现在完全不认识你了
You were my best friend in life, but
now it's like I don't even know you.

172
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,890
你说得对 我变了
You're right. I've changed.

173
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,060
兄弟 现在我可以向你解释
Listen,buddy,now I can explain to you.

174
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,640
我可以解释为什么...
I can explain to
you how and why--

175
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,160
有意义吗
What'd be the point?

176
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,680
反正我不会再信你
I wouldn't believe a word of it,anyway.

177
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:50,710
其中一枚导弹的有效射程是2400公里
One of those missiles has an effective
range of up to 2,400 kilometers.

178
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,310
查清Fyers的阴谋前 咱俩哪儿也不去
We're not going anywhere until we
figure out what Fyers is planning.

179
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,400
我猜 他要炸掉什么吧
Wild guess? He's planning
on blowing something up.

180
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,400
用那枚导弹 大材小用
Well,one of those could
do the job. But this?

181
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,570
这是发动战争的征兆
This is about starting a war.

182
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,950
- 跟谁打
- 有什么关系
- With who?
- What does it matter?

183
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,460
我们得阻止Fyers涂炭生灵
We have to stop Fyers before he
kills thousands of innocent people.

184
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,760
下面重兵集结呢
There are tons of soldiers down there.

185
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,280
即使我俩把他们都撂倒
Even if we get through all of them,

186
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,870
也没法偷走整套导弹发射器
we can't just steal a
whole missile launcher.

187
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,150
谁说要偷了
Well,who said anything
about stealing it?

188
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,520
那要干嘛 伏击
So what's the plan? Ambush?

189
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,140
不行 一次性得搞定6个人 
其中肯定会有人呼叫援助
It's impossible. We can't take out all
six without one radioing for back up.

190
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,590
如果能把那些兵聚集在一起就好了
It'd be good if we could get
all the soldiers in one place.

191
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,400
不错
You're right.

192
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,120
破玩意儿
*****

193
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,710
订书机得罪你了
What'd the stapler ever do to you?

194
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,610
干嘛 Laurel 我忙着呢
帽衫侠的女友回来了
What is it,Laurel? I'm busy.
The Hood's girlfriend is back.

195
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,380
爸 早上的事 我很抱歉
Dad,I'm sorry about this morning.

196
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,240
可如果我据实以告
But if I told you the
real reason to come see me,

197
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,340
你根本不会来见我
you wouldn't have shown up.

198
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,720
你说得太对了
You're damn right I wouldn't.

199
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,350
你妈说Sarah还活在奇幻岛上
So you really believe this
garbage your mother's selling

200
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,660
你真相信这种胡话
about Sarah being
alive on fantasy island?

201
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,850
不
I mean,no.

202
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,060
但看一看妈妈的发现 也没什么坏处啊
But what would it hurt to take a
look at everything that mom found?

203
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,850
即使只是让她面对现实
Even if it's just to set her straight.

204
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,720
Laurel 你知不知道我花了多久
Laurel,you know how
long it's taken for me

205
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,940
才使自己不要每天一早就想起Sarah
to get to a place where Sarah isn't the
first thing I think about every morning?

206
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,850
爸...
Dad...

207
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,560
转告你妈 我不做任何承诺
Tell your mom I'm not
making any promises.

208
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,340
敬翡翠
To Verdant.

209
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,440
我没有一直支持这个项目
I know I haven't always been
supportive of this venture,

210
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,550
但我必须承认 这个夜店很赞
but I have to admit this nightclub
is quite an accomplishment.

211
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,510
我以你为傲 你父亲肯定也一样
I'm proud of you. Your
father would be,too.

212
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,520
谢谢
***

213
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,040
恭喜 Ollie 这儿也不是很糟啦
Yeah,congratulations,Ollie.
The club doesn't totally suck.

214
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,200
过奖 飞毛腿 谢谢大家来捧场
Thanks,Speedy. Thank you very
much,all of you,for coming.

215
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,400
你在这儿呢
There you are.

216
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:58,270
这地方真棒 我为你和Ollie自豪
This place is amazing. I'm
so proud of you and Ollie.

217
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,280
谢谢
Thanks.

218
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,690
- 你没事吧
- 我挺好
- Is everything ok?
- I'm great.

219
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,960
早餐真是场灾难
Well,breakfast was a disaster.

220
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,380
早餐 和我父母
Breakfast? With my parents?

221
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,440
对 今早的事
Right. That was this morning.

222
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,580
对不起
Sorry.

223
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:22,230
你确定没事吗 你看起来心不在焉的
Are you sure everything's ok?
Because you seem completely off.

224
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,680
没事 真的
I'm fine. I promise.

225
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,090
Tommy Tommy 你打给Roy了吗
Tommy! Tommy. Did you call Roy yet?

226
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,080
我给他留言了 他明天来上班
I left him a message.
He starts tomorrow.

227
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,990
我得去办公室看看
Which reminds me,I have to
go check in with the office.

228
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,330
失陪了
Excuse me.

229
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:41,420
嘿 Tommy 还记得我吗
Hey,Tommy. Remember me?

230
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,870
- Queen先生 打扰你一下
- 没关系 反正我又不会跳舞
- Sorry to bother you,Mr. Queen.
- Your timing is perfect. I can't dance.

231
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,790
他们说这个很紧急
They said it was urgent.

232
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,410
<i>楼下见 立刻--Dig</i>
<i>meet**</i>

233
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,770
- 你还好吧
- 嗯 水晶香槟快喝完了
- You ok?
- Yeah. We ran out of Cristal.

234
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,080
- 我去去就回
- 好
- I'll be right back.
- Ok.

235
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,280
Dig
Dig?

236
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,920
放开他 跟他无关
Let him go. He has
nothing to do with this.

237
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,420
我说过 Oliver 我警告过你
I told you. Oliver,I warned you.

238
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,630
Helena 别这样
Helena! This isn't you.

239
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,210
我父亲是个歹徒 凶手
My father is a mobster and a murderer.

240
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,320
好像你没杀过人似的
It is not like you haven't
killed men like that before!

241
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,050
我教过你 避免杀戮而达到目的
And I tried to teach you to obtain
your objective without killing!

242
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,080
通过制约别人
By applying leverage.

243
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,500
通过利用别人的弱点
By exploiting someone's weakness.

244
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:03,030
上面那一屋子人 我都可以抓来制约你
There is a whole club full of
leverage above our heads right now.

245
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,060
求你了
Please.

246
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,030
Oliver 别逼我做出让我们都后悔的事
Oliver,don't make me do something
that both of us will regret.

247
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:13,970
好 你赢了 我会帮你 放开他
Ok! Ok. You win. I'll
help you. Let him go.

248
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,780
放 开 他
Let... Him... Go!

249
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,320
- 别提那事
- 好
- Don't say it.
- Ok.

250
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,280
那就谈谈Helena吧
Then let's talk about Helena.

251
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,800
Oliver 如果你不是还对她有感觉的话
Oliver,if you didn't still
have feelings for this girl,

252
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,430
你会想出别的解决之道
you would have thought
of a different solution

253
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,650
而不会受她威胁去杀人
than letting her extort
you into killing someone.

254
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,660
你想要我怎么做
So what do you want me to do?

255
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,810
杀掉她吗
You want me to kill her?

256
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,120
你是看她长得漂亮
I think you would have a long time ago

257
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,860
要不你早就杀她了
if she looked like me
instead of the T-Mobile girl.

258
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,080
- 她是个无情的杀手 Oliver
- 她并不邪恶
- She's a stone cold killer,Oliver.
- She's not evil.

259
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,460
她父亲冷血地杀掉她未婚夫 她迷茫了
She's been lost since her father
killed her fiancé in cold blood.

260
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,780
你想冷眼旁观地说
And are you going to sit there

261
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,330
你不懂得复仇的欲望吗
and tell me that you don't know
what it's like to want revenge?

262
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,410
换了是你 会怎么做
What would you do? Hmm?

263
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,200
如果Floyd Lawton站在那儿
If Floyd Lawton was
standing right there?

264
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,950
反正不会威胁你去杀他
Nothing that will involve
blackmailing you into hunting him down.

265
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:23,170
你说对了 我是下不了手杀她
You're right. Ok? I can't kill her.

266
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,520
我也不能冒着泄露身份的风险 
把她交给警察
And I can't take her to the police
and risk her exposing all of this.

267
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,160
但至少 如果我参与其中 我能控制她
But at least,if I'm involved,I
can contain her,all right?

268
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,490
我可以最大程度减少间接损害
I can minimize the collateral damage.

269
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,140
抱歉 我打扰你们了吗
Sorry,am I... interrupting something?

270
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,450
我们正谈起你
We were just... talking about you.

271
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,700
以前觉得你很不在乎我
And here I thought you
didn't care much for me.

272
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,440
一如既往
Still don't.

273
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,000
我还没找到
I haven't been able to
locate the safe house

274
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,830
FBI软禁你父亲的地方
where the FBI is keeping your father.

275
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,310
我能帮忙 我超想黑进FBI的安全系统
I can help with that. I've been dying
to hack into the FBI security system.

276
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,960
出去 出去
Get out. Get out.

277
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,010
这是私事 Felicity 请离开
This is a private
thing,Felicity. Please.

278
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,270
好吧
Ok.

279
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,260
那么 再见
See ya,I guess...

280
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,130
你到底有多少女朋友
How many girlfriends
do you have,exactly?

281
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,500
如我所说 我们没查到软禁地址
Like I said... We don't
know where the safe house is.

282
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,000
我们只知道今晚
What we do know is that the Marshall
service is taking your father

283
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,990
法警要带你父亲去司法部的听证会
to a hearing at the
Justice Department tonight.

284
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,010
有个问题 Helena
There's a problem... Helena.

285
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,700
有两辆车 其中一辆是诱饵
There are two vans. And
one of them's a decoy.

286
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,800
我们也有两个人啊
Well,it's a good thing
there's two of us,then.

287
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,550
现在取消行动 为时未晚
It's not too late to call this off.

288
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,060
你了解我的
I think you know me better than that.

289
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,550
我不让他坐牢
I don't take prisoners.

290
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,220
我巡视的时候发现这家伙
I found an intruder while I
was circling the perimeter.

291
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,520
是Wilson
It's Wilson.

292
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,650
你杀了我好几个朋友 混蛋
You killed a few of my
friends,you son of a bitch.

293
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,080
那我再杀几个
And I'm going to kill a few more.

294
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,480
我先跟我们的律师谈谈 
然后叫他们给你回电
I'll talk to one of our lawyers
and have them call you right back.

295
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,600
刮胡子弄伤了
Cut yourself shaving?

296
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,960
- 能聊会儿吗
- 可以
- You got a minute?
- Sure.

297
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,900
- Roy第一天表现如何
- 那小子没来
- How was Roy's first day?
- Kid never showed.

298
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,700
我过来是想为昨晚的事道歉
I just,uh,I came by to
apologize for last night.

299
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,110
比起道歉 我更想知道实情
Instead of an apology,why
don't you try the truth?

300
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,850
你可以从腕伤谈起
You can start with your wrist.

301
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:45,030
我在夜店跟一个搅局的打了一架
I got into a fight with
a blender at the club.

302
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,540
挺二的
It was stupid.

303
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,520
我以为你会说实话
I thought I asked for the truth.

304
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:55,650
肯定发生什么事了 为什么不告诉我
I know something's up. Why won't
you tell me what's going on?

305
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,890
- 我不能说
- 为什么
- Because I can't.
- Why not?

306
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,330
这个我也不能说 我真希望可以告诉你
I can't tell you that,either.
I wish that I could.

307
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,930
Laurel 对不起
Laurel,I'm sorry.

308
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,920
我也是
So am I.

309
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,970
现在我真的很需要你 Tommy
I really need you right now,Tommy.

310
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,620
我妈跑来跟我说我姐没死
My mother shows up saying my
dead sister is still alive,

311
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,290
我听信了她 我爸因此发飙了
and my father is furious with me
that I'm even listening to her.

312
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:23,190
我真不知该信谁了
And I don't know who to believe.

313
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,930
- 我快崩溃了
- 我在你身边呢
- I feel like I'm falling apart.
- I'm still here for you.

314
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,900
不 你没有 你人在心不在
No. You're not. You're
a million miles away,

315
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,330
最糟的是 我不知这是为何
and the worst part is,I
don't even know why.

316
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,600
对不起
I'm sorry.

317
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,510
跟踪我哈
Wow. Stalker much?

318
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,810
我给你找了份工作 你却没来上班
You didn't show up
for the job I got you.

319
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,510
我改主意了 不想帮你哥停宾利车
Yeah,I had second thoughts about
parking your brother's Bentley.

320
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,620
怎么 当泊车的跌份儿吗
What,being a valet is beneath you?

321
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,320
不 接受富家女的施舍才跌份儿
No,but accepting charity
from some rich girl is.

322
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,910
我是有钱人 为什么会让你如此反感
Why are you so obsessed with
the fact that I have money?

323
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,700
金钱不是万能的
You know,money isn't everything.

324
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,630
果然是有钱人的口吻
Spoken like someone who's got it.

325
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:09,620
失陪了 我得回到我的罪恶人生了
Now,uh,if you'll excuse me,I need
to get back to my life of crime.

326
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,350
喂 帮个忙 我迷路了
Yo,can you help me out? Think I'm lost.

327
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,710
- 市中心怎么走
- 我 我不知道
- Where's downtown at?
- I-- I-- I don't know.

328
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,360
给我们指个道 给点钱更棒
Maybe you can give us some
directions. Or better yet,some money--

329
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,570
你没事吧
You ok?

330
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,900
你在流血
You're bleeding!

331
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,860
被刺了一刀当然会流血
Yeah,that's what happens
when you get stabbed.

332
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,660
只杀父亲
Just your father.

333
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,990
让其他人受伤的话 我会赏你一箭
Anyone else gets hurt and
I'll put an arrow in you.

334
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,720
真贴心
That's sweet.

335
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,040
总算知道你是怎么
迷倒你的警察女友了
Now I know how you charmed
your cop girlfriend.

336
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,370
把Frank Bertinelli交给我
Give me Frank Bertinelli.

337
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,490
你父亲不在这辆车上
Your father's not in the van.

338
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,100
但他托我问候你
But he sends his regards.

339
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,240
帽衫侠在哪儿
Where's the Hood?

340
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,730
Helena Bertinelli
Helena Bertinelli...

341
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,670
你有权保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent.

342
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,780
糟糕
Damn it.

343
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:13,340
但你所说的一切都将成为呈堂证供
Anything you say can and will be
held against you in a court of law.

344
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,980
你有权请律师
You have the right to an attorney.

345
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,780
Paul Copani  
Nick Salvati  Gus Sabatoni
Paul Copani,Nick Salvati,Gus Sabatoni.

346
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,310
你是个不错的猎手 Bertinelli小姐
You are quite the hunter,Ms. Bertinelli.

347
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,780
我应该说"女猎手"
Well,I guess I should
make that "Huntress."

348
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,060
你有计划地干掉了
你父亲的犯罪集团中的每个人
You've been systemically taking down everyone
in your father's criminal organization.

349
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,900
Gus Sabatoni死的时候
When Gus Sabatoni turned up dead,

350
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,120
我们就知道 你弑父是迟早的事
we knew it was just a matter of time
before you tried to murder your old man.

351
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,240
- 想告诉我们为什么吗
- 不太想
- Do you want to tell us why?
- Not particularly.

352
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,430
你该再考虑下
You should reconsider.

353
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:04,850
我们抓住了你
但特警队没来得及抓住义务警员
We got you,but the vigilante got
away before E.S.U. could move on him.

354
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:10,110
你知道他是谁 他的真实身份 对不
You know who he is. Who
he really is. Don't you?

355
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:17,840
Bertinelli小姐 你已经失踪一天了
这事实无法改变
Ms. Bertinelli,you're going away
for all day,we can't change that.

356
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,290
但事情可以就此变好 或是变糟
But things can be better.
Or they could be worse.

357
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:29,750
告诉我他是谁 我会尽力让事情变好
You tell me his name,I will do
everything I can to make it better.

358
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,980
Oliver Queen
Oliver Queen.

359
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,760
你在跟他约会 对不
You're dating him now,right?

360
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,760
昨晚我看到你在他俱乐部开业典礼上
I saw you at the opening
of his club last night.

361
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,820
他跟你说过我们曾是恋人吗
Did he mention that
we used to be lovers?

362
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,700
我们想知道帽衫侠的事 
不是Oliver Queen
We want to know about
the Hood,not Oliver Queen.

363
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,020
我告诉你个小秘密
Let me let you in
on a little secret--

364
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,350
你俩成不了的
it's not going to work
out between you two.

365
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:55,710
Oliver有特殊的才能
You see,Oliver has a particular talent.

366
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,120
他会利用人
He uses people.

367
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,570
他利用了我 利用了警探您的女儿
He used me,he used the
detective here's daughter--

368
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,870
不好意思 是女儿们
excuse me--
daughters.

369
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:12,040
要是我 就会全身而退
I would get out of it
before you get yourself hurt.

370
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,570
给你最后一次机会
Last chance.

371
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,050
说出他的名字
His name.

372
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,210
帽衫侠
The Hood.

373
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,730
- 什么情况
- 不知道 快走
- What's going on?
- I don't know. ***

374
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,340
走 离开这
Go,get out of here!

375
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,950
快出门
Head for a door.

376
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,070
别动
Freeze!

377
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,780
可是次冒险援救啊
Sounds like quite the daring rescue.

378
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,500
你有Roy这个朋友 很幸运 Thea
You're very lucky to have
a friend like Roy,Thea.

379
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,000
- 我还不知道么
- 我们不是朋友
- Oh,don't I know it.
- We're not friends.

380
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,270
让我帮你缝合
Well,let me get you stitched up,

381
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:13,530
你俩再决定是啥关系
and then you two can decide
what you are or aren't.

382

see why I need a shot.

385
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,220
别告诉我你这黑帮硬汉
Oh,don't tell me a tough
gang banger like yourself

386
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,280

看起来可不小

388

else. Besides the needle.

389
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,500

谢谢你救了我

我可不能冒你跟警察坦白的风险
I couldn't risk you
telling the police about me.

395
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,130
就这原因吗
Is that the only reason?

396
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,220
为什么你不能承认

You're being too hard on yourself.
We both have demanding jobs.

425
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,870
但也不能伤害你亲近的人
That's no excuse for hurting
the people closest to you.

426
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,400
没错 但你坚信自己所做的事
No,but when you believe in what you do,

427

你会想办法成功的

518
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,850
我之前错了...
I was wrong...

519
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:25,340
以为我可以有双重身份
to think that I could have it both ways;

520
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,120
能做我要做的
that I could do what I do

521
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,290
还能过正常的生活
and still have a normal life.

522
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,490
不为人所知
With anyone.

523
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:40,420
除非孑身一人 不然不会开心
Except if you're alone,you're
never going to be happy.

524
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,600
或许不是这样
Maybe not.

525
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,870
但我开心 不是最重要的事
But me being happy isn't
what's important right now.

526
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,770
你的计划 你做主
Your plan,your call.

527
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,960
Fyers
Fyers.

528
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:08,150
Queen先生 我知道你会联系我
Mr. Queen. I thought I
might be hearing from you.

529
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:11,120
电路板在我们手里
We have the circuit board.

530
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,470
你这是自掘坟墓
You're making a grave mistake.

531
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,620
我的人正在搜查这座岛
My men are scouring the
island for you as we speak.

532
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:20,310
他们找到你 会杀了你
And when they find
you,they will kill you.

533
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:23,070
恐怕是慢慢折磨死
Very slowly,I'm afraid.

534
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,510
如果你的人杀了我们
你就别想拿到电路板了
If your men kill us,then you'll
never find the circuit board.

535
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,990
在那之后 你我都明白
And after that,we both know
that all you'll be left with

536
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:31,060
你手中就只有一团废铁
is a really ugly piece of modern art.

537
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:36,280
你想怎样
What do you propose?

538
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,070
做笔交易
A trade.

539
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:42,440
明白了 想拿什么交换
I see. And what do you want in exchange?

540
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:49,340
离岛
I want a way off the island.

541
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,120

1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,360
我叫Oliver Queen
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:09,410
被困在孤岛上5年以来
我只有一个目标...活下去
For 5 years,I was stranded on an
island with only one goal... survive.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,260
Oliver Queen还活着
Oliver Queen is alive.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,800
现在 我要完成我父亲的夙愿
Now I will fulfill my
father's dying wish...

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:19,360
根据他留给我的名单
除掉那些毒害我城市的人
to use the list of names he left me and
bring down those who are poisoning my city.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,940
为了完成目标 我必须扮成别人
To do this,I must become someone else.

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,090
我必须掩盖身份
I must become something else.

8
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,660
绿箭侠 前情提要
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,230
- 妈妈
- 你怎么来了
- Mom?
- What are you doing here?

10
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,120
我觉得Sarah还活着
I believe Sarah's still alive.

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,650
其实你没有任何证据
You don't actually have any proof.

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,380
我有 她不像Sarah吗
I have proof. Doesn't
it look just like Sarah?

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,100
我确实发现了些东西
I did manage to find one thing.

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,330
我想退出
I want to get out.

15
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,720
我要你帮我杀了Malcolm Merlyn
Malcolm Merlyn. I want
you to kill him for me.

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,520
我们当中有叛徒
We have a traitor in our midst.

17
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,810
他大错特错了
He just made his last mistake.

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,870
John Nickels的律师今天对媒体
Lawyers for John Nickels
spoke to the press today.

19
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:03,050
声称很高兴地检拒绝了对最近
Nickels其中一幢楼起火的指控
They say they're pleased the D.A. declined from the recent fire in
to indict their client on charges stemming one of Nickel's buildings.

20
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,620
John Nickel是斯特林市
最有钱的房地产开发商之一
John Nickel is one of the wealthiest
real estate developers in Starling City.

21
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,280
同时也是最肮脏的
He's also one of the dirtiest.

22
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,500
昨晚起火的那幢楼吗
That building that
burnt down last night?

23
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,220
- 线路没按质量要求接
- 也许他不知道
- Wiring was not up to code.
- Maybe he didn't know that.

24
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,740
他可能也不知道过去三年
有七个人冻死在他的楼里
I guess he also didn't know about the in his other buildings
seven people who have frozen to death over the past three years.

25
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,270
是啊 他是真男人
Yeah,he's a real man of the people.

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,220
做不了多久了
Not for long.

27
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,440
地检无视此事 贫民都在林中空地
The D.A. ignores this,and
the police can't do anything

28
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,430
所以警察也无能为力
because all these slums are in
the Glades. So tonight,Felicity,

29
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,400
Felicity 今晚我们要划掉Nickel的名字
we cross Mr. Nickel's name off the list.

30
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,900
你同意吗
You ok with that?

31
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,080
完全同意
100 percent.

32
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,390
他出去了吗
He was just gone?

33
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,490
不 不是出去 是被绑架了
No! Not gone. Taken.

34
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,220
貌似Nickel还在别人的名单上啊
Looks like Nickel was on
somebody else's list,too.

35
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,800
昨晚那场火之后也不足为奇
After the fire last night,it's
not entirely surprising.

36
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,790
Felicity 我需要你帮我
查出所有Nickel的信息
Felicity,I need you to get me
everything that you can on Nickel.

37
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,000
关注他的租客
Focus on his tenants,

38
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,300
对他有投诉记录的人
and anyone who might have filed a
formal complaint against him,or...

39
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,970
还有在大火中有所失去的人
people that lost something in the fire.

40
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,630
那肯定有个单子 贫民窟的议员
Well,it's going to be some list. I
mean,slum lords aren't generally known

41
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,200
一般不会知道他们的人口 而且...
for their popularity. Plus...

42
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,590
什么
What?

43
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,970
没什么 你一过去就是一副
Nothing,it's just... you
went over there to be all,

44
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,330
"改邪归正吧 不然我就射死你"的样子
"grrr,stop being bad or I'll arrow you,"

45
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,520
现在却要救他
and now you want to rescue him.

46
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,770
我不喜欢危险的人逍遥法外
I don't like the idea that
somebody dangerous is out there.

47
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,390
其他人
Somebody else.

48
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:06,130
因为他们没我那么有自制力
Because typically... They don't
show my level of restraint.

49
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,470
所以Nickel是肯定要被灭的咯
So you're going to
cross Nickel off anyway?

50
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,610
不
No.

51
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,830
我要找那个其他人谈谈
I'm finding somebody else
who needs a talking to.

52
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,550
你还要出去吗 Oliver
You're going out there again,Oliver?

53
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,990
回家陪你家人吧 兄弟
Why don't you go home and
be with your family,man?

54
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,710
这是任务完成后的事情 Diggle
That's when the work is done,Diggle.

55
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,160
行 那我们出去吃晚饭
Ok,then I'll take you out to dinner.

56
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,330
我现在不饿
I'm not hungry.

57
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,920
我不是在问你
I'm not asking.

58
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,110
简单交易
Simple exchange.

59
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,720
你想办法让我们离开这座岛
我们就给你电路板 
You get us a way off the island,and
we'll give you the circuit board

60
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,800
你的导弹发射器就能运作了
so that your missile
launcher isn't just furniture.

61
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,880
我看 你学会不少嘛 Queen先生
You've grown up quite a bit,Mr. Queen.

62
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,850
我能给你们一艘船
I'll give you that.

63
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,350
但我需要时间
I can get you a boat. But I need time.


64
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:52,150
给你一小时 Fyers 
不然你就永远...干嘛
You got an hour,Fyers,and
then you're never... what?!

65
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,540
我们知道你可能需要
不止一小时才能搞到船
We understand it might take you
longer than an hour to get a boat.

66
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,540
你需要调度
What we mean is you need
to move with some dispatch.

67
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,280
Wilson 你还是指挥吗
Ah,Wilson,still in command there,eh?

68
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,590
你的小宠物是不是要夺权了
I thought your little pet
had staged a coup d'etat.

69
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,890
给我们搞到船
Just get us the damn boat.

00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,500
这会儿怎么停了
Now you want to stop?

74
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,680
你以为每户都有管家呀
Well,we don't all have butlers.

75
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,780
得自己去开门
You know,some of us actually
have to answer our own doors.

76
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,320
真讨厌
Oh,the horror.

77
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,860
你有点眼熟啊
You look familiar.

78
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,930
你上过电视什么的吗
Did I see you on TV or something?

79
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,620
也许吧 我是Thea Queen
Probably. I'm Thea Queen.

80
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,870
是哦
Yeah,right.

81
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,090
拿来了吗
Did you get it?

82
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,150
明晚
Tomorrow night.

83
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,640
Joe要在11点见到我们
Joe wants us there at 11 p.m.

84
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,410
他说要准时 Harper
He said to be on time,Harper.

85
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,080
明晚11点要干嘛
What's happening tomorrow at 11:00?

86
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,140
我只关注现在的事
You know,I'm actually kind of
focused on what's happening right now.

87
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,930
好啊
Oh,ok. Yeah.

88
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,370
不 Thea 别
No,no,Thea,don't!

89
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,380
你拿枪干什么
Why do you have a gun?

90
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,810
因为我不擅长用刀
Because I'm no good with knives.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,360
是一家卖酒的店
Look,it's just a liquor store.

92
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,950
那人是变态 相信我 他该死
The guy's a creep.
Trust me,he deserves it.

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,670
我把子弹拿了 好点了吧
Look,if it'll make you feel
any better... I won't be armed.

94
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,250
当然 他不会知道的
But of course,the owner
won't know that,but...

95
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,530
我给了你份我哥俱乐部的工作
你有选择的 不用非得做罪犯
I got you a job at my brother's club. You
have choices. You don't have to be a criminal!

96
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,090
这不是钱的问题
I'm not talking about phone bills.

97
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,540
是我欠别人的
I owe people.

98
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,350
更有权势的人
People with much bigger guns than this.

99
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,560
在林中空地 这是唯一的解决办法
Look,here in the Glades,this is
pretty much the only solution.

100
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,530
不 这里很多人都活得正派
No,lots of people in the
Glades live honest lives.

101
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,040
显然你不是
Obviously not you.

102
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,570
你就是一废物
You're just a waste.

103
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,240
不 Thea Thea
No,Thea. Thea!

104
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,770
我要确保你安全回家
I'm going to make sure you get home ok.

105
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,210
不用麻烦了
Don't bother.

106
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,220
嘿 宝贝
Hey,honey.

107
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,110
给
There you go.

108
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,460
这是什么情况
Um,what's all this?

109
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:30,460
你要我从你妈的线索下手找Sarah
我打了几个电话
Well,you asked me to look into your
mother's leads on Sarah,so I made some calls.

110
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,350
看来你不止做了这些啊
It looks like you did
a lot more than that.

111
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,770
是啊 是你说我们得做的 Laurel
Well,yeah,but you're the one who
said we should do this,Laurel,

112
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,100
如果有一丝可能你妹妹还活着...
so,you know,if there's even
a chance that your sister is...

113
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,990
- 嗯 可是...
- 谢谢
- yeah,but...
- thank you.

114
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,410
宝贝 抱歉这里一团乱
Hi,sweetheart,I'm sorry about the mess.

115
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,380
Quentin 我刚和普吉岛领事馆通电话
Quentin,I just got off the phone
with the consulate in Phuket.

116
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,520
部长说会从他们的数据库里
调查Sarah的照片
The secretary there's going to run
Sarah's photo against their database,

117
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,800
看看是否有匹配
see if there's a match.

118
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,250
不错
That's good work.

119
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,710
怎么了
What?

120
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:02,540
我以为你是想帮妈妈接受一些事
Well,I guess I just thought deep down that
you were going to help mom... accept things.

121
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,010
你我都已接受的事
Things you and I accepted.

122
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,600
是的 但你不得不承认
Yeah,but... You got to admit.

123
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,290
这个女孩很像Sarah
This girl,she looks a lot like Sarah.

124
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,320
Sarah也有这样的帽子 
斯特林市火箭队的图案
Sarah had that same cap.
The Starling City Rockets.

125
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,060
是你爸买给她的 记得吗
Your dad bought it for her,remember?

126
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,100
我记得
Yeah,I remember.

127
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,850
是有离奇的事发生
Stranger things have happened.

128
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,340
是啊 我看出来了
Yeah. I can see that.

129
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,360
比想象中饿呀
Hungrier than I thought.

130
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,210
等我吃完你要发表演讲吗
Are you waiting for me to finish
before giving me the lecture?

131
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,260
Oliver 这几周你扮演
帽衫侠的时间太多了
Oliver,you've been spending a lot of time
under that hood the last couple weeks.

132
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,780
保持状态
Keeps my ears warm.

133
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,770
这样做是为了避免纠纷吗
And you made this decision
to,um,avoid entanglements?

134
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,230
为了保护他们
For their protection.

135
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,840
和我亲近的人会受伤
The people who get close to me get hurt.

136
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,760
怎么了
What's the problem?

137
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,140
你觉得我失控了吗
Do you think I'm losing my grip?

138
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,390
不 正好相反 你看起来很冷静
No,it's just the
opposite,really. You seem calm.

139
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,430
冷静得可怕
Scary calm.

140
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,590
我知道Helena和McKenna的结局都不太好
I get that things didn't end
well with Helena,with McKenna...

141
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,420
Laurel 还有Sarah
With Laurel. With Sarah.

142
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,110
- 以后还会有人受伤
- 好吧 但你做什么了
- The list goes on.
- Yeah. But what do you do?

143
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,450
行侠仗义后回家 
不停地重复 这不是生活
You hood up,you go home,you
repeat. It's not much of a life.

144
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,370
我现在的生活方式
Well,the life that I'm
leading for myself right now

145
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,610
容不得我过正常人的生活
doesn't leave much
room for an actual life.

146
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,460
而且我也不需要
And I don't need one.

147
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,730
给自己安排的人生
还真暗淡...孤独终老
That's a pretty bleak future you
plan on spending...with no one.

148
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,630
我习惯一个人了
I'm used to isolation.

149
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,360
这正是我担心的
And that is exactly what worries me.

150
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,120
你回家已经8个月了 Oliver 
但我觉得你还没离开那座岛
You've been home for 8 months,Oliver,but
I don't think you left that island yet.

151
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,320
发生什么了
What the hell is going on?

152
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,510
找到Nickel了 打开我刚发你的链接
Found Nickel. Click the
link I just sent you.

153
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,080
每个IP手机都收到了
从林中空地发来的信息
This came up on every screen with an
I.P. address originating from the Glades.

154
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,140
如果你住在林中空地  
你就知道这个人是谁
If you make the Glades your
home,you know who this man is.

155
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,420
John Nickel
John Nickel.

156
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,270
他拥有你的房屋
He owns your tenements.

157
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,990
管理你的贫民窟
Manages your slums.

158
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,470
给你提供漏雨的屋顶
Provides the leaking
roofs over your head.

159
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:18,610
水管里的霉菌 墙壁上的石棉
The mold in your pipes
and asbestos in your walls.

160
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,210
基本上 他赚的钱是建立在我们的苦难上
Basically,he makes
money off our suffering.

161
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,850
警方不想帮助我们
But the police aren't
interested in helping us.

162
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,020
他们也许让我们失望了 但我不会
They may have let us down,but I won't.

163
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,020
John 我给你个机会陈述
John,I want to give you the
chance to state your case.

164
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,670
你为什么不该受罚
Why shouldn't you be punished?

165
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,660
我知道我的建筑是豆腐渣工程
I knew there was bad
stuff in my buildings.

166
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,450
- 追踪他 Felicity
- 正在查
- Track him,Felicity.
- I'm looking.

167
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,500
没错 我挣了一点钱
Ok,yes,I made a little profit!

168
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,220
至少他们有个地方住
At least they had a place to live.

169
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,210
要是没有我 那样的人只能流落街头
Without me,people like that
would end up on the street.

170
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,790
"那样的人"
"People like that."

171
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,230
在他这样的人眼里 我们什么都不是
That's all we are to guys like this.

172
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,800
别动
Don't.

173
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:11,330
我宣布...你有罪
I find you... Guilty.

174
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,580
还有更多人要为他们犯下的罪付出代价
There are plenty more people who need
to answer for their crimes against us.

175
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,250
那么...下一个会是谁呢
So... Who's next?

176
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,260
发现什么了
Anything new?

177
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,970
这个家伙绝对不止连线这么简单
This guy's definitely got more
than a subscription to "Wired."

178
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,380
他的网站经过严格的加密保护
His website's protected by
some very serious encryption.

179
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,280
用那个空气磁铁 你说过它可以追踪...
Well,use that air magnet thing,you
said that it could trace...

180
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:46,710
Oliver 无意冒犯 
我有对你的弓箭指手画脚吗
Oliver! No offense. Do I tell
you how to sharpen your arrows?

181
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,940
根据我在国安局的朋友
Spoke to my friend at the NSA.

182
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,120
网站编码与他们
正追踪的网络十字军相符
The website code matches a cyber
crusader who's been on their radar.

183
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:55,290
他以"救世主"的名义黑进了极端网站
He hacks into fringe sites
under the user name "The Savior."

184
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,250
国安局认为他曾是林中空地的居民
NSA believes he's a former
resident of the Glades.

185
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,530
- 曾是
- 一年前 他把自己弄得人家蒸发
- Former?
- Yeah,well,a year ago,he hacked himself right off the radar.

186
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,080
抹除了他的所有痕迹
He erased all traces of his existence.

187
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,280
一年前发生什么了
So what happened a year ago?

188
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,730
我们回来了
We're back.

189
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:09,570
和我一起的是
地方助理检察官Gavin Carnahan
I have with me assistant
district attorney Gavin Carnahan.

190
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,080
地方检察官的职责是逮捕坏人
Now,DAs are supposed
to go after bad guys.

191
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,640
但是这个人甚至懒得带他们去审训
But this one can't even be
bothered to bring them to trial.

192
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,490
就像在酒店杀了我妻子的那些人
Like the ones who killed
my wife in a bodega.

193
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,450
- Felicity...
- 在查
- Felicity...
- I'm on it.

194
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,900
他们说没有足够的证据
They said there wasn't enough evidence.

195
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,800
你认为她在斯特林市的良好社区被杀
You think the evidence
would have turned up

196
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:31,540
证据会自己出现吗
if she'd been killed in one of
Starling City's nicer neighborhoods?

197
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,540
Emma Falk 悲痛的丈夫是Joseph Falk
能查到什么
Emma Falk. Grieving husband is
Joseph Falk. What do we have on him?

198
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,140
不多 42岁 曾是市政人员
Not much. 42,former city worker.

199
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,060
运输部的电脑技术员
Department of
transportation,computer technician,

200
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:42,050
妻子被杀后离职 就在去年的今天
left his job when she was
killed. One year ago today.

201
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,460
没有现在的电话和住址
No current phone,no current address.

202
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:47,640
Gavin 你是一个律师 你习惯申辩
Gavin,you're a lawyer.
You're used to making a case.

203
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,060
那么来吧
So go ahead.

204
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,970
我给你十分钟的时间
I'm going to give you ten minutes

205
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,430
来发表最后的声明
to deliver the closing
argument of your life.

206
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,670
- 快点
- 正在锁定他的无线信号
- Come on.
- I'm trying to get a lock on his wireless signal.

207
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,600
给你十分钟说服我不杀你
10 minutes to convince
me not to blow you away.

208
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,050
在医院的时候 Malcolm想让你做什么 
What did Malcolm want
with you last night?

209
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,610
一个报复的目标
A target for reprisal.

210
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,490
他想要以牙还牙 他不会善罢甘休的
He wants justice,and he's not
going to stop until he gets it.

211
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,990
情况还不错
Besides,this is good.

212
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,760
我想你对"不错"的定义需要调整下
I think your definition of
good requires an adjustment.

213
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,530
不 他来找我 说明他还不知道
No,he came to me. Which
means he doesn't know

214
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,940
我们是想要谋杀他的人
that we're responsible for
the attempt on his life.

215
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,170
还不知道
Yet.

216
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,410
Malcolm 查到是谁
雇了三合会刺杀他的可能性有多大
What are the chances of Malcolm discovering
who paid the triad to assassinate him?

217
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,930
我很谨慎
I was very discreet.

218
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,810
我用海外账户通过我的空壳公司汇的钱
I wired the money through a shell
corporation I own,from an offshore account.

219
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,260
海外的 好的 很好
Offshore? Good. That's good.

220
00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:00,360
我让Amanda去伦敦几周 以防万一
I'm sending Amanda to London for
a few weeks,just as a precaution.

221
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,410
也许你也应该安排一下你的家人
Perhaps you should do
the same for your family.

222
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,430
为了我的孩子我做什么都愿意 Frank
There's nothing I wouldn't do
to protect my children,Frank.

223
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,220
我能跟你聊聊吗
Hey,can I talk to you about something?

224
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,440
女人之间的谈话
Almost woman to woman.

225
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,100
我现在很忙
I'm really busy right now.

226
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,460
好吧
Ok.

00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,470
Thea
Thea.

228
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,620
抱歉
Sorry.

229
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,250
怎么了
What's up?

230
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,820
我需要点建议
I could use some advice.

231
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:56,760
我正和一个"坏男孩"约会
I'm sort of dating this guy who would
definitely be described as a bad boy.

232
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,360
我想你跟很多这样的人约会过
And I figured,as someone who's
dated like a gajillion of them...

233
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,980
我没约会过那么多
I haven't dated a gajillion.

234
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,880
好吧 或许有
All right,guilty as charged.

235
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,370
要听我的意见吗 躲得远远的 
You want my advice? Run.

236
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,120
有多远离多远
As fast as you possibly can.

237
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,470
是 那也是我的第一反应 但...
Yeah. See,that was my
first instinct,too,but...

238
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,530
Laurel 2号线 中国大使馆
Laurel? The Chinese
embassy's on line two.

239
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,750
我转接过来了
I'm transferring him over.

240
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,180
中国大使馆
Chinese embassy?

241
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,200
我正忙的一个案子
It's just this case that I'm working on.

242
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,040
过会我们接着聊
But we are definitely continuing
this conversation later.

243
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,420
多谢回电
Thank you so much for
getting back to me.

244
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,230
我正在找我发给你照片上的女子
I'm trying to track down a woman
in the photo that I emailed you.

245
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,180
你找到了
You did.

246
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,890
真的吗
Really?

247
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,710
你确定她现在就在美国吗
And you're sure that
she's in the states now?

248
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,460
你不会刚好有她的联系地址吧
Do you happen to have an address on her?

249
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,290
- 找到他了
- 关了他的信号
- I got him!
- Shut it down.

250
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,520
不行 他有防火墙保护无线信号
Can't. He has a firewall
protecting his wireless signal.

251
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,230
但他在23街和米拉街之间有个IPX
But he's working off an IPX
located at 23rd and Mira.

252
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,190
- 你要乔装一下吗
- 现在是大白天
- You want to hood up?
- The middle of the day!

253
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,170
听着 听着 听我说
Look! Listen. Listen to me. Ok.

254
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,710
我的桌上现在有53个案子
I have 53 cases on my desk right now.

255
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,520
我没有时间处理每个案子
I don't always have time
to take on every case!

256
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,600
Carnahan怎么样了
How's Carnahan?

257
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,100
不是很有说服力
Not making a very persuasive argument.

258
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,170
我快到了
I'm almost there.

259
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,500
- 发现什么了
- 我刚到第一层
- See anything?
- I'm only on the first floor.

260
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,730
还有6层
Just six more to go.

261
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,270
没有那么多资源 我努力了
There aren't resources. I tried.

262
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,660
- 天哪 对不起
- Oliver 快点
- Oh,my God! I'm sorry!
- Oliver,hurry.

263
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,790
找不到他
Can't find him!

264
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,790
- 他不在这 Felicity
- 什么
- He's not here,Felicity!
- What?!

265
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,660
我找了每层的每间屋子
I searched every office on every floor!

266
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,800
他不在这 是这里吗
He's not here. Is this the right place?

267
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,440
- 你确定吗
- 是 我...
- Are you sure?
- Yeah,I...

268
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,320
- 噢 见鬼
- 什么
- Oh,crap.
- What?

269
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,170
这怎么可能 怎么会 他...
How is this possible?!
This can't happen! He's...

270
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,140
- 跟我说
- 等等
- Talk to me!
- Wait.

271
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,990
他移动了 就在你的北边 大洋和格兰街 
He moved. Just north
of you. Ocean and Grand.

272
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,200
这就去
On my way!

273
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,880
我只处理我觉得我可以...
I took on cases that were...that
I thought that I could...

274
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,610
- 赢的案子
- 对
- Win.
- Yes.

275
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,020
抱歉
I'm sorry.

276
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,410
Gavin Carnahan 我宣布 
你愧对于林中空地的居民
Gavin Carnahan,I find you guilty
of crimes against the Glades.

277
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,030
不要 不要
Don't do this! Don't do this!

278
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,520
我判你死刑
And I sentence you to death.

279
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,610
我赶到了 Felicity 这儿是块空地
I'm at Ocean and Grand,Felicity.
That's just a vacant lot.

280
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,970
怎么可能 这不应该 他...
How is this possible?
This can't happen. He...

281
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,250
查出正确地址 快
Find the right address,now!

282
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,620
Oliver 没用了 Carnahan死了
Oliver,it's over,Carnahan is dead.

283
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,900
Diggle呢
Where's Diggle?

284
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,300
我大声对他说
I asked him to leave me alone.

285
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,110
我要静一静
In my loud voice.

286
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,010
这不是你的错
This wasn't your fault.

287
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,900
本该由我来找到Carnahan
I was the one who was
supposed to find Carnahan,

288
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,800
但正是我给了你假地址
and I was the one who sent
you that bogus location.

289
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,110
我从未目睹过谁死去
I've never seen anybody die.

290
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,420
这是难免的 我们做的事
This is the thing with what we do.

291
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,070
有时会失败
Sometimes we lose.

292
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,430
或许单身更好
Maybe it is better being alone.

293
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,770
现在我没跟谁约会
I'm not seeing anyone currently,but...

294
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,840
否则我真不知 该怎么跟他说今天的事
If I were,I don't know how
I'd tell him about today.

295
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,270
先生们 欢迎啊
Gentlemen. Welcome.

296
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,510
很高兴我们能达成共识
So happy we were able
to reach an accord.

297
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,440
还跟我闲聊呢
Oh,good. Small talk.

298
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,870
继续聊吗
Are we going to get on with this?

299
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,270
好 说正题吧
As you wish. Straight to business.

300
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,460
电路板在哪儿
The circuit board. Where is it?

301
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,100
安全的地方
Somewhere safe.

302
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,410
带我们上船 就告诉你它藏哪儿了
So get us to the boat and then
we'll tell you where it is.

303
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,650
你们最好别骗我
And of course you'll be
honest about its location.

304
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,130
我可不想说实话
Well,I wouldn't be.

305
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:44,200
可这哥们执着于讲原则 守诚信
But this one's got some strange hang
up about principles and integrity.

306
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,860
我想也是
I always imagined as much.

307
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,250
因此我想提个相反的建议
Which is why I'd like to
make a counter proposal.

308
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,390
带上来
Men!

309
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,100
不 
No!

310
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,860
不
No!

311
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,440
把电路板给我 否则我杀了姚飞的女儿
You will deliver back to me the circuit
board,or I will kill Yao Fei's daughter.

312
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,670
所以我不能走了
So I wouldn't leave.

313
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,490
你这么有原则的人 我不相信你会
I can't imagine you want the death of
an innocent young woman on your hands.

314
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,310
目睹一个年轻女孩因你而死
Not with your... Principles.

315
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:36,760
你收集的关于Sarah的证据
我想自己做些调查
I wanted to do some research on my own into
the evidence that you gathered on Sarah.

316
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:42,250
所以我拜托了一个大学同学
他在中国大使馆工作
So I called my friend from law school
who works at the Chinese embassy,and...

317
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,840
照片上的女孩
The photo of the girl.

318
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,120
我找到她了
I found her.

319
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,190
抱歉 能借用下你的手机吗
I'm sorry. Can I...
can I borrow your phone?

320
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,590
我答应了未婚夫 晚饭前打给他
但我手机没电了
I promised my fianée that I'd call
him before dinner. My phone's dead.

321
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,200
Jen 他们是我父母
Jen,these are my parents.

322
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,410
很高兴认识你们
Hi. Nice to meet you.

323
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,060
我也是
Yeah,you,too.

324
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,580
我告诉Jen 这张照片
突然出现在我负责的案子里
I just told Jen about this photograph that
popped up in this case that I'm working on.

325
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,700
照片上的人是你吗
Is that you in the picture?

326
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,480
对 我在那个中国海岛上呆了6个月
Yeah. I spent six months on an
island off the coast of China.

327
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:20,530
照片是在一个叫Zhengjiu的渔村里拍的
That was taken in a small
fishing village called Zhengjiu.

328
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:25,010
- 中文意思是...
- 拯救
- It's Mandarin for...
- Salvation.

329
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,450
你没事吧 Lance夫人
Are you all right,Mrs. Lance?

330
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:40,860
没事 只是 你长得很像我认识的一个人
Yes,I... it's just,uh,you look
like someone I used to know.

331
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,030
我正等着呢
I was waiting for this.

332
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,390
等什么
Waiting for what?

333
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,380
你的长篇大论 "你可以改变"
"我会认识到真正的你"
The whole "You can change,I
can see the real you" speech.

334
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,720
看看这儿 Thea
Look around,Thea.

335
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,210
这就是我的栖身之所
This is home sweet home for me.

336
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,690
要嘛挨饿 要嘛就干违法的事
能活到21岁就算走运了
You either starve or you do things that
mean you're lucky enough to make it to 21.

337
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,030
我不能接受那些
I can't accept that.

338
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,160
不 你不能接受我
No. You can't accept me.

339
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,790
- Roy Harper
- 我就是
Roy Harper?

340
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,850
以下是林中空地绑架案的进一步报道
More on the story out of the Glades.

341
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,200
绑匪又劫持一人 并在网上直播
The kidnapper seems to have another victim
and is broadcasting the feed to his website.

342
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,650
观众请注意 这是实况直播 
我们也不知道接下来会看到什么
A warning to viewers,this is live footage,so
we're not sure what we're about to see.

343
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,340
来认识下Roy Harper
Meet Roy Harper.

344
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:11,090
因盗窃 抢劫 重伤他人罪被捕
Arrests for larceny and
robbery,aggravated assault.

345
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,770
他还没被绳之以法
And yet you're out on the street.

346
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:20,020
林中空地另一个逍遥法外的小子
就像杀死我妻子那人一样
Another gangbanger in the Glades running
free,like the ones who killed my wife.

347
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,030
我也来自林中空地
I'm grew up in the Glades,too.

348
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,330
但我没变成罪犯
And it didn't turn me into a criminal.

349
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,490
我认识那孩子
I know that kid.

350
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,180
- 怎么认识的
- Tommy
- How?
- Tommy!

351
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,820
上帝啊 不
Oh,God,no.

352
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,860
我不知还能去哪儿
I didn't know where else to go.

353
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,100
- 你认识他吗
- Roy是我的朋友
- You know him?
- Roy,he's my friend.

354
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,550
我们在吵架 
突然冲出来一个家伙袭击了我们
And we were in a fight and some guy
came out of nowhere and just attacked us!

355
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,560
他不该死
He doesn't deserve to die!

356
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,530
我保证 他会没事的
I promise you,he's going to be ok.

357
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,350
你跟Tommy呆在这儿 好吗
You stay here with Tommy,all right?

358
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,950
- 喂
- Moira 我是Malcolm
- Hello?
- Moira,it's Malcolm.

359
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,360
我刚得知 中国黑帮的一个头儿被抓了
I've learned a high ranking member
of the Triad was just arrested.

360
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,940
我该跟他谈谈
Well,I should have a word with him.

361
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,920
我已经跟他谈了 
他同意去查出是谁为了减刑
I already have. He's agreed to
find out who hired his organization

362
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:15,040
雇了他的组织来杀我
to assassinate me in return
for a reduced prison sentence.

363
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:19,600
今晚我们应该就会知道是谁想杀我
By tonight,we should know the name,or
names,of the people who tried to kill me.

364
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,000
很好
Good.

365
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,920
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

366
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,700
照片上的人不是Sarah
So it's not Sarah in the photo.

367
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,150
但她肯定没死 Quentin
But she's still out there,Quentin.

368
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,700
我要去找她
And I'm going to find her.

369
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,660
我知道 你俩现在已经不抱希望了
Look,I understand now that neither of you
have the stomach to continue looking for her.

370
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,890
没关系
And that's fine.

371
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,310
很抱歉 我把你们扯进来
I'm sorry I involved you both.

372
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:04,110
如果能换她一命 
我下地狱都可以 但那行不通
You know that I would cross to hell
and back to bring her home,but I can't!

373
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,680
她已经不在了 Di
'Cause she's gone,Di.

374
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,710
不
No.

375
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,320
你得放手了
You got to let go of this now.

376
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,970
不 我不能
No! I can't!

377
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,740
我也不会
I won't!

378
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,250
你怎么知道Sarah上船时带着帽子
How did you know Sarah had her hat
with her when she went on the boat?

379
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:28,190
你确信照片上的人是Sarah
You were so sure that the
girl in the photo was Sarah.

380
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,990
不是因为她是美国人 
而是因为那顶帽子
Not because she was
American,but because of her hat.

381
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,590
爸爸买给她的那顶斯特林火箭帽子
Her Starling City Rockets
hat that dad bought her.

382
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,090
妈
Mom.

383
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:44,100
你怎么知道她带着那顶帽子
跟Oliver上船的
How did you know she took her hat with
her on "the Queen's Gambit" with Oliver?

384
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,660
因为我看见了
I saw her.

385
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,300
什么意思
What do you mean?

386
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:59,030
那天我回来早了 就看见她了
I came home early
that day,and I saw her.

387
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,880
Sarah
Sarah.

388
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,050
我看见她把帽子放进包里
I saw her put the hat in a bag.

389
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,900
她在收拾行李
She was packing.

390
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:12,320
你知道她要跟他走
You knew she was going with him?

391
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:18,190
我叫她别那样做 别那样对你 Laurel
I told her not to... I told her
not to do this,not to you,Laurel.

392
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,450
可她说她陷入爱河 要追随心之所属
But she said she was in love
and she had to follow her heart,

393
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,550
即使大家都觉得她错了
even if nobody else
thought it was right.

394
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:30,330
就像我告诉过她 我也曾那样过
Just like I told her... Just
like I told her I once did.

395
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,110
所以 我让她走了
So... I let her go.

396
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,620
是我害死她的
I killed her.

397
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:49,940
我害死了自己的女儿
I... I killed my daughter.

398
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,680
我害死了她
I killed her.

399
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,610
对不起 Quentin
I'm so sorry,Quentin.

400
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,840
对不起 Quentin
I'm so sorry,Quentin.

401
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,920
我害死了我的孩子
I killed our baby.

402
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,980
有线索了吗
Anything?

403
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,980
我把视频都看了一遍
I've been going through
all the video we got,

404
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,230
想找出蛛丝马迹 透露出他们的所在地
trying to see if there's anything
that'll tell us where this guy is.

405
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,220
一无所获 除了一个声音
I got nothing,except a sound.

406
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,420
隐含在背景杂音中 比较有节奏
Buried in the ambient
noise. Almost rhythmic.

407
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,700
我把它分离出来了
Here,I've isolated it.

408
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,700
是什么声音
What is that?

409
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,930
像是轿车碾过行车线标记
Sounds like a car
driving over lane markers.

410
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,360
比轿车大多了
It's bigger than a car.

411
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:26,160
- 比轿车大 巴士吗
- 等等 我知道
- Bigger than a car. What,a bus?
- Uh... wait,I know this.

412
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,530
我知道了
I know it.

413
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,320
加油 伙计们
Come on! Guys!

414
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:35,880
Felicity 给我看看绑架地点的地图
我们看见信号的那地方
Felicity,show me a map. Sights of the
abductions on where we've seen the signal so far.

415
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:38,540
那儿 就是那儿
Right there,right there.

416
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,690
第23大道和Mira大道
23rd and Mira.

417
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,780
Locksley街和Adams街
Locksley and Adams.

418
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,510
威尔斯街 国家创研会旁
Wells street down by CNRI.

419
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,740
- 这都是地铁站啊
- 斯特林城没有地铁
- Those are all subway stops!
- Starling City doesn't have a subway.

420
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:51,500
对 但以前有
小时候我爸常带我去看火箭队比赛
No,but they used to. When I was a kid,my
dad used to take me down to the Rockets game.

421
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,940
乘地铁去 我靠在窗边14分钟
By subway. For 14 minutes,I'd
lean against the window,

422
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,950
感受地铁飞驰的韵律
feeling the rhythm of the train moving.

423
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,680
他就是这么干的
That's how he did it.

424
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:00,170
他在23号和Mira 但在地下
He was at 23rd and
Mira,but he was underground.

425
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,740
他曾为交通部工作
He used to work for the
department of transportation,

426
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,070
所以他清楚所有的老地铁站
so that's why he knows
all the old subway stops.

427
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,170
所以我没法追踪信号
That's why I couldn't trace the signal.

428
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,010
他在移动 在地铁里
He was moving. He was in a subway car.

429
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,130
他现在在哪
Where is he now?

430
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,330
他在老的跨城线上
He's on the old cross town line.

431
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,130
要是他沿这条线走
15分钟后到达春天街道站
If he continues on this route,he'll be
at the Spring Street stop in 15 minutes.

432
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,690
放了那女孩
Let the girl go.

433
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,260
不做笔交易吗
No deal?

434
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,550
很好 杀了她
Very well. Kill her.

435
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:26,800
不
No!

436
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,480
这可没想到
That was unexpected.

437
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,370
开枪
Fire!

438
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,570
快来
Come on! Come on!

439
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,360
带她去安全的地方 快
Get her to safety! Now!

440
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,590
我只会拖累你们 快走
I'll only slow you down. Go!

441
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,850
快走 你得走了
Just go! You've got to go!

442
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,800
走吧
Go! Go!

443
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:06,010
- 来了
- 我给你10分钟叙述理由 Roy
- It's happening.
- I'll give you 10 minutes to state your case,Roy.

444
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,480
告诉我们
So tell us.

445
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,300
为什么你还活着
Why do you get to live?

446
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,260
我不该活着的
I shouldn't.

447
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,510
杀了我吧
Just do it.

448
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,970
杀了我
Kill me.

449
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,540
下手吧 杀了我
Just go on! Kill me!

450
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,450
你不在乎你是死是活吗
You really don't care
if you live or die?

451
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,340
没人会想我的
No one's going to miss me.

452
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,220
我就是个废物
I'm just a waste.

453
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,900
那我们达成一致了
Then we agree on something.

454
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,850
这世界没你会更好
This world would be better
off without you in it.

455
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,030
好像没影像了
We seem to have lost the feed.

456
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,260
我们会追踪此事
有任何进展将继续报道
We will stay on this story and keep
you up to date on any developments.

457
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:32,340
放了那孩子
Let the kid go.

458
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:37,280
你杀了他 便永不得悔改的机会
You kill this kid,you'll never
get an opportunity to change!

459
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:41,090
你可以再给他个机会
You can give him a second chance.

460
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,790
只有我们能救这座城市
We're the only ones
who can save this city.

461
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,070
不能现在停止
We can't stop now.

462
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,800
我们不一样
We're not the same!

463
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:53,580
你我都为这座城市杀了人
You've killed people
for this city,so have I.

464
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:56,280
咱俩有何区别
What's the difference
between you and me?

465
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,920
Emma没得到第二次机会
Emma never got her second chance.

466
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,360
你不知道这有多孤单
You have no idea how lonely it is.

467
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,890
Joseph
Joseph.

468
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,330
Joseph
Joseph!

469
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,240
我理解你的孤独
I understand being alone.

470
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,760
但这不是你冷血杀人的理由
But it doesn't give you the right
to kill people in cold blood.

471
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,320
这是他应得的
He deserves it.

472
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:24,420
他和那些杀了她的少年犯并无两样
Just like the gangbangers who gunned
her down,he's no different than them.

473
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,460
我现在要杀了他
And now I get to gun him down.

474
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,440
别这么做
Don't do it!

475
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,550
我要去机场了
Got to get going to the airport.

476
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:21,630
坐红眼航班去中心城
That red eye to Central City.

477
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:25,310
我马上就能到家了
I should be home in a flash.

478
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,500
妈
Mom.

479
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,160
给我打打电话
Call me some time.

480
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,630
我喜欢这样
I'd really like that.

481
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,940
你愿意吗
You would?

482
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,400
当然
Of course I would.

483
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,410
你是我妈
You're my mother.

484
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,070
我很爱你
I love you so much.

485
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,880
我也爱你
I love you,too.

486
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,310
Roy Harper
向左转
a**

487
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,210
我以为你要死了
I thought you were going to die.

488
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,350
我也以为
That makes two of us.

489
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,840
我可能看起来很糟
I probably look like a mess.

490
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:39,730
我要去洗手间梳洗一番
I'm going to go to the
bathroom and freshen way,way up.

491
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,700
好
Ok.

492
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,250
Ollie
Ollie?

493
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,290
我听说Thea的朋友没事
I heard Thea's friend was ok.

494
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,830
完好解决了
Yeah. That worked out ok.

495
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,820
这个Roy不只是朋友 对不
This Roy... is more than
just a friend,isn't he?

496
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,780
坏男孩啊
Bad boys.

497
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,820
次次吸引你
Hook you every time.

498
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,790
我觉得Tommy今晚回家了
Oh,I think,uh,Tommy actually
went home for the night.

499
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:58,030
你还好吗
You all right?

500
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,860
看起来你不太好
You seem like you're
something other than all right.

501
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:11,280
我妈 这周来镇上 她觉得...
My mom,she showed up in town
this week and she's been...

502
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,420
什么
What?

503
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:16,780
她觉得Sarah还活着
She had this crazy idea
that Sarah was still alive.

504
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:22,730
她坚信自己是对的
弄得我也快要相信了
She was so sure of it that she
kind of had me believing it,also.

505
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,950
但是Sarah不在了
But Sarah's gone.

506
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,750
是啊
Yeah.

507
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,290
真不敢相信我就这么信了
I can't believe she
sucked me in like that.

508
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,460
- 你想她
- 我想她们
- You miss her.
- I miss them both.

509
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,650
谢谢你听我说这些
Thanks for listening.

510
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,410
没事
Of course.

511
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,290
Laurel
Laurel.

512
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:54,470
要不要一起吃晚饭...
或者喝杯咖啡 都行
Want to have dinner,or...
coffee,I don't know.

513
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,920
怎么了
Why?

514
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,960
我不想再这么孤单了
I don't want to be on an island anymore.

515
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,340
- 晚安
- 晚安
- Good night.
- Good night.

516
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,510
Slade
Slade?

517
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,670
电路板没了
Circuit board's gone.

518
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,010
靠 Fyers耍咱们
Damn. Fyers played us.

519
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:42,520
他在咱们耍咱的时候
他的人在树丛里找电路板
While he was screwing us around,his
men were combing the woods for it.

520
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,850
现在他的导弹发射器可以运转了
Now his missile launcher
is fully operational.

521
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,020
他永远不会
让咱们离开这座岛了 我懂了
And he was never going to let
us off the island,I get it!

522
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,930
他当然不会帮你
Of course he wasn't going to help you.

523
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,080
他不能冒着让你们警告大陆
关于他的计划的险救你们

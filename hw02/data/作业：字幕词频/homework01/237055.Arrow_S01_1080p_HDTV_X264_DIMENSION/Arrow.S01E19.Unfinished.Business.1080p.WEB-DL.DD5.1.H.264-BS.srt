1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,760
我叫Oliver Queen
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:10,120
被困在孤岛上5年以来
我只有一个目标...活下去
For 5 years,I was stranded on an
island with only one goal... survive.

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,870
Oliver Queen还活着
Oliver Queen is alive.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,670
现在 我要完成我父亲的夙愿
Now I will fulfill my
father's dying wish...

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,960
根据他留给我的名单
除掉那些毒害我城市的人
to use the list of names he left me and
bring down those who are poisoning my city.

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,130
为了完成目标 我必须扮成别人
To do this,I must become someone else.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,550
我必须掩盖身份
I must become something else.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,920
绿箭侠 前情提要
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,370
谁给你的致幻剂
Who supplies you with Vertigo?

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:31,940
他们叫他伯爵
They call him the Count!

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,840
56个人死于研发这种快感
56 people died to perfect this high.

12
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,020
警方从未抓到杀了你哥的人
The police never caught
your brother's shooter.

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,690
子弹上有箭毒 
这是Floyd Lawton的手法
The bullets were laced with
curare,that's Floyd Lawton's M.O.

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,760
- Lawton还活着
- 我很抱歉 John
- Lawton's alive.
- I'm sorry,John.

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,420
这个叫Lawton的人踢了他的狗吗
This Lawton guy kick
his dog or something?

16
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,830
他杀了他的哥哥
He killed his brother.

17
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,260
我们怎么样
How we doing?

18
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,010
有盈余 也有亏损
We're in the black,and the green.

19
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,420
我喜欢把钱扔进俱乐部再收回来
I like how we've gone from throwing
money at clubs to catching it.

20
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,010
看看这些
Oh,look at these.

21
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,900
什么生意会做到失物招领处
都是女人的内衣啊
What sort of business has a lost and found
that's just filled with women's underwear?

22
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,120
最好的生意吗
The best business ever?

23
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,780
这么欢乐肯定犯法了
Ohh,having this much fun
should be against the law.

24
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,600
噢 希望是这样
Oh,if wishing made it so.

25
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,770
抱歉 打扰你们了吗
Sorry,am I interrupting anything?

26
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,870
- Laurel还好吗
- 她很好
- Is Laurel ok?
- She's fine.

27
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,060
我来是为了别的事
This visit is about something else.

28
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,050
有个女孩在附近街区出车祸了
A girl just got mowed down
a couple blocks from here.

29
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,500
在斯特林大桥
On Starling bridge.

30
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,190
你们俩有印象吗
Ring any bells with you two?

31
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,870
- 没有
- 真的吗
- No.
- Should she?

32
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,040
她今晚来过你们俱乐部
She was in your club tonight.

33
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,400
很多人都来过
A lot of people were.

34
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,600
你觉得有人杀了她
You think someone killed her?

35
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,990
不是某人
Not someone.

36
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,410
是某样东西
Something.

37
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,050
致幻剂
Vertigo.

38
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,600
是的 你们俱乐部有这个吗
Yeah. You got a problem
with that in this club?

39
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,200
我不知道
Not that I'm aware of.

40
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,050
这里我们不允许带毒品 警官
We don't allow drugs in here,Detective.

41
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,620
控制好你们的客户群
Control your clientele.

42
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,860
以防又有人跑到马路上乱晃
Before anyone else wanders into traffic.

43
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,140
她有可能带毒品进来吗
Is there any chance she could
have scored the drugs in here?

44
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,460
我怀疑 我尽量没雇太多毒贩子
I doubt it. I try not to
hire too many drug dealers.

45
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,830
给我一份员工名单
Get me a list of employees,anyway.

46
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,940
我让Felicity去查他们的毒品拘留记录
I'll have Felicity cross
reference it for drug arrests.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,880
也包括咱俩了
That includes the two of us,you know.

48
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,770
我以为义务警员已经解决伯爵的案子了
I thought the Vigilante
finished off the Count.

49
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,910
我是解决了
I did.

50
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,070
医生 我就问他几个问题
I just need to ask him
a few questions,Doc.

51
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,350
你可以试试 警官
但我不确定你能问出什么来
Well,you're welcome to try,Detective,but
I'm not sure you'll get very far with him.

52
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,360
什么意思
What does that mean?

53
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,290
是因为医生病人保密协议吗
Is this a load about
doctor-patient privilege?

54
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,580
不 他服用过量的未提炼致幻剂
No,far from it. The unrefined
Vertigo overdose he suffered

55
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,300
导致他的前扣带皮层末梢有所损伤
caused damage to the caudal
portion of his anterior cingulate.

56
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,390
好吧 你可能会因为
我没上过医学院而惊讶
Well,you'll probably be shocked to
hear that I didn't go to medical school.

57
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,270
我和他已经处了几个月了
I've been working with
him for months now.

58
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,530
他只会说些分裂性言语
还会偶尔对你吐痰
And all I've gotten out of him is word
salad and the occasional spit in the face.

59
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,370
- 祝你好运
- 谢谢
- Best of luck to you.
- Thanks.

60
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:39,230
我生于此地 死于彼地
Here I was born,and there I died.

61
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,130
有一刻是因为你
It was only a moment for you.

62
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,940
你不曾发觉
You took no notice.

63
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,910
今晚一个女人死于你的毒品
A woman died tonight...
from your poison.

64
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,690
很多女人会在很多夜晚死于不同的原因
Lots of women die,lots of
nights,for lots of reasons.

65
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,640
又有人在出售致幻剂了 
都是从哪里来的
Someone is selling Vertigo
again. Where is it coming from?

66
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,160
我记得你
I remember you.

67
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,400
帽衫侠
Man in hood.

68
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,240
你一直在我的脑海里
You are never far from my thoughts.

69
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,550
你让这座城市失望了
You have failed this city!

70
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,450
你让这座城市失望了
You have failed this city!

71
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,680
你让这座城市失望了
You have failed this city!

72
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,100
你可以直接说他是个疯子
You could have just said he was nuts.

73
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,100
你让这座城市失望了
You failed this city!

74
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,790
好了 我学到了一招
All right! You're teaching me that one.

75
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,920
还差不知道刀的位置
Only if you show me where the knife was.

76
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,490
谁教你打架的
Who taught you how to fight?

77
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,320
我爸希望生的是儿子
My father wanted a son.

78
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,850
这不就是吗
He got one.

79
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,850
当心点 这支弓能承受150磅的重量
The tension of that bow's 150 pounds.

80
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,580
一失手你俩眼睛里就都是纤维碎片了
Snap it,you'll both be covered
by fiber shrapnel in your eyes.

81
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,590
她说的没错 你不够强 孩子
She's right. You're
not strong enough,kid.

82
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,340
再来吗
Go again?

83
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,330
真不错啊 你俩都很强悍
It's pretty exciting that
both of you are such bad asses,

84
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,380
你们也许可以计划下怎么阻止Fyers
but do you think that maybe we
should be making a plan to stop Fyers?

85
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,480
还有...救你父亲
And,I don't know... Save your dad?

86
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,930
他一直这么怨念吗
Does he always whine this much?

87
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,740
今天算不错了
Today's one of his good days.

88
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,210
他会打架吗
Can he fight?

89
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,030
我试着教过 但从未成功
I've tried. Never much success.

90
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,500
我坐等呢
I'm sitting right here.

91
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,040
我还没试过
Well,I haven't tried yet.

92
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,980
Patterson议员被狙击手射杀
a***

93
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,870
- John叔叔
- 嘿 小盆友
- Uncle John.
- Hey,buddy.

94
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,840
你能读"Logan Bogan"的故事给我听吗
Will you read "Logan Bogan" to me?

95
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,960
宝贝 上床去 等会妈妈念给你听
Sweetheart,get into bed and mommy
will read to you in a minute.

96
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,760
我要John叔叔给我念嘛
But I want Uncle John to read to me!

97
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,230
John叔叔今天很累了
Uncle John's had a long day.

98
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,860
下次再念给你听
He'll read to you next time.

99
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,720
抱歉
Hey,I'm sorry.

100
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,490
我今天一直在外面
I've been some place else today.

101
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,530
你怎么了
What's going on with you?

102
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,890
我在查一些事情
I'm just trying to
figure some stuff out.

103
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:27,660
需要谈心的话 我一直在
If you need to talk about
anything,you know I'm here for you.

104
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,140
是Oliver Queen 有急事
It is Oliver Queen,with an emergency.

105
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,570
我得走了
Got to go.

106
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,140
我尽快赶来了
Got here as quickly as I could.

107
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,660
是你爸小册子上图案的事吗
This about the glyph in
your father's notebook?

108
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,160
Felicity还在查
Felicity is still working on that.

109
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,510
有别的事了
We have another problem.

110
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,610
斯特林市又陷入了
人尽皆知的致幻剂之战
Starling City is once again at war with
the drug known on the streets as Vertigo.

111
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,960
它曾是这里最致命的东西
It used to be the
city's most lethal vice,

112
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,530
但这绿紫色药丸已经消失三个月了
but the purple and green pill was
nowhere to be found for the last 3 months.

113
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,910
过去几天 我市因为
新型的致幻剂血流成河
Over the past few days,the city has been
flooded with a new version of Vertigo.

114
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,540
它更易上瘾 更不稳定
More addictive,more unstable.

115
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,020
导致俱乐部的一个女孩死了
It killed a girl in the club.

116
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,110
就像当初差点要了Thea的命
Just like it almost killed Thea.

117
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,160
那你怎么想 去见见伯爵吗
Ok,what are you think? We
should pay the Count a visit?

118
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,720
已经见过了 白去
He was my first visit. Waste of time.

119
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,610
他已经疯了
He's...sumasshedshiy.

120
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,470
但他是唯一一个知道致幻剂配方的人
Since he was the only one that
knew the forumla for Vertigo,

121
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,140
我不知道从何下手了
I don't... I don't even
know where to begin.

122
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,310
很好 你们都在 
当然都在 你们还能去哪
Good,you're here. Of course you're
here. Where else would you be?

123
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,040
你们可爱死这里了
You clearly love it down here.

124
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,200
来看看这个
You got to see this.

125
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,190
我现在在警方几小时前公布的
一个精神病患者逃离的现场
I'm here at the scene where police say a
disturbed patient escaped only hours ago.

126
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:48,540
当局立即宣布封锁斯特林市
精卫中心以追查此次越狱事件
Authorities issued an immediate for Mental Health
lockdown at the Starling County Institute following the breakout.

127
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,200
警方提醒市民不要接触叫伯爵的毒贩
Police are warning people to avoid contact
with the drug dealer known as the Count.

128
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,650
一点也不疯狂吧
Not so crazy after all,huh?

129

132
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,050
我在给他吃药 他在喃喃自语
I was administering his
meds. He was babbling.

133
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,550
他惯例吼闹 然后突然不说话
His usual ranting,then he's ice cold.

134
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,590
一下子压制住我
He overpowered me.

135
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,930
他逼我从维修出口带他出去
He forced me to take him out
through the maintenance exit.

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,280
我以为他无害 正如你所说
I thought he was harmless.
Basically a vegetable,you said.

137
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:23,830
我知道 这几个月我一直在观察他
I know. Which means... I've interviewed
him dozens of times in the past few months.

138
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,170
- 这么被一个病人完全欺骗...
- 别担心 我们会找到他的
- To be deceived by a patient so completely...
- Don't worry. We'll find him.

139
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,160
会让他进一个无法逃离的监狱
He's going to find prison a
lot harder to break out of.

140
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,830
警官 他很危险
Detective... He's dangerous.

141
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,340
千万别低估他
Don't underestimate him.

142
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,410
监控录像里能找到什么吗
Did we get anything from
the security cameras?

143
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,030
根据这里的规定
Not according to the orderly here.

144
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,100
为了节省预算 第一个拆的就是摄像头
Due to budget cuts,the
cameras were the first to go.

145
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,360
真是荒唐
That is unbelievable.

146
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,170
还有别的途径
There's another angle.

147
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,020
Veronica Sparks 
那个从俱乐部出来的受害者
Veronica Sparks,the
dead girl from Verdant?

148
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,420
我查了她的用户数据信息
I checked her LUDs.

149
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,460
她死前最后联系的人是Tommy Merlyn
The last person she texted
before she died was Tommy Merlyn.

150
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,830
他说不认识她
He said he didn't know her.

151
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,230
Merlyn被指控两项罪名 
其中一项是蓄意谋杀
Merlyn has two collars for
possession,one with intent.

152
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,020
对 那是5年前的事
Yeah,that was over five years ago.

153
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,130
或许他更擅于逃脱法网
Maybe he's just better at
not getting himself arrested.

154
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,820
Laurel说他爸不给他钱以后 
他改变了很多
Well,Laurel says he's changed
ever since his father cut him off.

155
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,780
人总是秉性难移
Yeah,a leopard and his spots,you know?

156
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,240
或许在他的夜店贩毒
只是维持他以前生活作风的一种方式
Maybe pushing Vertigo at his new club is
a way of maintaining his old lifestyle.

157
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,080
是啊 或许去找Meryln
Yeah,or maybe going after Meryln's
a great way to get my daughter

158
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,900
能让我女儿别再跟我闹僵 Hilt
to stop speaking to me again,Hilt.

159
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,140
Quentin 我了解你的难处
Look,Quentin,you know I get that.

160
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,870
还有 凭直觉 我查了夜店的账户
But here's the thing... on a hunch,I
subpoenaed the club's bank accounts.

161
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,170
他们的营业费用中有1万美元亏空
There's ten large missing
from their operating expenses.

162
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,180
你觉得Merlyn用那些钱买致幻剂了吗
You think Merlyn spent
that money on Vertigo?

163
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,710
我很纳闷 那么多钱花哪儿了
I think I can't explain how that
much money just gets misplaced.

164
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,270
我会继续查的
Look,I'll take a run at it.

165
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,860
- 你别管了
- 不
- Keep you out of it.
- No.

166
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,190
还是我来吧
I should do it.

167
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,560
需要什么
What you need?

168
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,980
好嘞
All right.

169
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,140
黑哥哥我弄来了你要的毒品
The person of color has
successfully purchased your drugs.

170
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,320
别忘了 我说过我去的
For the record,I offered.

171
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,420
追踪器激活时 我们怎么知道呢
How will we know when
the tracker is active?

172
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,690
已经激活了 我们在钱上植入的纤维
已经在发信号了
It already is. I'm getting a good signal off
the monofilament strips we placed in the bills.

173
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,930
贩毒的钱就像鸽子 总能找到回家的路
Drug money's like a pigeon...
it always finds its way home.

174
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,990
追踪那些钱 我们就能找到伯爵
We can follow the money all
the way back to the Count.

175
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,850
继续追踪
Ok. Keep tracking it.


176
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,060
这些致幻剂 你要怎么处理
Well,what are you going to do
with all the Vertigo you bought?

177
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,220
办个派对呗 Felicity
Plan on having a party,Felicity?

178
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,200
我仅有的涉毒经历是大一那年
My only experience with
drugs was an encounter

179
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,690
无意中吃了含大麻的巧克力蛋糕
with a pot brownie my
freshman year... by mistake.

180
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,090
本来应该挺嗨的 可是我对坚果过敏
Which could have been
fun,except I'm allergic to nuts.

181
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,510
头部中枪
All right,head shot.

182
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,570
又有人被杀 是个议员
Kills again,this time a U.S. senator.

183
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,780
在哪儿追踪到他的
Where have you been tracking him?

184
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,540
不远处 我用他Floyd Lawton那个化名
查了我能想到的所有法律类数据库
Not very far. I ran his Floyd Lawton alias
through every conceivable law enforcement database.

185
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,160
他给一个Alberto Garcia的人
打过几次电话
He's made a series of
calls to an Alberto Garcia.

186
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,970
根据国家安全局的记载
Garcia是个不错的黑社会伯乐
According to NSA,Garcia's a
reputed underworld talent scout.

187
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,720
他帮Deadshot接的活儿
He books all the Deadshot's hits.

188
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,480
- 没查到更多 但...
- 查到这些已经不错了 Felicity 谢谢
- It's not much to go on,but...
- Yeah,but it's something,Felicity,thanks.

189
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,810
你觉得该告诉Oliver吗
Don't you think Oliver should know?

190
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,900
不用 这是我的私事
No,this is personal.

191
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,630
我自己处理Lawton的事
Lawton is my problem to deal with.

192
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,050
什么风把你吹来了
What brings you by?

193
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,770
嘿 一起吃晚饭吧
Hey,would you like some dinner?

194
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,580
你女儿点了超多泰国外卖
Your daughter ordered
way too much Thai food.

195
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,320
不用了 谢谢
No,thanks.

196
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,550
我是来谈公事的
This is a business visit,actually.

197
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,350
关于Sparks那个女孩的命案
我想问你几个问题
I got some follow up questions
on the Sparks' girl's death.

198
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:31,780
好啊 那女孩出车祸前去过我的夜店
Sure. The girl was in the
club before she got run-over.

199
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:37,360
你说不认识她 但她手机里
最后一条短信是发给你的
You said you didn't know her,but,um,but
the last text off her phone was to you.

200
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:42,740
是吗 那...我可倒霉了
Really? Because,uh...
Well,I'll be damned.

201
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,760
我没回复
Huh. Well,I didn't reply.

202
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,230
这种垃圾短信 我每晚收到无数条
I get a hundred texts like this a night.

203
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,860
大家想去夜店玩
People wanting to get into the club.

204
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,700
那女孩说"要勾搭我吗"
只为了进夜店吗
So that's what she meant
by,"Can you hook me up?"

205
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,900
要不还能为什么
What else would it be about?

206
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,480
你们夜店的账户少了1万美元
$10,000 is missing from
your club's bank accounts.

207
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,600
钱去哪儿了
What'd you spend the money on?

208
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,110
不知道 可能是记错账了
No idea. There must be some
sort of bookkeeping error...

209
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,280
我打开天窗说亮话吧
Ok,let me put this another way...

210
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:08,350
如果你为了"勾搭"你的顾客
用那笔钱去买致幻剂...
if you spent that money on Vertigo so
that you could "hook up" your clientele...

211
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:08,890
爸
Dad!

212
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,300
现在你最好配合警方 这事你别管
Then the best thing for you right now is
to cop to it,ok? Get out in front of this.

213
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,410
什么也别说
Don't say anything.

214
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,000
- 我是想...
- 公事公办吗 我知道了
- I am trying to...
- To do your job? Yeah,I know.

215
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,820
我也一样
And this is me doing mine.

216
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:22,810
Laurel 我知道我现在
又成了不招人待见的老爸
Laurel,I know I look like the
disapproving father...again.

217
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,910
但我不来 别的警察就会来
But I came down here
so another cop wouldn't.

218
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,650
明白吗
You understand?

219
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,900
- Tommy 我...
- 我没胃口了
- Tommy,I...
- I'm not hungry anymore.

220
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,220
手举起来
Hold up hand up.

221
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,250
掌心对着我
Palm facing me.

222
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,070
击打水面
Hit the water.

223
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,070
- 什么
- 快点
- What?
- Hit it.

224
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,100
再来
Again.

225
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,230
再来 用力
Again. Harder.

226
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,640
想让我看起来像个二B吗 你做到了
If the point of this is to make
me feel like an idiot,it's working.

227
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:22,050
"不积跬步无以至千里"
"A journey of a thousand miles
begins with a single step."

228
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,560
孔夫子名言 很好
Confucius,great.

229
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,310
跟你爸一样
I'm starting to see
the family resemblance.

230
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,250
是老子的名言 再来
Laozi,actually. Again.

231
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,070
到底要干嘛
Now what?

232
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,470
盛满水 再来
Fill the bowl. Start again.

233
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,970
有线索没
What have you got?

234
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,860
查到了钱最终的去向
The end of the money trail.

235
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,830
我把交易地点发给你
Sending the dealer's
location to you now.

236
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,830
谁想嗨一嗨
Who's looking to party?

237
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,700
这可不够 哥们
That's not enough,man.

238
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,550
付不起钱就别想嗨
You don't pay,you don't play.

239
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,150
没关系 薄利多销
It's all right. Good for business.

240
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,500
我老板好像挺喜欢你 G
My boss seems to like you,G.

241
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,470
这个 够买一大包了 老兄
Now that... That'll
buy you a brick,my man.

242
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,840
快跑
Go,go,go!

243
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,350
保持呼吸
Don't forget to breathe.

244
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,240
他不会的 我不会的
He won't. I won't.

245
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,180
恭喜
Congratulations.

246
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,360
我正式封你为超级大怪咖
You're officially the
creepiest person I've ever met.

247
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,040
我 我感觉不好
I don't...I don't feel so good.

248
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,510
别靠近我 怪咖
Get away from me,creep.

249
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,220
怎么回事
Have we got a problem?

250
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,750
你没事吧
Are you ok?

251
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,290
各部门请注意 发生袭警事件 呼叫救护车
All units,all units,code 99.

252
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,890
有持枪者在斯特林水族馆 各部门...
417 in progress,Starling
Aquarium. All available units...

253
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,340
警方频道刚播的
this just came over
the police frequency.

254
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,490
我黑进了水族馆的安保系统 
能看得更清楚
I hacked the aquarium security
system to get a better look.

255
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,980
想难为我吗你
You want

256
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,080
围观者看见他吃过黑色和绿色的药
Bystanders said they saw him
pop some green and black pills...

257
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,470
有个服用致幻剂 嗨过头的家伙
劫持了人质
There's a lunatic high on
Vertigo who's taking hostages,

258
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:20,480
你却在...泡茶
and you're making... making tea.

259
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,560
那是我从岛上带来的草药
They're medicinal herbs from the island.

260
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,940
有解毒功效
They counter balance the effects
of certain drugs and poisons.

261
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,210
应该可以解致幻剂的毒
They should counteract
the effects of Vertigo.

262
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,720
- 你不想...
- 什么
- And you aren't going to...
- What?

263
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,090
你懂的...
You know...

264
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,420
我妹妹服食过那破玩意儿
My sister got high on this garbage.

265
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,580
差点闹出人命
Could have killed someone.

266
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,020
但她罪不至死
She didn't deserve
an arrow in the heart.

267
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,370
那家伙也没危害本市
This guy didn't fail the city.

268
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,620
是本市害了他
The city failed him.

269
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,780
我也害了他
And so did I.

270
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,100
这不是你的错
What's happening now isn't your fault.

271
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,350
你又没逼他吸毒
You didn't make him take drugs.

272
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,200
是 可我没干掉伯爵
No,but I did fail to put
the Count in a grave so deep

273
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,690
要不他也不能再害人
that he couldn't come
back and hurt anyone again.

274
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,050
你抓到他了 他也被关起来了
You caught him. They locked him up.

275
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,030
现在本市在水深火热中
And now the city is on fire!

276
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,490
很显然 只把他抓起来是不够的
So clearly,it wasn't the right decision.

277
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,750
联系Diggle
Get in touch with Diggle.

278
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,830
监控系统受损 
我需要有人在水族馆帮我望风
With the security feed out,I'm going
need a second set of eyes at the aquarium.

279
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,340
你回国时能见上面 真高兴
Glad I caught you stateside.

280
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,480
可不 两天后我要去平壤
Just barely. I leave in
two days for Pyongyang.

281
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,850
这不是秘密吗
Isn't that classified?

282
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,650
老战友肯定会为我保密的
I figure an old army
buy can keep a secret.

283
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,220
很高兴接到你的电话
I was glad to get your call.

284
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,240
Lyla 我打给你不是为了叙旧
Lyla,that's not why I called.

285
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,100
那你是要我帮你忙咯
There's something else you'd
like me to do for you,then.

286
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,020
实际上 是我要帮你
Well,actually,I think there's
something I can do for you.

287
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:56,720
我快陷入孤立无援之地了
我想Deadshot是Argus的头号通缉犯
I'm going to go out on a limb and assume
that Deadshot is on Argus' most wanted list.

288
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:57,680
你掌握了些什么
What do you know about him?

289
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,150
第一 他叫Floyd Lawton
Well,his name,for
starters. Floyd Lawton.

290
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,830
我们都没查到呢 你怎么知道的
We don't even have
that. Where'd you get it?

291
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,150
我还有这东西
Same place I got this.

292
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:11,790
这里面的信息 
能查出Deadshot的幕后指使
This is everything you need to locate
who's giving Deadshot his targets.

293
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,500
你为什么对这事上心
What's your interest in this?

294
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,620
Lawton跟我在从事的一些事有关
Lawton came up in connection
with some things I'm working on.

295
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,860
我觉得这些信息给你最合适
I thought you were the right
person to pass it off to.

296
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,240
你以前说谎可没这么差劲 Johnny
I remember you being a
better liar than that,Johnny.

297
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,990
Lyla  Lawton是危险分子
Listen,Lyla,Lawton is
a very dangerous man.

298
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,960
你们才有能力把他绳之以法
And your people are the most
qualified to take him down.

299
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,990
就这么简单
It's that simple.

300
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,720
我们的工作从不简单
Nothing in our business is simple.

301
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,040
又需要我帮什么吗 Lance先生
Me to ask for my help again,Mr. Lance?

302
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,670
Eric Messner吗
Eric Messner?

303
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,200
谁
Who?

304
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,770
斯特林市城区规划委员
He's a zoning commissioner
for Starling City.

305
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,530
而且是出了名的腐败
A notoriously corrupt one,at that.

306
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:02,570
那失踪的一万元 
就是你贿赂他免于检查你们俱乐部
Missing ten grand. You paid it to him
to skip the inspection of your nightclub.

307
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,720
为什么这么做 Merlyn
有什么你不想让他发现的
Why'd you do that,Merlyn? What
didn't you want him to find?

308
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,270
没有啊
We got nothing to hide here.

309
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,090
好 那我四处转转
Great. Then let's just
take a little look around.

310
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,710
没问题
Absolutely.

311
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,700
但必须有搜查令
When you come back
with a search warrant.

312
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,520
你确定要这么来
Are you sure this is how
you want to play this?

313
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,330
当然
Apparently.

314
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,140
我女儿还真会挑人
Doesn't my daughter
know how to pick 'em.

315
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,580
不许笑我
Stop laughing at me!

316
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,290
闭嘴
Shut up!

317
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,580
别吵
Shut up!

318
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,170
站住 我不想伤害你
Stop! I don't want to hurt you.

319
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,150
我是来帮你的
I'm here to help you.

320
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,630
我妈会瑜伽
My mom does yoga.

321
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,880
还记得Slade和我救你的时候吗
Hey,remember when
Slade and I rescued you?

322
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,070
你救的我
You rescued me?

323
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,590
行 我们互救的时候
Fine. When we all rescued each other.

324
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:47,560
你说你知道Fyers为什么
要抓姚飞逼他帮忙
You said you knew why Fyers wanted Yao
Fei,and how he was forcing him to help.

325
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,740
想说说吗
Feel like sharing?

326
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,320
我们没可以拍的水了
We're almost out of slapping water.

327
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,280
我父亲是人民解放军的将军
My father was a Shangjiang in
the People's Liberation Army.

328
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:04,490
上将 我不知道Fyers计划的细节
A general. I didn't hear
the details of Fyers plans,

329
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:07,590
但他想让我爸去应对
but he wants my father
to be the face of it.

330
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,360
做替罪羊 承担过失 隐藏内幕
A scapegoat. To take the blame
and conceal their own involvement.

331
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,920
姚飞一开始怎么会来这的
Why was Yao Fei on the
island in the first place?

332
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,030
Fyers说他杀了人
Fyers says he murdered people.

333
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,740
没有
No,he didn't.

334
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,630
中国军方承认了大屠杀
The Chinese military
comitted the massacre.

335
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,710
得有人承担过失
Someone had to take the blame.

336
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,850
他们就选择了他
They chose him.

337
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,510
把他遣送到这座岛度过余生
Sent him to this island for life.

338
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,080
我找他找了很多年
I spent years looking for him.

339
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,410
几个月前 有人找上了门
A few months ago,a man
came to my apartment.

340
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,500
说他知道我父亲的下落
Said he had information
about my father's whereabouts.

341
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,120
我当时已经不抱希望了
I had given up hope.

342
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:50,690
就放下警戒 没看到他带了电击枪
直到在这里醒来
Let my guard down. Didn't see the tazer
until... When I woke up,I was here.

343
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:03,780
我很担心 在这座岛上只为了生存
I'm worried. This island... What
he must have had to do to survive.

344
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,640
这会不会改变他
That it changed him.

345
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,190
他救过我的命
He saved my life.

346
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,490
他还是好人 Shado
He's still a good man,Shado.

347
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,600
再来吧
Again.

348
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,810
我就这么坐在我们最爱的寿司店
So there I am sitting at our
favorite Sushi restaurant,

349
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:30,300
喝着清酒 只缺佳人
a bottle of saki,and the only thing
that's missing is my boyfriend.

350
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,090
天哪 我真的很抱歉 亲爱的
My God,I'm so sorry,baby.

351
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,100
这里事情太多了
I just have a lot going on here.

352
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,900
Tommy 不管发生什么事
你要知道我都相信你
Tommy,whatever's going on with
you,I want you to know I believe you.

353
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,490
我都站在你这边
I'm here for you.

354
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,390
不好意思
Sorry.

355
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,000
Ollie
Ollie.

356
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,060
怎么了
What's wrong?

357
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,260
今晚糟透了
Bad night.

358
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:56,290
事情变糟了 Meryln先生
根据你的要求 搜查令已到
It's about to get worse. Mr. Meryln,as
requested,a warrant to search these premises.

359
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,900
- 我不敢相信你这么做
- 相信吧
- I can't believe you're doing this.
- Believe it.

360
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,100
警官 我不是律师
Detective,I'm not an attorney,

361
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,160
但你为什么要搜我的俱乐部
but on what grounds are
you searching my club?

362
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,560
你的总经理贿赂了一个政府官员
Your general manager
bribed a government official

363
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,400
让你们的楼免于检查
to keep him from inspecting
the entirety of your building.

364
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,080
什么
What?

365
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,340
因为他在店里出售致幻剂
Because he's selling
Vertigo out of the club.

366
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,450
- Ollie 这是有效的
- 谢谢
- Ollie,it's valid.
- Thank you.

367
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,520
地下层不在检查楼层内
A sub level is not listed on
the inspection's floor plans.

368
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:20,530
但我查了县里记录
However,I pulled the county records.

369
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,350
下面有东西
There's something down there.

370
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,000
我想亲眼看看是什么
I want to see for myself what it is.

371
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,710
在那
Oh,look at that.

372
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,710
开门吧
Open the door.

373
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,160
你这是在犯错
You're making a mistake.

374
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,740
不 是你
No. You are.

375
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,540
如果你不开门的话
If you don't open that door.

376
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,550
我说开门
I said,open the door.

377
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,840
谢谢
Thank you.

378
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,790
这地方真是一片乱
The place is kind of a mess.

379
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,290
我用它来储藏我们大部分存货
I've been using it to store
the bulk of our inventory.

380
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,050
箱子里是什么
What's in the boxes?

381
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,410
你自己看啊
Why don't you have a look.

382
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,250
如果禁酒令还有效的话
Well,if prohibition
were still in effect,

383
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,300
你有刑事诉讼依据了
you might actually have a
basis of a criminal complaint.

384
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,110
想打开其他板条箱吗
Would you like to open
the rest of the crates?

385
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,310
既然你们没什么需要藏的
So if you don't have anything to hide...

386
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:04,030
为什么这里不让检查
Why didn't you want
the inspector down here?

387
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:11,190
这里的通风系统六十年代之后就没换过
Well,the ventilation system in this place
hasn't been updated since the sixties.

388
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,000
也许我们都没法营业
Maybe we shouldn't even be open.

389
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,370
抱歉
I'm sorry.

390
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,000
我以为他能接受我们在一起
I thought he was ok
with us being together.

391
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,680
他没错 我是贿赂了那个人
He wasn't wrong. I bribed a guy.

392
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,730
那他也不该使这种高压手段
That's not why he
brought out his jackboots.

393
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,260
会没事的
It's all gonna be fine.

394
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,840
回家见
I'll see you at home.

395
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,370
- 晚安
- 晚安
- Good night.
- Good night.

396
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,050
有什么想跟我说的吗
Is there something
you want to say to me?

397
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,910
谢谢你
Thank you.

398
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:46,200
我不明白你为什么不告诉我贿赂的事
No,I meant the thing when Lance accused me of
that you were thinking dealing out of the club.

399
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,040
我经营着俱乐部 Oliver
I don't understand why you wouldn't I run the club,Oliver.
just tell me about the bribe.

400
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,360
很多事我都没告诉你
I don't tell you a lot of things.

401
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,920
我倒要问问你了 兄弟
So let me ask you a question,pal.

402
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,300
你回来的这半年我做了什么
What have I done in the last
6 months since you've been home

403
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,620
会让你相信我贩毒了
that would lead you to believe
that I would sell drugs?

404
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,030
过去半年吗 没有
In the last 6 months? Nothing.

405
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,820
但我失踪之前 你行为卑劣
Before I left,you played hard.

406
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,960
你总是跟那些坏人在一起
You played with bad people
who were into bad stuff.

407
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,880
你又何尝不是 Oliver
And so did you,Oliver.

408
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,290
但我和你一样变了
But I changed just like you did.

409
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,590
现在你拿箭指着那些违法的人
Now you put arrows in
people who do illegal things.

410
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,830
贿赂检查员是违法的
Last time I checked,bribing a
city inspector was not legal.

411
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,270
你真的以为我会伤害你吗
Do you actually think
that I could hurt you?

412
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,220
其实我完全不知道你会做出什么来
Truthfully,I have no idea
what the hell you would do.

413
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,480
你对我来说像迷一样
You are a complete mystery to me.

414
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:33,750
我不知道你如何做到轻易地去杀一个人
I've got no idea how you find
it so easy to kill people.

415
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:40,340
下次你认为我有多恶劣时
想想我是怎么认为你的
The next time you decide to think the
worst of me,imagine what I now think of you.

416
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,580
他怎么了
What's his problem?

417
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,360
你怎么了
What's yours?

418
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:51,980
什么意思
Excuse me?

419
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,330
我让Felicity联系你
I asked Felicity to
get in touch with you.

420
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,440
水族馆有人劫持人质
There was a hostage
situation at the aquarium.

421
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,190
抱歉 之后我才看到消息
I'm sorry,I didn't get that
message till it was over.

422
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,620
怎么会
Why?

423
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,410
我在处理别的事
Because I was busy doing something else.

424
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,860
Lawton
Lawton.

425
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,570
Oliver 你最后并不需要我
Oliver,you didn't end up needing me.

426
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:10,870
你怎么会知道呢
You couldn't have known that.

427
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,810
你不是自己去找杀你哥哥的凶手了吗
In other words,find your brother's
killer on your own time,right?

428
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,110
致幻剂在腐蚀这座城市 Diggle
Vertigo's tearing
this city apart,Diggle.

429
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,070
没错 也许现在是解决
私人恩怨的最佳时机
So,yeah,maybe now's not the best
time to indulge a personal vendetta.

430
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,300
你现在敢跟我说
你去找伯爵不是擅自去的
You're actually gonna that you going after the
stand there and tell me Count is not personal?

431
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:27,260
Oliver 听着 在不知道是Lawton
夺走了我侄子的父亲前 
Oliver,listen,I cannot
read a book to my nephew

432
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,490
我没法给他讲故事
without knowing that Lawton
took his father from him.

433
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,600
我没法和Carly在一起 
I can't move on with
Carly,I can't move on

434
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,380
知道他还活着我没法前进
with my life knowing
that he's still out there.

435
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,960
我以为只有你会懂我
I thought if anybody
got that it'd be you.

436
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,610
这里怎么了
What happened here?

437
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,240
这里的网还能用
The ethernet cable still works.

438
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,500
接上你的电脑吧
Would you plug in your tablet,please?

439
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,720
你想重建吗
Did you decide to remodel?

440
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,540
说来话长
Long story.

441
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,690
Dig呢
Where's Dig?

442
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,790
一言难尽
Long story.

443
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,010
那个劫持人质者是瘾君子
The hostage-taking junkie.

444
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,450
他现在是我们能找到伯爵的唯一线索了
He is the only lead to
the Count we've got left.

445
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,160
你要什么信息
What type of information
are you looking for?

446
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,240
只要能让我知道伯爵的位置就行
Anything that will give us a
line on the Count's location.

447
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,590
验尸有结果了吗
Has the M.E. performed
the autopsy report yet?

448
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,520
马上调出来
Yeah,just pulling it up now.

449
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,970
查一下毒物学
看是否有和他用的致幻剂相关的东西
Check the toxicology to see if there's
something related to the Vertigo he was on.

450
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,450
他不是使用致幻剂过量死的
He didn't die of a Vertigo overdose.

451
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,700
我看到了 Felicity
I saw it,Felicity.

452
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,790
验尸官说是死于严重的过敏反应
According to the coroner,cause
of death was severe anaphylaxis.

453
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:24,720
他是因氯丙嗪过敏而死的
He died of an allergic
reaction to chlorpromazine.

454
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,230
那是抗精神病药
That's an anti-psychotic.

455
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,250
看一下Veronica Sparks的尸检
Pull up the Veronica Sparks autopsy.

456
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,080
她体内有氯丙嗪吗
Did she have chlorpromazine
in her system?

457
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,370
有
Yes.

458
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,200
你怎么知道
How did you know?

459
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:41,460
伯爵肯定已经把它加进
最新一批致幻剂了
The Count must have added it as a new
ingredient in this latest iteration of Vertigo.

460
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,110
但他生产这些 
不需要庞大的社交圈来推销吗
But wouldn't the amount he'd need to
manufacture enough for circulation be huge?

461
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,410
这从何而来
Where would he get that much?

462
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,150
精神病院
A mental institution.

463
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,320
万一我们都想错了怎么办
What if we're looking at this all wrong?

464
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,250
怎么会
How so?

465
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,910
每个人都在救济院之外的地方找他
万一他从没离开过呢
Everybody is looking for him outside
the asylum,but what if he never left?

466
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:06,280
万一他假装自己跑了
就像他装疯一样
What if... What if he faked his escape
the same way that he faked being insane?

467
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,060
我本该抓住机会杀了你的
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

468
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,630
转过去
Turn around.

469
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:05,400
我让你转过去
I said turn around.

470
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,840
Oliver Queen
Oliver Queen.

471
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:47,890
在岛上的那么多年 看来你真是疯了
All those years on that island.

472
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,280
所以伯爵不是装疯 对吧
So the Count didn't fake
losing his mind,did he?

473
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,240
一直都是你
This was you the whole time.

474
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,870
你怎么让他把致幻剂的配方给你的
How'd you get him to give you
the formula for Vertigo? Huh?

475
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:23,270
现在化学不像是他的强项了
Chemistry doesn't seem like
his best subject right now.

476
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,030
他要不想说是不会告诉我的
He couldn't tell me if he wanted to.

477
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,410
我给他的肾脏做了个活检
I ordered a biopsy on his kidneys.

478
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,640
在他吸毒过量后 纸巾上全是麻醉药
The tissue was suffused with
the narcotic after his O.D.

479
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:34,920
拿到结果以后
我意识到我可以逆向推出
When I got the results,I
realized I could reverse engineer

480
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,860
药物的化学成分
the chemical compound of the drug,

481
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:40,620
用这里的设备 制造一种合成版本
produce a synthesized version
myself using the facilities here.

482
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,600
也有一些改进 比如加入氯丙嗪
And made a few improvements,like
adding chlorpromazine.

483
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,810
你就是这么找到我们的
That's how you found us.

484
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,700
有警察来询问
Cops came around,started
asking questions,

485
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:52,980
你假造了伯爵的失踪
来减少别人对你的关注
you faked the Count's disappearance
to draw attention away from yourself.

486
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,690
很聪明
It's clever.

487
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,780
我没想过要当犯罪主谋
I wasn't trying to be
a criminal mastermind.

488
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,050
我只想要钱而已
I just needed the money.

489
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:05,800
你这亿万富翁当然不会懂
Something I'm sure a
billionaire wouldn't understand.

490
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:11,400
相信我 我懂你
Believe me,I understand you perfectly.

491
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,010
掰开他的嘴
Open his mouth.

492
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,990
什么 不
What? No! No!

493
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:33,200
我从小报里了解到
From what I've read in the tabloids,

494
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:38,350
人们听说Oliver Queen吸毒过量而死
是不会惊讶的
no one will be surprised to hear
Oliver Queen died of a drug overdose.

495
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,990
安全
Clear.

496
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,050
不许动
Freeze!

497
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,840
你看起来可不怎么好
You don't look so good.

498
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,790
我觉得你射不准的
I doubt you could aim a single arrow.

499
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,220
看来我是站到最后的那个
Looks like I'm the last one standing.

500
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:55,180
坐着 旋转
Sitting. Spinning.

501
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,160
做点什么
Something to do.

502
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,960
我本来要做什么
What was I going to do?

503
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,640
记忆和原来的不一样
Memory not what it once was.

504
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:09,460
什么都变了
Nothing what it once was.

505
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,870
墓碑上有名字吗
Is there a name on the gravestone?

506
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,750
没有
No.

507
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:26,360
是新的
It's new.

508
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,880
很干净
And clean.

509
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:32,070
在等着
And waiting.

510
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,890
这里完事了
We're finished here.

511
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,850
怎么样
Hey. How we doing?

512
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,350
不怎么样
In the black.

513
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,430
帽衫侠找到他的人了么
Did the Hood get his man?

514
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:05,860
我们不会再因为致幻剂惹上麻烦了
Well,we won't be having any
problems with Vertigo anymore.

515
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,080
Tommy 我很抱歉
Look,Tommy,I'm sorry.

516
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:12,340
我一直在记账
我记的存货的单子都在这
I've caught up the bookkeeping and all
my notes on the inventory are in there,

517
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,740
有我们用的供应商的清单
along with a list of
suppliers that we use.

518
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,300
好
Ok.

519
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,730
我不懂你为什么要跟我说这个
I don't see why you're telling me that.

520
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,700
这个俱乐部对我很重要
This club is important to me.

521
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,840
但对你来说就是个幌子
But for you it's just a front.

522
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,250
你想让我帮你保守秘密
帮你做你的帽衫侠
You want me to keep your secret,help
you be this thing you've become,

523
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,080
但你却看不到我所成为的人
but you refuse to see
me for what I've become.

524
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,820
我把这个看的有点太重了
I've got just a bit too
much self-respect for that.

525
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,040
我不干了
I quit.

526
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,890
吃饭吧
Dinner.

527
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,360
你还在弄呢
You're still doing that?

528
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:54,020
Fyers最好小心他那碗水
Fyers better be careful
with his bowls of water.

529
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:57,250
我们什么时候才能实际演习
When are we going to do actual training?

530
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,210
有个男孩被他爸爸放到少林寺
There once was a young boy
whose father dropped him off

531
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,550
去学功夫
at a shaolin monastery to study Kung Fu.

532
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,430
很好 讲上故事了
Good,a story.

533
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,960
一年以后 男孩回家
After a year,the boy
came to visit his family.

534
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,580
问他学到什么了的时候
男孩羞愧的低下头
When they asked what he'd learned,the
boy hung his head in shame.

535
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,440
和尚就让他拍桶里的水整整一年
All the monks had him do was
slap water in a barrel for a year.

536
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,280
我们没有一年时间
We don't have a year.

537
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,890
所以我希望你的训练方案能快一点
So I hope your training
regimen is a bit faster.

538
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:26,140
家里都不相信他
他就演示给他们看
The family didn't believe
him,so he showed them.

539
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:30,840
他举起手去拍他们吃饭的桌子
He raised his hand and hit
the table they were eating on.

540
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,370
桌子碎成两半
It broke in half.

541
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,070
我能击碎一个桌子吗
I'm gonna be able to break a table?

542
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,680
比那个还厉害
Better.

543
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,250
好吧
Ok.

544
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,500
拉弓
Draw the bow.

545
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,420
真见鬼
I'll be damned.

546
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,640
然后呢
What's next?

547
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,400
我们教你射箭
We teach you to shoot.

548
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,240
自己喝酒吗
Drinking alone?

549
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,570
没有 不再喝了
Oh. Well,no,not anymore.

550
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,200
就喝苏打水
Just soda?

551
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,760
酒保忘了放酒吗
Bartender forget the scotch?

552
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,590
我觉得我不需要那个了
I didn't really feel the need for it.

553
00:38:54,020 --> 00:39:01,810
那个死了的女孩
她的致幻剂是从一个同事那来的
So,um,the girl who died,it turns out
that she got her Vertigo from a co-worker.

554
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,680
看来我要跟你男朋友道歉了
Guess I owe your boyfriend an apology.

555
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,100
他有名字的 
He has a name,you know.

556
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,270
我就是不太习惯叫
Yeah,I just can't seem
to bring myself to use it.

557
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,740
起步阶段
Baby steps.

558
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:15,010
我又毁了咱们之间的关系吗
Did I screw things up between us again?

559
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,300
没有
No.

560
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,710
听着 我不是有意刁难Merlyn 好吗
Look,I really wasn't
looking to jam up Merlyn,ok?

561
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:27,520
我知道追查他的话 能让他犯错...
I knew by pursuing him that
I could throw a wrench in...

562
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:28,870
那你为什么这么做
Then why did you do it?

563
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:33,850
有证据的 Laurel 我必须遵循那个
There was evidence,Laurel,and
I had to follow it. I had to.

564
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,620
你妈妈是对的 你是对的
Look,your mom was right,you were right.

565
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,380
就像你说过 我和那个义务警员
我放不下的
Like you said about me and the
Vigilante,I can't let things go.

566
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:43,180
我销案了
I close cases,it's what I do.

567
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,660
其他人可不理解
Everyone else be damned.

568
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:50,850
也许你不喝酒代表着
你准备好去解决这件事了
Well,maybe the fact that there's no scotch
in there means you're ready to work on that.

569
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,870
人是可以改变的
People can change.

570
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,530
你挺我 
You had my back.

571
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,140
你需要我
You needed me.

572
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,650
Felicity告诉我你去哪了
Felicity told me where you were headed.

573
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,000
你还好吗
You ok?

574
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,380
我是杀手 记得吗
I'm the killer,remember?

575
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:21,670
我杀过人 Oliver
I've killed before,Oliver.

576
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:24,780
就那么一阵
It's just been a while.

577
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,940
如果你是杀手
为什么伯爵没有死
If you're the killer,why
isn't the Count down,too?

578
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:33,250
我知道你肯定很想除掉他
I'm sure it must have been tempting
to take him off the board for good.

579
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,570
人是可以改变的
People change.

580
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,640
像伯爵那样的人
People like the Count?

581
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,470
不 我是说我
No. I meant me.

582
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,800
要是不久前 我一定会杀了伯爵的
Not so long ago I would have
put that guy down for good,

583
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:52,920
但是看着他那样茫然 杀他毫无意义
but looking at him today all vacant...
There didn't seem to be a point.

584
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:58,610
但不是所有人都值得你的仁慈
But not everybody deserves mercy.

585
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,150
比如
For example.

586
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:07,000
我以为他不是你优先考虑的
I thought he wasn't a priority to you.

587
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,260
他是你优先考虑的
He's a priority to you.

588
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:15,600
你有两个未完成之事
You two have unfinished business.

589
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,270
我们从哪开始
Where do we start?

590
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:27,090
我不想再说"我早跟你说过"
但夜店经营得很不成功
I'd prefer we skip the I-told-you-sos,but
the nightclub wasn't really working out.

591
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:31,430
我想我需要一些更无聊 更安稳的事
I guess I need something
more boring,stable.

592
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:36,140
朝九晚五 回家吻Laurel这样的事
9:00 to 5:00,go home kiss
Laurel,that sort of thing.

593
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:43,670
我想说的是 我想要一份工作
I guess what I'm saying
is... I want a job.

594
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,770

1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,030
我叫Oliver Queen
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:09,120
被困在孤岛上5年以来
我只有一个目标 活下去
For five years,I was stranded on an
island,with only one goal: Survive.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,850
Oliver Queen还活着
Oliver Queen is alive.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,470
现在 我要完成我父亲的夙愿
Now I will fulfill my
father's dying wish...

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,260
根据他留给我的名单
to use the list of names he left me,

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,940
除掉那些毒害我城市的人
and bring down those who
are poisoning my city.

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,160
为了完成目标 我必须扮成别人
To do this,I must become someone else.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,390
我必须掩盖身份
I must become something else.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,840
绿箭侠 前情提要
 
10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,150
所以你见到帽衫男了
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,110
他之前联系过我
So you met up with the Hood guy? He's contacted me before.


11
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,830
你这个杀人凶手
You're a murderer.

12
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,460
你曾是我这辈子最好的朋友
可现在我完全不懂你了
You were my best friend in life,but
now it's like I don't even know you.

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,380
我不干了
I quit.

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,540
听着 Lyla Lawton是个危险人物
Listen,Lyla,Lawton is
a very dangerous man.

15
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,530
你了解他吗
What do you know about him?

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,860
这些足以帮你查出谁指使死亡射手了
That's everything you need to locate
who's giving Deadshot his targets.

17
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,760
这个Lawton踢了他的狗还是怎么了
This Lawton kick his dog or something?

18
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:48,990
他杀了他哥哥
He killed his brother.

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,260
知道他逍遥法外 我就不得安宁
I can't move on with my life
knowing that he's still out there.

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,230
我以为你能懂我
I thought if anybody
got that it'd be you.

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,390
你们还有恩怨未了
You two have unfinished business.

22
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,660
从哪里下手
Where do we start?

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,620
感觉好点了吗
You feel better?

24
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,470
干掉死亡射手我就能好了
I'll feel better once we end Deadshot.

25
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,060
欢迎来德国 大使先生
Welcome to Germany,Mr. Ambassador.

26
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,050
Henrik 气色不错呀
Henrik,you're looking great.

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,530
在更多女人丧夫前 我们得干掉他
We have to end this guy before he
makes any more widows out of wives.

28
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,770
我们当然要
We will.

29
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,010
Diggle 我们会阻止他的
Diggle,we'll stop him.

30
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,870
我答应过你打倒他 我决不食言
I promised you I'd help take
him down,and I keep my promises,

31
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,050
可他在另一块大陆上
but he's on another continent.

32
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,280
现在回来了
Not anymore.

33
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,530
我觉得追踪超人类研究组
I thought it would be helpful
to track A.R.G.U.S' manhunt

34
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:05,240
有助于追捕死亡射手Floyd Lawton
所以我破译了他们的通讯记录
for Floyd Lawton aka Deadshot,so I
decrypted their communication logs.

35
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,530
就是说 我入侵了一个联邦机构
Which means,I just Which kind of makes
hacked a federal agency. 

36
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,310
弄得我有点像网络恐怖分子了
me a cyber-terrorist,

37
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,420
糟糕 我可不适合关塔那摩湾监狱
which is bad because I really don't see
myself fitting in well at Guantanamo Bay.

38
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,540
别担心 Felicity 
他们不会把金发美女关进去的
Don't worry,Felicity,they
don't send blondes there.

39
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,780
我这发色其实是染的
I dye it,actually.

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,580
我保守了你的秘密...
I keep your secret...

41
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,490
嘿 有什么发现
Hey,what'd you find?

42
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,750
死亡射手会在斯特林市和一潜在客户见面
Deadshot is scheduled to meet with a
potential new client here in Starling City.

43
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,750
可这次交易是假的
Except the potential contract is bogus.

44
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,770
你朋友Lyla设了陷 Lawton上钩了
 
46
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,020
太好了 我去跟Lyla谈
看看能不能套出细节
Your friend Lyla is setting a
trap for him. Lawton took the bait.

45
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,740
好 我得去和Laurel吃午饭了
Great,I'll talk to Lyla,see Good. I've got to
if I can suss out any details. have lunch with Laurel.

46
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,180
你何时成了她的御用午餐伴
So when did you become,uh,lunch
dates with Laurel?

47
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,250
我们只是...只是朋友
Look,we're just... We're friends.

48
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,590
- 是朋友很好啊
- 但是
- Friends are good.
- But?

49
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,060
你结交朋友能别那么复杂吗
她是你的前女友呢
Couldn't you be friends with someone
less complicated than your ex-girlfriend,

50
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,710
还是你前好友的现任女友
who's your ex-best
friend's current girlfriend?

51
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,560
我穿帽衫杀罪犯
I wear a hood and I put
arrows into criminals,

52
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,740
即使情况复杂 我也能顺利过关
so when it comes to
complexity... I grade on a curve.

53
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,360
营救你爸爸 阻止Fyers
并不像公园散步那么简单
Rescuing your father and stopping Fyers
is not going to be some walk in the park.

54
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,800
他们不会让我们在军营里晃荡的
They're not going to allow us to
just stroll on into their camp.

55
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,270
所以我们需要掩护
Which is why we'll need cover.

56
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,940
若我俩都要进敌营 谁来掩护
If both of us are
infiltrating,who'll provide that?

57
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,780
他来
He will.

58
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,490
我吗
Me?

59
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,440
那冲锋枪进水了
The assault rifle is flushed.

60
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,430
没用了
It's useless.

61
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,390
我们有弓箭
We have a bow,arrows.

62
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,610
可没人会用
And no one capable of shooting them.

63
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,610
无意冒犯啊 小鬼
No offense,kid.

64
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,610
你抢了我的台词
I was going to say the same thing.

65
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,900
我觉得大家应该多花点时间制定计划
I think we should be spending
our time trying to devise a plan,

66
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,850
而不是缩小那本就一线的生机
not lower our already
slim chances of survival.

67
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,650
他会在日落前学会射箭
He'll hit his mark by sundown.

68
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,600
如果学不会 就听你的
If not,we'll do it your way.

69
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,450
Lyla
Lyla!

70
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,400
什么事 Johnnie
What is it,Johnnie?

71
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,810
就来看看对死亡射手的调查
Just came by to see how things were
going on your Deadshot investigation.

72
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,870
有什么进展吗
Anything new come up?

73
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,320
还真有
Funnily enough,it did.

74
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,250
我本来很好奇 你一个保镖
I was curious why you,a bodyguard,

75
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,510
为何如此执着于抓捕臭名昭著的杀手
were so keen on taking down
such a high profile assassin,

76
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,440
所以我调查了Lawton
so I did some reading up on Lawton.

77
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,120
Lyla 听我说...
Lyla,listen...

78
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,950
你以为我查不出他是你杀兄仇人吗
Did you really think I wouldn't
find out that he killed your brother?

79
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,860
你一直在利用我
That you were using me...me!

80
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,140
为什么 引他出来 手刃仇敌吗
To what? Draw him into the open so
you could take him down yourself?

81
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,100
我不会让你利用我的人来报仇雪恨的
I will not let you use my
agency to settle your blood feud.

82
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,290
Lyla 这人必须死
Lyla... I need to see this guy in a bag.

83
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,840
你应该懂我
You of all people should get that.

84
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,640
听清楚 离Lawton远点 Johnnie
再插手 就别怪我抓你了
Get this...stay away from Lawton,Johnnie,or
so help me,I will have you arrested.

85
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,230
不信我说到做到吗
You doubt me?

86
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,800
我不敢
Never have.

87
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,840
收到我的语音信息了吗
Did you get my voicemail?

88
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,600
没
No.

89
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,420
情况有点失控了 连着开了好几个会
Things got a little crazy around
here... back to back meetings...

90
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,590
真是抱歉 下次再一起吃饭吧
I am so sorry,rain check?

91
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,280
没事
Sure.

92
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,210
我正好夜店那边有好多文件要看
I could definitely catch
up on some club paperwork.

93
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,410
Tommy一走 很多事就拖着了
We're way behind since Tommy left.

94
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,320
我还是很惊讶 他居然去帮Malcolm了
I'm still shocked that he
went to go work for Malcolm.

95
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,450
你肯让他去 真是太善解人意了
You know,you were really understanding
to let him take this opportunity.

96
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,000
Tommy说你同意了
Tommy said you were cool with it.

97
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,050
何乐不为呢 他跟你一样 是我朋友
Why wouldn't I be? He's
my friend. Like you.

98
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,180
对不起  我们来早了吗
I'm sorry,are we early?

99
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,440
没 没有
No,not at all.

100
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,420
Oliver 这是Eric Moore 他妻子Nancy
Uh,Oliver,this is Eric
Moore and his wife,Nancy.

101
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,920
我要帮他们准备明天的口供
I'm prepping them for a
deposition for tomorrow.

102
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,980
这应该就是你们的保镖吧
And this must be your bodyguard?

103
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,620
他是我们儿子 Taylor
This is our son,Taylor.

104
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,990
她是很棒的律师
Well,you are in very capable hands.

105
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,220
很高兴见到你们
It was nice to meet you.

106
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,170
Eric Nancy 你们确定准备好了吗
Eric,Nancy,I want to make sure
that you guys are up for this.

107
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,580
Edward Rasmus不好对付
Edward Rasmus isn't known
for playing with kid gloves,

108
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,580
前路困难重重啊
so this could get rough.

109
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,780
我们的毕生积蓄都投资给Rasmus
他却欺骗我们
We invested our entire life
savings with Rasmus and he stole it.

110
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,450
包括我们的退休金
Our retirement.

111
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,020
Taylor上大学的钱
Taylor's college fund.

112
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,740
他偷了我们的未来 Lance小姐
He stole our future,Ms. Lance.

113
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,280
我们想要回来
We want it back.

114
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,000
那好 就去要回来吧
Well,then let's go get it.

115
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,090
谁啊
Hello?

116
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,230
Moore先生 Lance小姐有些文件给你
Mr. Moore? I have some documents for you

117
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,300
是关于明天的口供
from Ms. Lance related
to tomorrow's deposition.

118
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,170
你家真漂亮
What a nice home you have here.

119
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,730
在这你可以真切地感受到爱
You can really... Feel the love.

120
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,070
弄这么乱 真抱歉
Sorry about the mess.

121
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,650
弄得像入室抢劫 会好一点
This works better if it
looks like a break-in.

122
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,160
- 搞定了吗
- 那对夫妻搞定了
- Is it done?
- The parents,yes.

123
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,170
但恐怕有变数 那小孩跑了
I'm afraid there's been a
variable. The child got away.

124
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,110
跑了
Got away?

125
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,450
他看见你了吗
Did he see you?

126
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,780
没 Rasmus先生
No,Mr. Rasmus.

127
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:31,280
他要看见谁 那就是送他上西天了
What he saw was the face of the man
who will reunite him with his parents.

128
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,520
斯特林市将举办今年的灯展
Starling City is expected to be host of
this year's Festival of Lights exhibition.

129
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,650
另一则消息 Moore夫妇的尸体
在今早被发现
In other news,the bodies of Mr. and
Mrs. Moore were found early this morning.

130
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,480
法律援助所的Laurel Lance代表这对夫妇
The couple were being represented

00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,270
这不是你的错 Laurel
你不该为此自责
This isn't your fault,Laurel,you
shouldn't feel guilty.

137
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,870
我没自责 我是生气
I don't feel guilty. I'm angry.

138
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,920
这不是随便的入室抢劫
This wasn't some random break-in.

139
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,990
Edward Rasmus有参与 我知道
Edward Rasmus is involved,I know it.

140
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,570
听着 我们的人在调查此事
Ok,listen,our guys
are looking into this.

141
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,000
你不要涉入此事 好吗
But you need to stay out of it,ok?

142
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,020
因为如果Rasmus是幕后推手
他可不是闹着玩玩
Because if Rasmus is behind
this,he's clearly not messing around.

143
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,380
你们要不要和Taylor道别一下
Uh... If you'd like to
say good-bye to Taylor,

144
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,880
我要带他去托管所了
I will be taking him
over to child services.

145
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,790
他没别的家人吗
Doesn't he have any other family?

146
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,830
祖父母在墨尔本
Grandparents are in Melbourne.

147
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,140
我在联系他们 联系上之前
We're tracking them down,but until then,

148
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,620
他就先在美国待着
he's going to be a
temporary ward of the state.

149
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,360
我可以带着他
He can stay with me.

150
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,110
作为他的律师
我任命自己为临时监护人
As his attorney,I am assigning
myself temporary guardianship.

151
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,440
你还是需要法院指令
You'd still need a judge's order.

152
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,910
一小时后给你
I'll have it to you in an hour.

153
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,390
随你吧
Well,have it your way.

154
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,380
我去把巡逻车停在你家外
Ok,look,I'm going to park a
patrol car outside your place.

155
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,890
好
Fine.

156
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,280
你照顾他们 行吗
And you... You look
after them,all right?

157
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,320
反正我常在你女儿家过夜
I spend most nights at
your daughter's anyways.

158
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,710
可能现在说这个不合适
There was probably a better
time to tell you that.

159
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,000
可能是
Probably not.

160
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,070
你要来住我家啦 好吗
Hey,come stay in my house,ok?

161
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,130
- 你在这干嘛
- 我听说发生的事了
- What are you doing here?
- I heard what happened.

162
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,040
我想确保Laurel没事
I just wanted to make
sure Laurel was ok.

163
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,610
打电话来就好
You could have just called.

164
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,960
我昨天见到Laurel的客户
和他们儿子了 我很难过
I met Laurel's clients and their
son yesterday and I felt badly.

165
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,480
你见到他们了
You met them?

166
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,110
我接Laurel去吃午餐时
Yeah,when I was picking
up Laurel for lunch...

167
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,180
她没跟你说
Which she didn't tell you about.

168
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,630
说什么
Tell you what?

169
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,910
没事
Nothing.

170
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,720
安顿好了
It's settled.

171
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,350
Taylor今晚和我们回家
Taylor's coming home with us tonight.

172
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,910
- 要是你需要什么...
- 我们很好
- Well,if you need anything...
- we're fine.

173
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,780
好吧
Ok.

174
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,200
我们真该走了
We should really get going.

175
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,340
走吧
Here.

176
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,480
瞄准
Set your sight.

177
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,030
射树
Hit the tree.

178
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,310
没射准那棵树
Probably hit a tree.

179
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,950
瞄准
Set your sight.

180
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,620
射树
Hit the tree.

181
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,370
稳住瞄准点
Steady your anchor point.

182
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,990
我希望你们走得
离教他成为神射手更近了
I hope you're getting closer... At
teaching him how to be a better marksman.

183
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,220
倒不是我们就指着这活呢
It's not as though our lives
depend on it or anything.

184
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,060
- 再试次
- 好
- Try again.
- Ok.

185
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,950
这是什么
What's this?

186
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,340
Lyla为死亡射手设埋伏的任务档案
Lyla's mission profile on the
trap they've set for Deadshot.

187
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,800
Lawton被安排见他的新雇员
明晚八点拿到任务
Lawton is set to meet his new employer
and get his assignment tomorrow at 8 pm.

188
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,530
只是 他的新雇员...会是探员
Only,his new employer...
Will be an A.R.G.U.S. agent.

189
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:11,560
Lyla会带队趁虚而入 逮捕他
Lyla will then swoop in
with her team and arrest him.

190
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,710
你想让Lawton被捕吗
Do you want Lawton arrested?

191
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,710
不想
No.

192
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,500
那明晚 我们
把Floyd Lawton的名从名单上划掉
Then tomorrow night,we cross
Floyd Lawton's name off your list.

193
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,560
还有些东西要查下
There is something else
we need to look into.

194
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,540
两位Laurel的客户昨晚被害
Two of Laurel's clients
were murdered last night.

195
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,620
他们7岁的儿子死里逃生
Their seven-year-old
son barely escaped.

196
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,070
真是糟
That's terrible.

197
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,400
Edward Rasmus
那个Laurel带上法庭的理财顾问
Edward Rasmus,the financial
advisor Laurel was taking to court,

198
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,650
可能没开枪 但他可能计划了抢劫
may not have pulled the trigger,but
he probably called in the hit.

199
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,930
我想让你调查他的公司账户
通话记录
I want you to get into his
corporate accounts,phone records,

200
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,170
所以与犯罪有关的
anything that may link
him to the killer,ok?

201
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,920
你去哪
Where are you going?

202
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,740
Laurel家
Laurel's.

203
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,270
又是朋友聚会吗
Another friendly meal?

204
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,570
- 我女儿在她住处还安全吗
- 目前来说是 没有异常
- My daughter is secure at her place?
- So far,all quiet...

205
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,730
要是有动作就告诉我
All right,let me know
if there is any movement.

206
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,560
我现在就过去
I'm heading over there right now.

207
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,260
你这次偷了什么
What did you steal this time?

208
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,980
- 你有时间吗
- 没
- You got a minute?
- No.

209
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,380
是有关帽衫侠的事
It's about the Hood.

210
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,480
你被绑架后 我的人地铁上发现你时
When my men found you on that
subway car after you were kidnapped,

211
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,690
你说你不知道义务警员的事
you told them you didn't know
anything about the vigilante.

212
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,080
你有什么忘说了吗
So there's something
you forgot to tell them?

213
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,390
没有
No.

214
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,160
我只是像大家一样想看他被绳之于法
I just want to see him brought
to justice like everyone else.

215
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,600
别担心 孩子 我们会抓住他的
Don't worry,kid. We'll get him.

216
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,820
可别给个理由让我抓你
Just keep making sure I don't
have a reason to get you.

217
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,930
Taylor 亲爱的
Taylor? Sweetheart?

218
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,780
你饿了吗
Are you hungry?

219
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,530
我做奶酪通心粉一绝哦
You know,I make the world's
best macaroni and cheese.

220
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,100
她只会做这个
It's the only thing
she knows how to make.

221
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,870
我想爸爸妈妈
I miss my mom and dad.

222
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:09,380
我像你这个年龄时
我妈在出门前给我掖好被子
When I was your age,my mom tucked me
into bed that night before going out.

223
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:14,350
接下来就是警察来了
Then the next thing I knew,there
was a police officer at my door.

224
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:20,780
他说她走了 我再也见不到她了
但你知道吗
He said that she was gone and that I would
never see her again. But you know what?

225
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,210
他错了
He was wrong.

226
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,870
你见到她了
You saw her?

227
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,320
我每闭上眼 就能见到她
Every time I close
my eyes,I can see her.

228
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,080
每晚入睡 都在梦乡中见到她
Every time I go to bed,I
see her in my dreams.

229
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,520
真的吗
Really?

230
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,680
嗯
Yeah.

231
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,430
试试 闭上眼
Now try it,close your eyes.

232
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,410
我看到他们了
I see them.

233
00:13:51,840 --> 00:14:00,350
你伤心或难过的时候
记住他们都会在你身边
Whenever you are sad,or scared,just
remember that they will always be there.

234
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,300
你总是给我惊喜 Merlyn
You constantly surprise me,Merlyn.

235
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,860
我去开
I'll get it.

236
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,050
Lance小姐
Ms. Lance?

237
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,010
Kessel上尉 斯特林城警察
Lieutenant Kessel,SCPD.

238
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,340
你爸让我来看看
Your dad asked me to check in.

239
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,140
上尉 你能出示你的警徽吗
Lieutenant,can you hold your
badge up to the door,please?

240
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,550
好
Ok,great.

241
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,830
等一下
Just one sec.

242
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,220
什么
What?

243
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,800
他警徽上的工号是0开头
上尉的工号是1开头...
His badge number begins with a zero,Lieutenant's
badge numbers begin with a one...

244
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,310
是警徽穿帮了 对吧
It was the badge that
gave me away,right?

245
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,080
我爸是警察
You know,my father's a cop.

246
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,310
他可不光教了我这些
And that's not all he taught me.

247
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,630
你该搬家了
I'm feeling like it might
be time for you to move.

248
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,150
爸 Rasmus雇的人不杀我不会罢休
Dad,whoever Rasmus hired is going to
keep coming until he finishes the job,

249
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,720
不然Rasmus也会再雇人来杀我
otherwise Rasmus will just
hire someone else who will.

250
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,020
听着 我想对你们仨
立即实行保护性监禁
Ok,listen,I want the three of you
in protective custody immediately,

251
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,020
别犹豫了
and don't even think about it.

252
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,580
他杀了我两个手下
He killed two of my men.

253
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,950
帽衫侠刚刚救了我们
The Hood just saved our lives.

254
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,830
我们能相信他
We can trust him.

255
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,600
他不会让我出事的
He won't let anything happen to me.

256
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:29,170
即使我想让他全天候保护你
Even if I was comfortable with the
idea of him watching over you 24/7,

257
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:34,050
当然我不想 我觉得他有更重要的事要做
which I'm not,something tells
me he's got better things to do.

258
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,770
那Oliver呢
What about Oliver?

259
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,300
你还有别的朋友叫Oliver吗
Sorry,you got another
friend named Oliver?

260
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,200
Queen一家比总统安保措施还多
The Queens have more
security than the President.

261
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,580
哪里都有监控 各处都有保镖
They've got cameras
everywhere,bodyguards in every wing,

262
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,720
进出需要理由
and no one goes in or out
without being accounted for.

263
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,680
我们都知道什么对Laurel最好
We both only want what
is best for Laurel.

264
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,750
眼下是在Oliver身边
And right now that is
to stay close to Oliver.

265
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,340
相信我
Trust me.

266
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,670
这是Robbins先生
This is Mr. Robbins.

267
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,600
你去哪 他去哪
Where you go,he goes.

268
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,130
我会保护好你的 Lance小姐
You'll be very well protected,Ms. Lance.

269
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,000
谢谢
Thank you.

270
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,650
我亲自挑选了这些保镖
I hand-selected these men myself.

271
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,050
房子和院子都很安全
The house and the grounds
are completely secure.

272
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,710
当自己家 不用拘束
Please make yourself at home.

273
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,690
你就是Taylor吧
You must be Taylor.

274
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,990
我告诉你好吃的曲奇藏哪了 好不好呀
How about I show you where
I hide the good cookies?

275
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,940
Queen先生 等你准备好了
Mr. Queen,whenever you're ready,

276
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,600
我带你去下一个地方
I can take you to your
next appointment,sir.

277
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,540
去见Lawton吗
The Lawton meeting?

278
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,950
是的
Yes.

279
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,390
我得先去趟俱乐部 拿一下我的外套
I just need to swing by the
club and pick up my good suit.

280
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,080
你在那里等我吧
So,I'll meet you there.

281
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,500
好的 
Of course,sir.

282
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,380
你要出门吗
You're leaving?

283
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,290
我还有其他事要处理 很重要
There's something else I need
to take care of. It's important.

284
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,450
比这儿的事还重要吗
More important than
what's going on here?

285
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,510
无意冒犯
No offense to Oliver,

286
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,660
但我认为比起Oliver
我们更需要Robbins先生和他的手下
but I think we need Mr. Robbins
and his men more than him.

287
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,820
你是我们来这的原因 
相信我 我很不乐意承认这一点
You are the reason why we're here,and
trust me,that wasn't easy to admit.

288
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,540
你们会没事的
You'll be fine.

289
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,110
我保证
I promise.

290
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,300
你知道吗 嚼东西会缓解压力
You know,chewing might help.

291
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,700
你觉得不好吃吗
Not dainty enough for you? 

292
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,790
不要忘了
I could eat you under
the table,Roy Harper.

293
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,910
我可以偷偷把你吃了 Roy Harper
Don't forget that.

294
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,990
所有小组注意 发生爆炸
斯特林市港口发生爆炸
 
297
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:36,990
什么声音
All units,code 10-80.
Starling City port,10-80...

295
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:40,420
怀疑义务警员所为 请求支援
What is that? Suspected vigilante
 activity,requesting all available units.

296
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,920
你口袋里有警方的对讲机吗
Do you have a police
radio in your pocket?

297
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,130
没有 很高兴见到你
No,I'm just happy to see you.

298
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,780
我得走了
Got to run.

299
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,810
我想你拿了我的东西
I think you've got
something that belongs to me.

300
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,880
你设下这个局 只是为了拿回对讲机吗
You set this up,just
to get your radio back?

301
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,920
对 我很喜欢那个对讲机
Well... I do love that radio.

302
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,350
快点
Come on.

303
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,700
我把广场的卫星俯视图发到你手机上了
I'm uploading a satellite overview
of the Plaza to your phone...

304
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,690
多谢 但是我很熟悉那个地方
Thanks,but I know the place...

305
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,330
Dig对你该藏的位置很上心
Dig was pretty specific about
where you should perch...

306
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,010
你知道的 那样能给Lawton致命一击
you know,what position gives
you the best shot at Lawton.

307
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,190
我这样认为
I think.

308
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,850
他说了很多军事术语
He used a lot of military jargon.

309
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,940
你要反狙击
So you're sniping a sniper.

310
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,560
听上去有点讽刺 是吧
Kind of ironic,don't you think?

311
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,940
我没有
Me neither.

312
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:47,930
这是什么
What's that?

313
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,170
我用远程木马在网上查找Edward Rasmus
I had a remote access trojan scouring
the Internet for Edward Rasmus.

314
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,190
他的名字突然出现在航空公司名单上
8：15的飞机去上海
His name just popped up on a
flight manifest,8:15 to Shanghai...

315
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,080
- 他想逃跑
- 很好 不是吗
- He's running.
- That's good,right?

316
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,660
如果他跑了 
就不会再追杀Laurel和那孩子
If he's leaving town,he won't be
after Laurel and the child anymore.

317
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:07,400
不过你要是想阻止他 现在是最好的机会
But if you did want to stop
him,looks like it's now or never.

318
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,600
死亡射手还是Rasmus... 你自己选
Deadshot or Rasmus... Your choice.

319
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,810
诱捕1队 这里是先头人员
Trap one,this is Harbinger.

320
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,870
等Lawton进去接头
Wait for Lawton to
enter and make contact.

321
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,510
我们把他拿下
Then we'll take him down.

322
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,660
该死 Oliver
Damn it,Oliver...

323
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,040
等法律援助协会的风波平息后
Just until this CNRI mess dies down.

324
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:08,670
如果没有搞定 去中国的好处是
吃馄饨而且不用引渡条款
And if it doesn't,two best things about
China... wontons and no extradition treaty.

325
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:12,580
嘿 我想我有花钱让你不要停红灯
Hey,hey,I thought I was paying
you extra not to stop at the reds.

326
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,860
诱捕1队 可疑目标出现
Trap one,possible target acquisition.

327
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,370
准备好
Get ready.

328
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,180
退下
Stand down.

329
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,920
可能Lawton没有上钩
Maybe Lawton didn't
take the bait after all.

330
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,120
我们已经暴露 快掩护
We're blown! Take cover!

331
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,750
跪下 跪下
On your knees. On your knees.

332
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,510
把手放在头后面
Hands behind your head.

333
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,530
隔1英里远我就看到你过来了
I saw you coming a mile away.

334
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,620
多谢替我转移视线
Thanks for tipping me off.

335
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,260
我要杀了你 为Andy报仇
I'll kill you for what you did to Andy.

336
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,830
要不是因为没人付钱 我现在就杀了你
I'd be pulling these triggers right
now,except there's nobody paying me.

337
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:20,100
这儿给你留着位置 就在你哥哥旁边
There's space for you right
here,right next to your brother.

338
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,920
你最好记住了
You'd do best to remember that.

339
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,390
发生什么了
What happened?

340
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,000
你没有出现 事情进展不是很顺利
You didn't show,things didn't go well.

341
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,400
Rasmus要逃跑 我得权衡重要性
Rasmus was skipping town...
And I had to reprioritize.

342
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,380
因为你的权衡 4名警员死了 Oliver
Thanks to your new priorities
four agents are dead,Oliver.

343
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:04,190
你本可以阻止他 杀了这个疯子
You could have stopped this guy,ended
this maniac once and for all.

344
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,020
Lawton逃了吗
Lawton got away?

345
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:13,090
你真的认为被称为"死亡射手"的人
会乖乖束手就擒吗
You seriously think a man who goes by the
name "Deadshot" was going down without a fight?

346
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,250
我当时需要你 伙计
I needed you there,man.

347
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,060
Taylor Moore需要我 Diggle
Taylor Moore was relying on me,Diggle.

348
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:21,080
这跟那个孩子无关 
他在戒备森严的房子里很安全
But this was never about that kid,he is
safe under armed security at your house.

349
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,150
这是为了Laurel
This is about Laurel.

350
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,560
Diggle 我必须做个选择
Diggle,I made a choice.

351
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,060
我知道
I know.

352
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,750
你选了Laurel
You chose Laurel.

353
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,660
总是她
Always her.

354
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,740
其他人都该死
Everybody else be damned.

355
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,700
有什么想说的 Felicity
Something to say,Felicity?

356
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,600
你不想听的
Nothing you want to hear.

357
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,520
再试试
Try again.

358
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,980
你想得太多了
You're thinking too much.

359
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,040
从没有人这么说过我
Nobody ever accused me of that before.

360
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,480
炫耀
Show-off.

361
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:27,120
看见远处的目标 感受风的变化
I see my target in the distance,I
feel the variation in the wind,

362
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:31,220
感觉弦拉紧了 放手
I hear the bowstring
tighten... And I let go.

363
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,470
相信你的感觉 不要多想
Give in to your senses... Don't think.

364
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,960
你说的对 这绝对不合时宜
You're right,this is definitively
not the time or place...

365
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:04,980
不...不 只是...因为某人
No,it's...no,it's just
there's,uh... Someone.

366
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:09,740
事情很复杂 但是我不能
And it's a mile past
complicated,but I can't.

367
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,110
她知道你有多爱她吗
Does she know how much you love her?

368
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,790
我想她现在不知道
I suspect right now she doesn't.

369
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,650
但是一旦我回家了 她会知道的
But as soon as I'm home,she will.

370
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,690
那天晚上你太漂亮了
You looked so beautiful that night.

371
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:36,030
我记得Oliver告诉我过
I remember Oliver telling me
once that he wished your father

372
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,820
他希望你父亲能够 
允许他多拜访你们家
would let him come over
to your house more often.

373
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:44,620
在那里他更能找到自我
而不是Robert Queen的儿子 
That being there made him feel less like
Robert Queen's son and more like himself.

374
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,560
我喜欢看到在你身边的他
I liked who my son was
when he was around you.

375
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,840
谢谢
Thank you.

376
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,220
警方刚刚来电
The police just called.

377
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,520
Edward Rasmus已经被捕
Edward Rasmus was arrested.

378
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,730
真的吗 发生什么了
Really? What happened?

379
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,840
显然他承认了一切
Apparently he confessed to everything.

380
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:06,900
他会在狱中呆很久 再也不能伤害任何人
He's going to go to prison for a long time
and won't be able to hurt anyone ever again.

381
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,330
他为什么会认罪呢
Why would he confess?

382
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,240
义务警员帮了忙
The vigilante was involved.

383
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,060
很好
Good for him.

384
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,140
我想事情结束了
So,I guess it's over.

385
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,660
是
Yes...Yeah.

386
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,160
太好了 我去把Taylor叫醒
Great,I'll go wake up Taylor...

387
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,890
别 Tommy 他在睡觉 
这几天他经历了太多
No,Tommy,please. He's
sleeping,he's been through a lot.

388
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,280
很欢迎你们都住下
Now you all are welcome to stay.

389
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,900
我们绝对有足够的房间
We certainly have enough room.

390
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,600
听你的
It's your call.

391
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,760
多谢 Queen夫人
Thank you,Mrs. Queen.

392
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,230
我想那我们就住下吧
I guess we'll stay,then.

393
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,610
好的
Good.

394
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,840
你的律师到了
Your lawyer's here.

395
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,100
我们得商量下怎么收场
I'd like to discuss loose ends.

396
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,560
你没收到我的信息吗
You didn't get my message?

397
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,830
不要管Moore家的孩子了
Forget about the Moore boy.

398
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:11,050
我已经认罪了 那个帽衫怪物说 
我要是不认罪就杀了我
I've already confessed,that freakshow in
a hood told me he'd kill me if I didn't.

399
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,130
我们得让这次见面看起来像模像样
We need to make this
meeting appear legitimate.

400
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,550
律师该做的
Lawyer stuff.

401
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,770
签这里
Sign here,please.

402
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,340
你听清楚了吗 不要管那个孩子了
Am I clear? You leave the boy alone.

403
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,620
我也乐意放他一条生路
可他见过我的脸
I wish I could,but he's seen my face.

404
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,830
就像你一样
Just like you.

405
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,350
如果你按压小臂上的这块皮肤
就像这样
If you put pressure in just the
right areas above the forearm,

406
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:38,900
内侧前臂静脉中会形成塞栓
like I did to you,an embolism will
form in the medial antebrachial vein.

407
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:43,380
大概十五秒之后 当气穴到达你的心脏
When the air pocket reaches your
heart in,give or take,fifteen seconds,

408
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:47,460
你就会安然无痛地死去
you'll die. It's relatively painless.

409
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,600
我这么做并非是针对你
Nothing personal.

410
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,450
我们完事了
We're done here!

411
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:18,550
打扰一下 我在找我男朋友
他是这的常客
Excuse me,hi,I'm looking for my
boyfriend,he's kind of a regular around here.

412
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:22,410
锐利的蓝眼睛 或许偷了个警员对讲机
Piercing blue eyes,and may or may
not have stolen a police radio.

413
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,050
哦 他就在你身后
Yeah,that's him. Behind you.

414
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,260
你看起来气色不错啊
Well,that's a nice look.

415
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:36,480
- 你脑子里到底在想什么啊
- 如果这不是正在上演非凡兄弟组...
- What were you thinking?
- Well,if it isn't the wonder twins...

416
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,660
他很抱歉偷了对讲机
He's very sorry for stealing the radio,

417
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,480
他再也不会给你们找麻烦
或者从这偷东西了
and he won't ever bug you or steal
anything from you guys ever again.

418
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,090
你们俩 跟我过来
Both of you. Come with me.

419
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,980
你带我们来这干什么
What are we doing here?

420
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,130
既然你男友对帽衫男这么感兴趣
Well,your boyfriend is
so interested in the Hood,

421
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,630
我猜他会想见见帽衫男的老熟人
I thought he might like to meet someone
else who already made his acquaintance.

422
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,860
哦 天哪...
Oh,God...

423
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,340
他是谁
Who was he?

424
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:07,310
事实上 你活着的时候有名字
Well,that's the thing. When
you're alive,you get a name.

425
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,930
等你在这挺尸的时候 就只剩个编号了
When you wind up down
here,you get a number.

426
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,090
他是26号
Meet 26.

427
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:18,660
自打你那位帽衫男哥们开始独自为战
See,your pal the Hood,he's
already sent 26 stiffs down here

428
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,640
他已经给这添了26具尸体了
since he started his
little one-man... War.

429
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,680
- 或许是因为这人该死
- 或许确是如此
- Maybe this guy deserved it.
- Maybe he did.

430
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:29,150
但他不该用这种方式伸张正义
But that's not how justice works.

431
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:33,840
那位义务警员无需在意
除他自己之外的任何人
You see,the vigilante,he doesn't
have to answer to anyone but himself,

432
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,760
任何人若是有此等权力都是件危险的事
and that's a very dangerous
power to give to any one man.

433
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,370
他救了我一命
He saved my life.

434
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,700
你怎么知道他明天不会又随手把你干掉
And how do you know tomorrow
he won't just as easily take it?

435
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,390
出去吧
Get out of here.

436
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,400
走吧
Let's go.

437
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,370
他现在安全了 Laurel
He's safe now,Laurel.

438
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,840
但前路坎坷
With a hard road ahead of him.

439
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,670
他能遇到你真是太幸运了
Well,he's lucky to have you in his life.

440
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,370
我对这体会感同身受
I know the feeling.

441
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:40,460
你刚回来的时候 我觉得你还是老样子
When you first got home,I didn't
think that you changed much.

442
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:46,720
但你的确变了... 变得更好了
But you have,and... It's nice to see.

443
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,800
谢谢
Thank you.

444
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,330
有辆货车来送东西给Lance小姐
身份已查对无误
I have a delivery van coming in
for Ms. Lance,his I.D. checks out.

445
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,390
多谢提醒
Thanks for the heads up.

446
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,290
这是给Lance小姐的
For...Ms. Lance.

447
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,600
多么漂亮的家啊
What a beautiful home.

448
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,400
却弥漫着一股痛苦的气息
Such pain here.

449
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,720
地板散发出一种失意和悔恨的味道...
A sense of loss and regret,you can
feel it,down to the wood paneling...

450
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,360
Tommy... 你俩进来陪着Taylor吧
Tommy... Can you two
stay here with Taylor?

451
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,840
- 你要去哪
- 这老房子总跳闸
- Where are you going?
- It's an old house,fuses blow all the time,

452
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,160
应该没事 进来吧... 好的
it's probably nothing,just
please... Come on. Ok.

453
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,270
他在这
He's here.

454
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,210
那孩子在哪
Where's the child?

455
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:32,150
这房子太大了 我可不想挨个房间搜查
This house is quite large and I don't
particularly care to check every room.

456
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,770
很好
Very well.

457
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,780
敬酒不吃吃罚酒
Have it your way.

458
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,980
- Laurel... Laurel 别去...
- 不 Ollie还在外面
- Laurel... Laurel,don't...
- No,Ollie is still out there.

459
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,370
你在那岛上究竟经历了什么
What happened to you on that island?

460
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,510
你很快就会知道了
You're about to find out.

461
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,900
被拨火棍捅死
Death by poker.

462
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,140
这死法倒是很新奇
That's a new one.

463
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,800
他原本要开枪打我
He was going to shoot me.

464
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:27,830
然后... Robbins先生抓起拨火棍...
救了我一命
And then,uh,mister... Robbins,he
grabbed the poker and... saved my life.

465
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,750
Robbins先生才是真英雄
Mr. Robbins was a real hero.

466
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,630
要是没有他 我们早就都没命了
If it weren't for him,we'd all be dead.

467
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,950
好了 我知道该怎么写案件报告了
I've got enough details for my report.

468
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,610
我这就撤走我的人
I'll clear my boys out of here.

469
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,760
走吧
Let's go.

470
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,640
你还爱她 对吧
You still love her. Don't you?

471
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,050
我的感受并不重要
It doesn't matter how I feel.

472
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:10,480
因为我的所作所为...
我永远不可能和她在一起
Because of what I do...
I could never be with her.

473
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,340
你用不着害怕
You see,you don't have
anything to be afraid of.

474
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:18,780
她永远... 都绝不会知道我的秘密
She is never... ever
going to know my secret.

475
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:21,230
她知不知道并不重要
It doesn't matter if she knows.

476
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,910
我知道就行
I know.

477
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:27,970
我知道如果她发现你的身份
她会毫不犹豫地选择你
And I don't know how to be with
Laurel knowing the entire time...

478
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:34,920
我已不知该如何与Laurel相处了
that if she ever found out who you
really are... she would choose you.

479
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,660
感谢你为Eric和Nancy作出的努力
Thank you for everything you
tried to do for Eric and Nancy.

480
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,730
以及保护Taylor的安全
And for keeping Taylor safe.

481
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,270
过来
Come here.

482
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,960
你要乖哦 听到没
You keep being a good boy,ok?

483
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:18,220
Tommy 我十分需要和你谈谈...
Tommy,I really need to talk to you...

484
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,350
- 这是什么意思
- 拎包走人
- What's that for?
- It's my stuff.

485
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,330
怎么了
What's going on?

486
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,260
我不确定能否如你所期望一般付出
I'm not sure that I'm ready for the kind
of commitment that you're looking for.

487
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,930
长痛不如短痛 所以...
I don't want to hurt
you in the long run,so...

488
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:42,610
等等 我们差点死了
我现在情绪也很不稳定 你肯定不是认真的吧
Wait. We both almost lost our lives,and
I'm emotional,too,but you can't be serious.

489
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:44,710
我是认真的 Laurel
This is me serious,Laurel.

490
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:50,790
但是... 但这完全说不通啊
为什么... 为什么要现在说分手
But... But it doesn't make any
sense,I mean,why... Why now?

491
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,840
你为什么要跟我分手
Why even at all?

492
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,940
我曾以为这就是我想要的
I thought that I wanted this.

493
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,060
你
You.

494
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:00,480
但那晚我意识到事实并非如此
And the other night
made me realize I don't.

495
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,480
你在撒谎
You're lying.

496
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,130
我没有
I am not a liar.

497
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:11,210
如果你真的改变了 
我也知道你确实变了 那你就不会...
If you've changed,and I know that
you've changed,then you wouldn't...

498
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,060
你不会这样对我
you would never do this.

499
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:19,810
大概我并未如想象中变化那么大吧
Then I guess I haven't changed
as much as we all thought,then.

500
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,840
我知道
I know.

501
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,340
你觉得我就是个白痴
You think I'm an idiot.

502
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:43,220
我一直觉得你是个白痴
I always thought you were an idiot.

503
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,060
我现在觉得你根本就是脑死亡
Now I think you're brain dead.

504
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:48,200
可能你还真说对了
Yeah,you're probably right.

505
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,350
我不明白 Roy
Look,I don't understand this,Roy.

506
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,750
为什么你非要找到帽衫男
Why is finding the Hood
so important to you?

507
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,490
那晚的场景不停在我脑海中回放
I can't stop replaying
that night in my head.

508
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,530
那晚我被那个变态抓住
The night I got
kidnapped by that psycho,

509
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:03,470
我以为我要死了
I just... I thought I was going to die.

510
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,850
- 但你活下来了
- 是啊 都是他的功劳
- But you didn't.
- Yeah,because of him.

511
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,750
你不欠他什么
You don't owe him anything.

512
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,360
你错了 我的一切都是他给的
You're wrong,I owe him everything.

513
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,350
我已无法回到过去的生活方式了 Thea
And I can't go back to
the way things were,Thea,

514
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,230
我不能继续平庸下去
I can't just go back to being nothing.

515
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,560
是你告诉我 我可以变得更好
You're the one that keeps telling me
that I can be better than who I am,

516
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:24,210
而这... 就是我改变的机会
and this... This is my chance to be.

517
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:31,670
我说不清 但是...
就好像我的生活与他息息相关
I can't explain it,but... It feels
like my life is connected to his.

518
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,900
那就去找他吧
So let's find him.

519
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,270
我知道这对你很重要
I can tell this means the world to you.

520
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,660
而你也对我很重要
And you mean the world to me.

521
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,550
所以去找他吧
So let's find him.

522
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,150
咱俩一起去
You and me.

523
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,820
义务警员 我们来啦
Vigilante,here we come.

524
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,680
一猜你就在这
Was hoping you'd be here.

525
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,330
我希望我们能统一思想
I want us to get back on the same page.

526
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:23,120
Oliver 我们根本就不是一个世界的人
至少以后不再是了
Oliver,we're not even in the
same book,you and me,not anymore.

527
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:27,490
我只是做了我觉得自己该做的事
I just did what I thought I had to.

528
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,740
我也一样
Just like I'm doing what I have to.

529
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,130
咱俩就此为止吧
We're done.

530
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,900
别这样
Don't do this.

531
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:42,700
你要么一箭射死我 要么就放我走
The only thing you have to stop me
from going out that door is an arrow.

532
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,910
他要去哪
Where's he going?

533
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,570
我们的罗宾汉表现如何啊
So how did our Robin Hood do?

534
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,550
意料之中的烂
As expected?

535
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,800
还是好好定个计划吧
So back to the drawing board we go.

536
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,940
姚飞
Yao Fei!

537
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:26,140
爸
Ba!

538
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:36,030
你怎么逃出来的
How did you escape?

539
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,310
我没逃出来
I didn't.

540
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,570
你这狗娘养的...
You son of a bitch...

541
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:56,570
你在岛上的日子到头了
Your time on this island is at an end.

542
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:59,350

his first million

938
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:50,476
betting on a horse race
in 1958.

939
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:52,395
He wasn't just lucky.

940
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:55,982
He knew because he had
all the race results
in the sports almanac.

941
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,943
That's how he made
his entire fortune.

942
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,988
Look at his pocket
with a magnifying glass.

943
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,992
The almanac.

944
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:09,203
Son of a bitch
stole my idea.

945
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:12,332
He must have been
listening when I...

946
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:17,503
It's my fault.
The whole thing
is my fault.

947
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:19,589
If I hadn't bought
that damn book,

948
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,215
none of this would
have ever happened.

949
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,425
Well, it's all
in the past.

950
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:23,593
You mean the future?

951
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,554
Whatever.
It demonstrates precisely

952
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:28,431
how time travel
can be misused

953
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,643
and why the time machine
must be destroyed

954
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:34,103
after we straighten
all of this out.

955
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,272
Right. So we go
back to the future,

956
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:38,483
and we stop Biff
from stealing
the time machine.

957
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:41,110
We can't,
because if we travel

958
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:43,655
into the future from
this point in time,

959
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:47,283
it will be the future
of this reality,

960
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:51,245
in which Biff is
corrupt and powerful

961
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:53,247
and married
to your mother

962
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:58,211
and in which this
has happened to me.

963

(WHIMPERING)

964
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:08,596
No. Our only chance
to repair the present
is in the past

965
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:12,809
at the point where
the timeline skewed
into this tangent.

966
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:16,980
In order to put
the universe back
as we remember it

967
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:19,399
and get back
to our reality,

968
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:21,317
we have to find
out the exact date

969
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:23,194
and the specific
circumstances

970
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:26,114
of how, where
and when Young Biff

971
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:28,616
got his hands on
that sports almanac.

972
00:55:31,412 --> 00:55:32,578
I'll ask him.

973
00:55:56,228 --> 00:56:00,398

(LAUGHS) Great flick!
Great frigging flick!

974
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,775
The guy is brilliant.

975
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:04,902
Hey, what the hell's
going...

(GIRLS SCREAMING)
Hey! What the hell
are you doing in here?

977
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,781
Party's over, Biff.

978
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:11,951
Sorry, ladies.

979
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:14,787
How did you get past
my security downstairs?

980
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:17,165
There's a little matter
we need to talk about.

981
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:19,584
Yeah. Money, right?
Well, forget it.

982
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:21,544
No. Not money.

983
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:26,924
Gray's Sports Almanac.

984
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,305
You heard him, girls.

985
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,265
Party's over.

986
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:38,978
Start talking, kid.
What else you know
about that book?

987
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:43,483
First, you tell me
how you got it.

988
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:47,236
How, where and when.

989

(SCOFFS)

990
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,991
All right.
Take a seat.

00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:57,330
Sit down!

992

November 12, 1955.
That was when.

993
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:07,548
November 12, 1955.
That was the date
I went back...

994
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:12,887
That was the date of
the famous Hill Valley
lightning storm.

995
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:16,724
You know your history.
Very good.

996
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,435
I'll never forget
that Saturday.

997
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,229
I'd just picked
my car up from the shop,

998
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:24,482
'cause I'd rolled it
in a drag race
a few days earlier.

999
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:27,193
I thought you crashed
into a manure truck.

1000
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,155
How do you know
about that?

1001
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,032
My father told me
about it.

1002
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:34,367
Your father?

1003
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,537
Before he died.

1004
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,081
Yeah. Right.

1005
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,168
So there I was,
minding my own business.

1006
00:57:44,253 --> 00:57:47,547
This crazy old codger
with a cane shows up.

1007
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:49,632
He says he's my
distant relative.

1008
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,384
I don't see
any resemblance.

1009
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:56,222
So he says,
"How would you
like to be rich?"

1010
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,683
So I said, "Sure."

1011
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,481
So he lays
this book on me.

1012
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:07,316
He says this book
will tell me the outcome

1013
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:10,069
of every sporting event
till the end of the century.

1014
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:13,614
All I have to do is
bet on the winner,
and I'll never lose.

1015
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,369
So I said,
"What's the catch?"

1016
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,539
He says, "No catch.
Just keep it a secret."

(SIGHS)

1018
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:28,171
After that,
he disappeared.

1019
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:29,589
I never saw him again.

1020
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:44,520
Oh, and he told me
one more thing.

1021
00:58:44,605 --> 00:58:47,356
He said,

you're forgetting
one thing.

match up the bullet

that particular date.

It could mean that
that point in time

around Jennifer and Einie.

Track down Young Biff
and tail him.

to give Young Biff
the almanac.

1084

Above all you,
must not interfere
with that event.

believe he's succeeded,
so that he'll leave 1955

back to the future.

Once Old Biff is gone,
grab the almanac
any way that you can.

Remember,
both of our futures
depend on this.

You don't have to
remind me of that, Doc.

Here's some binoculars
and a walkie-talkie
so we can keep in contact.

1092
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:18,419
I'll stay here and
try to repair the short
in the time circuit.

1093
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:21,297
That way, we don't
risk anyone else
stealing the time machine,

1094
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:25,676
and I won't risk
accidentally running
into my other self.

1095
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,760
Other self?

1096
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:29,013
Yes. There are now
two of me here,

01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,973
and there are
two of you here.

1098

The other me is
the Dr. Emmett Brown
from 1955,

1099

the younger me that
helps the other you
get back to 1985.

1100
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,568
Remember the lightning bolt
at the clock tower?

1101
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,653
Yeah.
That event doesn't
happen until tonight,

1102
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:47,323
so you must be
very careful not to run
into your other self.

probably resold it, too.

something for that.

something for it?

We'll go inside.
You can call

give you a refund...

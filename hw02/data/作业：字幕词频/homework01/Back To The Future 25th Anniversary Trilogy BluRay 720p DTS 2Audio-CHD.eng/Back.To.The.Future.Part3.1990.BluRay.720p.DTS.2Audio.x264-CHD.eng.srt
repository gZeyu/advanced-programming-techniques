November 13, 1955.
7:01 a.m.

26
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,000
Last night's
time travel experiment

27
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,002
was apparently
a complete success.

28
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,671
Lightning struck
the clock tower at
precisely 10:04 p.m.

29
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,590
Sending the necessary
1.21 gigawatts into
the time vehicle,

30
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,884
which vanished in
a brilliant flash

leaving a pair of
fire trails behind.

32
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,514
I, therefore,
assume that Marty
and the time vehicle

33
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,393
were transported
forward through time
into the year 1985.

After that...

(GASPS) After that,
I can't recall
what happened.

In fact,
I don't even remember
how I got home.

37
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,360
Perhaps
the gigawatt discharge

38
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,154
coupled with the temporal
displacement field

39

generated by
the time vehicle

40

caused a disruption

I'd been reading
my favorite author,
Jules Verne.

156
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,495
I spent weeks preparing
that expedition.

get this far.

Of course,
I was only 12
at the time.

00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:11,170
You know,
it was the writings
of Jules Verne

160
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,756
that had a profound
effect on my life.

It was when I was 11
that I first read

Twenty Thousand
Leagues Under the Sea.

163
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,261
It was then
that I realized

164
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,681
that I must devote
my life to science.

I'm a blacksmith,

the DeLorean ready

782
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,137
and get the hell
out of here.

783
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,682
I wish I'd never invented
that infernal time machine.

784

nothing but disaster.

Check, Marty.

788
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:04,404
Great, Doc.
These things still work.

789
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:05,906
All right, Marty.

790
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:09,451
Once more, let's go over
the entire plan and layout.

791
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,536
I apologize for the
crudity of this model,
but I just...

792
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:14,623
Yeah, I know, Doc.
It's not to scale.
It's okay, Doc.

793
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:18,168
All right.
Tomorrow night, Sunday,

794
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:21,129
we'll load the DeLorean
onto the tracks here,
on the spur

795
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:23,507
right by the old
abandoned silver mine.

796
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:26,426
The switch track is
where the spur runs
off the main line

797
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:30,013
three miles
out to Clayton...
Shonash Ravine.

798
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,891
The train leaves
the station at 8:00
Monday morning.

799
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,519
We'll stop it here,
uncouple the cars
from the tender,

800
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,812
throw the switch track,
and then we'll hijack...

801
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:41,858
Borrow the locomotive
and use it to push
the time machine.

802
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:43,151
According to
my calculations,

803
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:44,611
we'll reach
88 miles per hour

804
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,696
just before we hit
the edge of the ravine,

805
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:50,450
at which point
we'll be instantaneously
transported back to 1985

806
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:52,953
and coast safely across
the completed bridge.

807
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:55,789
What does this mean?
"Point of no return."

808
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,832
That's our
fail-safe point.

809
00:47:57,917 --> 00:47:59,292
Up until there,
we have still
have enough time

810
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,962
to stop the locomotive
before it plunges
into the ravine.

811
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,213
But once we
pass this windmill,

812
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,464
it's the future
or bust.

813
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:11,137
Here you go, Marty.
Connect that to
the positive terminal.

814
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,181
All right,
Marty, you all set?

815
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:14,516
Yeah. Yeah. Go!

deep enough in his back,
nobody will hear the shot.

971
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:21,687
Careful, Buford.
You ain't got but one
bullet with that.

01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:35,376
Seamus, relax.
I know what I'm doing.

1090
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,460
He reminds me
of poor Martin.

1091
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:37,545
Aye.

Who?
Me brother.

1093

Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1094
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,049
You have a brother
named Martin McFly?

1095
01:02:42,134 --> 01:02:44,552
Had a brother.

1096
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:47,304
Martin used to
let men provoke him
into fighting.

1097
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:50,266
He was concerned that
people would think him
a coward if he refused.

1098
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:52,726
That's how he got
a Bowie knife shoved
through his belly

1099
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:55,688
in a saloon
in Virginia City.

1100
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,606
Never considered
the future, poor Martin.

1101

God rest his soul.

1102
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:04,947
Sure, and I hope
you're considering
the future, Mr. Eastwood.

1103
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:10,703
I think about it
all the time.

1104
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,289
CLARA: And that crater
in the middle north west,

1105
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:15,291
the one that's
out there all by itself
like a starburst...

lunar geography
so fascinating.

You're quite

1113
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,975
When I was 11,
I had diphtheria.

1114
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,060
I was quarantined
for three months.

1115
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:37,229
So my father
brought this telescope,

1116
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:38,689
and he put it
next to my bed

1117
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:41,317
so I could
see everything
out the window.

1119

Emmett, do you think
we'll ever be able
to travel to the moon

1120
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:48,991
the way we travel
across the country
on trains?

1121
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:52,495
Definitely.
Although not for 84 years
and not on trains.

1122
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:56,415
We'll have
space vehicles, capsules
sent aloft with rockets.

1123
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,334
Devices that
create giant explosions.

1124
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:00,836
Explosions so powerful
that they just...

1125
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:03,005
That they break the pull
of the Earth's gravity

1126
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:06,342
and send the projectile
through outer space.

1127
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:10,137
Emmett,
I read that book, too!

1128
01:04:10,222 --> 01:04:12,223
You're quoting
Jules Verne

1129
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:13,766
From the Earth
to the Moon.

1130
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,101
You've read Jules Verne?

1131
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,812
I adore Jules Verne.

1132
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:20,523
So do I.

1133
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:23,484
Twenty Thousand
Leagues Under the Sea.
My absolute favorite.

1134
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:25,486
The first time
I read that when
I was a little boy,

1135
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:28,155
why, I wanted to
meet Captain Nemo.

1136
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,406
Don't tease, Emmett.

1137
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:31,367
You couldn't have
read that when
you were a boy.

1138
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:33,869
It was only first
published 10 years ago.

1139
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,998
Oh, yes. Well,
I meant it made me
feel like a boy.

1140
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:44,922
I never met a woman
who liked Jules Verne
before.

1141
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:50,386
I never ever met a man
like you before.

calls you a name.

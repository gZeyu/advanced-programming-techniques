1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,010
We were in a store and a guy in that store...

2
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,720
...told us to put our uniforms on.

3
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,880
"what the hell are you talking about?"

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,360
He says, "The USA is in a war with Japan."

5
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,260
We couldn't believe it.

6
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,390
Well, our country was attacked.

7
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,700
It's different.

8
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,640
It wasn't like Korea or Vietnam.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,200
We were attacked.

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,910
And, you know, it was a feeling that...

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,450
...maybe, we're just dumb country people but...

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,680
...where I come from a lot of us volunteered.

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,020
"Who would like to volunteer for the Tank Corps?

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,650
"Who would like to volunteer for the Air Force?

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,950
"Who would like to volunteer for the Navy?" or whatever.

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,420
And then, they said:

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,890
"Who would like to volunteer for the Airborne?"

18
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,560
Somebody says, "What the hell's the Airborne?"

19
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,860
Nobody ever heard of it.

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,230
We came from a small, small town.

21
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,470
And three fellows in that town that were 4F...

22
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,370
...committed suicide because they couldn't go.

23
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,740
A different time.

24
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:11,940
I did things.

25
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,840
I didn't do them for medals.

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,720
I didn't do them for accolades. I did 'em because it's what had to be done.

27
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,820
The guy says, "would you jump out of airplanes?

28
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,550
"You know, you got all your army equipment...

29
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,460
"...and you jump out of airplanes, to fight the enemy."

30
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,760
These guys, they said, "Go to hell."

31
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,420
Nobody put up their hands.

32
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,470
And then, I don't know what it was brought it up...

33
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,430
...but the guy giving the speech was saying:

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,130
"But you get paid $50 a month more."

35
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,260
So, that made it a hundred bucks.

36
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,080
I want a whiff of chicken pie.

37
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,310
Okay, boys, let's get this gear stowed.

38
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,240
Fox Company...we go in five.

39
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,360
"In the name of the Father..."

40
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,400
1st Platoon, draw small arms.

41
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,260
Do you need a hand, Lieutenant?

42
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,800
Easy Company! Listen up!

43
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,700
Gather up around me.

44
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,210
Just move it up. Come on, gentlemen.

45
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,770
Let's go!

46
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,970
Now, the Channel coast is socked in with rain and fog.

47
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,640
High winds on the drop zone.

48
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,180
No jump tonight.

49
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,810
The invasion has been postponed.

50
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,020
We're on a 24-hour stand-down. Son of a bitch.

51
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,820
Drill sergeants, take charge.

52
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,160
Well, this is quite a surprise.

53
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,530
Not particularly.

54
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,900
It so happens I rather expected it.

55
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:13,280
Well, I can't see how you people can pass up $80,000 for the Cause

56
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,830
For whose cause?

57
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,480
If you're so interested in serving a cause...

58
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,310
...why don't you join the Army?

59
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,310
I think it's clearing up.

60
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,880
You think it's clearing up?

61
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,440
No.

62
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,680
I think it's clearing up.

63
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,380
How are your men?

64
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,020
They'll be fine.

65
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,560
5:00 in New York.

66
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,720
4:00 in Chicago.

67
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,770
Happy hour, huh? Yeah.

68
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,430
Happy hour.

69
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,240
A couple of drinks.

70
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,840
Maybe an early dinner before the theater.

71
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,340
A civilized place for civilized men.

72
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,920
Should've been born earlier, Nix.

73
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,620
What, and give up all this?

74
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,610
We'll go to Chicago, I'll take you there.

75
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,580
Yeah.

76
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,720
We'll see.

77
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,290
Actually, you know who's from there?

78
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,730
Who? Oh, him.

79
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,390
712 days of that son of a bitch and here we are.

80
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,700
You people are at the position of attention.

81
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,870
Private Perconte, have you been blousing your trousers over your boots like a paratrooper?

82
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,740
No, sir.

83
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,980
Then explain the creases at the bottom.

84
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,440
No excuse, sir.

85
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,280
Volunteering for the Parachute Infantry is one thing...

86
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,880
...but you've got a long way to prove you belong here.

87
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,050
Your weekend pass is revoked.

88
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,850
Name? Luz, George.

89
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,890
Dirt in the rear side aperture.

90
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,360
Pass revoked.

91
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,440
When did you sew on these chevrons, Sergeant Lipton?

92
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,280
Yesterday, sir.

93
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,480
Long enough to notice this. Revoked.

94
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:42,780
Sir.

95
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,580
Name?

96
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,050
Malarkey, Donald G.

97
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,760
Malarkey's slang for bullshit, isn't it?

98
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,690
Yes, sir.

99
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,430
Rust on the butt plate hinge spring, Private Bullshit.

100
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,860
Revoked.

101
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,100
Name?

102
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,600
Liebgott, Joseph D., sir.

103
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,430
Rusty bayonet, Liebgott.

104
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,700
You want to kill Germans?

105
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,540
Yes, sir.

106
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,840
Not with this.

107
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,510
I wouldn't take this rusty piece of shit to war.

108
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,880
And I will not take you to war in your condition.

109
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,390
Now, thanks to these men and their infractions...

110
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,220
...every man in the company who had a weekend pass...

111
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:25,890
...has lost it.

112
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,790
Change into your PT gear, we're running Currahee.

113
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,930
2nd Platoon, fall out.

114
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,030
We have two minutes.

115
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,160
Fall out!

116
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,280
I ain't going up that hill.

117
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,250
Perconte, what are you thinking of blousing your pants?

118
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,410
Shut up, okay?

119
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,580
He gigged everyone.

120
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,880
You should know better.

121
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,390
Don't give him no excuses.

122
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,650
Excuses?

123
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,850
Why don't you come here, look at these trousers...

124
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,760
...get down and tell me if there's a crease?

125
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,560
Let's go on the road in PT formation.

126
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,100
Let's move, move, move!

127
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,000
Perconte, let's go, Perconte.

128
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,570
Private White, why are you not in your PT gear?

129
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,970
I asked you a question, Private.

130
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,140
Oh, Easy Company.

131
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,570
While you're running, don't worry.

132
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,430
We'll take your dames to the movies.

133
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,070
Yeah, good, they need some female company.

134
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,540
Where do we run?

135
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,780
Currahee.

136
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,010
What does "Currahee" mean?

137
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,240
We stand alone.

138
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,850
How far up, how far down?

139
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,720
Three miles up, three miles down.

140
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,510
And what company is this?

141
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,990
Easy Company.

142
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,430
And what do we do? Stand alone.

143
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,490
Do not help that man! Do not help that man!

144
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,560
We do not stop.

145
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,000
You've got 30 minutes to get to the top of this mountain...

146
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,960
...if you want to serve in the Paratroopers.

147
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,970
Hi-ho, Silver!

148
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,060
You can make it up there.

149
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:49,870
Come on.

150
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,060
Come on, Alley, let's go.

151
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,270
Come on, Guarnere.

152
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,600
Christenson, come on.

153
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,170
I never thought I'd see the day, Private Wynn.

154
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,140
We are coming on 23 minutes.

155
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,770
That may be good enough for the rest of the 506...

156
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,690
...but that is not good enough for Easy Company.

157
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,400
We can make it, we can do this, come on.

158
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,460
I'm going to say something.

159
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,990
To who?

160
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,830
Lieutenant Winters.

161
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,300
What is it?

162
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,270
Permission to speak, sir?

163
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,540
Permission granted.

164
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,670
Sir, we got nine companies, sir.

165
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,470
That we do.

166
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,280
How come we're the only company...

167
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,750
...marching every Friday night, 12 miles, full pack in the pitch dark?

168
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,880
Why do you think, Private Randleman?

169
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,820
Lieutenant Sobel hates us, sir.

170
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,760
Lieutenant Sobel does not hate Easy Company, Private Randleman.

171
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,900
He just hates you.

172
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,100
Thank you, sir.

173
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,110
He hates him back.

174
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,470
He hates you, too, Muck.

175
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,180
Lieutenant Winters, I want canteens out of belts with the caps unscrewed.

176
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,220
Easy Company, canteens out and open.

177
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,480
On my command, they will pour the contents onto the ground.

178
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,080
On the CO's order, you will upend your canteen.

179
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,250
Now, Lieutenant.

180
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,380
Pour them.

181
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,720
Who is this?

182
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,060
Christenson.

183
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,430
Why is there no water in your canteen?

184
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,230
You drank from your canteen, didn't you?

185
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,170
Lieutenant. Yes, sir.

186
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,080
Was this man ordered to not drink from his canteen during the Friday night march?

187
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,010
He was, sir.

188
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,570
Private Christenson, you have disobeyed a direct order.

189
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,840
You will fill your canteen...

190
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,410
...and repeat all 12 miles of the march immediately.

191
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,460
Yes, sir.

192
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,650
Fall out!

193
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,200
What in the name of God are you doing with my company?

194
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,640
You're late and you allow troopers to disobey direct orders?

195
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,040
No excuse, sir.

196
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,900
You're making me look bad, Lieutenant.

197
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,680
This is not Dog Company. This is not Fox Company.

198
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,340
This is Easy Company.

199
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,680
Under my command, this will be the first...

200
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,980
...and finest company in this regiment.

201
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,020
I want the names of six men.

202
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:05,830
Their infractions and your disciplinary recommendations on my desk by 0130.

203
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,160
Is that clear?

204
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,160
What infractions, sir?

205
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,030
Find some.

206
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,900
So, what'd you do?

207
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,850
Picked six men and gave them latrine duty.

208
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,480
The lucky six?

209
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,540
McDowell, Toye, Perconte.

210
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,820
Lipton, Muck and Guarnere.

211
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,320
Why them?

212
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,760
It was their turn.

213
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,590
Sobel's a genius.

214
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,890
I had a headmaster just like him in prep school.

215
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,190
I know the type.

216
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,660
Lewis.

217
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,360
Michelangelo's a genius, Beethoven's a genius.

218
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,230
You know a man in this company who wouldn't double-time Currahee with a full pack...

219
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,740
...just to piss in that guy's morning coffee?

220
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,670
Let's go, let's go.

221
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,580
Stand in the door.

222
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,840
1,000, 2,000.

223
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,510
You just broke both your legs, Private Gordon.

224
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,240
Are you trying to get killed?

225
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,690
No, sir.

226
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,190
Stand in the door.

227
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,530
Shit.

228
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,880
To the wall.

229
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,850
Over as a team.

230
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,750
Go on, against the wall.

231
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,150
Jesus, what the hell is this?

232
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,210
That's pig guts, boy.

233
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,920
Goddamn it!

234
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,100
Why are you here, Private Gordon?

235
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,260
To be in the Airborne, sir.

236
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,820
I don't believe you. Why are you here, Private Gordon?

237
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,270
To be in the Airborne, sir.

238
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,210
You have 50 minutes to the top and back, and I will be watching you.

239
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,800
What are you waiting for?

240
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,850
Easy Company has the finest performance record in the entire 2nd Battalion.

241
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,480
I believe every bit of that is thanks to you.

242
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,790
Congratulations, Captain Sobel.

243
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,120
Thank you, sir.

244
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,900
Isn't that Lieutenant Winters leading Easy Company in PT?

245
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,370
Yes, sir.

246
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,060
He's a damned good man.

247
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,470
I was planning on giving him a set of these today.

248
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,270
Why don't you do it? He'd be proud to get them from you.

249
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,850
Pornography, contraband.

250
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,750
Non-regulation clothing, contraband.

251
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:27,230
This man had 200 prophylactic kits in his footlocker.

252
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:31,900
How in the name of God was he going to have the strength to fight the war?

253
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,900
How is it Private Tipper...

254
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,730
...has spare time for so much correspondence?

255
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,040
Captain, are personal letters to be considered contraband?

256
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,310
These men aren't paratroopers yet, Lieutenant.

257
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,580
They have no personal property.

258
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,880
What is this?

259
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,660
Anybody?

260
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,320
It's a can of peaches, sir.

261
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,730
Lieutenant Nixon thinks this is a can of peaches.

262
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,200
That is incorrect, Lieutenant.

263
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,100
Your weekend pass is cancelled.

264
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:12,400
This is United States Army property...

265
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,340
...which was taken, without authorization, from my mess facility...

266
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,920
...and I will not tolerate thievery in my unit.

267
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,540
Whose footlocker is this?

268
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,210
Private Parks, sir.

269
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,620
Get rid of him.

270
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,090
All weekend passes are cancelled.

271
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,920
Officers included.

272
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,630
Carry on.

273
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,530
Lieutenant Winters.

274
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,380
Colonel Sink has seen fit to promote you.

275
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,550
As First Lieutenant, you'll serve as my executive officer.

276
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,920
Congratulations.

277
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,410
Thank you, sir.

278
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:07,490
And, as a test of your organizational skills and command potential...

279
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,730
...I am designating you mess officer for 14 days.

280
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,700
Report to the mess kitchen at 0515 hours.

281
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,570
Company breakfast to be served at 0600.

282
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,240
Yes, sir.

283
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,140
And, Dick, there's rain forecast tomorrow...

284
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,210
...so the company will have a light afternoon of lecture and classroom instruction.

285
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,250
I think a special meal before their afternoon off...

286
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,990
...would be a welcome change of pace.

287
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,260
Would you agree?

288
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,230
Yes, sir.

289
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,060
I like spaghetti.

290
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,600
Hold on, more coming.

291
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,910
These guys are packing it away.

292
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,620
This stuff is orange.

293
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,150
Spaghetti ain't supposed to be orange.

294
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,460
This ain't spaghetti.

295
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,520
This is army noodles with ketchup.

296
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,530
You ain't got to eat it.

297
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,930
Oh, come on, Gonorrhea, as a fellow Italian...

298
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,600
...you know that calling this spaghetti is a mortal sin.

299
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,540
I'll have it. No, I'm eating here.

300
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,910
Hey, get out of here.

301
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,870
Orders changed, get up!

302
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,540
Lectures are cancelled.

303
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,950
Easy Company is running up Currahee.

304
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,540
Move, move!

305
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,310
Three miles up, three miles down.

306
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,260
Hi-ho, Silver!

307
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,790
Let's go, let's go.

308
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,060
You're a washout, Private Hoobler!

309
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,500
You should pack up both your ears and go home.

310
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,130
Looks like Gordon's done.

311
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,940
Aren't you, Gordon. You finished?

312
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,100
You do not deserve to get your wings.

313
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,150
Private Randleman, you look tired.

314
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,910
There's an ambulance waiting for you at the bottom of the hill.

315
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,210
It can all be over right now.

316
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,690
No more pain, no more Currahee.

317
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,120
No more Captain Sobel.

318
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:19,920
"We pull upon the risers We fall upon the grass

319
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,050
"We never land upon our feet We always hit our ass

320
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:26,630
"Hide tidee, Christ almighty Who the hell are we?

321
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,100
"Zim zam, goddamn! We're Airborne Infantry

322
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,400
"We pull upon the risers We fall upon the grass

323
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,440
"We never land upon our feet We always hit our ass

324
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,970
"Hide tidee, Christ almighty Who the hell are we?

325
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,380
"Zim zam, goddamn! We're Airborne Infantry"

326
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,090
So, do we feel like we're ready to be army paratroopers?

327
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,360
Yes, Sergeant.

328
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,770
I hope so.

329
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:07,510
This'll be the first of five exits from a C-47 aircraft scheduled for today.

330
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,300
Get ready!

331
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,150
Stand up!

332
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,650
Hook up!

333
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,650
Upon successful completion of your fifth and final jump...

334
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,120
...you'll be certified army paratroopers.

335
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,190
Check equipment!

336
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,020
Sound off for equipment check!

337
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,790
Nine okay.

338
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,020
Eight okay.

339
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,220
Seven okay.

340
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,390
Six okay.

341
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,270
Five okay.

342
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,800
Four okay.

343
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,170
Three okay.

344
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,100
Two okay.

345
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,160
One okay.

346
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,940
There'll be a lot of men dropping from the sky today.

347
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,940
Hopefully, under deployed canopies.

348
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,740
Stand in the door!

349
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,250
I guarantee you're going to love it, Lieutenant.

350
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,120
Go, go!

351
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,160
Jumping from 1,000 feet AGL...

352
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,560
...in sticks of 12 jumpers per aircraft.

353
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:02,160
All you have to do is remember what you were taught...

354
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,430
...and I guarantee you, gravity will take care of the rest.

355
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,560
Go, go, go, go!

356
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,170
Go, go, go!

357
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,280
Go, go, go!

358
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,440
Damn it.

359
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,840
And, gentlemen, rest assured...

360
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,510
...any refusals in the aircraft or at the door...

361
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,750
...and I guarantee you, you will be out of the Airborne.

362
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,250
Four okay.

363
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,390
Three okay.

364
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,120
Two okay.

365
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,990
One okay.

366
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,830
Stand in the door.

367
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,660
Go!

368
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:29,640
1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000...

369
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,240
...7,000, 8,000, 9,000!

370
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,980
Hi-ho, Silver!

371
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,800
Now just think, if you had any class or style like me...

372
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,930
...somebody might mistake you for somebody.

373
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,970
You mean like your fucking sergeant?

374
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,230
I'm just kidding.

375
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,480
Congratulations, Martin.

376
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,540
Corporal Toye, there will be no leaning in my company.

377
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,380
Are those dusty jump wings?

378
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,310
How do you expect to slay the Huns with dust on your jump wings?

379
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,990
Luz, just give me a drink.

380
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,860
Hell of an idea, Joe.

381
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,490
There you go.

382
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,230
Three miles up, three miles down.

383
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,470
Ten-hut!

384
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,780
Well, at ease, paratroopers.

385
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,110
Good evening, Easy Company.

386
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,810
Evening, sir.

387
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,550
Now, Parachute Infantry is a brand-new concept...

388
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,280
...in American military history.

389
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,290
But, by God, the 506 is going to forge that brand-new concept...

390
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,330
...into victory.

391
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,490
Yes, sir.

392
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,330
I want you to know that I'm damned proud of each and every one of you.

393
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,670
Now, you deserve this party.

394
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,360
Thank you, Sergeant Grant.

395
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,500
Sir.

396
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:04,300
So, I want you to have fun and remember our motto:

397
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,470
Currahee!

398
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,310
Currahee!

399
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,170
Petty.

400
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,440
Map.

401
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,410
Come on.

402
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,140
Ah, Christ.

403
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,090
We're in the wrong position.

404
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,830
We're in the wrong position.

405
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,060
We're textbook position for ambush, sir.

406
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,600
We should sit tight, let the enemy team come into our killing zone.

407
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,100
They're right out there somewhere.

408
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,600
Let's just get them.

409
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,500
Sir, we have perfect cover here.

410
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,610
Lieutenant, deploy your troops.

411
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:17,140
2nd Platoon, move out.

412
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,180
What?

413
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,380
Tactical column.

414
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:43,100
Captain, you've just been killed, along with 95 percent of your company.

415
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,840
Your outfit?

416
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,540
Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th.

417
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:56,620
Leave three wounded men on the ground and report back to the assembly area.

418
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,150
Goddamn it.

419
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,060
You, you, you.

420
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,430
Well, what are you going to do?

421
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,440
Nothing, just keep training the men.

422
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,640
Am I interrupting?

423
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,970
No, no.

424
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,170
Lieutenant Lewis Nixon.

425
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,810
Lieutenant Harry Welsh, just in from the 82nd.

426
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,180
Congratulations on the promotion.

427
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,150
Thanks, if you want to call it that.

428
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,620
You'll learn him pretty quickly.

429
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,020
No flaws, no vices, no sense of humor.

430
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,560
Just like your chums up at battalion staff.

431
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,460
What's up?

432
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,990
I'm hearing a lot of rumblings.

433
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,190
Sobel?

434
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,830
Just talking about that.

435
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,170
So, he gets a little jumpy in the field?

436
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,630
He gets jumpy and then you get killed.

437
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,270
That's nice.

438
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,740
Yeah, listen, if we discuss it, I think it should just be amongst ourselves.

439
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,040
Absolutely.

440
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,910
2nd Platoon, ready?

441
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,080
Ready, sir.

442
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,350
Then get them in formation.

443
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,520
We're moving out.

444
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,960
Yes, sir.

445
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,650
Shut up, Cobb.

446
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,990
You got to admit it.

447
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,490
He's got no chance.

448
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,320
Either the Krauts will get him or one of us.

449
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,130
Who, Sobel?

450
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,330
He screwed up one maneuver.

451
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,160
Well, you know, I'm always fumbling with grenades.

452
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,400
It would be easy if one went off by accident, you know?

453
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:59,570
Well, now they must have put him in charge for a reason.

454
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:03,580
Yeah, 'cause the Army wouldn't make a mistake, right?

455
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:21,160
Going my way? Wherever the train takes me.

456
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,390
Where do you suppose that might be? I haven't got a clue.

457
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,060
Yeah, come on, take a guess.

458
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,790
Atlantic, Pacific, Atlantic?

459
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,070
I'm not the intelligence officer.

460
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:35,480
Well, as such, I, of course, know, but if I told you, I'd have to kill you.

461
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,980
So, don't tell me.

462
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,680
New York City.

463
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,050
Troopship.

464
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,480
England.

465
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,050
We're invading Europe, my friend.

466
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,720
Fortress Europa.

467
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,350
Since when do I drink?

468
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:00,370
If I thought you'd drink it, I wouldn't offer it to you.

469
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,170
Nix?

470
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,300
What are you going to do when you get into combat?

471
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,610
I have every confidence in my scrounging abilities.

472
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,520
And I have a case of VAT 69 hidden in your footlocker.

473
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,450
Really?

474
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,290
Oh, yeah.

475
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,820
'Morning.

476
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:31,400
This could turn into a real nice trip.

477
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,740
"Dear sir or madam:

478
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:55,210
"Soon your son will drop from the sky to engage and defeat the enemy.

479
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:58,490
"Your frequent letters of love and encouragement...

480
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,030
"...will arm him with a fighting heart.

481
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:05,590
"With that he cannot fail, but will win glory for himself...

482
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,260
"...make you proud of him, and his country ever grateful...

483
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,770
"...for his service in its hour of need.

484
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:15,510
"Signed, Herbert M. Sobel, Captain Commanding."

485
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:32,550
Right now, some lucky bastard's headed for the South Pacific.

486
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,600
Oh, what I'd give.

487
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,250
He's going to get billeted on some tropical island.

488
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,200
Keep talking.

489
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:40,290
Sitting under a palm tree with six naked native girls...

490
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:44,030
...helping him cut up coconuts so he can hand-feed them to the flamingos.

491
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,330
Flamingos are mean.

492
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,670
They bite.

493
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,370
So do the naked native girls.

494
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:50,600
With any luck.

495
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,940
Hey, guys, I'm glad I'm going to Europe.

496
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,980
Hitler gets one of these right across the windpipe.

497
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,210
Roosevelt changes Thanksgiving to Joe Toye Day...

498
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:02,780
...and pays me $10,000 a year for the rest of my fucking life.

499
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,520
What if we don't get to Europe?

500
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,420
What if they send us to North Africa?

501
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,620
My brother's in North Africa.

502
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,820
He says it's hot.

503
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,730
Really, it's hot in Africa?

504
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,320
Shut up.

505
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,370
The point is, it don't matter where we go.

506
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,500
In combat, the only person you can trust...

507
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,730
...is yourself and the fellow next to you.

508
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:22,780
Hey, as long as he's a paratrooper.

509
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,710
Oh, yeah?

510
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,750
And what if that paratrooper turns out to be Sobel?

511
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,510
If I'm next to Sobel in combat, I'm moving on down the line.

512
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:34,650
Hook up with some other officer, like Heyliger or Winters.

513
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,490
I like Winters, he's a good man.

514
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,530
But when the bullets start flying...

515
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,290
...I don't know if I want a Quaker doing my fighting for me.

516
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,350
How do you know he's a Quaker?

517
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,590
He ain't Catholic.

518
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,860
Neither is Sobel.

519
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,770
That prick's a son of Abraham.

520
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,170
He's what?

521
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,740
He's a Jew.

522
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,540
I'm a Jew.

523
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,900
Congratulations.

524
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,110
Get your nose out of my face.

525
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:10,280
What's all that about?

526
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,530
Gonorrhea called Sobel a Jew.

527
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:15,320
Liebgott took offense 'cause he's a Jew too.

528
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,600
Fighting over Sobel, that's smart.

529
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,250
Attack!

530
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:45,020
No, you want to kill him!

531
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:47,030
Parry right, parry left.

532
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,130
Thrust!

533
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,490
Take cover.

534
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,860
Okay.

535
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:55,200
Yesterday, we talked about magnetic declination...

536
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,700
...and the "left add, right subtract" rule.

537
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,330
Today we're putting it into practice.

538
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:02,570
There are two basic types of fighting positions.

539
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,510
The first is the prepared position.

540
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:11,320
The advantages of a prepared position are that it gives you cover and concealment.

541
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,050
Commence fire!

542
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,590
We'll then maneuver right in through these trees.

543
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:25,430
At the same time, our second platoon, in this particular case, moves over here.

544
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,870
He's then going to close with and kill or capture that German.

545
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,590
Sobel's late.

546
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,200
Why is there a fence here?

547
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,540
There should be no fence here.

548
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,250
Give me the map.

549
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,810
Perconte, Luz.

550
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,820
Get the men, get them...

551
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:24,580
Take cover behind those trees.

552
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,090
You heard the word. Let's go over there.

553
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:34,160
There should be no... There should be no fence here.

554
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,200
We could go over it, sir.

555
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,830
Really?

556
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,270
That's not the point. Where the goddamn...

557
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,410
Where the goddamn hell are we?

558
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,470
Perconte? Yeah.

559
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,910
Sobel's lost again, right? Yeah, he's lost.

560
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,110
Fucking Christ.

561
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,140
Can you do Major Horton?

562
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,920
Does a wild bear crap in the woods, son?

563
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,020
Maybe the good major can goose this schmuck.

564
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,360
Get us moving?

565
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,790
No way.

566
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:08,090
Yes. You got to.

567
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,160
All right, just this once.

568
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:18,770
Three-five-six-eight-three-three.

569
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,000
Isn't that the intersection?

570
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,270
No, sir, it's here.

571
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,710
You're a full grid off.

572
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,950
Goddamn it.

573
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,640
Is there a problem, Captain Sobel?

574
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,810
Who said that?

575
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,220
Who broke silence?

576
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:33,090
I think it's Major Horton, sir.

577
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,420
Major Horton?

578
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,160
What is he... Did he join us?

579
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:41,460
I think maybe he's moving between the platoons, sir.

580
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:45,370
What is the goddamn holdup, Mr. Sobel?

581
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,470
A fence, sir.

582
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,000
God!

583
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:53,110
A barbed wire fence.

584
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,240
Oh, that dog just ain't going to hunt!

585
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:01,810
Now, you cut that fence and get this goddamn platoon on the move!

586
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,120
Yes, sir!

587
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,750
Where are my goddamn wire cutters?

588
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,130
We have to move.

589
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,670
Sir, without Captain Sobel and 1st Platoon?

590
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,200
It's a T-intersection. We improvise.

591
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:23,370
Double envelopment laid on a base of fire to cut the road in all directions.

592
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,000
Hook right with first squad. Tell Guarnere to move left with second.

593
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,140
I'll be right up the middle with third, go. Yes, sir.

594
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,040
Deary me.

595
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,650
Bloody hell.

596
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,200
You've done it now, Yanks.

597
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,470
You've captured me.

598
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:36,580
Hi-ho, Silver!

599
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,390
Would that be the enemy?

600
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,910
As a matter of fact, yes.

601
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,330
Good work, 2nd Platoon.

602
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,800
We took the objective.

603
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:08,140
Who is the idiot who cut that man's fence?

604
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:09,370
I was ordered to, sir.

605
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:10,280
By whom?

606
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:11,540
Major Horton, sir.

607
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,050
Major Horton? Yes, sir.

608
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,510
Major Horton told you to do that? Yes, sir.

609
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,620
Major Horton ordered you to cut the fence?

610
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,790
Yes, he did.

611
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:24,590
Major Horton is on leave in London.

612
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:28,990
Get those cows out of here.

613
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:59,430
Lieutenant Winters.

614
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:04,990
With Captain Sobel's compliments, sir.

615
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:09,330
Lieutenant.

616
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,320
Oh, for crying out loud.

617
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,600
This spells court-martial.

618
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,760
Wide open! Yes.

619
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,470
No, sir, I do not understand.

620
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:44,330
Your orders to me were to inspect the latrines at 1000 hours.

621
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:49,910
From 0930 to 0955 I was censoring the enlisted men's mail by order of Colonel Strayer.

622
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,880
At 1000 hours I followed your orders to the minute.

623
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:56,610
I changed that time to 0945.

624
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:57,750
No one told me, sir.

625
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,880
I telephoned.

626
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,390
I'm quartered with a family that has no telephone.

627
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,860
And sent a runner.

628
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:04,360
No runner found me, Captain.

629
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:12,840
Irregardless, when given a task to perform by a ranking officer you should have delegated your task of latrine inspection to another officer.

630
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,340
You failed to do so.

631
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:18,330
Were I to let such a failure of duty by my own X O go unpunished...

632
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:20,710
...what kind of message is that to the men?

633
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:23,070
I performed my duty as I was ordered, sir.

634
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:24,750
And I disagree.

635
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:28,210
So, your options are quite simple, Lieutenant.

636
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,820
Punishment for your offenses will be denial of a 48-hour pass for 60 days.

637
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:36,020
Stand before me at attention.

638
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:43,500
Or you may initiate a letter of appeal and request a trial by court-martial.

639
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:50,270
You spend your weekends on the base anyway, Dick.

640
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,270
Be a man, take the punishment.

641
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:55,570
May I borrow your pen, sir?

642
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,080
My endorsement, sir.

643
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,890
I request trial by court-martial.

644
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:26,340
We lost Winters to battalion mess.

645
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,640
You're shitting me. No.

646
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:32,670
Strayer did it, while they try to figure out the procedures for his court-martial.

647
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,880
Nix better find a loophole and get him out.

648
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:36,040
And if he don't?

649
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:39,950
Winters scrambles eggs while the rest of us make the big jump with Sobel.

650
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,990
Not me.

651
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:46,130
So we're going through with this, right?

652
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:48,090
We've got to do something.

653
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:49,390
Yeah.

654
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,090
All right.

655
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,160
Good.

656
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:57,860
But we'd all better be clear on the consequences.

657
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,140
I don't care about the consequences.

658
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:04,270
We could be lined up against a wall and shot.

659
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:08,150
Now, I'm ready to face that.

660
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,120
And every one of us had better be, too.

661
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,250
I will not follow that man into combat.

662
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:25,560
Me neither.

663
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,830
All right.

664
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:32,600
Then let's do it.

665
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,150
"I hereby...

666
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:54,480
"...no longer wish to serve...

667
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,220
"...as a non-commissioned officer...

668
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,000
"...in Easy Company."

669
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,290
All right, boys.

670
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:25,450
Good luck.

671
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,490
I ought to have you all shot!

672
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:34,560
This is nothing less than an act of mutiny...

673
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,700
...while we prepare for the goddamn invasion of Europe.

674
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,360
Sergeant Harris.

675
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:40,170
Sir.

676
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,230
Turn in your stripes, collect your gear.

677
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:45,070
You are hereby transferred out of my regiment.

678
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,010
Sir.

679
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:46,910
Get out.

680
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,850
Sergeant Ranney.

681
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:51,210
Sir.

682
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:54,450
You consider yourself lucky, I'm only busting you to private.

683
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:58,560
All of you NCOs have disgraced the 101st Airborne.

684
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:03,560
Consider yourself lucky that we are on the eve of the largest action in the history of warfare...

685
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:07,530
...which leaves me no choice but to spare your lives.

686
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:13,670
Now, get out of my office and get out of my sight.

687
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,400
Get.

688
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,790
Keep them coming, atta-boy.

689
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:11,220
I can only speculate, sir. Most of the men would never do this...

690
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:15,390
...but I believe just a few of the sergeants may have felt...

691
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:19,270
...their loyalty lay more to the platoon than to the company.

692
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:23,770
And these few sergeants convinced all of the other NCOs in your company...

693
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:25,110
...to turn in their stripes?

694
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,140
As staff sergeants, they have a great amount of influence, sir.

695
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,940
But as I say, the rest are good men.

696
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,440
I know them, I can work with them.

697
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,920
This business with the Winters' court-martial...

698
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,190
...has been an unpleasant distraction.

699
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,250
Indeed it has, sir.

700
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:47,420
However...

701
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:50,870
...your command of Easy Company has been exemplary.

702
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:52,730
Thank you, sir.

703
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:57,780
In fact, except for the actions of a few of your non-coms...

704
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,010
...I believe you've fielded one of the finest companies of soldiers I've ever seen.

705
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,240
Yes, sir.

706
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:08,080
Herbert, Division has established...

707
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,590
...a parachute training school at Chilton Foliat.

708
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:14,110
The idea is for non-infantry types who...

709
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,760
...were vital to the coming invasion...

710
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:20,530
...such as doctors and chaplains, to take jump training there.

711
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:24,300
I can't think of anyone more qualified...

712
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:26,930
...to command such a school than you are.

713
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:31,780
Sir?

714
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,410
I'm reassigning you to Chilton Foliat.

715
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:48,590
I'm losing Easy Company?

716
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:50,720
The war effort needs you elsewhere.

717
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:59,260
Permission to speak, sir?

718
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:00,570
Granted.

719
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:07,570
Is... Who will be replacing me?

720
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:10,940
Lieutenant Meehan from Baker Company is senior.

721
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,490
Good luck at Chilton Foliat, Herbert.

722
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,150
Don't let us down now.

723
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:25,120
No, sir.

724
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:34,270
Carry on.

725
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:28,960
2nd Platoon, listen up.

726
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:31,860
I want the first squad and A-side tents right up there.

727
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:34,830
Third squad, second row...

728
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,080
Holy shit.

729
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,350
No, it's all right. We're tommies...

730
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,780
...not bleeding boche.

731
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:57,050
Is all this real?

732
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,140
Yeah, yeah.

733
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,920
Some is from the Hermans, somebody's tailor's knocked up.

734
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:03,960
For you, so you can get your mince pies on this Jerry clobber...

735
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:05,360
...if you know what I mean.

736
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,590
Not really.

737
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,490
Mack, you got a Luger?

738
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:10,230
I'm dying to get a real Luger.

739
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,500
Yeah, go on then.

740
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:15,230
A quick butchers, yeah?

741
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:21,140
Boy, she sure is a doozy.

742
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:22,510
Yeah, it's pukka, ain't it?

743
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,510
What?

744
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,540
Hey, Petty.

745
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,320
Hey, mate.

746
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:32,920
You're having a bath if you think you're half-inching that.

747
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:34,720
Oh, yeah.

748
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:36,520
Sorry. Well, good luck.

749
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,790
You too, mate.

750
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,930
What's up, Hoobs?

751
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:45,830
These men have been through the toughest training the Army has to offer.

752
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:48,060
Under the worst possible circumstances.

753
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:50,700
And they volunteered for it.

754
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:53,870
Christ, I was just shooting craps with them. It's not like...

755
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:55,740
You know why they volunteered?

756
00:53:55,810 --> 00:54:00,720
So, when things got really bad, the man next to them would be the best.

757
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,910
Not some draftee who's going to get him killed.

758
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,960
Are you ticked because they like me?

759
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:08,980
Because I'm spending time to get to know my soldiers?

760
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:12,020
You've been with these guys for what, two years?

761
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,620
I've been here for six days.

762
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:16,160
You're gambling, Bob.

763
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:18,060
So what? Soldiers do that.

764
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:20,040
I don't deserve a reprimand for it.

765
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:22,100
What if you'd won?

766
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,900
What? What if you'd won?

767
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:35,640
Never put yourself in a position where you can take from these men.

768
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:42,220
Lieutenant Meehan?

769
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:43,320
Enter.

770
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,200
On the last training jump, I had a compass.

771
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:52,190
Close the flap.

772
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:55,370
Then we turn left.

773
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,430
Yeah.

774
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:59,270
Bearing zero-four-two.

775
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,540
12 minutes.

776
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:02,140
Then another left?

777
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:05,810
Call it three-five-eight...

778
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:08,710
...for 10 and a half minutes.

779
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,080
Green light, right over Ramsbury.

780
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,210
Ramsbury.

781
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:14,920
Every single time.

782
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:19,280
Linear distance on the grid of about...

783
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:22,930
Okay.

784
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,020
Ramsbury.

785
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:26,760
Upottery.

786
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,500
So...

787
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:38,010
It's Normandy.

788
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:40,410
St. Marie du Mont.

789
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,040
Causeway Number One.

790
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:43,810
Causeway Number Two.

791
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:45,550
The ultimate field problem.

792
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,950
The estuary of the Douve River divides two beachheads...

793
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:53,620
...code-named Utah, here, and Omaha, here.

794
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,990
Seaborne Infantry will hit these beaches in force...

795
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:59,260
...at a date and time to be specified.

796
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:01,830
H-hour, D-day.

797
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:06,270
Airborne's objective, gentlemen, is to take the town of Carentan...

798
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:10,210
...thus linking Utah and Omaha into a single, continuous beachhead.

799
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,720
...linking Omaha and Utah into one continuous beachhead.

800
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:17,250
Each trooper will learn this operation by heart...

801
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:20,790
...and know his and every other outfits' mission to the detail.

802
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:21,620
Meehan?

803
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:22,890
Yes, Dukeman.

804
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,260
Sir, are we dropping tonight?

805
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:26,320
When it's time for you to know, we'll let you know.

806
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,960
In the meantime, study these sand tables, maps, and reconnaissance photos...

807
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:33,760
...until you can draw a map of the area by memory.

808
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,710
Now, we will drop behind this Atlantic wall five hours before the 4th Infantry lands at Utah.

809
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:44,080
And between our assembly area and the battalion's objective...

810
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:48,450
...there is a German garrison right here in this area, St. Marie du Mont.

811
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,020
Easy Company will destroy that garrison.

812
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:58,120
Three-day supply of K rations, chocolate bars, charms, candy...

813
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,190
...powdered coffee, sugar, and matches.

814
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:04,220
Compass, bayonet, entrenching tool, ammunition, gas mask.

815
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:08,700
Musette bag with ammo, my webbing, my.45, canteen...

816
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:10,200
...two cartons of smokes.

817
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:13,260
Hawkins mine, two grenades, smoke grenade, gamma grenade...

818
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:16,940
...TNT, this bullshit, and a pair of nasty skivvies.

819
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:18,100
What's your point?

820
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,550
This weighs as much as I do.

821
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:22,680
I've still got my chute, my reserve chute, my Mae West, my M-1.

822
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,950
Where are you keeping your brass knuckles?

823
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,390
I could use some brass knuckles.

824
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:29,560
Hey, anything for me?

825
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:29,630
No.

826
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:32,920
Sergeant Martin.

827
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:41,400
For Talbert.

828
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,730
Heavy! condoms?

829
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:48,170
I don't know, probably.

830
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,070
What you got?

831
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,740
"Dear Floyd: Give them hell."

832
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,010
It's from the chief of the Kokomo Police.

833
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,140
Right.

834
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:00,820
You've got to love cops.

835
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,080
All right, listen up, listen up.

836
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:07,820
If you did not sign your GI life insurance policy...

837
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,570
...you go on over and see Sergeant Evans at the headquarters company tent.

838
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:17,200
You boys don't let your families miss out on $10,000.

839
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,370
You hear that, Gerry?

840
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,240
Hey, Lip?

841
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:21,280
Yeah, boy.

842
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,370
Has Guarnere said anything about his brother?

843
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:27,410
No.

844
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,640
I got a problem.

845
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:32,650
My wife keeps up with things back home, casualty lists and like that.

846
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,740
Yeah?

847
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,650
Guarnere's brother in Italy?

848
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,920
Henry?

849
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:38,660
Killed in Monte Cassino.

850
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:42,220
Well, I'm sure he doesn't know.

851
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,130
Damn.

852
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,860
What'd you think I should do?

853
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,400
If it were me, I'd tell him.

854
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:51,060
Couple of hours before we jump?

855
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,970
I don't know.

856
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:05,710
Why are they springing these things on us now?

857
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,480
It's just an extra 80 pounds strapped to your leg.

858
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,120
Does anybody have any idea how the hell this thing works?

859
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,990
Colonel Sink.

860
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,200
Colonel Sink.

861
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:23,640
"Soldiers of the regiment.

862
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:29,070
"Tonight is the night of nights.

863
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:32,140
"Today, as you read this...

864
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:36,080
"...you are en route to the great adventure for which you have trained...

865
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:38,210
"...for over two years."

866
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:40,510
So, that's why they gave us ice cream.

867
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:45,760
Easy Company, listen up!

868
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:50,960
Channel coast is socked in with rain and fog.

869
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,630
No jump tonight.

870
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,390
The invasion has been postponed.

871
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:58,900
We're on a 24-hour stand-down.

872
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:04,870
Well, this is quite a surprise.

873
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:06,140
Not particularly.

874
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:08,240
It so happens I rather expected it.

875
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:14,550
Well, I can't see how you people can pass up $80,000 for the Cause.

876
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,780
For whose cause?

877
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,680
If you're so interested in serving a cause...

878
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,090
...why don't you join the Army?

879
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,650
Next, please.

880
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:26,800
Oh, 4F.

881
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:28,270
You look 1A to me.

882
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,270
You don't look so bad yourself.

883
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:33,300
"Dearest Johnny"?

884
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:36,170
Well, should you be giving blood?

885
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,440
I woke up.

886
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,410
I got the wrong goddamn jacket.

887
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,110
I was struck by lightning.

888
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:53,020
Nobody dancing.

889
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:55,250
It doesn't matter.

890
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,620
"Your pal, Bill Guarnere's brother..."

891
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:32,920
Good luck, lads.

892
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:34,320
See you, tommies.

893
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,660
See you, mate.

894
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:51,600
Try and get these leg straps through.

895
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:57,840
Johnny?

896
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,120
Got something you might be looking for.

897
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,490
Took your jacket by mistake.

898
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,760
I'm sorry.

899
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:11,230
You read it?

900
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:15,160
Where the fuck is Monte Cassino?

901
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,200
I don't know. Italy somewhere.

902
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:23,370
Sorry about your brother, Bill.

903
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,670
I'm sorry for my ma.

904
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:28,310
He was...

905
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,280
Let's get this over with.

906
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,790
Bill?

907
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:44,460
I'll meet up with you over there.

908
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,740
Gentlemen, Doc Roe is handing these out for air sickness.

909
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:55,670
Orders are, "Every man takes one now, another, 30 minutes in the air."

910
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,570
Lieutenant.

911
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:06,880
2nd Platoon, listen up.

912
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:11,850
Good luck.

913
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:15,050
God bless you.

914
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:18,730
I'll see you in the assembly area.

915
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:17,950
If the wire contacts are sensitive, then I think all we should have to do...

916
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,820
Goddamn, Lieb.

917
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,890
That airsick pill is making me loopy.

1
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,670
Standing in the door I could see...

2
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,880
...the lights on the drop zone...

3
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,280
...and I had to assume that was our drop zone...

4
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,980
...way in the ahead of us.

5
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,150
And so that we had the red light...

6
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,890
...I had everybody standing up ready to jump.

7
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,290
So, when the plane started to get hit...

8
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,730
...and suddenly the pilot gives me the green light...

9
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,700
...I'm out the door immediately.

10
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,910
We got such an opening blast from the opening shot...

11
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:11,880
...from the prop blast that it broke this chin strap that we had on this helmet liner.

12
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,150
And that's when I lost this famous leg bag...

13
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,840
...that everybody talks about...

14
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,610
...just from the shock of the opening.

15
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,160
It just flew right off my foot.

16
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,290
We came from the sky.

17
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,160
We hit, and in any direction you went...

18
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,720
...there would be enemy, you knew it.

19
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,230
And that was all part of what you accepted.

20
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,470
How do you prepare yourself mentally?

21
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,870
Each man must do that himself.

22
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:50,510
Each man must prepare himself mentally to make that jump.

23
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,410
At the back of your mind you, you know, you wonder what will happen and all that.

24
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,360
You know you've been trained and trained and trained...

25
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,520
...and what your job is gonna be...

26
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,720
...and what you're supposed to do and...

27
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,420
Oh, that's what you gotta think about, you know?

28
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,160
And we lost a lot of people that night...

29
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,410
...but you try to put it all out of your mind.

30
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,550
Give me a light.

31
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,830
Lip, did Evans make it?

32
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,560
Yes, sir.

33
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,300
He's in Lieutenant Meehan's stick, sir.

34
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,100
Lieutenant Meehan!

35
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,840
Lieutenant Meehan.

36
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,740
Will, could use some help.

37
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,720
Will.

38
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,790
Will, hey.

39
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,830
Will, I need your help here.

40
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,750
Get ready!

41
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,820
Stand up!

42
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,090
Hook up!

43
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,450
Equipment check!

44
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,070
Sound off for equipment check!

45
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,070
Ten okay!

46
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,070
Nine okay!

47
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,140
Eight okay!

48
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,070
Seven okay!

49
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,970
Six okay!

50
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:16,940
Five okay!

51
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,240
Four okay!

52
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,070
Three okay!

53
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,110
Two okay!

54
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,340
One okay!

55
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,750
Jesus Christ! Let's go, let's go!

56
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,940
Does that light look green to you?

57
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,040
No, let's go!

58
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,780
I'm hit!

59
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,830
Jesus, tell Meehan to get them out of there!

60
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,530
Ahh!

61
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,390
2:00!

62
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,220
Oh, Jesus Christ!

63
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,740
Go!

64
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,010
I wanna jump, sir!

65
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,550
Now, listen to me, stay on the plane...

66
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,950
...you're not jumping!

67
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,620
He's okay.

68
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,310
No, sir, no!

69
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,090
All right, son of a bitch.

70
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,040
Where's the goddamn DZ?

71
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,640
Maybe it's three more minutes on this bearing!

72
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,070
We get any lower...

73
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,110
...we ain't gonna need any frigging parachutes!

74
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,270
Slow down!

75
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,040
We gotta get some altitude!

76
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,650
They can't jump at this speed!

77
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,090
We there?

78
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,090
Oh, God!

79
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,560
Oh, no!

80
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,520
Let's go!

81
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,870
Flash!

82
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,970
Shit!

83
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,580
I don't think that's the correct reply, trooper.

84
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,120
I say "flash", you say "thunder".

85
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,210
Yes, sir, thunder, sir.

86
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,030
Musette bag.

87
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,760
Coach?

88
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,030
Sir, it's Hall, sir.

89
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,760
I was on the basketball team.

90
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,290
Leg bag?

91
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,890
Prop blast got it, sir...

92
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,960
...and my radio and batteries with it.

93
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,640
Mine, too.

94
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,340
Mine are somewhere behind those trees.

95
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,410
Okay.

96
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,550
Follow me.

97
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,080
To hell with that!

98
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,510
Wait until they reload.

99
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,020
Go.

100
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,760
Aren't you D Company?

101
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,630
Able, sir.

102
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,160
Guess that means one of us is in the wrong drop zone, sir?

103
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,130
Yeah, or both of us.

104
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,010
Do you have a weapon, sir?

105
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,510
Just my knife.

106
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,640
Do you have any idea where we are, sir?

107
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,240
Some.

108
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,910
So, you're a radioman?

109
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,080
Yes, sir.

110
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,680
Well, I was until I lost my radio on the jump.

111
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,050
I'm sure I'll get chewed out for that.

112
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,950
Well, if you were in my platoon...

113
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,230
...I'd tell you you were a rifleman first, radioman second.

114
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,700
Maybe you could tell that to my platoon leader...

115
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,100
...when we find him.

116
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,800
If we find him.

117
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,030
It's a deal.

118
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,600
First, I need your help.

119
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,510
We'll locate some landmarks to get our bearings.

120
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,740
Keep your eyes peeled for buildings, farmhouses...

121
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,380
...bridges, roads, trees.

122
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,420
I wonder if the rest of them are as lost as we are.

123
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,390
We're not lost, Private.

124
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,330
We're in Normandy.

125
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,730
Who's that?

126
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,400
Lieutenant Winters, is that you?

127
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,640
Get in here, sit down.

128
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,880
Any weapon?

129
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,610
No, sir.

130
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,880
As soon as I hit the prop blast, so long leg bag.

131
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,040
All I got is this knife and some TNT.

132
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,090
These 82nd boys got their M-1s, though.

133
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,120
Oh, man, 82nd, where the hell are we?

134
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,620
Sir, I saw a sign back thataways.

135
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,820
It said, "Sainte-Mere-Eglise".

136
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,430
Flashlight.

137
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,400
Raincoat?

138
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,060
You got a raincoat? Yeah.

139
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,360
We're about seven kilometers away from our objective.

140
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,920
And four hours from when we need to have it secured.

141
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,560
So, we got a lot of walking ahead of us.

142
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,010
You men will stick with us until we find your unit.

143
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,840
Let's go.

144
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,940
Hey, Sarge, where are we going?

145
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,640
Causeway Number Two, Utah Beach.

146
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,410
The Germans flooded the fields inland.

147
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,420
We don't clear the routes, we ain't moving.

148
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,450
Five of us ain't gonna secure a road.

149
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,720
That Louie don't even have a weapon.

150
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,890
I don't remember hearing about any railroads near our objective.

151
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,820
I'm telling you...

152
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,490
...this is the spur line that runs parallel to the river.

153
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,290
We should be nearing a road and bridge.

154
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,560
Yeah, how would you know?

155
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,400
Because I studied sand tails, all right?

156
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,340
Probably a frigging train or...

157
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:50,570
Flash.

158
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,630
Thunder.

159
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,880
Lieutenant, is that you?

160
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,770
Malarkey?

161
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,940
Sir. Sir.

162
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,380
Glad to see you, sir.

163
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,550
Good to see you.

164
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,680
Nice to see you guys.

165
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,150
Guarnere. Sir.

166
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,290
You and Hall up front.

167
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,860
Who the hell is Hall?

168
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,090
Lipton.

169
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,860
Go.

170
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:44,950
Guarnere.

171
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,150
Wait for my command.

172
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,350
That's enough, Guarnere!

173
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,130
Everyone okay?

174
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,130
Yes, sir.

175
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,070
Next time I say wait for my command...

176
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,300
...you wait for my command, Sergeant.

177
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,170
Yes, sir.

178
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,020
Here you go, Lieutenant.

179
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,850
Kraut weapon.

180
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,090
Fine, Quaker.

181
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,050
What's that guy's problem?

182
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,000
Gonorrhea.

183
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,860
Really?

184
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,900
His name, dummy, Guarnere, gonorrhea, get it?

185
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,200
So besides having a shitty name, what's his problem?

186
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,430
None of your fucking business, Cowboy.

187
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,450
All right, let's move out.

188
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,610
Sir.

189
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,550
Quietly.

190
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,160
Did you see him? He just sat there.

191
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,000
He didn't have a weapon.

192
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,630
What's he gonna do, shout at them?

193
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,830
Shouts at me for killing Krauts.

194
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,210
He just wanted you to wait for his command.

195
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,940
Joe, he don't even drink.

196
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,060
Lipton, Wynn.

197
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,600
Anybody need supplies or ammo, now's the time to get it.

198
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,210
McDowell, you okay?

199
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,310
Yes, Sergeant.

200
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,680
Then let's go.

201
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,420
Hey, I promised my kid brother I'd fetch him back a Luger.

202
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,020
So I got first dibs, okay?

203
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,290
Check that one.

204
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:54,960
It's the Navy.

205
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,600
The landings have started, let's go.

206
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,440
Let's move it out. Right on time.

207
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,570
Yeah, tell that to him, Cowboy.

208
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,310
My name's Hall.

209
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,370
That so?

210
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,410
Let's move out.

211
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,640
You just gotta learn to return his fire.

212
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,520
You gotta realize it ain't about you.

213
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,610
He just heard his...

214
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,210
Malarkey, shut your yap.

215
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,650
His brother got it at Cassino.

216
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,220
Found out before we jumped.

217
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,600
'Morning, sir.

218
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,410
Battalion sure will be happy to see you guys.

219
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,610
Where? At the farm, sir.

220
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,650
Top of the morning to you fellows. Enjoying the war?

221
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,310
Where are you from, son?

222
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,590
Eugene, Oregon.

223
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,620
Eugene? You gotta be kidding me.

224
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,750
Popeye, did you hear this?

225
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,630
I'm from Astoria. You don't say.

226
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,220
Yeah, Orange Street.

227
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:00,130
What gives? What are you doing in a Kraut uniform?

228
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,600
Volksdeutsche.

229
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:02,800
Come again?

230
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,800
My family answered the call.

231
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,610
All true Aryans should return to the fatherland.

232
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,610
Joined up in '41.

233
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,310
You're shitting me, right?

234
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,680
Hey, Malarkey, stop fraternizing with the enemy.

235
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,980
Get over here!

236
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,690
What got you to Eugene?

237
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,980
I was born in Eugene.

238
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,530
Really?

239
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,430
Popeye.

240
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,840
Hey, Popeye.

241
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,140
Hey, Harry.

242
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,170
Carry on.

243
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,710
Oh, Easy Company.

244
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,180
Welcome.

245
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,180
Good to see you.

246
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,510
Good to see you.

247
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,180
And this here's Hall, Able Company.

248
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,220
Known as Cowboy.

249
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,350
You from Texas?

250
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,450
Manhattan.

251
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,730
Hey boss, how you doing?

252
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,320
What's going on?

253
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,120
What's the hold up?

254
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,130
Not sure.

255
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,290
Five will get you ten it has to do with that.

256
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,160
Yeah.

257
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,860
It's good to see you, Dick.

258
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,240
Yeah, you too, Buck.

259
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,770
What's the situation?

260
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,830
Not good.

261
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,310
Ninety percent of the men are still unaccounted for.

262
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,070
Lieutenant Meehan?

263
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,580
No, no one's seen him, or anyone from his plane.

264
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,880
You know, if he is missing...

265
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,280
...wouldn't that put you in line to be the next commander of Easy?

266
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,280
Hey, Lieutenant Speirs.

267
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,690
How many men have Dog Company got assembled?

268
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,860
A handful, maybe 20.

269
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,930
You the only officer that made it?

270
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,160
So far.

271
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,690
Still waiting for orders.

272
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,630
You got some cigarettes?

273
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,900
Here.

274
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,640
Hey, keep the pack.

275
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,540
Yeah, so I was in the plant in '39.

276
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,310
That's when I was at Monarch tooling propeller shafts.

277
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,540
No kidding.

278
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,950
What are the chances of that?

279
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,750
You and me 100 miles from each other...

280
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,810
...working at practically the same job.

281
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,320
Hey, Malark, we're waiting on you.

282
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,550
Yeah, I'm coming.

283
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,290
Well, I gotta run, I'll see you around.

284
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,830
Yeah, see you around.

285
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,170
Zigaretten?

286
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,980
Here you go.

287
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,310
Danke.

288
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,450
Danke.

289
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,050
Thank you.

290
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,400
Shit.

291
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,100
Easy Company?

292
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,240
Easy?

293
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,040
Hey, any of you guys know where Easy Company is?

294
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,710
You seen Lt. Meehan?

295
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,150
No, not yet.

296
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:09,290
Well, Major Strayer wants Easy Company's C.O. up front.

297
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,590
Well, I guess that means you, Dick.

298
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,150
Come on.

299
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,250
Son of a bitch.

300
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,660
Hey, Malark, where's the best chow?

301
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,430
In Berlin.

302
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,480
And the MGs?

303
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,710
I'd say right around here, sir.

304
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,410
I can't be sure.

305
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,880
There's some Kraut 88s up ahead.

306
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,380
Up ahead and to the right about, what, 300 yards?

307
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,050
Up through those gardens.

308
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,490
They're right between us and Causeway Number Two.

309
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,680
Firing on to the boys landing at Utah.

310
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,060
Think Easy can handle it?

311
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,360
Yes, sir.

312
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:53,360
'Cause my guess is they're doing some terrible damage there.

313
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,500
The 88s we've been hearing...

314
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:06,470
...have been spotted in a field, down the road aways.

315
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,470
Major Strayer wants us to take them out.

316
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,380
There are two guns that we know of firing on Utah Beach...

317
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,750
...and plan on a third and a fourth...

318
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,410
...here and here.

319
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,720
The Germans are in the trenches with access to the entire battery...

320
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,990
...and with machine-gun cover in the rear.

321
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:28,030
We'll establish a base of fire...

322
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,330
...and move under it hard and fast with two squads of three.

323
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,200
How many Krauts they think we're facing?

324
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,530
No idea.

325
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,630
No idea?

326
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:44,210
We'll take some TNT along with us to spike the guns.

327
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,710
Lipton, your responsibility.

328
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,840
Yes, sir.

329
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,280
Liebgott, you'll take the first machine gun...

330
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,880
...with Petty, A gunner.

331
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,680
Plesha, Hendrix, you take the other.

332
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,980
Who does that leave?

333
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:58,520
Compton, Malarkey, Toye, Guarnere.

334
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,790
Okay.

335
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,790
We'll be making the main assault.

336
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,060
Understood?

337
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,000
Yes, sir.

338
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,470
All right, let's pack it up, boys.

339
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,670
Shouldn't you be outside with the other Able Company guys?

340
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,600
See you around, Hall.

341
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,320
Lipton, when you see we've captured the first gun...

342
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,210
...I want you and your TNT as fast as possible.

343
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,550
Yes, sir.

344
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,350
Okay, just weapons and ammo, drop everything else.

345
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:33,960
Got any spare ammo in a pack or a musette bag bring it along.

346
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,460
Lieutenant, sir?

347
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,160
I was wondering, sir, you need an extra hand?

348
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,860
Ain't you Sink's jeep driver?

349
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,470
So?

350
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,370
Oh, shit.

351
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,840
What's your name, trooper?

352
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:45,770
Lorraine, sir.

353
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,400
You're with me, Lorraine.

354
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,480
Compton, second squad.

355
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,410
Yes, sir.

356
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,500
All right, you heard the word, let's move, let's move.

357
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,810
Three cannons.

358
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,190
Petty, we've got escalating fire.

359
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,460
Right, let's go.

360
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,900
Stay down.

361
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,250
MG-42s.

362
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,320
I'll draw their fire to the right from the truck.

363
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,220
Take two men and hit them from the left.

364
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:07,950
Okay, go.

365
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,080
Right.

366
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,960
Take Ranney, envelop right, give covering fire.

367
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,690
Lorraine, on the machine gun.

368
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,130
Don't give away your position until you have to.

369
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,030
And I want that TNT...

370
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,730
...as soon as we've captured the first gun. Go.

371
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:27,700
Yes, sir.

372
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:46,850
Go.

373
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,900
I can't see nothing.

374
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,310
Come on, Buck.

375
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,340
Oh, shit!

376
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,750
Let's go!

377
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,910
Let's go!

378
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,650
Follow me!

379
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,200
Oh, fuck!

380
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,130
It got my ass!

381
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,710
Sorry, sir.

382
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,180
Jesus Christ!

383
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,150
Fucking jeep jockey.

384
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,920
Shit, I'm sorry, sir.

385
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,150
I screwed up.

386
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,030
Grenade!

387
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,890
Joe, Joe, roll on, roll on!

388
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,100
God!

389
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,600
Shit.

390
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,840
You are one lucky bastard, Joe.

391
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,550
Guarnere, Malarkey, Lorraine, secure that gun!

392
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,680
Compton, covering fire.

393
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,160
Yes, sir!

394
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,000
Where are you hit, Pop?

395
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,570
I can't believe I fucked up. My ass, sir.

396
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,730
Your ass?

397
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,840
Oh, shit.

398
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,880
Popeye, how bad is it?

399
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,680
Sorry, sir, I didn't mean to fuck up.

400
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:03,440
I don't think it's too bad.

401
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,440
Can you make it back yourself?

402
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,790
I think so, sir.

403
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,520
Let's move out.

404
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,020
Right, here we go.

405
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,920
Drop your weapon, Pop, drop your weapon.

406
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,890
Come on!

407
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,590
One, two, three!

408
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,690
Get down, Dick, get down!

409
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,330
Pop!

410
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,370
Popeye, get down!

411
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:28,330
Winters, 1:00!

412
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,110
Grenade!

413
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,480
Toye!

414
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,940
Let's go! Get out of there!

415
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,000
Get out of there!

416
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,910
Toye!

417
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,250
Joe!

418
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:41,980
Jesus Christ.

419
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,280
Fucking twice.

420
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,490
Jesus Christ!

421
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,100
Lorraine, through, go!

422
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,290
Malark!

423
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,940
Ranney, let's move!

424
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,670
They've got the first gun.

425
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,080
There's the second gun.

426
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,420
Grenades first.

427
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,750
Then keep going, go!

428
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,950
Right.

429
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,130
Okay.

430
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,310
Nicht schieBen!

431
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,240
Nicht schieBen!

432
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,710
Bitte, nicht schieBen.

433
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,540
No make dead!

434
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,600
Shut up.

435
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,380
Nicht schieBen!

436
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,810
Shut the fuck up! No make dead.

437
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,750
Stay down, stay down!

438
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,920
Compton! All right, cover for me.

439
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,360
We must be doing something right.

440
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,900
They're so confused they're firing on their own gun.

441
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:08,600
Let's blow this before they realize what's happening.

442
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,900
I'll see what's keeping Lip.

443
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,460
All right.

444
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,440
Toye, cover Lieutenant!

445
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,810
I think one of those dead Krauts has a Luger.

446
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,680
So what?

447
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,810
Keep your head low, Petty.

448
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:21,870
Come on, move it!

449
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,580
Have a little suppress in fire, why don't you?

450
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,810
Jesus Christ!

451
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,710
Malarkey!

452
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,730
Now you stop firing?

453
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:33,560
Beautiful.

454
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,620
Shit.

455
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,790
They must think he's a medic or something.

456
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,800
He's gonna need a goddamn medic.

457
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,390
Okay, okay, okay.

458
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,630
Malarkey!

459
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,870
Get low!

460
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,240
What the hell are you doing? Come on!

461
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,470
Forgot your frigging Luger?

462
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:00,220
You want I should go get it for you, you stupid Mick?

463
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,890
Where's Lipton with that TNT?

464
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,390
Don't know, sir.

465
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,390
You'll be all right.

466
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,660
I'm sorry, I messed up.

467
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,490
Don't be sorry.

468
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,730
Hey, Sarge?

469
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,800
You think this is a ticket home?

470
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,870
Maybe.

471
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,760
Shit, I just got here.

472
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,440
Hiya, Cowboy.

473
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,880
Shut your fucking Guinea trap, Gonorrhea.

474
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,810
He's all right, that kid.

475
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,940
You got a whole Kraut platoon out there.

476
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,450
Probably more, Captain.

477
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,350
You need help?

478
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,550
I need ammo, sir, lots of it!

479
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,590
And TNT!

480
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,850
I've got TNT, sir.

481
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,690
Good job, Private.

482
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,660
Hall, ready!

483
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,570
Sir, I don't have any way to set it off, sir.

484
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,190
Fire in the hole!

485
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,970
Plesha, covering fire.

486
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,430
Third gun, here!

487
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,600
Lorraine, grab some more of those potato mashers and follow me.

488
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,140
Malarkey, Hall, you two, go!

489
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,590
Running a little low on ammo, sir.

490
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,990
How about you, Malarkey?

491
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,030
Okay.

492
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,130
Think you got enough to take the third gun?

493
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,260
We'll soon find out, Dick.

494
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,460
Malarkey, let's go!

495
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,870
Toye, cover!

496
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,500
Okay, Hall, keep your head down.

497
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,570
Hall!

498
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,040
Leave your TNT!

499
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,310
Fire in the hole!

500
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,490
Malarkey, cover the front!

501
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,930
Go to the cannon, go.

502
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,190
Hey, Sarge. I'm looking for Battalion HQ.

503
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,490
Are you kidding?

504
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,360
It's back thataway.

505
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,560
You mean over...

506
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,500
Fire in the hole!

507
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,750
TNT!

508
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,820
TNT!

509
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,980
Don't need it.

510
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,120
What?

511
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,090
Don't need it!

512
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,990
Hall!

513
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,730
Hall?

514
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,400
Where'd he come from?

515
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,940
Winters, Hester said you needed ammo!

516
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,500
Malarkey!

517
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:49,180
As much as you can, everyone!

518
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:53,210
You mind if D Company takes a shot at the next gun?

519
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,610
All yours.

520
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,450
Let's go, Dog Company!

521
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,750
Up and at them, D Company.

522
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,950
Compton!

523
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,750
Who is that, Speirs?

524
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,100
What's he doing out of the trench?

525
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,930
Oh, what the hell's he doing?

526
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,100
Oh, Jesus.

527
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,010
Sir, had a little trouble...

528
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,980
...getting through that first field.

529
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,210
Oh, Christ.

530
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:31,190
We're gonna need it at the next gun.

531
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,720
Once it's blown, have them leave.

532
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:33,950
Go! Yes, sir.

533
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,950
Compton, police them both, then pull out!

534
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,790
Lorraine, Toye, move out!

535
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,000
Move out!

536
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,870
Move out! Move it out!

537
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,840
MGs first.

538
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,470
Fall back to your original positions.

539
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,240
Everyone else, maintain your base of fire.

540
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,920
Okay, back to battalion!

541
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,320
Go, go!

542
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,770
They were 105s, not 88s, sir.

543
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,460
We disabled them and pulled out.

544
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,770
I figure there's maybe 40 or so Krauts...

545
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,110
...still manning three MG-42s to the rear.

546
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,870
Hey, Popeye.

547
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,010
Forty?

548
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,310
Yes, sir.

549
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,540
We killed maybe around 20...

550
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,180
...so, yeah, probably there's 40 left.

551
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,810
I think we need artillery...

552
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:44,250
...or maybe mortars might do the job.

553
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,040
Going my way?

554
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,170
Sure.

555
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,000
Sergeant.

556
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,540
Careful, don't hurt yourself.

557
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,910
Nice ride you got here, Nix.

558
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,040
Straight from Utah Beach.

559
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,610
We should put them to work before they're missed.

560
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:21,960
By nightfall...

561
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:24,550
...Second Battalion had secured Sainte-Marie-du-Mont...

562
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,230
...and elements of the 4th Division were beginning to move men and material inland.

563
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,840
Most of the 101st Airborne, including Easy Company...

564
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:38,000
...were still scattered all over Normandy...

565
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,670
...and the success of the invasion was far from certain.

566
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,110
We had an hour to rest...

567
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,840
...and scrounge for food we could...

568
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,380
...before we had to move south...

569
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,650
...and secure the town of Courville.

570
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,320
...die in the back of this damn truck.

571
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,260
Come on, you're stepping on my legs.

572
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,330
Jesus, let me out of here.

573
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,360
Light, light discipline.

574
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:02,660
Guarnere, close that flap.

575
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,300
Let the Krauts cook their own goddamn food.

576
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:08,100
How are we doing, Malark?

577
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:08,970
We're doing good.

578
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:09,530
Doing good?

579
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,640
What the hell do you know about cooking, you're Irish.

580
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,700
Sir, if you have a reservation someplace else...

581
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,270
Just start dishing it.

582
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,600
Thank you.

583
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,710
Shit.

584
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,510
Jesus Christ, give me some air.

585
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:39,760
'Evening.

586
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:40,870
Hello, sir.

587
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,300
Did something die in here?

588
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:43,770
Yeah, Malarkey's ass.

589
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,200
Any word on Lieutenant Meehan, sir?

590
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,750
No, not yet.

591
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:55,910
Don't that make you our commanding officer, sir?

592
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:58,150
Yeah, it does.

593
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,150
Sir?

594
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:04,160
Joe, the Lieutenant don't drink.

595
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:09,560
It's been a day of firsts.

596
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:17,970
Don't you think, Guarnere?

597
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,800
Yes, sir.

598
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,750
Carry on.

599
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:28,040
Good night, sir.

600
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,320
Oh, Sergeant?

601
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,910
Sir?

602
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:33,150
I'm not a Quaker.

603
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,020
If he's from Lancaster County, he's probably a Mennonite.

604
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,320
What's a Mennonite?

605
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,230
Hey, wait up!

606
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:50,000
What?

607
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:51,440
You know that map you found?

608
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,630
It had every Kraut gun in Normandy on it.

609
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:54,300
Oh, yeah?

610
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,170
Yeah.

611
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:57,770
Here.

612
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,340
Don't ever get a cat.

613
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,480
What's on your mind?

614
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,950
I lost a man today.

615
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:10,310
Hall.

616
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:11,620
Thanks.

617
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:13,420
A John Hall, New Yorker.

618
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:16,900
Got killed today at Brecourt.

619
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,600
I never knew him.

620
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:19,900
Yeah, you did.

621
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:23,830
Radio-op, 506th basketball team, Able Company.

622
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:28,270
He was a good man.

623
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:29,940
Man.

624
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,370
Not even old enough to buy a beer.

625
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:39,020
Not hungry.

626
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,950
Hey, Dick.

627
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,790
I sent that map up to Division.

628
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,350
I think it's gonna do some good.

629
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:33,970
That night I took time to thank God...

630
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,670
...for seeing me through that day of days...

631
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,370
...and prayed I would make it through D plus one.

632
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:45,350
And if, somehow, I managed to get home again...

633
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:48,380
...I promised God, and myself...

634
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:52,050
...that I would find a quiet piece of land someplace...

635
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:55,660
...and spend the rest of my life in peace.

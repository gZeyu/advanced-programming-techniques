1
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,810
If you're a leader, you lead the way.

2
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,780
Not just on the easy ones.

3
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,610
You take the tough ones, too.

4
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,080
A good leader has to understand...

5
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,390
...the people that are under him, understand their needs...

6
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,490
...their desires or how they think a little bit.

7
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,860
It seemed like he always made the right decisions along the way.

8
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,830
He was a real soldier.

9
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,100
Like, some of the officers...

10
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,400
...I don't think I'd follow them into water.

11
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,540
But he was one of the best.

12
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,480
He went right in there and he didn't know.

13
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,520
He never thought of not being first...

14
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,110
...or sending somebody in his place.

15
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,220
I don't know how he survived.

16
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,260
But he did.

17
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,590
Lew?

18
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,360
Wake up. They want us back at regiment.

19
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,130
Come on, Nix, get up. Let's go.

20
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,370
Come on, something's up. Strayer's orders.

21
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,970
Okay, I'll be right down.

22
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,610
Let's go, come on, you got 10 minutes. Go away.

23
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,440
Come on, big guy, let's go.

24
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,080
Leave me alone. Okay.

25
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,450
Come on. Goddamn it.

26
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,750
That's my own piss, for Christ's sake.

27
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,400
Son of a bitch.

28
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,530
We're the only unit in the group...

29
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,130
...that's got the Germans on the German side of the Rhine.

30
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,880
If we'd have taken Antwerp and I'm not saying that would be easy...

31
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,880
...we'd be over the river, well supplied, and have the Krauts on their heels.

32
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,610
Now, if I can just get lke on the phone... Are you listening to me?

33
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,320
Hangin' on every word.

34
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,020
Hey, Moose, you too?

35
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,060
Yeah, whatever's going on, Sink is not happy.

36
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,730
Nixon, Heyliger. Meet Col. Dobie, British 1st Airborne.

37
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,100
Capt. Nixon is our 2nd Battalion S-2. That's First Lt. Moose Heyliger.

38
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,900
It appears the British lost 8,000 men when Market Garden fell on its ass...

39
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,470
...which is why Col. Dobie has been tasked with coordinating a rescue operation...

40
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,710
...for the Red Devils trapped when Arnhem fell.

41
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:08,380
Dutch resistance are harboring 140 of my chaps here just outside a Jerry-held town 15 miles north of the river.

42
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,290
They'll go to the riverbank and gather in the woods tonight.

43
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,520
Pick a team and get them back across the Rhine as fast as possible.

44
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,850
140 men?

45
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,050
Canadian engineers have supplied six boats.

46
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,260
The rendezvous point is isolated and landable.

47
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,100
I swam it myself last night. At approximately 0030 hours...

48
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,500
...they will signal the "V" for victory with a handheld red torch.

49
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,700
That would be a handheld red flashlight.

50
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,400
We'll call this Operation Pegasus.

51
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,840
Bob, your 2nd Battalion is on the spot. Do it.

52
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,710
Capt. Nixon, assist Col. Dobie in every way possible.

53
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,010
If you need anything at all, you come to me.

54
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,450
I can hardly ask for more. Capt. Winters.

55
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,540
You haven't endorsed the Market Garden after-action report...

56
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,350
...or the updated Battalion TO and E. Why is that?

57
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,120
I'll have them at CP at 1300, sir.

58
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,440
I want an inventory on any material the British 43rd left behind:

59
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,960
Rations, medical supplies, transport.

60
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,930
An inventory. Yes, sir. Dick.

61
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,460
I'm still waiting to write citations on that 5 October operation.

62
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,630
I need your report. The report. Yes, sir.

63
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,760
Light a fire under it, Dick. Sir.

64
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,240
Now, goddamn it, we asked for this yesterday...

65
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,680
...and here it is today, a day late and a dollar short.

66
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,050
Enemy disposition and maps in the S-2. We should have a look at that.

67
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,520
You say there's about 100 of 'em?

68
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,690
This is it, boys.

69
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,200
Get across the river, across the field and over the dike.

70
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,330
That's a lot of territory to cover. Where you want us to go?

71
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,470
You, Hashey, you get the penthouse.

72
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,110
Thank you. We're up top.

73
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,440
How bad does it get? You'll find out.

74
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,150
That's a lot of territory to cover. A couple of regular GI Joe's?

75
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,280
You said it. Come on.

76
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,290
New guys giving the replacements the what-for, and why-is.

77
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,330
I swear one of them's never shaved.

78
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,600
Yeah, kids. This is a hell of a dog, Tab.

79
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,400
Thank you, there you go.

80
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,530
What'd you call it, Tab? Trigger.

81
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,110
That's good. I like that. Trigger.

82
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,870
Got anything on this?

83
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,310
No, it's all quiet. We've got penetration!

84
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,650
Alley's hurt, get the doc. Get him on the table.

85
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,180
Yeah, it's Alley.

86
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,390
All right, I got this. Alley, you're gonna be okay.

87
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,020
Boyle, get Doc Roe. Where am I?

88
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,890
Something happened, what happened? Where was it?

89
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,900
Crossroads, where the road crosses the dike.

90
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,360
They knew we was there because of your loud mouth.

91
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,460
Joe, back off.

92
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,470
Lesniewski, send a runner for Lt. Welsh.

93
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,370
Assemble me a squad. Yes, sir. 1st Squad, on your feet!

94
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,240
Weapons and ammo only! Give me room.

95
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,930
Let's move! Let's go!

96
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,730
Boyle, get the boots off, elevate the leg.

97
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,550
Liebgott, use the sulfur.

98
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,580
Let's get this done quickly, we got to move.

99
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,810
Not too much.

100
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,980
Alley.

101
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,220
MG-42? Yeah.

102
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,090
What the hell are they shootin' at?

103
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,260
What's down that road? Regimental headquarters.

104
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,160
But that's three miles away. Why are they giving away their position?

105
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,070
They ain't as smart as me and you?

106
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,970
I'll check it out anyway. Hold here, wait for my signal.

107
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,470
Yes, sir.

108
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,280
Holding here, I'm waitin' for a signal.

109
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,030
This is our fallback position, here.

110
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:42,940
Mortars, deploy here. 1st Squad, on me.

111
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,770
Go.

112
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,740
Second on the right.

113
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,810
First on the right.

114
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,750
Third on the right. Nail the machine gun.

115
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,290
Second on the left, first on the left.

116
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,050
Wait for my signal.

117
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,120
Prepare to fire.

118
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,830
Two rounds, AG, quick.

119
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,990
Fall back! Fire.

120
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:59,870
Fire.

121
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,850
Higgins! Handful of Krauts, based on the dike, 12:00!

122
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,020
How many Krauts are left up there? I don't know.

123
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,420
But we got seven in one blow.

124
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,800
Bring on Boyle and Perconte, go!

125
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,860
Come on, fall back.

126
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,970
Suppressing fire.

127
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,380
Suppressing fire!

128
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,030
Hashey, Garcia, follow me.

129
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,210
Harry, tell Peacock to bring up the balance of 1st Platoon on the double!

130
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,280
And another machine-gun squad, over.

131
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,190
Dukeman!

132
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,920
Go get that machine gun on the right flank, go!

133
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,790
Christenson!

134
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,800
Fuck, Dukeman's down.

135
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,080
Sir, the balance of 1st Platoon are here.

136
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,480
Gordon and More brought another 30 cal.

137
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,060
Sir.

138
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,730
They're behind a solid roadway embankment.

139
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,930
We're in a ditch. They can outflank us along the dike...

140
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,560
...and catch us out here as soon as they figure that out.

141
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,070
So, how many Krauts are we talking about?

142
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,970
There's a ferry crossing here...

143
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,500
...so, it could be a whole battalion, as far as I know.

144
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,410
Okay, what are your orders?

145
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,750
We got no choice.

146
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,390
Here it is. Talbert, you'll take ten men along the dike.

147
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,290
Peacock, you'll take ten men along the left flank.

148
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,630
I'll take ten up the middle, so follow me.

149
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,730
Questions? Go!

150
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,500
Enter.

151
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,860
I don't know why I'm still doing this.

152
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,260
What, drinking?

153
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,770
No, hiding it in your footlocker.

154
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,740
I'm a captain, for Christ's sake.

155
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,010
Why don't you...

156
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,550
Why don't you just give it up?

157
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,670
Drinking?

158
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,490
No, hiding it in my footlocker.

159
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,080
You're a captain, for Pete's sake.

160
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,560
Maybe you're right and this is the perfect place to stop drinking.

161
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,960
Right here on the business end of the Allied advance.

162
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,700
Cheers.

163
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,020
Dick, you know, that's not literature. You just keep it simple.

164
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,720
Try writing it in the first person plural, you know.

165
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,760
Say "we" a lot. Thanks for the tip.

166
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,760
Fix bayonets.

167
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,270
Go on the red smoke.

168
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,470
No, wait! Wait for the signal.

169
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,910
Jesus.

170
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,080
Come on, boys!

171
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,750
Four.

172
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,420
Five.

173
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,490
Holy shit!

174
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,830
It's a whole other company! No shit!

175
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,040
Fire, fire, fire.

176
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:28,010
Easy Beaver to Easy Minor. Reinforce Easy at phase one yellow.

177
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,210
Plus one, strike three. Fire concentration Charlie.

178
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,310
Dropped 200, left 100.

179
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,690
Repeat, plus one, strike three.

180
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,390
Fire concentration Charlie. Dropped 200, left 100.

181
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:47,300
Krauts in the open, fire for effect, over.

182
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,800
Heraus, Hande hoch. Schnell, schnell!

183
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,500
What's he saying? He's telling me that they're Polish.

184
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,740
Don't you believe it. There ain't no Poles in the SS!

185
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,140
Move!

186
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,290
Jesus Christ

187
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,090
Shit!

188
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,600
Luz, send Lightning a contact report. Boyle!

189
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,230
Get up where you can spot the fall of those rounds, go!

190
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,640
Incoming rogues!

191
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,840
Easy Company, take cover!

192
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,680
Boyle's hit! Jesus Christ, they got me.

193
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,020
Take cover, it's German artillery.

194
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,690
Get Boyle, he's down, come on, help me.

195
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,050
Jesus, Captain, they're SS.

196
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,100
Joe?

197
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,840
Joe, knock it off. Damn it, what?

198
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,940
You're bleeding. It's nothing, Captain.

199
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,210
Take these prisoners back to Battalion CP.

200
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,270
Get yourself cleaned up. Yes, sir.

201
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,250
Come on, Kraut boys.

202
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,980
Joe? Yeah.

203
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,760
Drop your ammo. What?

204
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,160
Drop your ammo. You kidding? What are you doing?

205
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,350
Give me your weapon. Captain.

206
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,230
You have one round. Johnny, how many prisoners do we have?

207
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,530
We got eleven right now, sir. Okay.

208
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,800
You drop a prisoner, the rest'll jump you.

209
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:14,340
I want all prisoners back at Battalion CP alive.

210
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,380
Yes, sir.

211
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,920
"They got me." You believe that?

212
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,350
You believe I said that?

213
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,780
Can you make it back to CP? Yeah.

214
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,960
All right, I will see you someplace else.

215
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,190
Take these to Battalion.

216
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,700
Split 'em up. Yes, sir.

217
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,980
Up. All right.

218
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,910
Here you are.

219
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,520
We had 'em on the run.

220
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:04,410
How's that? The Germans were flooding back towards the ferry crossing when we hit 'em with artillery.

221
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,120
It was like a turkey shoot.

222
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:10,030
Then they hit us with their 88s, zeroed in on this crossroad.

223
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,830
Now we were lucky, though.

224
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,920
Only 22 wounded.

225
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,590
Lucky?

226
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,500
Capt. Winters? He's right down there, sir.

227
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,200
All right, carry on.

228
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,880
All right, Krauts, Hande hoch.

229
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,940
22 wounded? You okay?

230
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,050
Yeah, one killed. Who?

231
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,750
Dukeman.

232
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,620
Dukeman.

233
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,730
You're looking at two full companies of SS out there.

234
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,360
About 50 dead, probably another 100 wounded.

235
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:31,740
Seven back in the regimental cage plus a whole string of 'em up there.

236
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,570
That's not bad for Dukeman.

237
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,480
You got a drink?

238
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,880
Of water?

239
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,880
Yeah, it's water.

240
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,860
Thanks.

241
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,430
Okay?

242
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:19,410
363rd Volksgrenadier hit Opheusden early this morning...

243
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:23,450
...about the same time your SS made a run for my CP down the road.

244
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:26,430
3rd Battalion got the hell beat out of 'em.

245
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,560
Holly Horton was killed. Maj. Horton's dead?

246
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:34,130
They hit 2nd Battalion CP in force.

247
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,930
He was organizing the defense.

248
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,570
Capt. Nixon, excuse us for just a minute.

249
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,320
How'd you feel about handling the battalion?

250
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,580
Sir?

251
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,090
I'm moving you up to executive officer of 2nd Battalion.

252
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,720
Col. Strayer is... He could use some help.

253
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:12,270
I know I could handle them in the field, sir. That's right, Dick.

254
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:17,040
You're a solid tactician and a good leader. Don't worry about administration.

255
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,220
Who do you think'll be taking over Easy, sir?

256
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,810
Moose Heyliger can command Easy Company.

257
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,650
Lt. Heyliger would be my choice, sir.

258
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:34,720
Good.

259
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,760
You pack your gear and come to Battalion CP.

260
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,390
Yes, sir.

261
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,900
Would you like some coffee, sir?

262
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:48,460
Yeah, thanks, doc. All right.

263
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,730
Dick!

264
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:55,740
Finish your novel yet? That's a lot of homework.

265
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,540
And I thought executive officer was a fun job.

266
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,780
Who are you? Zielinski, sir.

267
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,920
Who is he? Zielinski, my orderly.

268
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,320
Rank does have its privileges.

269
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,850
Orderly? I suppose you do stuff like get coffee.

270
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,360
Can do, sir. Black, no sugar.

271
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,290
And a bacon sandwich. You want something?

272
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,560
Bacon sandwich.

273
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,210
You can give that to Col. Sink with my compliments.

274
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,470
All that for two pages.

275
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,510
Guess that means that's gonna take a while.

276
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,780
Yeah, it is. You want a job?

277
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,950
There. I think somebody wishes you were back in charge of Easy Company, Moose.

278
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,260
Are you two just here to gloat? No, just rub it in a little bit.

279
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,830
Moose is gonna lead his first mission as CO.

280
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:47,350
Operation Pegasus is set to go off. I wanted to give you the heads up.

281
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,590
Pegasus, yeah.

282
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,190
Yeah, great.

283
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,590
Everybody know their job? We've drilled with the boats all day.

284
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,540
Lt. Welsh is coming along, and the Canadian engineers.

285
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,170
Col. Dobie knows his stuff.

286
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,180
Know how many times you'll cross the river?

287
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,480
If there really are 140 Brits in hiding over there, 3 trips.

288
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,240
Speed is the key. What time's jump-off?

289
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,910
We'll be at the far side of the Rhine at 0100.

290
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,750
Speed is the key. Keep moving and lead the way.

291
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,910
Dick.

292
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,750
Easy's in good hands.

293
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,280
Yeah.

294
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,230
Yeah, right. Well, hang tough. I could say the same to you.

295
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,460
Good luck, Moose. Captain.

296
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,800
Nix? Yeah.

297
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,500
Are we sure on the intelligence of this? I think it's pretty good.

298
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,770
Is Easy walking into another company of Germans no one can see?

299
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,240
Why don't we ask Moose when he gets back?

300
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,210
Right, yeah.

301
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:50,020
If they do run into any trouble, you'll let me know?

302
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,850
Yeah.

303
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,990
You run into any bacon sandwich, do the same, all right?

304
00:29:58,570 --> 00:29:59,860
Yeah.

305
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,830
Line secure, sir. Fall back into position, Private.

306
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,130
I got the 30 cal on the left flank.

307
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,860
Extend it out to the left, 10 yards.

308
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,200
So, Colonel, where are they?

309
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,770
Leicester. Square.

310
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,310
Come on in.

311
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,980
Welcome back, sir. Good to be back.

312
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,240
Heyliger, 506 of the 101st Airborne.

313
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,310
Never thought I'd be so glad to see a bloody Yank.

314
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:57,550
Your show, Colonel. I'll be back shortly.

315
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,650
Go.

316
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,990
Boats are all secure, sir. Bull.

317
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:08,730
The Brits are on the way, pass the word.

318
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,640
Sir, you missed a signature here.

319
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,180
Moose Heyliger? That's me, sir.

320
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,650
God bless you, my man.

321
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,550
We're ready to go, sir. Where's the rest of you?

322
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,880
Right.

323
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:40,850
And here we all are. Let's go.

324
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,500
Wahai, Mohammed! Wahai, Mohammed!

325
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,970
Moose Heyliger and the American 101st...

326
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,740
...have done the Red Devils a great service, making it possible for us to return...

327
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,870
...and fight the enemy on another day.

328
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,480
To Easy Company, victory and Currahee.

329
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,950
Currahee!

330
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:18,700
I was only Easy's CO for four months, Moose.

331
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,800
Before that it was Meehan's company, and before that Sobel's.

332
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,570
But you're the only combat commander they've ever known.

333
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,160
And I'm from another company.

334
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,730
You know where they came from, you know what they've been through.

335
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,240
Just hang tough.

336
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:35,150
Train your new platoon leaders, and trust your noncoms.

337
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,510
Halt!

338
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,780
It's Moose. Hold your fire!

339
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,890
Okay, buddy.

340
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,560
Oh, my god.

341
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,900
Send for Lt. Welsh.

342
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,200
Stay awake on me, Moose.

343
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,100
Here, look in my eyes. Send for Lt. Welsh, now!

344
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,600
Okay.

345
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:04,100
I'm sorry, sir. I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

346
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,370
Jesus Christ.

347
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,810
Where are you from, trooper? Wyoming, sir.

348
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,750
You're a long way from home, Private.

349
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,550
Stretcher! I got him, Harry.

350
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,920
Give him morphine? Yeah.

351
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:16,150
How much? I don't know, two, three Syrettes maybe.

352
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,920
Three Syrettes maybe? Yeah.

353
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,220
Were you trying to kill him? I think it was two.

354
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,660
It's important to let me know...

355
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,130
...how much medication he's had.

356
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,460
I do not see one Syrette on the man's jacket.

357
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:28,020
Sorry, doc. Sure is a good thing he's a big man.

358
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,330
Maybe he'll stand a chance.

359
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,130
We didn't know what to do for his pain.

360
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:34,330
Yeah, but you are officers, you are grownups, you ought to know.

361
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,840
All right, let's go, come on, move it!

362
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,650
Mama, mama, can't you see

363
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,750
What the airborne's done to me?

364
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,820
What the airborne's done to me?

365
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,020
Once more. About face.

366
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,290
Forward march.

367
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,470
Easy still has only 65 percent strength...

368
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,990
...and most of those are replacements, including their new CO.

369
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,230
How's Lt. Dike doing? Three weeks in Holland...

370
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,680
...the guys are already calling him Foxhole Norman.

371
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,710
They're talking about a mid-march action at the earliest.

372
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,770
So, we train the guys for three months, we jump into Berlin, we end the war.

373
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,980
The only thing holding together Easy Company is the NCOs, Toccoa men.

374
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,750
Sir, there's a Sgt. Guarnere here to see you.

375
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,260
Look what the train brought in.

376
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,520
The daredevil. Hiya, Captain.

377
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,990
Welcome back, Bill.

378
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,690
It's true. I never thought I'd see you behind a desk.

379
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,130
Yeah, and someday he'll sit behind it.

380
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,000
I just went awol from the hospital to get back here, sir.

381
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,630
I hope it won't cause you a problem.

382
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,330
Would you care if it did? Not a bit, sir.

383
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:50,840
Got a letter for you here from Moose, Lt. Heyliger, sir.

384
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,470
He's recovering, but it's gonna be a long haul.

385
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,920
Thanks, Bill.

386
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,260
I hear there's gonna be a football game. Those chumps from the 5-0-deuce, right?

387
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:04,920
Yeah, Christmas day. Great, sky train boys.

388
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,000
Can't wait.

389
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,260
Great.

390
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,470
I

391
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,840
I'll just go find some trouble. You do that.

392
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,470
Bill. Sir?

393
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,010
No more joyriding, right?

394
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:34,350
Anybody ever heard of a little joint called Lulu's?

395
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,420
You got me.

396
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,490
I'll just ask around.

397
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,270
I guess now's as good a time as any.

398
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,400
What's that? I don't wanna see another piece of paper.

399
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,270
Gen. Taylor has flown back to Washington.

400
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:59,040
He's left Gen. McAuliffe in charge of the division.

401
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,410
Col. Sink is in Rheims to see Marlene Dietrich.

402
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:04,310
Marlene Dietrich is in Rheims? At the USO.

403
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,780
I'm going to Rheims.

404
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:09,220
Strayer is in London for at least a week for Lt. Col. Dobie's wedding.

405
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:12,420
I am heading back to Aldbourne to look up a certain young lady.

406
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:16,160
What are you telling me? You, my friend, are headed to Paris.

407
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,890
City of light. That's a 48-hour pass.

408
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:22,330
It's been decided that you need a little dose of civilization.

409
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,040
Bon voyage.

410
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,770
I second that.

411
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,570
The airborne is as tough as they come.

412
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,140
Basic training.

413
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,180
You know what I did in basic training?

414
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:15,220
I had to eat rats in basic training.

415
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,620
That's the first time...

416
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,430
Monsieur?

417
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:10,890
Monsieur, c'est le terminus. Le train s'arrete ici, on doit tous descendre.

418
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:04,370
Every time I look at you, I see eight or nine of you.

419
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,040
I'll be all right when I can only see one. Look at me, I'm John Wayne.

420
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:11,600
The costume department set me up with these great navy whites.

421
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,660
Luz, shut up.

422
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,110
What do you think?

423
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:17,640
I'm trying to watch this. I've seen this movie 13 times, okay?

424
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,690
I haven't, so, shut up. Watch the movie. It's fine.

425
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:23,330
Skip. Come on.

426
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,120
Where've you been? I've been lookin' all over for you.

427
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,990
Don, I was at home in Tannawanda.

428
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:31,000
But then Hitler started this whole thing, so, now I'm here.

429
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:34,130
How'd you make out in craps? Not so bad.

430
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:36,800
Here's the $60 I borrowed. You're paying me back?

431
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,930
And, to say thank you... Surprising.

432
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:42,240
...a tip. Jesus!

433
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,710
Shut up! Shut up!

434
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,040
I was up $6,000, but I only have $3,600 left.

435
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,310
What will you do with it?

436
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,680
Blow most of it in Paris as soon as possible.

437
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,740
Gimme a tip.

438
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,250
I don't think that climate in there agrees with you.

439
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,480
As a matter of fact...

440
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,790
...I've been worried about your health altogether.

441
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,290
Hey, Buck. You don't look well.

442
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:03,490
How are you feeling? Your wounds heal, all four of them?

443
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,400
You seen this before?

444
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,030
Buck.

445
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,770
Hi. Is it any good?

446
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,570
Yeah.

447
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:25,380
It's a real corker. I warned you about this girl a month ago.

448
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:33,760
Won't anybody give you a light?

449
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,060
Lip, favorite part.

450
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:42,300
"Got a penny? Got a penny?"

451
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,910
"Got a penny?" Got a penny?

452
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:54,570
What? It's an English penny...

453
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,010
Lights!

454
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,590
Come on. Quiet!

455
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,310
You can't do that to the Duke.

456
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,320
I said, quiet!

457
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:08,060
Elements of the 1st and the 6th SS Panzer Division...

458
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:10,220
...have broken through in the Ardennes forest.

459
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,360
They've overrun the 28th Infantry and elements of the 4th.

460
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:17,430
All officers report to respective HQs. All passes are cancelled.

461
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:21,370
Enlisted men report to barracks and your platoon leaders.

462
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,240
Damn, what a day.

463
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,420
Got a light?

464
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:04,910
Sir? Lt. Peacock?

465
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:08,350
Sir, have you seen Col. Strayer? Where's the company commander?

466
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,750
Lt. Dike, I've been looking for him all day.

467
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,420
How is it that the 4th Army's problem gets dumped on the airborne?

468
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:17,480
Lt. Peacock, Lt. Compton, Capt. Winters.

469
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,220
Lt. Dike, I've been looking for you. We have a problem.

470
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:24,000
Col. Strayer is not back from some wedding in London. Can you believe that?

471
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:27,970
We're going to the front here and our CO isn't even in the same country.

472
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,800
You have a bigger problem. Lt. Dike

473
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,300
Men are returning to action without proper cold weather clothing or enough ammo.

474
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,370
Sir?

475
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,710
I suggest you take a canvass of the entire base.

476
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,040
Get what materials you have before you roll out.

477
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,610
Or have you done that already? No, sir.

478
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:44,180
K-rations, as many as you can scrounge.

479
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,410
We don't know if we'll be resupplied. Yes, sir.

480
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:48,480
What about ammo? There is no more ammo.

481
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,650
Distribute it as best you can so at least everybody has something.

482
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,720
Yes, sir.

483
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,230
Lt. Compton, Lt. Peacock, inform Lt. Shames of the situation.

484
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,990
Equip your platoons as best you can...

485
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,730
...and then report to me, understood?

486
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,100
Yes, sir. Captain.

487
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,420
I guess the blackout's not in effect. Luftwaffe must be asleep.

488
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:33,330
What a difference a day makes, Lieutenant.

489
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,770
Christ, I miss those C-47s.

490
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,170
We've got a tailgate jump here.

491
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:48,010
Where are they sending us? What are we supposed to do with no ammo?

492
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,570
Kid, what's your name again?

493
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:53,920
Suerth. Suerth, Junior.

494
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:56,820
You got any ammo, Junior? Just what I'm carrying.

495
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,020
What about socks, Junior? You got extra socks?

496
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:02,990
A pair. You need four, minimum.

497
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,730
Feet, hands, neck, balls. Extra socks warms them all.

498
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:11,560
Okay, we all remember that one. But did we remember the socks?

499
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,630
I'd give my goddamn boots for a cigarette.

500
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:16,200
We're out of ammo and socks. Anybody got a cigarette?

501
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,570
I bet Junior's got plenty of both. I don't.

502
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:21,170
How about a hat, you got a hat? You got extra ammo?

503
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,710
What about a coat, you got a coat? I need to pee.

504
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,140
How about some smokes then?

505
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,090
Yeah, I got some smokes. Now you're talking.

506
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,920
Over here. Pass them down. Somebody, give me a light.

507
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,150
Keep moving. Come on, keep it coming.

508
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,990
Over to the left.

509
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:43,590
Keep it moving. All the way down.

510
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,280
Get moving, guys.

511
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,950
All right guys, 15 minutes. Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

512
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,190
Keep warm, guys. Where the hell are we?

513
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,190
Sure we ain't in hell, it's too damn cold.

514
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:18,460
Stand back, guys. I've been holding this for the last hour.

515
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,100
Anybody got any matches?

516
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,370
Gather round, guys.

517
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:43,060
Wait right here, don't go anywhere. Welcome to Belgium.

518
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,620
This area's known as Bastogne.

519
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,360
Strategic crossroads town.

520
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,460
Seven roads leading in, seven roads leading out...

521
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:53,970
...which makes it ideal for Kraut armor.

522
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,830
Now, lke wants to make sure...

523
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:58,130
...that the Krauts can't use those roads...

524
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,610
...so, we'll put a perimeter around Bastogne...

525
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,230
...dig in tight as a tick.

526
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:05,410
2nd Battalion will deploy to the east in this wooded area.

527
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,140
Thank God, barely made it. Better get yourself some ODS, Bob.

528
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,190
Okay.

529
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:12,740
1st Battalion's to the north on your left flank.

530
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,910
3rd Battalion's in reserve. Andy, let's roll.

531
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:17,390
Sir, we're a little short on ammunition. How short?

532
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,360
There was a limited supply in camp, sir.

533
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:23,560
Captain, you beg, borrow, or steal ammo, but you defend this area.

534
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:26,120
Yes, sir.

535
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,500
Jesus Christ.

536
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:46,650
Bill, Don, come here, look at this.

537
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,660
Hold on. Jesus, I'm done.

538
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,220
What the...

539
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:02,200
What the hell is going on?

540
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,170
You're going the wrong way.

541
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,570
Pal.

542
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,300
Pal, what happened? Where the hell are you going?

543
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:14,180
They came out of nowhere, they slaughtered us.

544
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:17,770
You gotta get outta here. We just got here. Give me your ammo.

545
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:20,650
Come on. Take it, you'll need it.

546
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,650
Go on, get out of here.

547
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:34,290
Who's got ammo? You got ammo?

548
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:36,460
Gimme your ammo. Who's got ammo?

549
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,660
You got any grenades? Come on, hand 'em over.

550
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,100
Gimme it. You got grenades?

551
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,640
Got any grenades, Lieb? Who's got grenades?

552
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,810
Private, what have you got?

553
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:50,780
Make a hole!

554
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:54,850
Make a hole! Make a hole.

555
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,620
I got ammo, grab what you can.

556
00:49:57,690 --> 00:49:59,950
Lieutenant, you're a godsend.

557
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:03,050
What's the situation? I heard you guys were coming in.

558
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:05,760
There was an ammo dump, so here.

559
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,600
Is it just you guys in the 101st?

560
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:10,460
Looks like. What hit you fellows?

561
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:11,760
Everything.

562
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:16,530
The Krauts had tigers, panthers, SPs, stukers...

563
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,240
And infantry that just kept on coming.

564
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:22,600
What's your name, Lieutenant? George Rice, 10th Armor.

565
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,270
Good work, son. You got any more mortar rounds, sir?

566
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:26,320
We're real short.

567
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:29,840
I'll try to make another ammo run if I can, but don't count on anything.

568
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,120
Thank you, sir. I'll take this, Captain.

569
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:36,950
A panzer division's about to cut the road south.

570
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,190
Looks like you guys are gonna be surrounded.

571
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:43,960
We're paratroopers, Lieutenant. We're supposed to be surrounded.

572
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,330
Good luck. Thanks.

1
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,760
When we left for Bastogne...

2
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,590
...we were short of equipment, we didn't have enough ammunition...

3
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,140
...we didn't have enough warm clothes.

4
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,500
But we had confidence...

5
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,170
...that our higher military authorities would get to us whatever we needed.

6
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,450
And there was a ridge with a tree line. We were dug in on that ridge.

7
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,110
The Germans knew right where we were, and they really gave us a shellacking.

8
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,560
Like in Bastogne, we were down to one round per man there for a while.

9
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,350
The fog was in.

10
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,060
They couldn't drop us or resupply us.

11
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,970
Every time they tried to drop supplies in to us...

12
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,230
...they missed us and dropped them to the Germans.

13
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,070
One of the guys got hit in the arm with a piece of shrapnel.

14
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,540
Took his arm off above the elbow.

15
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,600
And they were taking him out, he said, "Get my wristwatch off my arm."

16
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,520
And then a medic came along, and I think he really saved my life...

17
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:33,580
...because he stuck a Syrette in a key position. Morphine.

18
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,350
Even today, a real cold night...

19
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,550
...we go to bed and my wife will tell you that...

20
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,330
...first thing I'll say is, "I'm glad I'm not in Bastogne."

21
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,730
Duck, duck, duck!

22
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,840
Kommen Sie hier.

23
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,770
Kommen Sie hier, schnell!

24
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,480
Schnell!

25
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,600
Doc, bandage.

26
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,540
Take him back to Regiment.

27
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,040
As you all know, General McAuliffe, Acting Division Commander.

28
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,850
Give it to me straight!

29
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,350
We've been taking ground in one position, General...

30
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,190
...losing it in another.

31
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,220
And now it looks like a standoff. We're digging in on the edge of the forest.

32
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,960
We're under sporadic artillery fire, General.

33
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,900
We're taking a lot of hits, and we have no aid station.

34
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,230
We've run out of food, we have no winter clothes...

35
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,700
...and we have little or no ammo.

36
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:43,130
The line's spread so thin, the enemy wanders into our CP to use our slit trenches, sir.

37
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,440
We just can't cover the line.

38
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,470
Good morning, Captain Nixon.

39
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,670
You got anything to add for General McAuliffe?

40
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,720
General, yes, sir.

41
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:58,590
General, I took a walk along the line about 0300 last night.

42
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,150
Couldn't find the 501st on our right flank.

43
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,160
I tied in with a squad from our 2nd Platoon.

44
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,000
But, sir, we've got some considerable gaps in our perimeter.

45
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,830
I don't have enough people, sir. We're spread too damn thin.

46
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,000
Hold the line, Colonel, close the gaps.

47
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,710
This goddamn fog won't lift any time soon...

48
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,010
...so you can forget about air cover.

49
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,680
Your 1st Battalion just pulled out of Foy, Krauts on their tail.

50
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,840
Tanks, artillery. Got no backup.

51
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,280
There's a lot of shit heading this way.

52
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,240
Can I scrounge a bandage from your aid kit, sir?

53
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,440
How are you fixed?

54
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,040
No plasma, couple of bandages. Practically no morphine.

55
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,940
I tried to find my way up to 3rd Battalion...

56
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,920
...looking for supplies, but lost my way.

57
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,620
If you can't get over to 3rd, hook up with Doc Ryan.

58
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,320
He'll fix you up with what he has to spare.

59
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,990
Thanks, Captain.

60
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,970
Eugene, get everything you can.

61
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,200
You're gonna need it.

62
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,010
Spina. Doc. What's happening?

63
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,480
We're digging in right along the line. Yeah?

64
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,040
Yeah, this is it.

65
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,610
So, what'd you get?

66
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,450
I got this.

67
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,920
And I got myself a Kraut bandage.

68
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,640
What, this is it?

69
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,600
Yeah, that's it, that's all you got.

70
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,200
Jesus

71
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,710
You know, 1st Battalion's pulled out of Foy.

72
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,010
Heavy casualties.

73
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,350
If they're pulling back, why are we sitting here?

74
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,150
We need morphine, this is all I've got.

75
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,390
You got extra scissors?

76
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,020
Just the one.

77
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,250
First Sergeant Lipton! Sir.

78
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,600
What's this?

79
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,600
Two medics in one hole? Yes, sir.

80
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,800
What's gonna happen to us if you take a hit?

81
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,730
Sir?

82
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,100
First Sergeant, where's my foxhole?

83
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,940
It's back here, sir.

84
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,810
Maybe you missed it.

85
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,150
I'll walk you back, sir. You're a bit close to the line here.

86
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,620
Goddamn it.

87
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,390
Sergeant Guarnere, did you keep your morphine from Holland?

88
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,450
No.

89
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,590
Doc, I've gotta talk to you. How's that leg?

90
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,300
To hell with the leg, I'm pissing needles. Later.

91
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,500
Shit!

92
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,740
You seen them?

93
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,510
No. But they're out there.

94
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,110
Depend on it.

95
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,110
Cup of joe, Doc?

96
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,020
Gordon, I need scissors.

97
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,680
You got scissors, sharp scissors?

98
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,050
Scissors?

99
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,150
Well, let's see, I'll have to check the sewing room.

100
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,630
Might be upstairs in the study.

101
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,690
That skinny drawer in the middle of the desk.

102
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:28,260
All right, what about an extra Syrette in your aid kit?

103
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,460
Hide your morphine, guys.

104
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,670
Muck, you all right? I'm good!

105
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,740
Muck, Malarkey, take cover! We're okay!

106
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,150
Take a look at this shit! They've peppered my helmet!

107
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,280
Doc, morphine.

108
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,720
Here, take it! Where's Penkala?

109
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,280
Christ knows.

110
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,120
Medic!

111
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,090
Doc!

112
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,000
Medic! You guys hit?

113
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,670
Doc, what are you doing? Are you crazy?

114
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,550
What are you looking at him for? Watch the goddamn line.

115
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,550
You got a Syrette? No.

116
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,910
Medic!

117
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,180
Medic!

118
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,250
Doc!

119
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,120
Penkala!

120
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,100
Doc! It's the artery, I can feel it!

121
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,460
Penkala, let go... It's the goddamn artery!

122
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,470
Penkala, loosen your fingers, goddamn it!

123
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,830
I'll bleed to death. Relax your arm, Penky!

124
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,000
It's not the artery. I ain't going back, Doc.

125
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,410
What? I ain't going nowhere, not in this shit.

126
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,310
You don't wanna go, and you yell medic?

127
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,310
I don't need to go back to no aid station.

128
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,210
You're in luck, Penkala, because we don't got no aid station.

129
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,490
Penkala, I need scissors. You got scissors?

130
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,030
What the hell I need scissors for?

131
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,830
Got your aid kit?

132
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,310
Right, you don't need this, not yet.

133
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,500
I do.

134
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,510
Who got hit? Penkala.

135
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,020
All right, this is what I want you to do.

136
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:27,220
I want you to take someone and work your way to the 3rd Battalion.

137
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,020
You know what we need: Bandages, plasma.

138
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,920
Whatever you can beg, you beg, all right?

139
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,160
And get me some goddamn scissors. I can't get any.

140
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,860
And you get yourself a hot meal, too.

141
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,290
Go.

142
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,920
You know, he told me he was a goddamn virgin.

143
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,080
Who?

144
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,290
The replacement in my foxhole, Julian.

145
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,790
Yeah?

146
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,060
Goddamn virgin. Just a kid.

147
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,830
The only virgin I know is the Virgin Mary.

148
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,440
Hey, Babe, where the hell are we?

149
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,870
This way.

150
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,170
I don't like it.

151
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,720
Where the hell is 3rd Battalion?

152
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,150
Shit!

153
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,550
Come on.

154
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,190
Come on, come on, give me a hand. Go, go!

155
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,430
Come on, Spina, move! I'm moving!

156
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,490
Get moving! Come on, go!

157
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,360
Okay, we can spare a few bandages, but that's it.

158
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,600
No morphine.

159
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,730
You'll have to go back to Bastogne for plasma.

160
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,400
It took us an hour to find you.

161
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,910
Doesn't your surgeon have plasma?

162
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,880
We don't have one. No surgeon, no aid station, nothing.

163
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,010
Just me and my buddy.

164
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,850
Sorry, guys, but we just can't help you.

165
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,390
Take cover!

166
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,750
Get your butts out of here! We're pulling back!

167
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,590
Come on, let's go!

168
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,790
Move!

169
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,990
Should have shot Hinkle in the ass! And you would have shot him in the ass!

170
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,090
God bless ya.

171
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,210
Yo, these smell like my armpit.

172
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,040
At least your armpit's warm.

173
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,380
Do you want syrup with that?

174
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,470
Joe, be honest. What's in these things anyway?

175
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,880
Nothing you won't eat, Malarkey. I won't eat malarkey.

176
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,180
Maybe Hinkle would like your share?

177
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,780
Should've shot him when I could. Running backwards?

178
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,790
Anybody seen Lieutenant Dike?

179
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,060
Try Battalion CP, sir.

180
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,050
Try Paris.

181
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,530
Try Hinkle.

182
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,060
"Hinkle, sweetie, I'm home."

183
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,960
Eugene, Lieutenant Dike's got a full aid kit. Try him.

184
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,770
Yeah, I'm sure he's not using his.

185
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,640
Maybe Hinkle's got a Syrette for you.

186
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,040
Eat your strudel. Hinkle-vinkle, eat the armpit?

187
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,580
Lieutenant Dike.

188
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:18,230
Can you spare something from your aid kit? I'm short. I need Syrettes.

189
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,350
What, morphine? Yes, sir.

190
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,260
What happens if I get hit?

191
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,800
I'll be there, sir.

192
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,200
Syrettes in here, right? Yes, it is.

193
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,440
Here.

194
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,110
I don't plan on getting hit.

195
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,710
Thank you, sir.

196
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,220
Heffron.

197
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,150
Heffron, you okay?

198
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,720
Gene, what is with the Heffron bullshit?

199
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,560
You know my name. Why don't you use it?

200
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,390
It's Edward, right?

201
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,470
Edward? Are you serious? Only the goddamn nuns call me Edward.

202
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,630
I need to know if you kept your morphine from Holland.

203
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,230
No, you asked me already, remember?

204
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,700
No, I don't recall.

205
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,890
Gordon, you want me?

206
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,960
Oh, yeah, morphine.

207
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,930
3rd Platoon ponied up the contraband.

208
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,540
You still looking for scissors?

209
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,630
Yes, I am.

210
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,830
Perconte.

211
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,200
Perconte?

212
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,470
Doc.

213
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,940
Thank you.

214
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:45,040
And you'd better check on Joe Toye out on the OP.

215
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,150
He's missing something.

216
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,280
Thanks.

217
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,330
You guys okay?

218
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,030
They got hot food. Can you smell it?

219
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,110
Toye, are you missing something? Home.

220
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,070
Ask him to dance, Doc.

221
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,870
Toye, show me your feet.

222
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,510
You watch the goddamn line, McClung.

223
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,150
Where are your boots? In Washington, up General Taylor's ass.

224
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,710
I don't believe this. I can move better in bare feet, Doc.

225
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,320
What happened?

226
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,530
I took them off to dry my goddamn socks.

227
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,760
They got blown to hell, okay?

228
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,270
What's your size?

229
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,670
Nine, just like everybody else.

230
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,370
Frank, you keep cleaning those teeth, the Germans will see you a mile away.

231
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,180
Shoot you dead. That's right, Pee Wee, you keep laughing.

232
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,680
Hey, Doc.

233
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,450
My stuff!

234
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,950
Come on, Doc. You got a drug store in here?

235
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,790
No, I own my stuff.

236
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,380
What are you looking for?

237
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,860
Scissors. Thank you, Perconte.

238
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,060
My goddamn scissors!

239
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,800
Sergeant Guarnere. Gene, is that you?

240
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,360
Hey, Doc! Doc, come here!

241
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,670
USO. Picking up Syrettes. Alley, Liebgott, you got any?

242
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,080
No, got used in Holland, Doc.

243
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,880
You ain't using this stuff, are you, Doc, personally?

244
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,040
Come on.

245
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,110
Hey, Doc, I still got the itching.

246
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,780
Every time I pee, it's murder.

247
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,350
I'm sorry, but I don't have penicillin for your...

248
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,450
My what?

249
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,820
Make sure you move around. Get your blood flowing.

250
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:35,880
I can't feel my feet.

251
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,520
That's why you gotta move, so you don't get trench foot.

252
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,720
Should I take my boots off?

253
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,130
All you gotta do is just loosen them up, keep moving.

254
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,700
Sergeant, I'm sorry.

255
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:47,930
Look, I know it must be hell, but I can't help you, all right?

256
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,300
Just drink lots of water.

257
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,070
Water? It's pissing that hurts!

258
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,270
Shut it! Shut the hell up!

259
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,610
What's going on here, Bill? Who the hell's singing?

260
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,410
I'll find out, Lieutenant. I'll find out, I'll shut them up.

261
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:23,840
"Lord, grant that I shall never seek So much to be consoled as to console

262
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,070
"To be understood, as to understand Or to be loved

263
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,550
"As to love with all my heart.

264
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,520
"With all my heart"

265
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,620
Medic!

266
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,890
Medic!

267
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,660
Perconte, you getting a jeep? I'm on it, Doc.

268
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,610
Look what they did to my leg! Easy CP!

269
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,580
Easy CP, this is Perconte. Sisk has been hit and I need a jeep.

270
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,410
I say it again, I need a jeep now!

271
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,520
They're moving, goddamn it! We need it now!

272
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,120
Okay, Sisk, it ain't that bad.

273
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,950
Ain't that bad?

274
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,830
Pull!

275
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,670
No, Doc, save the morphine, I can make it. I can make it, save it, okay?

276
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,370
All right, let's get him out of here.

277
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,810
Where's the goddamn jeep? I don't know, but I hear it.

278
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,650
Jesus Christ!

279
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,480
You got blood all over my trousers.

280
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,750
I'm real sorry, Frank!

281
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,230
Get him up.

282
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,420
Damn it, Skinny.

283
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,370
Tell Spina I went in for plasma.

284
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,780
All the tanks, artillery, are pulled back to here.

285
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,180
We've got no backup beyond Bastogne. This is it.

286
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,850
The Krauts captured the 326th Medical, and they took everybody...

287
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,580
...doctors, medics, the whole shebang.

288
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,250
We got nothing.

289
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,860
They're giving the boys hooch for the pain.

290
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,170
He took a mortar hit. Watch the leg.

291
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,840
Yeah, watch the leg. Get him in.

292
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,680
Move it! Coming through.

293
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,240
'Morning, fellas.

294
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,360
No, no, here, put him here.

295
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,830
Yes, ma'am.

296
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,060
Is he bad?

297
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,630
No, lower-leg wound, no morphine.

298
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,440
Nurse, have you got plasma? I can...

299
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,000
Wait, please.

300
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,510
What's going on here? Why aren't these men evacuated?

301
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,810
We can't evacuate. We're cut off.

302
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,940
This is as far as it goes.

303
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,190
Faites attention aux deplacements.

304
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,500
Ca va?

305
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,740
Ce n'est pas grave, ce n'est pas urgent.

306
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,440
I'm in heaven, Doc.

307
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,450
Pas encore, Dieu merci.

308
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,740
Nurse?

309
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,480
This way.

310
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,640
I need morphine, I need bandages, whatever you've got.

311
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,790
Okay, I can give you a little, but not a lot.

312
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:38,890
There you go. You can have this today.

313
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:39,990
Do you want that?

314
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,700
Wait. You got plasma?

315
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,070
A little.

316
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,330
Are you a surgeon?

317
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,140
No, we don't got no surgeon.

318
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,640
What's this?

319
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,400
From the bed.

320
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,910
What, sheets? Yes, for bandages.

321
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,580
Voila. Merci.

322
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,320
Comment vous appelez-vous?

323
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,190
My name is Renee.

324
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,090
I'm Gene, Eugene Roe.

325
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,390
Where are you from?

326
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,360
Louisiana, half-Cajun.

327
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,160
Et toi, d'ou viens-tu?

328
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,530
Bastogne.

329
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,110
Can you get me back to the line?

330
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,770
Sure.

331
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,480
Eugene.

332
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,060
Chocolat.

333
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,060
Pour vous.

334
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:57,270
Benedictio dei omnipotentis patri et filii...

335
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:01,240
...et spiritus sancti descendat super vos...

336
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,380
...et maneat semper.

337
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,250
Amen. Amen.

338
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,320
Fight well for your God and your country.

339
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,990
God bless you all, and stay safe.

340
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,390
That's it, guys, nothing more to worry about.

341
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,660
We're gonna die now, we're gonna die in a state of grace.

342
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:21,000
Isn't that right, Babe?

343
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,100
Battalion want a reconnaissance patrol.

344
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,160
Kraut hunting.

345
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,330
All right, I'll go. Take these.

346
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:29,740
Give the boots to Joe Toye. Tell him they're a nine.

347
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,610
Keep going, till we make some kind of contact.

348
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:41,350
Peacock's leading, right? Right.

349
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:44,020
Asshole couldn't find a snowball in a blizzard.

350
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,960
That's what's happening, that's the order.

351
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,360
Sarge? Yeah, Julian.

352
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,760
Let me be the lead scout.

353
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,890
Back of the line, Private.

354
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,420
All right, that's it, let's move out. Tactical columns, gentlemen.

355
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,230
Doc, it's a combat patrol.

356
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:59,500
Why don't you stay back and keep your ass out of trouble?

357
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,410
Yes, sir. Yeah.

358
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,650
Come on, Hoobler, pick it up.

359
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,530
Right, move on.

360
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,540
Go.

361
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,050
Fire! Get down! Get down!

362
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,720
Jesus!

363
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,760
Shit!

364
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,700
Bull! Christenson!

365
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,340
Up on line!

366
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,410
Johnny!

367
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,940
We got a man down!

368
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,810
Jack, over here.

369
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,080
What have we got?

370
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,590
Keep still, Julian! We've gotta make a move!

371
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,490
I can get him, Sarge.

372
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,620
Suppressing fire!

373
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,760
One man down, Easy!

374
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,420
Covering fire!

375
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,880
Easy CP, I have one man down!

376
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,720
Okay, stay there, don't move!

377
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,450
Stop moving, or else they'll keep shooting!

378
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,530
What's happening, sir?

379
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,960
We're pulling back.

380
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,570
We made contact. I gotta get to the CP.

381
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:13,670
Don't move! Stop moving! They'll keep firing! Stop moving!

382
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,040
Jesus Christ, fuck it!

383
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,550
John! What?

384
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,780
Pull back, we gotta pull back!

385
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:25,290
Let's get the hell out of here! Let's go, let's go!

386
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,220
Move! Go!

387
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,680
Stay with us, stay with us!

388
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,130
Hold on, Julian! Stay with us! Look at me, stay with us!

389
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,070
Look at me, hold on, hold on!

390
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,000
Don't move, Julian, we're coming back!

391
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,160
We'll get you out of here, just hold on!

392
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,210
Go! Let's go!

393
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,650
Move!

394
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,710
Come on, let's go! Where the hell are we?

395
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,690
Straight ahead, straight ahead!

396
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,050
Doc!

397
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,830
Okay, Christenson set it up on the rock.

398
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,240
Easy CP, Easy CP, lightning. Over.

399
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,270
I need an A-jeep standing by at the CP.

400
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,100
Okay, got you a jeep, Doc.

401
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,410
Martin!

402
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,350
Sir! What's going on?

403
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,440
They got Julian!

404
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,680
He's still alive! We don't know that!

405
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,310
We gotta go get him! Did you hit an OP or their line?

406
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,360
Their line, sir!

407
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,390
We've gotta go back, get Julian out of there!

408
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,590
No, fall back! We lost Peacock.

409
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,690
No, he's back at the CP. Come on, Martin, fall back!

410
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,530
Get him out of here!

411
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,430
Let's up and go!

412
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,170
Doc, we've gotta move now, Doc. Come on, let's go!

413
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,000
Doc, now, let's go!

414
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,340
Move!

415
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,680
Let's go! Fall back!

416
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,930
We couldn't get to him, Captain.

417
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,030
We tried. Babe tried. We couldn't get to him.

418
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,720
Let me sit in here with you guys.

419
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,470
Heffron?

420
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,500
Toye.

421
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,470
What you doing out here?

422
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:38,940
Thanks for the boots, Doc. Doing fine.

423
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:42,520
Are you still having trouble with your feet?

424
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,590
Show me, let me see it.

425
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,870
It's trench foot, Toye.

426
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,770
If it turns gangrene, you could lose it.

427
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,280
I ain't coming off the line, Doc.

428
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,650
You gotta stay dry.

429
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,780
Massage your feet.

430
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,220
Change socks every day and dry the wet ones around your neck.

431
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,890
Trying. Do it.

432
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,660
I'm working on it.

433
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,670
You seen Heffron? No.

434
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,460
Why?

435
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,570
He ain't in his hole.

436
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,610
Fuck.

437
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,790
Got you.

438
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,300
Heffron?

439
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,040
Edward?

440
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,710
Eat it.

441
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,590
Good.

442
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,560
Perfect.

443
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,770
I promised him, if he got hit...

444
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,140
...I'd get his stuff and bring it to his ma, you know?

445
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,940
Now the fucking Krauts will strip him.

446
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,750
No, it's okay.

447
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,880
It's not! It's not okay.

448
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,650
I should've got to him.

449
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:39,020
What do you call those people again? Those Cajun healers?

450
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,330
Traiteurs.

451
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,800
You know, my grandma was a traiteur.

452
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:48,400
Your grandmother? No shit?

453
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,770
She was.

454
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,470
Laid her hands on people and cured them.

455
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,720
Took away sickness, cancer, you name it.

456
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,220
Your grandma did that? You're shitting me.

457
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,880
I remember she used to pray a lot.

458
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,080
Yeah, I guess she had to.

459
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,060
Talked to God about the pain she pulled out.

460
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,960
Asked him to...

461
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,700
...carry it away.

462
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,970
That's what she did.

463
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,770
Jesus.

464
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,410
I'm still trying to figure why they picked me for a medic.

465
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,850
God knows.

466
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,590
Snap of a finger, and just like that, you're a medic.

467
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,760
I've had enough playing doctor.

468
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,720
How about you?

469
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,820
Joe.

470
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,030
Cease fire!

471
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,040
Cease fire, goddamn it!

472
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,600
Sergeant, I don't understand! It was our own planes!

473
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,600
C-47's.

474
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,070
They're bringing supplies. It's a drop.

475
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,240
It's a drop, come on!

476
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,910
All right, help the doc.

477
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,190
The rest of you come with me.

478
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,030
Medic!

479
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,660
Someone give us a hand here!

480
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,830
Help, help!

481
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,870
This one through here.

482
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,500
Now, vite!

483
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,090
Fais pression, essaie de trouver I'artere.

484
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,680
Oui, d'accord.

485
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,730
The artery, gotta find the artery!

486
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,960
Moi, je ne la trouve pas!

487
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,870
Anna!

488
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:26,730
Anna!

489
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,130
Je ne la trouve pas!

490
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,620
Where does she come from?

491
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,660
The black girl?

492
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,140
The Congo.

493
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,270
How'd she get here?

494
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,600
Just like me.

495
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,070
She came to help.

496
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,790
Chocolat?

497
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,440
What?

498
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:37,350
Your hands.

499
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,680
My hands?

500
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,390
You're a good nurse.

501
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,700
No.

502
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,140
I never want to treat another wounded man again.

503
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:03,680
I'd rather work in a butcher shop.

504
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,750
But your touch...

505
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:12,480
...calms people.

506
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,760
That's a gift from God.

507
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:18,620
No, it's not a gift.

508
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,130
God would never give such a painful thing.

509
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,410
Nurse!

510
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:38,090
Nurse!

511
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,110
We need some help over here!

512
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,580
Guy's shot through the stomach.

513
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,180
How bad is it?

514
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,720
Okay, get this one in first.

515
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,530
You'll be all right.

516
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:24,250
Now we know how they felt.

517
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,560
What? Who?

518
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:29,100
The legionnaires...

519
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,670
...when they were watching the Huns...

520
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,860
...the Goths, the Visigoths.

521
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,360
Visigoths? Jesus Christ.

522
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:39,310
Barbarians.

523
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,770
They came right through here.

524
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,980
Right through these trees, just sweeping down...

525
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,580
...to burn the shit out of Rome.

526
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:51,180
That's a hell of a long ride.

527
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,520
So what's college like, Buck?

528
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:57,760
You got time to hit the books...

529
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:01,660
...with cheerleaders running their fingers through your hair?

530
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,930
Hell, Babe I can't even remember.

531
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,240
Hey, it's Doc.

532
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,780
Sergeant. Heffron.

533
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:16,350
Lieutenant.

534
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,940
Wrap up.

535
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,180
Never calls anybody by their nickname.

536
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,550
He once called me Edward.

537
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,650
Is that right?

538
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:29,890
Edward? That's your name?

539
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,990
Yeah.

540
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,260
Funny.

541
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:35,630
You don't look like an Edward.

542
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,440
Hey, Doc.

543
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,540
It's gonna get busy, pal.

544
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:25,050
Hold your fire, boys. Don't let them draw you out.

545
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,020
Hold your fire! Stay ready, boys.

546
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:30,020
What the hell are we gonna hit those things with, Lip?

547
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:32,610
Hold your fire! Get ready, Walter!

548
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,950
Stay in your holes, guys.

549
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,570
Smokey's hit! Medic!

550
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:47,030
Eugene, let's go!

551
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,930
Come on, let's go! Okay.

552
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,070
Go!

553
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:53,610
Ready.

554
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,310
Medic!

555
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:01,980
Doc! Smokey!

556
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,440
Hi, Mo.

557
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,990
I got it, I'm keeping it for you.

558
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:07,050
Smoke! I can't feel my legs, Gene.

559
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:09,320
Take it easy. My foxhole, get the plasma, now!

560
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,950
Here they come!

561
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,130
You got them? I got them. Go!

562
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,100
Machine guns, open fire!

563
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,920
Open fire!

564
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,970
Sergeant Lipton!

565
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,650
Doc, we gotta get the hell out of here.

566
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,910
Stay with us, Smokey. Stay with us!

567
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,390
We gotta get the hell outta here!

568
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,790
You ready?

569
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,390
All right, go!

570
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,570
Stop, we've gotta stop. All right.

571
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:35,470
Take the plasma. All right.

572
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,140
Come on, Walt.

573
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:42,720
Come on, buddy.

574
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:45,490
Hurry, Doc, come on, Doc. I've gotta get back to the line.

575
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,960
Okay, okay.

576
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:49,320
Lip? Yeah, buddy.

577
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,690
You're standing on my hand.

578
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,570
Sorry.

579
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,890
Look, I'll get you another Purple Heart for it.

580
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,570
Give us a hand!

581
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:07,840
I got you a ride, Doc.

582
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,060
Jones!

583
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:26,360
Give it here.

584
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,200
Okay, put him here.

585
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,330
Where's his tag?

586
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:34,170
Where's his tag? What's wrong with him?

587
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:35,970
Paralyzed.

588
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,170
What?

589
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,000
He's paralyzed.

590
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,840
Can't feel a thing.

591
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,720
"In the name of the Father of the Son and of the Holy Spirit

592
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:54,020
"Amen"

593
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,030
Eugene?

594
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,910
Are you... Renee, I need some help here.

595
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,610
Are you all right?

596
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,110
Renee!

597
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:40,640
Here you go, man.

598
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:43,080
One for the doc? Sure.

599
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:54,980
Doc?

600
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:14,070
Better than sitting down to a Christmas Eve dinner of turkey and hooch back at the division CP.

601
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:18,310
Damned if I don't like old Joe Domingus' rancid-ass beans better.

602
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:21,180
Hello, Easy Company. Hello, sir.

603
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,510
Hello, sir.

604
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,710
General McAuliffe sent a message to the entire division.

605
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:28,020
I thought maybe your people would like to hear it.

606
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:30,080
That should be your prerogative, sir.

607
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,520
All right.

608
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:33,350
Men!

609
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,590
General McAuliffe wishes us all a Merry Christmas.

610
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:42,230
"What's merry about all this, you ask.

611
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,640
"Just this.

612
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:50,100
"We've stopped cold everything that's been thrown at us from the north, east, south and west.

613
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:56,270
"Now, two days ago the German commander demanded our honorable surrender...

614
00:51:56,350 --> 00:52:00,150
"...to save the USA encircled troops from total annihilation.

615
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,460
"The German commander received the following reply:

616
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:07,020
"'To the German commander:

617
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:08,490
"'Nuts! '

618
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:16,660
"We're giving our country and our loved ones at home a worthy Christmas present.

619
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,000
"And being privileged to take part in this gallant feat of arms...

620
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:24,270
"...we're truly making for ourselves a merry Christmas."

621
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,780
Merry Christmas to you all, and God bless you.

622
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:28,010
Merry Christmas, sir.

623
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,210
Nuts!

624
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,380
Bill.

625
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:39,950
Picture of my girl.

626
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,350
Good looking broad, Buck.

627
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,530
She's...

628
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,330
She's finished with me.

629
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:55,660
Yeah?

630
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:57,400
Yeah.

631
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,530
Yeah, she's...

632
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:10,780
Just in time for Christmas.

633
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:17,820
Just in time for Christmas.

634
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,860
Shit! I almost forgot.

635
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:30,440
Lucky Strikes means fine tobacco. Where the hell did you get those?

636
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:32,480
Merry Christmas, fellas.

637
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,240
Gotta thank jolly old Saint Luz.

638
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:37,510
Beautiful.

639
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,020
There you go, Penk.

640
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:54,160
I am shaking so goddamn much I feel like I'm dancing.

641
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,900
There you go, buddy. There you go.

642
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:59,190
Frank, what are you doing?

643
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,990
It's Christmas, Pee Wee.

644
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:03,530
Here, Frank.

645
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:06,240
What is it? Lemon-powder snow cone.

646
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:08,840
Pass. Merry fucking Christmas.

647
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:18,180
Harry.

648
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:24,720
Fire's not a good idea. Just a couple of minutes.

649
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,490
We're in a dell.

650
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:30,790
A dell?

651
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,970
Like where fairies and gnomes live?

652
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,110
I swear I thought I could smell a fire.

653
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,810
I did smell a fire.

654
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,040
Are you out of your mind?

655
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:50,210
We're in a dell.

656
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:54,450
Down! Crossfire!

657
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,960
God, no!

658
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:08,430
This is Captain Nixon. I need an A-jeep for Second Battalion CP.

659
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:11,130
Stay still, Harry. Doc, put that out!

660
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:13,840
Repeat, A-jeep for Second Battalion CP.

661
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,110
Medic!

662
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:16,310
Doc!

663
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:23,650
Come on, Doc.

664
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:24,780
Is he hurt? I don't know.

665
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:26,350
Move, get in!

666
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:27,580
Doc!

667
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:31,190
I gotta go.

668
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,560
Eugene, come on, get up. The captain's yelling.

669
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:36,400
Come on, get up. Okay.

670
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:38,030
Okay, get up! Not lie down!

671
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,940
Okay, get up, come on, move! Jesus Christ!

672
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:44,600
My hand, my goddamned hand!

673
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,340
Roe!

674
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:56,680
Jesus!

675
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,150
Okay.

676
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,550
Roe?

677
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,600
Stay still, Harry.

678
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,900
Just a scratch. You're not getting out this easy.

679
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:19,200
Jeep's on it's way. Hang tough. Here's a towel.

680
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,080
Towel.

681
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,050
Yeah sure.

682
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,150
I got morphine in my pocket. Give it to him.

683
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:38,660
Where you want it? Opposite thigh.

684
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:39,860
Okay.

685
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:46,930
Elevate his head.

686
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,640
Get him up.

687
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:57,080
There you go, soldier, take that.

688
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:05,380
Eugene, get yourself into town, get a hot meal.

689
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:25,230
Get out, quick!

690
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:33,780
Clear the road!

691
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,540
Get out, quick!

692
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:29,070
Stay out of there!

693
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:48,260
Keep moving!

694
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,470
Medic!

695
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,580
Get your ass out here!

696
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:12,680
Come on!

697
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:22,020
Every hour, on the hour, on the radio, but I don't know where the hell you are.

698
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,070
Everything okay?

699
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:47,070
Babe?

700
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:50,110
Yeah.

701
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:54,350
How'd you do that?

702
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:56,950
You did that.

703
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:01,620
I'll fix it up.

704
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:34,390
Hey, Gene. You called me Babe.

705
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,790
I did?

706
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:37,360
When?

707
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:40,160
Just now.

708
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,500
Babe.

709
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:50,270
I guess I did.

710
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,010
Babe.

711
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:00,750
Heffron, watch the goddamn line.

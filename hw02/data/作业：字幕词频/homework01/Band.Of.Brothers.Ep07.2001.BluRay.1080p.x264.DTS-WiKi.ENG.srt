1
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,390
I've seen death, I've seen...

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,850
...my friends, my men being killed.

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,250
This is...

4
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,630
It doesn't take too many days of that and you change dramatically.

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,300
We were hungry, we had no food...

6
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,570
...we didn't have ammunition, it was cold, didn't have any clothes.

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,070
You couldn't build a fire.

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,510
If you did, some crazy thing would shoot at you.

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,070
Every where you would look, you would see dead people.

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,020
A dead soldier there, here. Ours, theirs.

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,290
Then civilians besides. Dead animals.

12
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,830
So, death was all over.

13
00:00:50,890 --> 00:01:00,890
You don't have a chance when your friends go down to really take care of them as you might.

14
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:06,040
And especially if you're under attack, moving, or whatever.

15
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,750
I withstood it well but...

16
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,380
...I had a lot of trouble in later life...

17
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,250
...because...

18
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,760
...those events would come back and...

19
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,560
You never forget them.

20
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,460
After holding the line at Bastogne...

21
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,930
...Easy Company was again called on to help push...

22
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,030
...the Germans back through the Bulge.

23
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,530
We were here this morning and then we came this way.

24
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,010
Right, so, right here's gotta be the logging road...

25
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,910
...coming into here, which means we get right there.

26
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,670
Take it easy. Stop crying, Malark...

27
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,150
...or I'll nail it to your head.

28
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,680
Good, it's made of wood.

29
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,290
Guarnere, move them out, let's go. Yes, sir.

30
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,120
2nd Platoon, let's go!

31
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,020
I was glad to be out of my foxhole and moving again.

32
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,350
Even if only to get warm.

33
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,920
Spread out. Keep your interval.

34
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,600
E Company was sent to clear the Bois Jacques the woods near the town of Foy...

35
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,910
...in preparation for what we knew would be the eventual assault on Foy itself.

36
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,550
I see it, Buck. Watch for mines.

37
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,980
During that 1,000 yard attack through the woods...

38
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,960
...we encountered German machine gun fire and had a couple of casualties.

39
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,790
But, for the most part, met little resistance.

40
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,970
Hoobler's run-in with the German officer on horseback...

41
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,130
...was the most dramatic moment of the day.

42
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,640
Halt!

43
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,920
Halt!

44
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,740
Shit.

45
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,320
Thank you.

46
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,900
Hoobler had been talking about getting a Luger since Normandy.

47
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,540
As we dug in, he went from foxhole to foxhole...

48
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,630
...telling everyone how he'd finally got one.

49
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,110
Down he goes, right out of the saddle, like a sack of potatoes.

50
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,810
Outstanding accuracy on my part, if I do say so myself.

51
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,110
Which you do. Which I do.

52
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,920
Hell, Shifty, I think maybe I could have even given you a run for your money.

53
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,690
No, I'm not a good shot.

54
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,620
Now, Dad, he was an excellent shot.

55
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,130
Excellent, I declare, he'd shoot the wings off a fly.

56
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,230
Lip, that German, what'd you think he was doing?

57
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,860
Probably a little recon.

58
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,700
He must have figured nobody would hear a horse.

59
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,330
I think he was trying to get outta Dodge. Yeah.

60
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,110
What happened to the horse?

61
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,770
I don't know, probably still running. Hope he's okay.

62
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,280
You dug in? Yeah.

63
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,650
Yeah, just thought I'd take a walk, shoot the shit.

64
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,780
You're a good shot, Hoob. Just glad you're on our side.

65
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,020
Thanks, Lip.

66
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,780
Hey, Lip? Yeah.

67
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,390
Thanks for the help. You got it, Shifty.

68
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,800
Lip? Yes.

69
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,920
You got a sec? Yes, sir.

70
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,830
Give him a hand.

71
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,940
Where's Dike? He's around.

72
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,000
Could you be more specific, Sergeant?

73
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,910
Not really, sir.

74
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,570
I haven't seen him all day.

75
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,310
Didn't see him in the woods...

76
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,410
...and I have to figure out how we ended up.

77
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,680
Two wounded. Who?

78
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,620
Brown and Stevenson. Goddamn it.

79
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,620
Where's Dike? Where the hell is he? Where does he ever go?

80
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,530
I don't know, but I wish he'd stay there.

81
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,330
Be nice if he took Shames with him.

82
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,730
Shut up, boys. Shutting up, Sarge.

83
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,340
What the hell is that?

84
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,270
Patrol? No, we would have heard.

85
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,410
One man, maybe a sniper. That was no rifle.

86
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,510
What do you see, Shift?

87
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,270
Nobody out there.

88
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,580
Are you sure?

89
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,980
Jesus, it's Hoob, he's shot.

90
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,720
Sniper? No, he shot himself.

91
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,160
Stupid. Medic!

92
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,160
What happened? Doc.

93
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,100
Is he all right? It's my fucking leg.

94
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,130
He did what? It just went off.

95
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,670
What happened? It just went off.

96
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,400
Why is there a loaded gun in your pants?

97
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,370
Buck, I wasn't touching it or nothing. Goddamn it.

98
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,070
I wasn't touching it, I swear. Medic!

99
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,270
Where are you hit, Hoob?

100
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,040
Where are you hit? In my leg.

101
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,580
Hold on.

102
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,910
Now, don't look. It's gonna be fine. Don't worry about it. Come on.

103
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,550
It hurts like a son of a bitch. I think maybe I hit bone.

104
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,060
Doc!

105
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,750
Don't worry about it. You'll be all right.

106
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,160
Warm him up.

107
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,590
Can you hear me?

108
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,290
Somebody keep him warm. Sergeant.

109
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,660
Let me see it. Hang in there.

110
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,860
Warm up some blankets or something for him.

111
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,170
You're gonna be fine.

112
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,140
Keep talking to him.

113
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,270
Okay, listen to me.

114
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,310
Think it was a German leg? Yeah, right.

115
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,180
You're gonna be fine.

116
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,250
Hold on. Perconte, put this across him.

117
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,780
Wrap him up.

118
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,450
Hang in there. Come on.

119
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,620
Lip. You said I was a great shot, right?

120
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,990
You're a great shot. Come on, you jump out of planes.

121
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,860
You're tough. He's still shivering.

122
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,630
It's not that bad at all, come on.

123
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,070
Stay with us. Hoob, take it easy.

124
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,800
What are we gonna do?

125
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,670
How are we doing? You're gonna be fine.

126
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,710
We've gotta get him to an aid station.

127
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,540
Hold on tight. All right, let's get ready to move him.

128
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,210
Take it easy. Stay there, Hoob.

129
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,350
Doc. Can't see anything

130
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,510
Doc!

131
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,990
Jesus.

132
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,460
Perco, we need a jeep.

133
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,270
He was wearing so many clothes, we couldn't tell how bad he was bleeding.

134
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,470
By the time we got him to the aid station, he was already dead.

135
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,070
The bullet cut the main artery in his leg, sir.

136
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,740
Hell, Lip.

137
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,450
It wouldn't have made a difference if you had known.

138
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,650
Cut that main artery in the leg, that's it.

139
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,920
Yes, sir.

140
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:49,920
I'm gonna go back and make sure the boys are all dug in, sir.

141
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,420
Lip.

142
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,130
Where's Dike?

143
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,640
You wanna see him, sir?

144
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:01,070
No, I just would have expected to get this kind of news from him.

145
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,300
I was there, sir.

146
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,240
I figured it might as well be me.

147
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,790
"Where's Dike?"

148
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,350
I probably heard that question 1,000 times.

149
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,330
I probably asked it a few times myself.

150
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,430
There were long stretches where we didn't know where Lieutenant Dike was.

151
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,970
He'd disappear, go off on these walks for hours at a time.

152
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,870
Wouldn't have been so bad if he was just one of the guys in the company...

153
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,970
...but Lieutenant Dike was supposed to be leading the company.

154
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,050
Captain Winters was a CO we could all respect.

155
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,290
Moose Heyliger probably would have done a good job...

156
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,260
...but before we got a chance to find out, he was accidentally shot by a sentry.

157
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,690
Then came Norman Dike.

158
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,830
I want tight security around the company CP, Lieutenant Shames, that understood?

159
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,070
Dike wasn't a bad leader because he made bad decisions.

160
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,040
He was a bad leader because he made no decisions.

161
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,270
Now, Battalion S-3 is planning a move.

162
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,910
So, I will probably be called away regularly.

163
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,680
Are there any questions? Yeah.

164
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,880
What's the formation you want us to go for?

165
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,820
At present, as per usual, but I'll clarify that with you at a later time, Lieutenant Compton.

166
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,190
Yes, sir.

167
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,430
All right, I gotta make a call.

168
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,880
Let's move it out.

169
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,350
Dike was the favorite of somebody at Division.

170
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:56,050
He'd been sent down to E Company to get some combat experience.

171
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,120
Sometimes we got the feeling E Company was an annoyance to him.

172
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,590
Something he had to get through before he could continue his march up the ladder.

173
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,300
I'm telling you boys, we're screwed.

174
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,800
If you ask me, I'm glad Dike's never around.

175
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,900
You know what?

176
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,640
We're doing all right, even with Foxhole Norman.

177
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,300
Yeah, we're doing all right. We're doing all right now.

178
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,210
If you noticed, there's a little town down the hill.

179
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,250
In that town are these guys, and these guys are called Germans.

180
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,150
And these Germans got tanks. I know.

181
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,310
Yeah.

182
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,580
And our side's gonna wanna go into that town.

183
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,720
Guess who they're gonna want to go knocking on the goddamn doors.

184
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,390
I know, Bill, it's me you're talking to here.

185
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,530
Jesus Christ, we've gotta do all this with a CO...

186
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,370
...who's got his head so far up his ass that lump in his throat is his goddamn nose.

187
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,570
Hey First Sergeant. Boys.

188
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,770
Sarge. Lip.

189
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,940
Muck...

190
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,710
...what's the word? You know.

191
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,510
Sitting around, freezing our ass off.

192
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,080
Singing Dike's praises. Yeah.

193
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,250
Lieutenant Dike.

194
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,560
I'll tell you...

195
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,090
...I wouldn't wanna be a replacement officer coming in here...

196
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:16,240
...getting thrown in with a group of guys who've known each other for two years.

197
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,570
They've been in combat together since Normandy.

198
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,900
You're supposed to just show up and lead them?

199
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,340
How's a guy do that?

200
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,040
How could anyone really hope to gain the respect of the toughest...

201
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:37,530
...most professional most dedicated sons of bitches in the entire ETO?

202
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,500
So, if you ask me, a guy'd have to march off to Berlin...

203
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:48,500
...and come back with Hitler's moustache or something.

204
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,300
Anyway, listen.

205
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,910
You guys, don't worry about Dike.

206
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,940
All right? Yeah.

207
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,480
We all do our jobs, everything will be fine.

208
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,020
See you, Sarge. Yeah, boy.

209
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,020
I don't know if I believed any of that...

210
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,360
...but as Company First Sergeant it was my job...

211
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,660
...not to protect Dike...

212
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,030
...but to protect the integrity of the company.

213
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,940
You know what Dike's problem is, don't you?

214
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,800
He's just another one of those arrogant, rich jerks from Yale.

215
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,140
God, not another one of those.

216
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,640
Division's not gonna let me replace him just 'cause I got a bad feeling about him.

217
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,090
Even if they would, who'd I put in his place?

218
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,780
Shames?

219
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,380
Do not ever talk when I'm talking, you got that?

220
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,190
He's seen too many movies. Thinks he has to yell all the time.

221
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,790
Both of you little crapheads did not listen to a word I said during that briefing, did you?

222
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,630
Or Peacock?

223
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,730
God bless him, no one tries harder but he's not cut out to take men into combat.

224
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,200
I'm not gonna make him Company CO when I don't want him as a platoon leader.

225
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,180
What about Compton?

226
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,980
He's the only real choice.

227
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,480
Buck's a real combat leader, but, you know...

228
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,190
I want Easy Company to have at least one experienced platoon leader.

229
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,790
Not that it matters anyway 'cause I can't get rid of Dike.

230
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,030
Well...

231
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,660
...we all know who you'd like to have running Easy.

232
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,700
Trouble is it's not your job any more.

233
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,470
We've gotta find somebody.

234
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,940
We all agreed Buck Compton would've been the best choice to run Easy...

235
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,550
...if Winters had been able to get rid of Dike.

236
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,850
But, to be honest...

237
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:55,390
...Buck wasn't the same soldier he'd been before he got shot in Holland.

238
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,160
He was more serious somehow.

239
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,390
He had a goddamn Luger in his pants.

240
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,940
Jesus. Dear God.

241
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,310
Don't you two do something stupid like that, all right?

242
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,770
Try not to, Buck. I mean it.

243
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,140
And you, Wild Bill...

244
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,550
...I've invested too much goddamn time...

245
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,680
...shaping you into something useful.

246
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,090
Do something crazy, get yourself knocked out of this thing...

247
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,680
I know, you'll kill me.

248
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,060
Even if you're dead, I'll still kill you.

249
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:29,060
I'll see you guys later. I'm gonna check on the other guys.

250
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,170
Crazy Joe McCloskey.

251
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,800
What?

252
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,810
This guy used to hang at the front of Delancey's and just...

253
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,540
...you know, just stare at people.

254
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,970
Yeah, I know who Crazy Joe McCloskey is.

255
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,680
What the hell's that got to do with anything?

256
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,240
Buck kind of reminds me of him now.

257
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,190
What? Ever since he got shot in Holland...

258
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,250
Wait.

259
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,820
What, are you saying he's nuts?

260
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,060
'Cause Crazy Joe McCloskey was fucking nuts.

261
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:05,330
That's why they called him Crazy Joe. No, I'm not saying he's nuts. I'm just...

262
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,590
What are you saying?

263
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,930
Forget it.

264
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,800
What? Forget it.

265
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,170
Come on, you've seen him, Bill.

266
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,040
He's all wound up like a spring.

267
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,980
He's fine.

268
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,350
It wasn't getting shot that got him, it was being in that hospital.

269
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,050
I've been there, okay?

270
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,350
It ain't pretty. Yeah.

271
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,530
Once he was up and moving around, he was his old self again.

272
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,800
I'm telling you, Buck Compton's fine.

273
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,530
I'm serious. Sure thing, Buck, nothing stupid.

274
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,630
We got it, right? We got it.

275
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,270
All right. George?

276
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,770
Yeah.

277
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,850
Nothing stupid, Buck.

278
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,560
Yeah.

279
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,430
"Don't do anything stupid"? Who the hell's he talking to?

280
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,990
Bunch of morons who volunteered to jump out of a perfectly good airplane.

281
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,560
Can you get any more stupid than that? Probably not.

282
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,660
Right.

283
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,700
I swum across the Niagara once. Yeah.

284
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,900
I swear.

285
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,770
On a bet.

286
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,280
What, in a barrel?

287
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,010
No.

288
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,510
I didn't go over the Falls, George. I swam across the river.

289
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,050
Ten miles up from the Falls. I tell you, that current is damn strong.

290
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,110
Yeah.

291
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,090
Must have carried me two miles downstream before I got across.

292
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,590
But, I got across.

293
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,830
Now, personally, I didn't think it was all that stupid but...

294
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,130
...my mom, my sister, Ruth...

295
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,170
...they gave me all kinds of hell.

296
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,970
Yeah, I bet, Muck. So did Faye.

297
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,700
Sweet Faye Tanner. Shut it, George.

298
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,840
Well, they had a point. You're an idiot.

299
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,930
I heard about Hoobler.

300
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,330
Shame.

301
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,430
Yes, sir.

302
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:25,970
It is.

303
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,240
That the Luger? Yes, it is.

304
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,880
What are you gonna do with it?

305
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,340
I don't know yet.

306
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,220
Where you from, Lipton? Where'd you grow up?

307
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,260
Huntington, West Virginia.

308
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,520
Huntington? Yes, sir.

309
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,720
I don't know it.

310
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,160
What kind of work did you do there?

311
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,370
My brother and I helped my mom run a boarding house.

312
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,070
And your father?

313
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:04,010
He was killed when I was 10, sir.

314
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,280
Automobile accident.

315
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,720
That's sad.

316
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,960
So, what made you decide to join the Paratroopers?

317
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:21,260
I read an article about paratroopers in Life magazine.

318
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,500
Talked about the training, how hard it was.

319
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,800
Said if you want to make it as a paratrooper you had to be the best.

320
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,170
And I wanted to fight with the best, sir.

321
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,900
You miss it?

322
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,610
Miss what?

323
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,310
Huntington.

324
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,150
Honestly, sir, I try not to think about it that much.

325
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,890
Where are you from...

326
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,240
Captain Nixon, sir.

327
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,710
Captain Nixon, sir. What?

328
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,690
Good morning, sir, sorry to disturb you. This came from Division.

329
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,360
All right.

330
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,100
Morning. Eviction notice? Not quite.

331
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,800
But I think this will help with your leadership problem.

332
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,710
Dike's being transferred? No, I can't help you with that...

333
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,110
...but Division has decided to pluck one officer...

334
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,640
...from each regiment that served in the heroic defense of Bastogne...

335
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,850
...send him back to the States on a 30-day furlough.

336
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,860
Get him out banging the drum for the war bond drive, that kind of thing.

337
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,350
It turns out I've been plucked.

338
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,390
That's fantastic, Lew, good for you. Thank you.

339
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,490
How in the world does your leaving help me?

340
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,000
It doesn't, I'm not going.

341
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,530
I've already seen the States, grew up there. That's why I came to Europe.

342
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,540
Just wish they'd told me there was a war on.

343
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,800
Anyway, the point is, this thing's wasted on me.

344
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,070
But, I'm sure we can find an officer somewhere...

345
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,840
...in this battalion who could use a long trip home.

346
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,080
Congratulations, Lieutenant Peacock.

347
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,310
I can't think of anybody who deserves this more.

348
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,580
Thanks.

349
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:29,020
I'm really glad that you're going home. Okay.

350
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,150
Best news I've heard in weeks. Hell of a guy.

351
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,390
Thanks, guys. It really means a lot, you know?

352
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,060
Get out of here.

353
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,700
Three cheers for Lieutenant Peacock. Hip hip hooray.

354
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,860
If they come by here, you all remember to smile for the camera.

355
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,520
Got to keep the morale up for them folks back home.

356
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,650
Why?

357
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,190
Damned if I know.

358
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,200
All right, Nix, what have they got waiting for us in Foy?

359
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:13,230
At least one company from the 10th Panzer grenadiers dug in here.

360
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:17,770
They've also got at least one 88 although we haven't been able to spot it yet.

361
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,410
How about armor? As of last night, three Tigers.

362
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,110
Would you excuse me for a moment, sir? Yeah.

363
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,840
How do I feel about being rescued by Patton?

364
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,420
I'd feel pretty peachy about it, if it wasn't for one thing...

365
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,090
...we didn't need to be fucking rescued by Patton.

366
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,990
You got that?

367
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,660
Joe. Excuse us for a moment.

368
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,730
Sorry, sir. Sorry about what?

369
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,000
Patton?

370
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,600
I couldn't agree more.

371
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:48,800
What are you doing here? I wanna head back to the line, sir.

372
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,680
You don't have to do that. Get yourself back to the aid station. Heal up.

373
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,840
I'd really like to head back with the fellas, sir.

374
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,550
All right, then go.

375
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,550
Thank you, sir.

376
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,490
Joe Toye had been at the aid station for three days...

377
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,790
...and everybody was glad to have him back.

378
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,030
Especially Bill Guarnere.

379
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,500
Joe. Bill.

380
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,040
Good to see you, pal. You, too.

381
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,600
What the hell you doing back here?

382
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,330
To make sure you're on top of things.

383
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,710
I'm on top of things. Tied me own boots once last week.

384
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:30,150
All by meself. Fellas, look who I found.

385
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,880
Joe Toye, back for more. How are you, Joe?

386
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,440
Yeah, doing pretty good. Escaped from the aid station.

387
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,010
Where'd you get hit? What's that?

388
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,120
It's Webb. Replacement. Really?

389
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,560
Thought it was some guy I've known for two years and I forgot his face.

390
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:49,620
Joe got hit in the arm. New Year's Eve gift from a luftwaffe.

391
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:53,170
A lot of you guys been injured? It's called wounded, peanut.

392
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,640
Injured's when you fall out of a tree or something.

393
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,680
Don't worry, there's enough crap flying around here.

394
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,440
You're bound to get dinged sometime.

395
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:04,040
Almost every single one of these guys has been hit at least once.

396
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,110
Except for Alley, he's a two-timer.

397
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,480
He landed on broken glass in Normandy...

398
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,890
...and got peppered by a potato masher in Holland.

399
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,980
You'll find out, son.

400
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,550
Now, Bull, he got a piece of exploding tank in Holland.

401
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,300
And George Luz here has never been hit.

402
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,230
You're one lucky bastard. Takes one to know one, Skip.

403
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,800
Consider us blessed. Now, Liebgott, the skinny little guy...

404
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,670
...he got pinged in the neck in Holland.

405
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,400
Right next to him, that other skinny guy, that's Popeye.

406
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,070
He got shot in his scrawny little butt in Normandy.

407
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,350
And Buck got shot in his rather large butt in Holland.

408
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,620
Yeah, kind of an Easy Company tradition, getting shot in the ass.

409
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,890
Even First Sergeant Lipton over there...

410
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,260
...he got a couple of pieces of a tank shell burst at Carentan.

411
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,820
One chunk in the face.

412
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,170
Another chunk almost took off his nuts.

413
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,560
How are those nuts, Sarge? Doing fine, Bill.

414
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,100
Nice of you to ask.

415
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,670
On the afternoon of January 3...

416
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,910
...most of E Company headed back to our old position in the woods overlooking Foy.

417
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:13,910
A few men remained in the Bois Jacques attached to D Company to hold the main line of resistance.

418
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,250
Good luck, ladies.

419
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,590
Been nice knowing you.

420
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,460
Wouldn't drink too much if I were you.

421
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:26,260
Be careful if he offers you a cigarette. What are they talking about?

422
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:28,960
If who offers us a cigarette? Speirs.

423
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,270
Who? Lieutenant Speirs.

424
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,640
Lieutenant Ronald Speirs was one of the platoon leaders in D Company.

425
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,180
He was already a legend.

426
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,710
The stories about Speirs are probably all bullshit anyway.

427
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,340
What stories?

428
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,810
What stories?

429
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,350
Supposedly Speirs shot one of his own men for being drunk.

430
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,690
You're kidding.

431
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,450
That's unbelievable.

432
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,200
Yeah, and there's another one about him giving cigarettes...

433
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,390
...to 20 German POWs before killing them.

434
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,840
He shot 20 POWs? Actually, I heard it was more like 30.

435
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:08,170
Christenson. Lieutenant Speirs.

436
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,770
I got the name right, didn't I, Christenson? Yes, sir.

437
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,150
What are you men doing out here?

438
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,710
We're watching the line, sir.

439
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,650
Keep up the good work. You might wanna reinforce your cover.

440
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,750
Lieutenant Dike said not even to bother. That we're only gonna be here one day.

441
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,590
Lieutenant Dike said that?

442
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,570
Then forget what I said.

443
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,900
Carry on.

444
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,580
Anyone care for a smoke?

445
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,910
You?

446
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,580
Late in the afternoon on January 3...

447
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:55,750
...we returned to our old position in the woods overlooking Foy.

448
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,950
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

449
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:03,160
Someone's gonna die. Someone's gonna fucking die.

450
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,890
Guarnere, look at this shit!

451
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,430
One of those 1st Battalion fuckers took a dump in my foxhole.

452
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,500
I think they shit in everyone's foxhole, Joe.

453
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,700
I don't think they wanted to spend much time above ground.

454
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,610
While we were in the Bois Jacques...

455
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,010
...the Germans had been shelling our old position.

456
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,110
There were signs of tree bursts everywhere.

457
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,980
That got our attention.

458
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,020
Light and noise discipline.

459
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,990
We're getting close.

460
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,530
Looking across the field at Foy, I could see enemy troops.

461
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:47,710
I still couldn't see their artillery, but I knew it was down there.

462
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,110
Looks like the Krauts have been pounding this area with pretty big stuff, 88s.

463
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,880
I'd say they got this whole stretch of the line targeted.

464
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,820
They're not shelling now. Maybe they've got a new target...

465
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,150
No, they're just waiting.

466
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,850
For what? For us to reoccupy the position.

467
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,050
Maybe we should fall back and dig in.

468
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,290
No, it's our job to hold the line here.

469
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:13,030
We've got pretty good foxholes. We just need to fortify the covers.

470
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,540
If they've got us targeted, maybe... We hold the line here.

471
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,000
Sergeant Lipton's right.

472
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:21,240
We're gonna strengthen our covers and we're gonna hang in.

473
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,370
We're not gonna fall back.

474
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,380
Right, Lieutenant?

475
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,920
Right, Lieutenant? Fine.

476
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,990
You all take care of it.

477
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,120
I gotta go talk to Regiment.

478
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,860
We'd better get moving. Yeah.

479
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,740
Here you go, Bill. Thanks, Lip.

480
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,070
I'll get you some more branches. I'd appreciate that.

481
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,030
Incoming!

482
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,760
Take cover!

483
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,700
Take cover!

484
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:30,580
Take cover! Come on, find some cover!

485
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,380
They got us zeroed!

486
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,410
Find some cover, find a foxhole!

487
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,080
Come on, take cover!

488
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,120
Take cover!

489
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:48,130
Come on, find some cover!

490
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,460
Take cover!

491
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,260
Shit.

492
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,480
Come on, find some cover!

493
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:20,250
For some reason, at that moment, in that half-finished foxhole...

494
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:23,360
...all I could think about was the Fourth of July when I was a kid.

495
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:27,230
I loved to make my own firecrackers, cherry bombs, ladyfingers.

496
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,510
I loved to blow up dirt clods and pop bottles and the like.

497
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,470
Looked forward to it all year long.

498
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,280
What I saw that day was the most awesome...

499
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:39,510
...and terrifying display of firepower I'd ever seen in my life.

500
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,750
Of course, I wouldn't have been laughing if I'd known what happened to Joe Toye.

501
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:48,910
Maybe we should see if anybody's hit. Malark, that's what they want.

502
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,590
The Krauts are trying to draw us out in the open.

503
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:06,770
Stay in your foxholes. Stay in your foxholes!

504
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,630
Are you okay, can you walk? Come on, find a foxhole, come on.

505
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,400
I gotta get up.

506
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:18,240
I gotta get up.

507
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,080
I gotta get up.

508
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,780
I need my helmet.

509
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,320
I need help!

510
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:33,260
You hear that? Is that Joe?

511
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,290
Help! Yeah, I think that's Joe.

512
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,230
Stay.

513
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,040
Stay down!

514
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:48,510
Stay in your foxholes!

515
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,710
Help!

516
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,170
Help, anyone there?

517
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,520
Jesus. I gotta get up.

518
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,380
I gotta get up.

519
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,420
Shit.

520
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,060
Come on, Joe. Come on, buddy.

521
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:09,960
Come on, pal.

522
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,330
You said you'd get back to the States before me.

523
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,840
You ain't going anywhere, you're all right.

524
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,110
I gotta get my helmet.

525
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:19,940
Forget it. I gotta get my helmet.

526
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,340
Anyone there?

527
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,280
Hang on. Help!

528
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,120
Who's that? It's Heff.

529
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,220
Come on, get me out of here, Lip.

530
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,820
Come on.

531
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,490
I got you.

532
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,720
Come on, Joe, I got you.

533
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,460
Come on, Joe.

534
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,630
Hang on.

535
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,800
Are you okay? Come on.

536
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,540
Think I overdid it on the cover for my foxhole?

537
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,410
Incoming!

538
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,780
Take cover!

539
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,360
Come on!

540
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,760
Hurry up, Guarno, you're gonna get bombed!

541
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:18,130
Come on! Move it, Bill!

542
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,570
Come on, Joe.

543
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,930
Hold on, I'll be there, I'm gonna help you.

544
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:28,080
No!

545
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,950
Medic!

546
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,360
During the second barrage, I wasn't laughing anymore.

547
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,230
Lip!

548
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,030
Are you okay?

549
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,060
Stay down!

550
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,800
You stay down!

551
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,340
First Sergeant Lipton?

552
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,810
You get things organized here.

553
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,450
I'm gonna go for help.

554
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,820
What the fuck?

555
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,990
Lip, where the fuck's he going? I don't know.

556
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,790
Get Battalion on the line. Tell them to notify BAS.

557
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,300
Battalion's up, Lip.

558
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,040
Medic!

559
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,780
Stay ready.

560
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,300
Sons of bitches might be trying to come through.

561
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,420
You okay, One Lung? Sergeant!

562
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,960
How you doing, Popeye? 100 percent ready to kill Germans, Lip.

563
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:37,970
Okay, Joe.

564
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,810
Doc, what can I do? Hold this.

565
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,050
You got a smoke?

566
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,490
Jesus, what's a guy gotta do to get killed around here?

567
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,720
Bill, you're going first.

568
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,790
Whatever you say, Doc, whatever you say. Over here, take this man.

569
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:06,500
Lip, they got old Guarnere this time. We got you, soldier.

570
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,630
Just lie back.

571
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,140
Take it easy. I told you I'd beat you back to the States.

572
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,810
Lip.

573
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,920
How's Buck?

574
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,450
Luz, how's Buck?

575
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,620
He's fine.

576
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,760
You sure? Yes, he's fine.

577
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:37,230
I think you should probably go talk to him now.

578
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,400
All right.

579
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,910
Some say Buck changed after he was shot in Holland.

580
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,110
Maybe.

581
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,360
I know something happened to him when he saw Toye and Guarnere on the ground.

582
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:15,070
On the report it said Compton was being taken off the line because of trench foot.

583
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,340
Didn't say anything about him losing his friends.

584
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,050
Buck was a great combat leader.

585
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:32,190
He was wounded in Normandy, and again in Holland.

586
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:36,350
He received the Silver Star for his part in taking out those German guns on D-day.

587
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:39,560
He took everything the Krauts could throw at him time and again.

588
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,530
Lieutenant Compton?

589
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,560
"UCLA did not make the Rose Bowl this winter.

590
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,610
"Probably because you weren't there.

591
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,980
"I'm sure you're teaching all of your young soldiers...

592
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,810
"...the joy you have of the sport.

593
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,850
"Gosh, how we all know what an exciting young man you are...

594
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,080
"...and how your heart and love..."

595
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:08,090
I guess he just couldn't take seeing his friends Toye and Guarnere torn up like that.

596
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,890
No one ever thought any less of him for it.

597
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,840
Hey Bull.

598
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:29,140
With Buck off the line, there was no longer any possible alternative to Dike.

599
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,210
At least none we could see.

600
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,120
Thanks.

601
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,610
Muck.

602
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,450
Muck. Yes, Sergeant?

603
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,960
I'm looking for Lieutenant Dike.

604
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,620
We were stuck with Dike.

605
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,320
And he was off taking a walk.

606
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,170
Sure thing.

607
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,260
Lightning Six, kidnap.

608
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:56,670
Yes, sir. We've cleared all the green area between...

609
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,870
We'd cleared the woods east of Foy.

610
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:01,880
So, a few days later, E Company and the rest of the 506...

611
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,710
...cleared the woods west of Foy.

612
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,780
There was little resistance.

613
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,350
You fellas know I got no reason to bullshit you, right?

614
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,590
Look, I'm not gonna bullshit you. This is what I saw.

615
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,290
It was so unbelievable, you might not believe me.

616
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,690
So, you-know-who comes running up to Lipton.

617
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,700
He's got no helmet, no gear, no nothing.

618
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,640
First Sergeant Lipton, you organize things here...

619
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,200
...and I'm gonna go for help.

620
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,740
I need to go polish my oak leaf clusters.

621
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,010
Luz. That's really good.

622
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,180
It's okay. Fellas.

623
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,950
Goodnight all. Yeah, see you, Luz. See you, Malark.

624
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:46,220
What can I do for you, Sarge? Two things, first, great impression of Dike.

625
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:48,160
You think? I thought it was a little off.

626
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:52,490
No, you got it pretty good. Second, don't do it any more.

627
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,860
Especially the part about what he said to me.

628
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,940
It doesn't do anybody any good, okay?

629
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,900
Yeah, I got you. All right.

630
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,440
Wise ass.

631
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,250
Incoming!

632
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:32,170
Luz!

633
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,370
Come on! Hurry!

634
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,030
Luz!

635
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:40,270
Stay down! Come on!

636
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:43,510
Get in here! Come on!

637
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:48,720
Come on! Come on, Luz!

638
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,180
Muck and Penkala! What?

639
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,780
Muck and Penkala got hit!

640
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,670
Medic!

641
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:40,240
Medic!

642
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,010
It's my shoulder. Come on, get up!

643
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,850
Stay down till you get the all clear.

644
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,740
Thought you didn't smoke. I don't.

645
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,930
The shell that hit the foxhole Luz and I were in was a dud.

646
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:36,460
The one that hit Muck and Penkala's foxhole wasn't.

647
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:38,430
That's just the way it was.

648
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,260
Muck and Penkala were good men.

649
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:46,710
Their death hit Malarkey the hardest.

650
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:50,370
Malarkey's best friends in the Company had been Compton, Muck, and Penkala.

651
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:52,740
In less than a week, he'd seen two of them die.

652
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,590
What's the word? The men on the line are okay.

653
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:01,180
Food has just been resupplied. We're in good shape.

654
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,020
Okay, we'll just hunker down. We might get some relief soon.

655
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,920
Okay? All right.

656
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,140
All right.

657
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:30,710
Later that day, we were back in our old position overlooking Foy.

658
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:33,280
We were all worried about Malarkey.

659
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,890
Malark.

660
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:47,320
Didn't I hear you say you wanted to bring a Luger home for your kid brother?

661
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,330
Yeah.

662
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,300
Why don't you...

663
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,510
Why don't you give him that?

664
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:07,010
It's Hoob's, right? Yeah.

665
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,520
Yeah, I was gonna get rid of it but I...

666
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:12,680
I don't know.

667
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:15,920
Listen...

668
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,330
...Captain Winters was wondering if you wanted to go back to battalion and...

669
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,670
...work as his runner for a few days.

670
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:29,810
Tell him thanks, I'm gonna stay here.

671
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:35,340
Look, why don't you at least come back for an hour or so.

672
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,550
Say goodbye to Buck. I'm sure it'll mean a lot to him.

673
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:45,590
All right.

674
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,770
You be careful with that.

675
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,070
Getting even 50 yards back from the line...

676
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:58,270
...just for an hour or two could make a big difference in a soldier's state of mind.

677
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:05,170
The morning after the shelling that killed Muck and Penkala...

678
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:08,280
...I saw a soldier try to dig a foxhole with his bare hands.

679
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:09,340
Private.

680
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,320
Didn't notice he'd torn off his fingernails.

681
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:12,480
Private.

682
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,950
I got him out of there quickly.

683
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,090
Not for his sake, but for ours.

684
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,060
Fear is poison in combat.

685
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:22,860
It's something we all felt, but you just didn't show it.

686
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:23,990
You can't.

687
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:27,000
It's destructive and it's contagious.

688
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:32,540
Told you I'd get you started. We got a bleeder here.

689
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:42,240
Buck was never the same after seeing Toye and Guarnere get hit that day.

690
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:45,150
I guess he just needed some time away from it all.

691
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:01,500
The barrages on January 3, and the shelling on January 9...

692
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:04,940
...marked the low point in the war for many of the men in E Company.

693
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:07,610
Even then, very few actually broke.

694
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:11,440
I knew the terror of those shellings and the pressure we'd been under...

695
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:14,570
...since we got to Bastogne could take their toll in other ways.

696
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:18,710
I was afraid the men would lose focus, suffer a drop in morale.

697
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,890
And that was dangerous, especially in combat.

698
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,330
More of which lay in store for us.

699
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:26,330
Perconte.

700
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:29,360
We'd cleared the woods east and west of Foy.

701
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:32,660
Now it was time for the inevitable assault on Foy, itself.

702
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,030
Frankly, I was dreading it.

703
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:37,600
I always knew the E Company men who trained at Toccoa...

704
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:39,270
...wouldn't survive the war unscathed...

705
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:43,470
...but now I was beginning to wonder if any of us were gonna make it through at all.

706
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,270
E Company would lead the attack.

707
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,580
The problem was, at least in my estimation...

708
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:50,950
...E Company still did not have a leader.

709
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:05,890
The night before the attack, I did something as First Sergeant...

710
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:08,370
...I would never have imagined myself doing.

711
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:17,340
Lip.

712
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:22,890
Didn't figure you for a smoking man. Neither did I.

713
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:30,360
D Company, Lieutenant Speirs, patrol order.

714
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,790
So?

715
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:36,530
We've been watching Foy all day, sir, not much activity.

716
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:39,520
Want a coffee? No, thank you, sir.

717
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:45,970
How's Easy's status? The men are good, sir, they're prepared.

718
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,270
I'm gonna be leading 2nd Platoon, tomorrow.

719
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:50,640
They're probably the weakest after losing Toye...

720
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:53,150
...and Guarnere, and Muck, and Penkala.

721
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:56,780
But all in all, I have every confidence in the men, sir.

722
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:57,980
Good.

723
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:06,430
But, on the other hand, I have no confidence in our CO, sir.

724
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:10,930
Lieutenant Dike is an empty uniform, Captain.

725
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:12,860
He's just...

726
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,540
He's not there, sir.

727
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:18,830
He's gonna be there tomorrow.

728
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:21,400
Yes, sir, I understand he will be there physically.

729
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:24,210
But tomorrow's gonna be the real deal...

730
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,610
...and he's gonna have to lead those men.

731
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:29,540
He's gonna have to make decisions, sir, and I...

732
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:34,980
I gotta tell you, sir, I think he's gonna get a lot of Easy Company men killed.

733
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,430
Thank you, Sergeant, that'll be all. Yes, sir.

734
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:50,140
I said what I had to say. There was nothing Winters could do.

735
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:56,910
He couldn't very well remove a company CO.

736
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,450
Especially a well-connected one...

737
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,350
...because of the misgivings of a company first sergeant.

738
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:06,450
There's an eighth of a mile of open field to cross before we get down here into Foy.

739
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,290
There's little cover, so move quickly.

740
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,850
There's two sections of light machine guns, either end.

741
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:12,260
They'll give you covering fire.

742
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:15,090
3rd Battalion will come from the east led by I Company.

743
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:16,430
That should cause distraction.

744
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,330
D Company will be in reserve but we shouldn't need them.

745
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,230
You gotta move in there fast.

746
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:25,440
Get in there before they can bring their mortars and artillery down on you.

747
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,870
Clear? Clear.

748
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:31,040
I'm relying on you. Get it done.

749
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,760
Covering fire! Let's go! Keep it moving!

750
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:53,630
Suppressing fire!

751
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:59,740
Keep moving! Move!

752
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,440
Let's go!

753
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:12,290
Suppressing fire! Fire!

754
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,950
Keep them tight, Shames.

755
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:20,660
Keep moving. Come on.

756
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,930
Krauts in the open!

757
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:29,930
Keep moving! Three inside!

758
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,510
Wait a minute, where's Foley?

759
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,580
Randleman!

760
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,010
Liebgott.

761
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,750
Where the hell is 1st Platoon?

762
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:49,530
Hold up! Keep moving!

763
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,220
Easy Company, hold up!

764
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,960
2nd Platoon, hold up!

765
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:57,600
Will you move! Get me Foley on the radio.

766
00:53:57,670 --> 00:54:00,800
Get out of there! Move! Sir, I think we should take cover.

767
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:03,310
Find some cover!

768
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,170
Find some cover! What?

769
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,770
Stay down!

770
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:12,720
Easy Red, Easy Red. Easy Six. Over. Six, Easy Red, go ahead.

771
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,510
Easy Red, Easy Red, stand by for the Six.

772
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:22,190
Foley, you get back here where I can see you, goddamn it!

773
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:26,990
1st Platoon, hold up. Take cover! Martin.

774
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:30,030
Come on, soldier, with me. With you, sir.

775
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:32,060
Fire!

776
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:35,770
Fall back!

777
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:40,380
Take cover! Goddamn it.

778
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:42,740
Go forward!

779
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:46,450
Herron, on me. Move back.

780
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:50,920
Stay on my ass. Hold fast, 2nd Platoon.

781
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:54,720
Follow Lipton! Take cover! What are we doing, Lieutenant?

782
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:58,490
Why are we stopped? Fall back!

783
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:00,300
Roger, kidnap.

784
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:02,890
Standby to Six, Lieutenant, what's the plan?

785
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:04,200
I don't know!

786
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,960
You'd better get Dike on that radio to me now.

787
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,700
Lieutenant, what's the plan?

788
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,740
Captain Winters, sir. What's the plan?

789
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:15,540
Okay, Foley. Foley, you take your men...

790
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:18,170
...on a flanking mission around the village...

791
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,310
...and attack it from the rear.

792
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:23,520
Dike, we cannot stay here!

793
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:26,560
You want 1st Platoon to attack the village, by itself?

794
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,560
We will provide suppressing fire.

795
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:30,790
We're gonna be alone out there, Lieutenant.

796
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:33,920
We will provide suppressing fire!

797
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:43,200
Get going forward!

798
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:46,840
You need to talk to Captain Winters, sir.

799
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,620
Sir, okay, here it is.

800
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:56,590
We go on a flanking run in the back of the village and we attack from the rear.

801
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:59,920
Ramirez, two guys, take them, go. Find some cover behind the stable.

802
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:01,460
Go!

803
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,630
Shit! Jesus Christ.

804
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,930
Webb, move up, find cover!

805
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:19,970
Suppressing fire, now!

806
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,520
Perconte! I got you.

807
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,610
Give me some cover!

808
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:30,320
How you doing, Perconte?

809
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:33,020
They shot me in my ass, Martin.

810
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:36,620
You're all right, stay down! I think we lost five men.

811
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,630
Can you locate? The building with the caved-in roof.

812
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,530
The building with the caved-in roof.

813
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:51,770
Sir, we are sitting ducks here.

814
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,280
We have to keep moving!

815
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:56,820
You've got to keep moving!

816
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:01,850
Dick! Captain Winters. Goddamn it, you do not go out there.

817
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,410
You're the Battalion Commander, now get back here!

818
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:08,690
Dick, I understand your attachment to Easy Company...

819
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,090
Speirs, get yourself over here!

820
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,590
Get out there and relieve Dike and take that attack on in.

821
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,930
Webb, fall back, you're too exposed.

822
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:27,040
Come on, Webb, let's go, kid.

823
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:32,380
Hang on, Perco. Fire!

824
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:36,980
Lieutenant, what are we doing?

825
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:42,550
I'm taking over. First Sergeant Lipton.

826
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,120
What have we got?

827
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,260
Sir, most of the Company is spread out here.

828
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:50,270
1st platoon tried an end around but they're stretched out, pinned by a sniper.

829
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,300
I believe he's there at the caved-in roof.

830
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:54,900
Destroy that building with mortars and grenade launchers.

831
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:57,070
Then, I want 1st to go in, forget going around.

832
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,670
Everybody else, follow me. Yes, sir.

833
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,040
Thank God.

834
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,880
All right, 3rd Platoon, let's go!

835
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:08,750
All right, you heard the word, 2nd Platoon, on the CO!

836
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,590
Sergeant Alley! Got it, Sarge.

837
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:16,890
Okay, 1st Platoon, move out!

838
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:21,130
On your feet, 2nd Platoon. Move out!

839
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,600
Get on your goddamn feet.

840
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:27,500
Come on!

841
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:32,070
Come on, Luz, let's get the bastards.

842
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:35,310
Fire!

843
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,580
Come on, move out!

844
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:43,860
Fire! Take cover!

845
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,390
Fire!

846
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:50,120
Go! Go on, come on.

847
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,860
Take the cart out!

848
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,340
Fire!

849
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:00,530
Lipton.

850
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:04,010
Street fight, Item. Easy Six, over.

851
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:08,440
What do you see, Lipton? Armor and infantry, a lot of infantry.

852
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,680
I Company's should be on the other side of town.

853
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:11,980
Do you see any sign of them?

854
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:13,820
Radio, anything? No, sir.

855
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:15,650
Sir, I think they're gonna pull back.

856
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,420
We don't connect with I, they'll escape.

857
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:19,890
That's right, wait here. Item, Item. Easy Six.

858
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:21,950
What the hell?

859
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:36,500
At first, the Germans didn't shoot at him.

860
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,640
I think they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing.

861
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:43,040
But that wasn't the really astounding thing.

862
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:47,180
The astounding thing was that after he hooked up with I Company...

863
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:49,050
...he came back.

864
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:15,070
? I've been working on the railroad ?

865
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:18,670
? All the live long day ?

866
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:21,380
? I've been working on the railroad ?

867
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,450
We took over 100 German prisoners.

868
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,390
After that it was mostly clean up.

869
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:29,890
Let's go, move it, move it! Take them down to the barn.

870
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,700
? Rise up early in the morn ?

871
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,370
Sit down.

872
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,410
Sniper!

873
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,170
Take cover!

874
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:49,170
Come on.

875
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:51,450
Where is he?

876
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:55,550
Shit, I can't see him.

877
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:01,220
Second floor, building on the right.

878
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:04,360
Don't miss, Shifty. Now!

879
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:30,360
Over here. I need help over here. Hey, can you guys get over here and help?

880
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:34,720
Mellet, Herron, Sowosko, and Ken Webb were killed by a sniper.

881
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,990
There would've been more if it hadn't been for Shifty Powers.

882
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:04,820
You hit bad, Perconte? Beautiful wound, Lip.

883
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:06,950
They shot me right through my ass.

884
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:08,500
You hang tough. Sarge.

885
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,620
Yeah? Is it true about Dike?

886
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:11,860
Yeah.

887
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:14,230
Thank God for small mercies?

888
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:16,260
Yeah.

889
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:30,810
We'd been looking down at Foy...

890
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:34,520
...for the better part of a month, knowing that's where we had to go.

891
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,520
It was a great relief to have done it.

892
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:43,460
A lot of the men thought once we'd taken Foy they'd get off the line...

893
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:46,090
...ship us back to Mourmelon for a breather.

894
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,190
But that wasn't to be.

895
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:51,970
Two days later, we took Noville, and after that, Rachamps.

896
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:16,720
We spent our night in Rachamps, in a convent.

897
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:20,570
It was the first time we'd spent a night indoors in a month.

898
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:36,010
The sisters there brought in their choir to sing for us.

899
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:37,950
It was heaven.

900
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,130
The mood of the men was relaxed.

901
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,430
We were finally being relieved and would soon be in Mourmelon.

902
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:55,300
Of course, in the morning we found out Mourmelon would have to wait.

903
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:57,700
Hitler had launched a counteroffensive in Alsace...

904
01:03:57,770 --> 01:04:01,000
...and we were bound for the town of Hagenau to help hold the line.

905
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,540
But at least for that night we didn't know it yet.

906
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:05,780
That night we were okay.

907
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:27,300
I spent that night trying to come up with a roster...

908
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:29,400
...for the Company, to see who we had left.

909
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:32,830
We'd come into Belgium with 121 men and officers...

910
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:34,640
...plus 24 replacements.

911
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:38,940
That's 145 total. We were going out with 63.

912
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:44,950
Guarnere was badly wounded and Hoobler died accidentally.

913
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:50,720
Joe Toye had lost his leg.

914
01:04:57,230 --> 01:04:59,430
Among the dead were Herron, Mellet...

915
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:02,630
...Sowosko, Kenneth Webb, Harold Webb...

916
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:05,440
...Alex Penkala, and Skip Muck.

917
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:12,710
Our month in Belgium cost us one good officer, Buck Compton.

918
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:15,480
And one bad one, Norman Dike.

919
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:25,060
But we gained a good one in the end, so I guess we came out ahead.

920
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:37,100
What is it?

921
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:38,870
Nothing.

922
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,540
I'd better get back to Battalion before they disappear.

923
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:55,510
You wanna ask me, don't you? Ask you what, sir?

924
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:58,460
You wanna know if they're true or not, the stories about me.

925
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,820
Did you ever notice with stories like that...

926
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:04,370
...everyone says they heard it from someone who was there...

927
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:06,270
...but then when you ask that person...

928
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:08,990
...they say they heard it from someone who was there.

929
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:11,340
It's nothing new, really.

930
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:15,600
I bet if you went back 2,000 years, you'd hear a couple of centurions...

931
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,810
...yakking about how Tercius lopped off the heads of some Carthaginian prisoners.

932
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:26,280
Maybe they kept talking about it because they never heard Tercius deny it.

933
01:06:28,830 --> 01:06:31,760
Maybe because Tercius knew there was some value to the men...

934
01:06:31,830 --> 01:06:35,390
...thinking he was the meanest, toughest, son of a bitch in the Roman legion.

935
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,090
Sir?

936
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:43,670
These men aren't really concerned about the stories.

937
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:46,330
They're just glad to have you as our CO.

938
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:49,240
They're happy to have a good leader again.

939
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:51,710
From what I've heard, they've always had one.

940
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:55,840
I've been told there's always been one man they could count on.

941
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,580
Led them in Bois Jacques, held them together...

942
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:00,990
...when they were shelled in the woods.

943
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:06,020
Every day he kept his spirits up, kept the men focused, gave them direction.

944
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:09,330
All the things a good combat leader does.

945
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:17,910
You don't have any idea who I'm talking about, do you?

946
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:19,230
No, sir.

947
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,340
Hell, it was you, First Sergeant.

948
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:26,040
Ever since Winters made Battalion, you've been the leader of Easy Company.

949
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:38,060
And you're not gonna be first sergeant much longer.

950
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:39,250
Sir?

951
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:44,790
Winters put in for a Battlefield Commission and Sink approved on your behalf.

952
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:47,300
You should get the official nod in a few days.

953
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:53,170
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

954
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:18,330
Look, it's 1st Battalion.

955
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,500
What do you want?

956
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:24,470
Yeah, thanks for crapping in our foxholes, you shitheads.

957
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:28,570
It's our pleasure. Enjoy the walk, boys.

958
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:45,090
There they go, Easy Company.

1
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,440
We had lost some very good men there.

2
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,080
Toye and Guarnere had lost their legs there.

3
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,420
Guarnere... Gordon was badly hit.

4
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,860
A number of other people were killed.

5
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,290
It was a difficult situation there.

6
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,530
I don't know the exact amount of men that got killed in that...

7
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,100
...but six, seven of 'em, were real close friends of mine.

8
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,770
Skip Muck died, and Eugene Roe came to me...

9
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,370
...about 10 minutes after he was killed...

10
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,410
...and he wanted me to see if I wanted to go look at him.

11
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,650
I said, no, I wouldn't be able to stand that.

12
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,810
So, I didn't go look at him.

13
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,260
After Bastogne, we went to Haguenau. There was another push there.

14
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,290
We wanted to know what was across the river there what kind of strength they had.

15
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,160
You have a feeling you're gonna live through the war.

16
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,360
You have a feeling it's starting to ease off.

17
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,540
You can't account for it. It's just a gut feeling.

18
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,970
But everybody had that feeling.

19
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,270
"I believe I might be able to live through it."

20
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,370
So, walk carefully, take care of yourself.

21
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,910
The 101st Airborne had been made famous by what it did in the Battle of the Bulge.

22
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,350
Newspapers called them "the battered bastards of Bastogne."

23
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,540
They'd been through hell...

24
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,950
...and were now pulling into the comparative paradise of Haguenau...

25
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,820
...the sounds of the war still coming from just across the river.

26
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,720
I had missed Bastogne.

27
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,230
All I knew was what I'd read and heard around the replacement depot...

28
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,290
...that we had broken the enemy, and the war would soon be over.

29
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,170
Thanks for the lift.

30
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,740
When I was finally able to rejoin Easy Company...

31
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,180
...they looked nothing like the heroes who had just helped win the war.

32
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,440
George Luz! Yeah?

33
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,490
It's me. Come on, I haven't been gone that long.

34
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,350
Jesus, yes, you have.

35
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,660
Now, look what I found.

36
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,890
Hey, guys. Sgt. Martin.

37
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,690
What do you want, Private?

38
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm sorry, sir.

39
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,900
My name's David Webster. I just got back from the hospital.

40
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,460
Good for you.

41
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,530
Where's the rest of the guys? This is everybody.

42
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,110
Come on, Sgt. Martin, this can't be everybody.

43
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,810
What about Hoobler? Where's he?

44
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,250
Lt. Foley, 2nd Platoon lost more guys than we did.

45
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,590
They're really short-handed.

46
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,600
Right, report to 2nd, Webster. They'll find a place for you.

47
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,900
Next truck up, Webster. You'll find 2nd. Move.

48
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,850
Hey, guys.

49
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,180
Some lieutenant told me to report to 2nd.

50
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,860
Your name's Jackson, right? That's right.

51
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,950
Who's leading the platoon? Sgt. Malarkey is.

52
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,500
What, no officers? I guess you didn't hear.

53
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,800
No, what's that? They're making Malarkey a lieutenant.

54
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,600
He's on the fast track now.

55
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,870
Really? That's great. Yeah, isn't it?

56
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,570
Yeah. Jackson, help me up, will you?

57
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,250
So, you come from the hospital? Yeah.

58
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,480
Must've liked that hospital, 'cause we left Holland four months ago.

59
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,690
I wasn't there the whole time.

60
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,460
There was rehabilitation, then the replacement depot.

61
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,300
I'm sure you tried to bust out and help us in Bastogne, Web.

62
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,630
I don't know how I would have done that. That's funny, 'cause Popeye found a way.

63
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,340
So did Alley, right, back in Holland?

64
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,430
And Guarnere, and...

65
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,540
Yeah, where is Guarnere? He still your platoon sergeant?

66
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,950
No. He got hit.

67
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,780
Yeah?

68
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,010
Yeah, Bill got hit. Blew his whole leg off.

69
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,150
1st Platoon, moving out!

70
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,590
Okay, spread out.

71
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,500
Hold along this line till I figure out where we're going.

72
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,730
Sarge?

73
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,770
What's the matter, Webster?

74
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,040
Nervous in the service? No.

75
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,310
No, I'm fine, Sarge. Why don't you go talk to Capt. Speirs.

76
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,490
Make sure he wants you with us. Capt. Speirs?

77
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,050
What happened to Capt. Winters? He's running the whole battalion now.

78
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,180
Go.

79
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,590
So, Easy Company had a new CO to go along with all the other new faces.

80
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,400
The guys I knew were either gone, or very different from what I remembered.

81
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,940
I was a veteran of D-day and Market Garden...

82
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,300
...had been with the company since its formation...

83
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,900
...but because I had missed Bastogne, I was treated as a replacement...

84
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,710
...and felt like I was starting all over again.

85
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,270
Look who it is. Nice digs, Lip?

86
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,180
Yeah. Sgt. Lipton?

87
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,650
Hey, look what I found.

88
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,850
Feeling all right? There you go.

89
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,950
He's got pneumonia. I'm sorry to hear that.

90
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,120
What are you sorry about?

91
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,920
He's alive, he's got a couch, a blanket, snug as a bug.

92
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,120
Yeah.

93
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,090
Sgt. Malarkey said to check with the CO if I should be in 2nd Platoon.

94
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,140
Have a seat, Webster. We'll get you situated.

95
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,070
How long have you been sick?

96
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,070
Long enough.

97
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,140
He wants us to cross the river.

98
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,480
Yeah, I bet that water's cold.

99
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,710
Should be able to get you some boats.

100
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,690
Had to be a full moon.

101
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,860
So much for the cover of darkness.

102
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,790
It's gonna leave the patrol exposed.

103
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,700
Is this the company CP for Easy? Yes, sir.

104
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,020
As you were.

105
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,570
Lt. Jones looking for Capt. Speirs.

106
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,610
He's on his way, sir. Why don't you sit down?

107
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,430
Can you get me a coffee? Would you like a coffee, sir?

108
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,570
No, thank you. All right.

109
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,240
What platoon are you in?

110
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,580
We're about to find that out.

111
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,650
You got any soap? I need a shave.

112
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,520
I'll send some down.

113
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,450
You know what you're doing for this?

114
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,620
I'm gonna let Speirs handle it. Right.

115
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,060
Capt. Speirs, sir.

116
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,660
This is Lt. Jones.

117
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,290
Listen, will you go back in the back and sack out?

118
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,100
There are beds there with fresh sheets.

119
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,470
I will, sir.

120
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,270
Just trying to make myself useful, sir.

121
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,110
Listen up.

122
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,010
Regiment wants a patrol for prisoners.

123
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,040
This one comes straight from Col. Sink, so it's not my idea.

124
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,680
Since the river's the line of resistance, we'll cross it to get to them.

125
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,810
What do we need to do?

126
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,690
There's a three-story building on the enemy side, up the embankment.

127
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,790
We know it's occupied.

128
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,890
You can have 15 men.

129
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,730
Think very hard about who you wanna lead the patrol.

130
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,500
You'll need a lead scout, a translator.

131
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,660
I've got the entire battalion on covering fire.

132
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,670
When? Tonight, 0100.

133
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes, sir.

134
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,410
Speirs, I want this one to be as fool proof, and as safe as possible.

135
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,850
Yeah, don't take any chances on this one. We're too far along for that.

136
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,080
Speirs, I want to discuss who might go along.

137
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,710
Who are you? Lt. Jones, sir.

138
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,380
Right, our West Pointer.

139
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,980
Yes, sir.

140
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,720
When did you graduate? June 6, sir.

141
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,400
June 6, of last year?

142
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,730
D-day, yes, sir.

143
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,260
All right. Don't get hurt.

144
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,940
Sir, I'd like to volunteer for the patrol.

145
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,510
Speirs, talk to you in an hour. Yeah.

146
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,540
Lt. Jones? We are short on offices.

147
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,920
You think a noncom could lead this?

148
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,510
I can think of a few possibilities.

149
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,750
Martin, Malarkey, Grant?

150
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,050
Honestly, sir, most of the NCOs could use a rest.

151
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,250
Captain, request permission to go on the patrol.

152
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,190
There's your answer.

153
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,290
No. You don't have any experience.

154
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,930
Report to 2nd Platoon. Yes, sir.

155
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,470
Tell...

156
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,140
Tell Heffron, Ramirez, and McClung they're going.

157
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,510
Yes, sir.

158
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,080
Sir, this is Pvt. Webster.

159
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,880
Sir, I'm Pvt. Webster from 1st Platoon.

160
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,750
I just got back from the hospital and Lt. Foley told me to go to 2nd...

161
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,990
...but Sgt. Malarkey said I... Fine, 2nd.

162
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,650
Take Lt. Jones.

163
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,960
Lieutenant, OP-2.

164
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,800
Come on.

165
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,700
Are there other officers in the platoon?

166
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,270
No, sir. Just St. Malarkey.

167
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,040
But they tell me he's getting a battlefield commission.

168
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,590
Maybe he'll be assisting you, sir.

169
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,190
Who's that?

170
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,990
Webster?

171
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,290
That's right. How you doing, Sgt. Kiehn?

172
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,060
Hi, Webster. Hey, Sarge.

173
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,220
Look what we just scrounged. We got some spuds.

174
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,390
Hey, OP-2, this way?

175
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,930
Shit, move! Go!

176
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,240
Shit, they spotted us!

177
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,640
Is that it? I don't know. I think so.

178
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,110
Go, go, go!

179
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,240
Come on, come on.

180
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,280
All clear! All clear!

181
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,480
Okay.

182
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,170
Wait, it was Heffron, McClung, and...

183
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,330
Ramirez, come on. Right.

184
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,610
Hey, guys.

185
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,050
This taken? Go ahead.

186
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,050
Sergeant, this is Lt. Jones.

187
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,190
Just assigned to 2nd Platoon.

188
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,950
Malarkey, Platoon Sergeant.

189
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,050
Congratulations on the battlefield commission.

190
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,890
The what?

191
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,430
They're making you an officer, no?

192
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,120
Me? No.

193
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,900
You must be thinking of First Sergeant Lipton.

194
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,370
My mistake.

195
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,210
So, you're without a platoon leader?

196
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,440
No, not anymore, Lieutenant.

197
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,010
Right.

198
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,650
So, do you wanna introduce me to the men?

199
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:55,290
Well, some are sleeping downstairs and the rest are right here.

200
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,740
Sergeant, a patrol's being planned for tonight 0100 hours, across the river.

201
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,900
Regiment wants POWs for interrogation.

202
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,910
What's the situation?

203
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,640
Hey, Web. What?

204
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,340
Come here.

205
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,900
I wanna talk to you for a second. Why?

206
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,510
You want some coffee? No.

207
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,050
Fifteen. Fifteen what?

208
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,080
Lugies since D-day.

209
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,320
Any mortars? 60s, out back.

210
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,220
Is this kid out of high school yet? Out of West Point.

211
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,030
West Point? Isn't that where lke went?

212
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,190
Yeah, he actually graduated with his son.

213
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,700
Shit, so...

214
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,200
What do you know about this patrol thing?

215
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,500
Nothing.

216
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,440
Come on, you gotta know something. I don't.

217
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,810
Bullshit.

218
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,470
You were there, right, at the CP?

219
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,210
This is a prisoner snatch, right?

220
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,410
Hey, Chuck, listen to this.

221
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,120
Come on, Webster, spill it.

222
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,530
Capt. Speirs is to pick 15 men.

223
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,700
Lt. Jones wants to be one of them.

224
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:10,530
I say let the kid go. He could use the experience.

225
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,770
Probably could find 14 replacements to help him out.

226
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,280
I take it this was already an outpost when you arrived?

227
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,470
There were some dogies from the 79th Infantry...

228
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,840
...but they left in a hurry.

229
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,970
What's the report on enemy activity?

230
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,480
Expect some flares, a few mortars at night...

231
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,380
...scattered 88s, snipers during the day.

232
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,320
Yeah, we dodged some mortars on our way in.

233
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,090
They also got some sort of railroad gun back there.

234
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,560
Shells about the size of a deuce and a half.

235
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,360
Sounds like a freight train when one comes over.

236
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,460
They haven't attempted to cross the river?

237
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,600
No.

238
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,770
They have roofs over their heads, sir. Just like us.

239
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,680
I don't think anybody wants to do anything stupid at this point, right?

240
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,480
Why are you holding out? I know you know.

241
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,020
Just give us the names, Web. Who?

242
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,460
There are three men here in this room, that think they should be on the patrol.

243
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,690
Who?

244
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,890
If I tell you, you can't let on that you know.

245
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:17,900
Your secret's safe, Web. Who is it?

246
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,570
Yeah, Heffron.

247
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,800
Shit!

248
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,440
McClung.

249
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,080
And you.

250
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,480
He want any other guys from any other platoon?

251
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,220
No, I don't know. Not that I know of.

252
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,080
Look, that's all I know, I'm sorry.

253
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,790
So, it's McClung, Heffron, and Ramirez.

254
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,030
I'll tell them. I just need you to point... Listen up!

255
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,800
Got some bad news.

256
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,470
There is a patrol set for tonight, and so far, Speirs wants McClung...

257
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,210
We know. Yeah, we just fucking heard.

258
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,180
Webster here told us.

259
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,950
Easy, White.

260
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,710
Yeah.

261
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,620
Okay. All right, out.

262
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,430
The PX rations just came in.

263
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,800
Including winter shoe pacs.

264
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,330
Beautiful. Yeah, finally, right?

265
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,430
Good of 'em. Now we're in a nice warm house.

266
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
Also, we get showers.

267
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,370
All right, let's move! Clear it out!

268
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,240
Come on, move, move!

269
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,350
Incoming!

270
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,910
Come on, come on, go!

271
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,320
Stay down! Stay low, stay low!

272
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,530
Okay.

273
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,230
Showers, let's go, come on.

274
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,280
Somebody's been hit!

275
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,380
What happened? Casualty.

276
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,850
Who is it? Bill Kiehn.

277
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,390
I just left him. I was on my way back.

278
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,690
In war, soldiers sometimes die in the fever pitch of a firefight...

279
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,170
...or by artillery when they're huddled in a foxhole.

280
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,100
Bill Kiehn, a Toccoa man...

281
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:35,770
...was killed because he was carrying potatoes from one building into another...

282
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,610
...in the wrong place at the wrong time.

283
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,270
He was dead before Doc Roe even heard the call for a medic.

284
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,610
Get him out of here, will you?

285
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,180
Let's go, let's get out of here. Yeah, okay.

286
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,360
Did you know him well?

287
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,460
No, not really.

288
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,280
McClung.

289
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,580
Thanks.

290
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,090
Malarkey.

291
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:34,330
Jackson, you and Liebgott, Powers, Wynn, and Webster.

292
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,200
All right?

293
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,370
2nd Platoon, on me.

294
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,240
All right, I'm leading this patrol.

295
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,580
CO wants Grant, Liebgott, Wynn...

296
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,720
...Jackson, Shifty from 3rd Platoon, and Webster.

297
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,990
They want anyone from 1st? No.

298
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,830
Anyone they don't want from 2nd? Jesus Christ.

299
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,560
That list sounds like everybody to me.

300
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,800
It's always 2nd Platoon.

301
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,960
Swear to God, if we had three guys, they'd still want us for it.

302
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,030
I can't believe Malarkey's gonna lead it.

303
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,410
He only lost his five best friends. What the fuck's he gotta live for?

304
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,110
Has it been a long time since your last shower, Professor?

305
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,990
Come on. Is it hot water or cold?

306
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,830
Come on, hurry up, will ya? All right.

307
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,710
I guess I don't really need a shower.

308
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,340
I don't either.

309
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,380
Lieutenant? Yeah.

310
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,150
You still wanna get your ODs dirty? Of course.

311
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,020
I was just thinking.

312
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,060
Sgt. Malarkey's really in no condition to be on this patrol.

313
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,400
And maybe, if you offered, you could go in his place.

314
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,900
Being that you are an officer... No, they want someone with experience.

315
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,810
The guys they picked have plenty of that.

316
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,090
Lt. Jones wanted to experience combat before the war was over.

317
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:39,450
Malarkey had been on the front lines every time Easy Company had seen action since D-day.

318
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,630
If it was possible for them to switch places for the patrol...

319
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,750
...it would be a small moment of justice.

320
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,060
As welcome as a hot shower and a fresh uniform.

321
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,840
The decision, though, was not theirs to make.

322
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,130
Goddamn it, Johnny, you're breaking my heart, I'm telling you.

323
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:00,870
Come on, George, just give me, I don't know, 10, 15 bars.

324
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,350
Juicy Fruit. Happy?

325
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,900
We just got a report of movement.

326
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,580
Lipton wants you to lay a few bazooka rounds into a house across the river.

327
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:10,020
You'd think we could get at least one Hershey bar.

328
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,450
You're 1st Platoon at heart.

329
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,890
Jesus, Cobb, there's not enough.

330
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,050
Hershey bars!

331
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,180
Jesus Christ.

332
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,990
Wait your turn. Who are they for?

333
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,050
Not you, Lieb. Come on, George, one bar.

334
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,860
No, there's not enough to go around. Capt. Speirs here?

335
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,330
Down by the river, sir.

336
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,340
Hey, big mouth, give the kid a Hershey bar.

337
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,770
You gotta be shittin' me!

338
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,070
What's up, guys?

339
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,040
I like what you did with the place, George. Yeah, I did good.

340
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,050
How you feeling? If you keep your hands off my ass, fine.

341
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,520
Have a Hershey. Thanks.

342
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,210
He gets a fuckin' Hershey bar? He got shot in the ass.

343
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,520
Did I tell you to stick your ass out in the wind?

344
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,920
No, but I expect a little sympathy from you, right?

345
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,190
I should rub it for you?

346
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,590
Can you believe this guy?

347
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,690
Try to get him out of the war, he comes back.

348
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,430
That's not what I heard. I heard the Krauts are finished.

349
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,560
Yeah, just to make sure...

350
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,200
...we've gotta row across the fucking river tonight...

351
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,900
...grab a few, and ask 'em in person.

352
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,500
Are you kidding me?

353
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,440
Wish I was. Welcome back, Frank.

354
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,470
Yeah, Jesus, that reminds me, Web, I need you to run these to OP-2 for me.

355
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,570
Grenade launchers for the night patrol.

356
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:13,240
Any day now, Web, there you go.

357
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,680
You know what? Send these, too.

358
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,620
Did you hear what happened on D-company's patrol last night?

359
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,350
What? Replacement lieutenant blew his foot off.

360
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,900
Stepped on a Schu mine. Fresh in from West Point.

361
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,950
Had to come back empty handed.

362
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,260
No shit.

363
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:30,430
Maybe he's a friend of yours, Lieutenant. What you got in there?

364
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,910
More Hershey bars and Lucky Strikes for you rear-echelon fucks to hoard?

365
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,770
Cobb, with the mouth, please. The kid's just trying to do his job, all right?

366
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,870
Jesus Christ. You know what? To hell with it.

367
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,680
Count 'em up, Vest. I gotta go blast this house.

368
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,650
You happy now? You coming, Perco?

369
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,710
Make yourself useful, watch this shit for me.

370
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,980
Web, you're coming with me.

371
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,250
Is Capt. Speirs gonna be where you're headed?

372
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,220
Same vicinity, yeah. Then I'll join you.

373
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:56,280
Where are we going? To the house I gotta blast.

374
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,230
Capt. Winters gonna be with him?

375
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,730
Jesus, look, I don't know, maybe.

376
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,830
Then I'm coming, too. All right, come on, please.

377
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,870
Take it easy, I've been here all fucking day. Give me a bar.

378
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,170
Come on, you don't even smoke cigarettes, damn it!

379
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,940
Come on, I got a wounded ass.

380
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,170
Did intelligence give you any information on the CP?

381
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,210
Third house on the left.

382
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,180
Soon as our men are in the boats, I want a quad 50 opening up.

383
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,880
Capt. Winters?

384
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,510
About the patrol.

385
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:27,360
I feel that I should go on the patrol, sir. I know I could use the experience.

386
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,790
Denied. Anything else?

387
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,560
You're not gonna lead that patrol, Lt. Jones.

388
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,330
Permission to speak, sir.

389
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,000
Go on, Lieutenant.

390
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,440
It looks like Sgt. Malarkey could use a break.

391
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:52,250
I've discussed it with him, he said he didn't mind if I took his place on the patrol.

392
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,150
That was nice of him.

393
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,720
Capt. Winters. Yes.

394
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,660
I'd really like to be on that patrol, sir.

395
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:05,090
If it's true the Krauts are finished...

396
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,860
I haven't really done anything except deliver mail...

397
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,100
...and type morning reports.

398
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,670
Absolutely.

399
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,100
Thank you, Captain.

400
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,670
He's got a point about Sgt. Malarkey.

401
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,270
Yeah, a point.

402
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,240
Fine, you can go.

403
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,120
There'll be a briefing, CP, 1700.

404
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,490
Yes, sir.

405
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:37,420
So, who do you have in mind leading this thing, if not Malarkey?

406
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:43,430
Come on. He can't be leading.

407
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,170
I'm not sure what they decided.

408
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,780
No way. Not on his first day.

409
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:57,080
Do you see any other officer here?

410
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,020
What?

411
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,150
They call you guys, too?

412
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,260
So, who's in charge of this bullshit?

413
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,540
No, he ain't.

414
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:23,400
If he ain't, it's you, Chuck. Or Shifty or Mo.

415
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,200
That'd be better.

416
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,040
Ten-hutt!

417
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,440
At ease.

418
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,280
Gentlemen. Sir.

419
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:40,950
As you can see, we've assembled 15 of you here for this prisoner snatch tonight, 0100.

420
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,020
Just a couple of points.

421
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,930
Secured four rubber boats to get you across the river.

422
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,090
Lt. Jones here is the ranking officer...

423
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,100
...and he'll be along as an observer.

424
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,810
Sgt. Martin here will lead the patrol in Sgt. Malarkey's place.

425
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,600
The whole battalion will be covering your withdrawal.

426
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,340
We've identified targets. We've planned fire for 'em.

427
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,400
We hear these whistles, we open up.

428
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,970
So don't blow them till you're back in the boats with your prisoners.

429
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,180
If the house turns out to be empty, sir?

430
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,090
It won't, but in any case...

431
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,450
...we know it's an outpost, we want it destroyed...

432
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,760
...so you have to lay some demo on a time delay.

433
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:20,320
You have to move fast, but carefully. Put a perimeter around the house.

434
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,830
Once in place, get rifle grenades in the window.

435
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,960
Get your assault team in quick. Okay, good, understood.

436
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,730
Remember, it's about prisoners.

437
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,000
Don't pop the first thing that moves.

438
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,170
Clear? Yes, sir.

439
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,070
Good.

440
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,510
Picked your assault team?

441
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,310
McClung, Sisk, Cobb, Garcia...

442
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,690
...and Webster, as translator.

443
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,750
The rest of you guys, a base of fire with Sgt. Grant.

444
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,870
You speak German, right, Webster?

445
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,730
Yeah, a little bit.

446
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,330
Good.

447
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,540
That's my team, sir.

448
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,000
Questions?

449
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,410
No, sir.

450
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,440
Good.

451
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,500
Good luck.

452
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,140
Thank you, sir.

453
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,680
Ten-hutt!

454
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,780
As you were. Carry on.

455
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,080
A little German?

456
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,790
His German's as good as mine.

457
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,870
It's not a concern of mine. Jackson, you need this.

458
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,960
Can you believe that guy?

459
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,810
Webster, likes to get out of everything.

460
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,170
Whatever.

461
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,110
I want four men on each block.

462
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,480
Four men to go in.

463
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,520
Four on the left flank, four on the right.

464
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,950
Sir? Yes?

465
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,490
Liebgott and I, we both speak German. Yeah?

466
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,430
You said 15 men, there are 16 of us, including two translators.

467
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,060
Fine. Liebgott, you wanna sit this one out?

468
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,360
Yes, sir.

469
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,900
Martin, you wanna supervise the street squads?

470
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,510
Thank you, sir. Or the two fives?

471
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,980
Yeah, anyway...

472
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,480
Okay, you men going on patrol...

473
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:20,040
...Skinny, nothing rattles, nothing shines, no helmets.

474
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,090
Lieutenant?

475
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,070
Thank you.

476
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,980
Are you set for tonight?

477
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,310
I'm ready.

478
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,720
Those Krauts are gonna catch some hell. So I hear.

479
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,920
I'm not personally going in.

480
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,090
It's Martin, right?

481
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,400
Martin and McClung.

482
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,870
I'm supposed to stay in the rear and give them cover.

483
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,000
It's the best place to be.

484
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:40,420
Fifteen men crossing a river to capture prisoners from a German observation post.

485
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:45,590
Getting back safely could be successfully accomplished in as little as ten minutes.

486
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,660
The same mission could be met with disaster...

487
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:52,390
...and result in nothing more than 15 Americans killed or wounded in action.

488
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,030
Those of us who had seen combat before put that out of our minds.

489
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:02,340
Those who hadn't probably thought of little else as we waited for darkness.

490
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,340
Any problems? No problems.

491
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,650
It's secured to the tree. No sign of any AP mines.

492
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,280
Let's go.

493
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,490
Webster, come on.

494
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,900
Keep it steady.

495
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,440
Shit.

496
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,280
I can't swim! Garcia, grab Sisk.

497
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:25,760
Okay, keep going, come on. Stay focused. Come on.

498
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,790
Use the rope.

499
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:34,830
Come on.

500
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,670
Cutters.

501
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,380
Good.

502
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,380
To the side.

503
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,480
Let's go, come on.

504
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,090
Clear.

505
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,590
Easy now, clear.

506
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,810
Powers, go. Go, McClung.

507
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,520
McClung, move up.

508
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,180
In twos, up.

509
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,820
Powers, Wynn, secure the left flank.

510
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,390
Lieutenant...

511
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,730
...take Grant and Heffron secure the right perimeter and crossroads.

512
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,990
Clear?

513
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,090
Security out, go. Move.

514
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,100
Come on, let's go.

515
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,110
Jackson, hold on!

516
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,880
Let's go!

517
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,110
Jackson, wait!

518
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,330
Put it down!

519
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,060
Put it down, and keep your hands out where I can see them!

520
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,520
Keep those Krauts quiet!

521
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,970
Jackson!

522
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,440
Vest, take care of him.

523
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,030
Ramirez, watch Vest.

524
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,270
Let's go, Webster, let's go.

525
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:29,250
Split 'em up, come on.

526
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,650
Webster, check 'em for weapons.

527
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,080
Keep those men quiet!

528
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,720
McClung, cover 'em!

529
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:41,020
Take the charges, prime it, bury it.

530
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,530
Shut up, you two, and pick him up.

531
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,200
McClung, these two are gonna carry the wounded Kraut.

532
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,930
Tell 'em. Bring the wounded man.

533
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,990
I said, shut up.

534
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,940
Ramirez, pick up Jackson! We're moving out!

535
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,840
Come on, where are you going? You, move!

536
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,770
Everybody moves out on my command.

537
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,540
Are you ready? Are you ready?

538
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:03,550
Shut up, you! Come on, we all go together.

539
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,010
Let's go, move, move out! Let's go, move! Move!

540
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,820
Webster, come on!

541
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,460
Powers, fall back, we're moving out!

542
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,470
Keep those prisoners' heads down, and let's keep moving.

543
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,470
Wynn! Fall back! We're moving out, let's go.

544
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,670
We're falling back! Covering fire!

545
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,850
Heffron, I want you to fall back now! Let's go!

546
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,420
Move out, get back to the boat, I'll cover.

547
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:49,550
Go!

548
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,960
Keep those men moving!

549
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,400
Lieutenant, take the whistle. Let's go!

550
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,740
Go!

551
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,570
Let's go!

552
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,180
Stay low, keep moving!

553
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:15,150
Fall back to the boats, now! Fall back!

554
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,380
Jesus Christ, come on, blow the goddamn whistle!

555
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:39,840
Okay, everybody, get in the boats, right now!

556
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,440
Come on, get in the boats.

557
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:46,570
Come on, move! Let's go, Shifty. I'm gonna shoot you, you fucking Kraut!

558
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,550
Shoot him, we'll have to come back for more.

559
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:52,450
You, in the boat, now! You get up, you Kraut piece of shit!

560
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:00,630
Into the boats! Quick, get in the boats, come on!

561
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,990
Let's go, we're moving out!

562
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,430
Let's get these boats in the water!

563
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,600
Let's do it, start pulling.

564
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,480
You're okay, Jackson!

565
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,510
Keep pulling!

566
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,930
Come on, keep going, come on!

567
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:37,030
Perconte, come on, let's go!

568
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,800
Where's the medic?

569
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,420
Everybody off the boats! Let's go!

570
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,050
Take cover!

571
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,250
We got wounded, come on.

572
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,800
Popeye, get the Krauts back there, and shake 'em down.

573
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,190
Move! Move!

574
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,730
McClung, McClung!

575
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,300
Get onto the company CP! Let 'em know what we got!

576
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,770
Shut up, just shut up.

577
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,170
I can't do this, I can't do this.

578
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,180
Move off. Webster, stay with him.

579
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,240
Hey, Shifty, watch Vest.

580
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,950
Sir, I'm going to get a medic.

581
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,820
You got this? Yeah.

582
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,060
Get his legs. Jackson, listen to me.

583
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,500
Calm down, or we can't help you.

584
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:43,000
Settle down.

585
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,800
He's gonna fucking die!

586
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,170
Jackson, look at me, don't listen to him.

587
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,110
Look at me. You're gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be okay.

588
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:59,340
Keep still. Be calm, buddy, everything's fine. Everything's fine.

589
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,820
Goddamn it!

590
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:03,850
Jesus!

591
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:10,280
You think you're out of this war? What do you think you're doing?

592
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,920
We're not gonna get more prisoners, because you killed one!

593
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,560
Private, listen to me, Private. He's gonna fucking die!

594
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,430
Sit down! Jackson, stay calm, the medic is coming.

595
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:24,840
They're on their way. Where the fuck is the medic?

596
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,470
Doc is on his way.

597
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:30,270
You'll be okay. All right, Jackson, you got the doc.

598
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:34,340
Doc's here, you're okay. All right, Jackson, take it easy, okay.

599
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,410
Okay.

600
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:40,760
Light, I need some light, give me some light.

601
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:44,060
All right, look at the flame, Jackson.

602
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,820
Okay, that's good.

603
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,400
All right, let's get him out of here.

604
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,800
You guys, help the doc move him.

605
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:57,570
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die!

606
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,370
It's okay, Jackson. I don't wanna die!

607
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,300
Take it easy.

608
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,410
It's okay, it's okay.

609
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,610
You're all right. Jackson!

610
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,980
God, my God! Jackson, you're not gonna die.

611
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,990
You're not gonna die, I need you to hang on!

612
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,290
Jackson!

613
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:00,400
Eugene Jackson was 20 years old.

614
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:04,130
He'd lied about his age when he joined the army at 16.

615
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:07,440
His family, I'm sure, got a telegram...

616
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:10,500
...from the War Department, saying he died a hero...

617
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,410
...on an important mission that would help win the war.

618
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:18,620
In fact, Eugene lost his life on a stretcher in a dank basement in Haguenau...

619
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:22,560
...crying out in agony while his friends looked on helplessly.

620
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:27,620
He was just one more casualty in a war that was supposed to be all but over.

621
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:34,300
Did they put that in the report on the ADA?

622
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:38,370
We're working on it. How long are you gonna keep...

623
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,450
Keep moving, go on.

624
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:51,050
Get up on the truck.

625
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,350
Up, up.

626
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,350
Status?

627
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:59,360
Private Jackson took a grenade fragment from the enemy OP.

628
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,200
It was his own grenade.

629
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,490
He died of his wounds, sir.

630
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,940
Any others?

631
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:08,670
No, sir.

632
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:14,330
Well executed.

633
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:16,510
It's not your fault.

634
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:20,310
Talk to your men.

635
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,380
Carry on. Thank you, sir.

636
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,910
We heard you got two prisoners.

637
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:55,750
Good work.

638
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,380
Jackson's dead.

639
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,720
Yeah, we heard.

640
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,460
They want another patrol tonight.

641
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,850
What are you doing, Cobb?

642
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,220
You leave someone on the bank?

643
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,290
Yeah, yeah, we did.

644
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:44,430
It's the third prisoner that was too far-gone to bring back.

645
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:48,100
Maybe we should put him out of his misery.

646
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:49,810
Fuck his misery.

647
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:52,100
I can't listen to it anymore.

648
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:07,450
Sir, want cigarette? Yeah.

649
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:09,960
Who's got a light?

650
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:11,390
Here, sir.

651
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,500
Twenty-two.

652
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:25,040
What you looking at, Webster?

653
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,240
Yeah, that's what I thought, college boy.

654
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,250
Are you drunk, trooper?

655
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,180
Leave me alone.

656
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:42,190
Answer the question.

657
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:45,050
Yes, sir, I am drunk, sir.

658
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,460
Drunk.

659
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:53,130
Sick and tired of fucking patrols, taking orders...

660
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,130
Hey, Cobb, shut up. It's boring, okay?

661
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,070
Taking his side, Johnny?

662
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:06,880
Yeah...I am.

663
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:35,180
So, he knows we lost a man? Yeah, he knows.

664
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,210
He also knows you picked up two prisoners who talked.

665
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,680
About what?

666
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:43,950
OB, supply trouble, Hitler's favorite color.

667
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:46,680
I don't know. None of it gets us across the river.

668
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,420
What's the point?

669
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,220
Honestly?

670
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,890
Sink's been on the phone all day, bragging it up.

671
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:58,430
I think he's just showing off now.

672
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:00,900
I don't know, Dick. I don't know what to tell you.

673
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:03,410
You gave him a successful patrol, now he wants two.

674
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:04,870
Successful.

675
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,300
Sir, the men are mustered.

676
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:11,110
If you want me to brief 'em, I'm gonna.

677
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:14,970
It's the same roster as last night.

678
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:17,820
Well, mostly.

679
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,730
Evening, gents. Evening, Colonel.

680
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:25,490
At ease.

681
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:34,200
Y'all did a damn fine job on a tough mission last night.

682
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:38,710
And I wish you good luck tonight, 'cause I'll be expecting more of the same.

683
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,970
Have you briefed the men? Just on our way, sir.

684
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:43,480
All right.

685
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,870
Make damn sure you remind 'em how proud I am of what they did.

686
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:48,250
Yes, sir.

687
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:55,850
So, I'll brief 'em now, sir?

688
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:59,290
No.

689
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,020
No, I'll do it.

690
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:14,110
Sarge, they're on their way in.

691
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,480
Ten-hutt.

692
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,810
Martin. Sir.

693
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:23,880
At ease.

694
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:26,750
This everybody, Grant? Sir.

695
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:33,790
You men did an excellent job last night.

696
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:37,630
I'm proud.

697
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,930
I just saw Col. Sink. He's proud, too.

698
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000
In fact, he's so proud, he wants you to do another patrol across the river tonight.

699
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:51,870
Any moment now, the outpost we hit last night...

700
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:54,350
...will go up in flames, Martin? Yes, sir.

701
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:57,180
It means we'd have to venture farther into town this time.

702
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:01,280
Capt. Speirs, you have the map, please? Yeah, Sgt. Grant.

703
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,160
We have enemy movement here and here...

704
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:11,430
...which means this is our new house target here.

705
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,660
We recovered all the boats so we'll set off from the same place as last night.

706
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:18,370
We're not changing the plan any, sir?

707
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,010
No. Plan is the same.

708
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:28,450
It will be 0200 hours instead of 0100.

709
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,050
Is that clear? Yes, sir.

710
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:36,190
Okay. Good, because...

711
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,020
...I want you all to get a full night's sleep tonight.

712
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:47,160
Which means, in the morning you will report to me that you made it across the river...

713
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,170
...into German lines...

714
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:53,870
...but were unable to secure any live prisoners.

715
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:01,950
Understand?

716
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,720
Yes, sir.

717
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:09,020
Good.

718
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:12,200
Look sharp for tomorrow.

719
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,320
We're moving off the line.

720
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,240
Did I fucking hear that right? A good man.

721
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:23,400
Moving off the line.

722
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:37,140
It's a whole new way to fight a war.

723
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:39,780
Don't bother writing this up. I'll take care of it.

724
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,690
I might actually enjoy it. Okay.

725
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,520
Think you might be onto something, Dick.

726
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,530
Lt. Jones. Sir.

727
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,660
Join us at the company CP.

728
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:05,040
First Sergeant Lipton. Sir.

729
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:08,280
Your honorable discharge as an enlisted man.

730
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:09,750
Just keep 'em coming, Luz.

731
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,720
Battlefield commission as Second Lieutenant.

732
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:14,310
Look what we have here, boys. Hey, pal.

733
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:16,660
Congratulations, Carwood. Thank you, sir.

734
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:18,990
Lip, congratulations. Thanks.

735
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:23,170
Thank you, sir. Thank you, welcome back, sir.

736
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,790
That's Harry to you. Congratulations. Thanks, Harry.

737
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:27,840
Harry, I didn't expect to see you this soon.

738
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:30,930
I figured you'd be nursing that scratch for another month or two.

739
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:32,940
Did you miss me, Lewis?

740
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,840
Lt. Jones.

741
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:39,840
Regiment has seen fit to promote you to First Lieutenant.

742
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:42,920
They want you on staff up there.

743
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,450
Congratulations and good luck. Thank you, sir.

744
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:54,800
Dismissed.

745
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:59,960
Looks like you lost another platoon leader, Web?

746
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,780
So, a second patrol never happened.

747
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:10,280
Word was Capt. Nixon wrote up a bogus report...

748
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:12,680
...and regiment never got wise.

749
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,510
As we pulled out of Haguenau...

750
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:17,990
...many of us in Easy Company felt that a corner had been turned...

751
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,790
...and we all might make it home alive.

752
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:24,920
So, we'll know more as soon as we get closer to the line.

753
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,790
Before I forget...

754
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:31,700
...Col. Sink's unhappy with the appearance of your uniform.

755
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:34,530
He says it's not befitting to your rank.

756
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:42,580
Oak leaves.

757
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,650
Congratulations, Major.

758
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:51,320
Gentlemen, we're ready.

759
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:01,600
I'll drive.

760
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:05,860
Sgt. Malarkey good luck, sir.

761
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,760
Sgt. Martin. Yeah, Lieutenant?

762
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:13,670
Good work. Thank you, sir.

763
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,510
Good to have you along. Good luck, men.

764
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:41,600
Here.

765
00:54:57,550 --> 00:54:59,820
I wondered if people back home would ever know...

766
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:02,880
...what it cost the soldiers to win this war.

767
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,290
In America, things were already beginning to look like peace time.

768
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:10,660
The standard of living was on the rise, race tracks and nightclubs were booming.

769
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:14,730
You couldn't get a hotel room in Miami Beach, it was so crowded.

770
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:20,070
How could anyone ever know of the price paid by soldiers...

771
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,370
...in terror, agony, and bloodshed...

772
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:24,680
...if they'd never been to places like Normandy...

773
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,910
...Bastogne, or Haguenau?

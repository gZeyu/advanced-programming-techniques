1
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,710
It was more than three years since Lewis Nixon and I...

2
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,050
...decided to join the paratroops.

3
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,590
And more than a year since we'd first gone to war...

4
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,610
...not knowing what would happen to us.

5
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,720
How long we'd be fighting where we'd end up.

6
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,190
I certainly didn't expect to find myself in a place like this.

7
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,500
I thought it might be you.

8
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,840
'Morning.

9
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,610
I heard reports about a red-headed Eskimo.

10
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,010
Thought I'd check it out.

11
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,350
Come to join me for a morning swim?

12
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,950
Yeah. You know me so well.

13
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,420
Here, it's from Zielinski.

14
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,860
Oh, great.

15
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,900
What is that?

16
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,600
Ran into the regimental photographer.

17
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,240
Said he had all these photographs of the 506th...

18
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,610
...going all the way back to Toccoa.

19
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,940
I traded them for a couple of Lugers.

20
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,170
That's a bargain.

21
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,890
What do you think you'll do after this?

22
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,860
Get some breakfast.

23
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,830
No, after, after.

24
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,160
Well, it's funny you should mention it...

25
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,760
...'cause I had a meeting with Colonel Sink.

26
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,170
Really?

27
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:53,970
Yeah.

28
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,010
Yeah, he and I discussed the possibility of staying.

29
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,580
In the Army?

30
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,080
Yeah.

31
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,980
Yeah, as a career.

32
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,350
What'd you say?

33
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,580
I said I'd think about it.

34
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,300
What do you think about New Jersey?

35
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,070
New Jersey?

36
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,200
There's a company in Nixon, New Jersey.

37
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,180
It's called "Nixon Nitration Works".

38
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,370
Sounds picturesque.

39
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,500
Yeah, well, oddly enough I know the owners.

40
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,980
Probably gonna expect me to make something of myself.

41
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,320
I thought maybe I'd drag you with me.

42
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,780
Are you offering me a job?

43
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,960
We'll see how you do in your interview...

44
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,560
...but, you know, a man of your qualifications...

45
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,470
...I think we can probably scrape something up. Commensurate with your current salary level.

46
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,240
Yeah, I'll think about it.

47
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,140
I really appreciate it.

48
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,690
Yeah, just think about it.

49
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,910
Yeah.

50
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,390
Job offers. Hard to fathom.

51
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,990
And the war wasn't even over.

52
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,660
I was still getting used to hot showers and morning swims.

53
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,330
We'd entered Bavaria in early May...

54
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,200
...with the hopes of capturing Berchtesgaden.

55
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,950
This famous town, high in the Alps...

56
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,420
...was the Nazi party's symbolic home...

57
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,680
...and all the heads of the Third Reich had houses there.

58
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,580
Although Hitler was dead, he had apparently ordered the SS to make it their last stand...

59
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,350
...from which to mount a guerrilla resistance against the Allied advance.

60
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,760
The first step was blocking the roads.

61
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,770
When are we expecting the engineers to arrive?

62
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,100
Half an hour ago.

63
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,370
We're stuck here until they do, Nix.

64
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,300
Well, if you're the SS...

65
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,940
...you're not gonna let us waltz into Hitler's house.

66
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,140
Probably throw a few rocks at us yourself.

67
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,740
If you want someone to find a way up that mountain...

68
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,180
...Easy Company is ready.

69
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:04,780
Duly noted.

70
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,840
I already recommended you to Colonel Sink.

71
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,790
Let's go find out where Hitler lived.

72
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,120
Ron, we're not sure what's up there.

73
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,650
The Colonel doesn't want us taking any unnecessary risks.

74
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,700
So, the French are gonna beat us to the Eagle's Nest.

75
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,410
Gents, I just had a conversation with General Leclerc.

76
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,070
He said he was first into Paris...

77
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,210
...and by God he wanted to be first into Berchtesgaden.

78
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,810
Told him I understood his point.

79
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,920
You fire up 2nd battalion and outflank that French son of a bitch.

80
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,550
Yes, sir.

81
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,170
I want Easy Company in the lead.

82
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,790
Have the men assemble on the highway.

83
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,960
Yes, sir.

84
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,370
Eerie. Not even any natives.

85
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,610
That's 'cause this is the one town you can't deny being a true Nazi.

86
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,340
What do you mean?

87
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,580
Well, you have to be to live here.

88
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,350
Need to find some place we can put the Colonel.

89
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,050
How about right there?

90
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,750
No, no.

91
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,280
Kitty would love this.

92
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,920
How many brides get a wedding present from Hitler?

93
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,050
You wanna take half?

94
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,590
I can't carry all this.

95
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,890
You know, whoever comes in here after us...

96
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,160
...is gonna take whatever isn't nailed down.

97
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,460
Well...

98
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,560
...wouldn't want that to happen.

99
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,300
Nice.

100
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,100
Don't even think about it.

101
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,310
Major Winters. Sir.

102
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,280
More.

103
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,350
Permission to climb the mountain, sir?

104
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,320
Eagle's Nest?

105
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,650
What is this?

106
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,160
Wait one minute.

107
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:54,260
Harry, have F Company put a double guard on the hotel. Set up roadblocks on the west side of town.

108
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,890
I want battalion HQ, seal off the north side...

109
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,490
...and prepare for prisoners.

110
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,590
Sergeant Grant.

111
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,430
And, Harry, nobody gets hurt, not now.

112
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,810
And Easy?

113
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,170
Easy will head up the mountain through the Obersalzburg...

114
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,150
...and take the Eagle's Nest.

115
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,540
Hi-ho, Silver!

116
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,460
The Eagle's Nest was a surprise birthday present for Hitler...

117
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,520
...built with Nazi party money.

118
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,030
A mountaintop stone retreat 8,000 feet up...

119
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,540
...accessible by a gold-plated elevator.

120
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,430
It was one of the crown jewels of his empire...

121
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,130
...and the man was afraid of heights.

122
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,150
Here's to him.

123
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,930
No, goddamn it, listen.

124
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,160
Hitler, Hitler, no.

125
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,170
Hitler, Himmler, Goering, Goebbels.

126
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,550
Hey, Adolf. Love your Eagle's Nest.

127
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,550
I hope you don't mind. We made ourselves at home.

128
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,180
Love what you've done with it.

129
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,850
Hey, hey, have a drink. Come on.

130
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,290
Just so as we can say we saw you do it.

131
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,890
Listen up.

132
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,690
From Corps, just came in.

133
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,960
Effective immediately.

134
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,590
All troops stand fast on present positions.

135
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,330
Standing fast.

136
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,500
Wanna hear it?

137
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,870
Ready for it, listen up. The German army surrendered.

138
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,950
I got a present for you, come on.

139
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,850
Is it? yeah.

140
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,240
What is this place? Hermann Goering's house.

141
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,910
We discovered it yesterday. Had it on double guard ever since.

142
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,950
I can vouch for that.

143
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,080
Oh, anxious to get off duty, O'Keefe?

144
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,710
No, there's just so much to see and do, sir.

145
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,250
Ten thousand bottles of the world's finest liquor...

146
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:06,790
...wine, and champagne helped Easy Company mark the day the war in Europe came to an end.

147
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,460
It's all yours.

148
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,460
Take what you want and have each company take a truckload.

149
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:18,500
We're going to Austria in the morning. Don't feel obliged to leave stuff for whoever comes next.

150
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:19,770
Austria, sir?

151
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,610
Happy V.E. Day.

152
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,700
Yeah.

153
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,600
V.E. day?

154
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,250
Victory in Europe.

155
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,590
Happy V.E. Day.

156
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,720
Instead of an aggressive combat unit...

157
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,960
...we became an occupation force...

158
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,590
...and no one wanted to leave Berchtesgaden...

159
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,500
...until they saw Austria.

160
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:31,940
So, you reckon they'll make us run up those or ski down them?

161
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,320
Hey, how are you?

162
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,180
Need a hand there?

163
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,320
He loves you!

164
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,770
Hey, lady, how are you?

165
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,370
I think the war is over.

166
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,670
We'll be comfortable here.

167
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,670
I wonder what will happen to us...

168
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,970
...to people like you and me when there are finally no more wars to occupy us.

169
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,950
Have all your men collect the weapons...

170
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,690
...deposit them at the church, at the school, and at the airfield.

171
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,920
Very well.

172
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,760
Please accept this as my formal surrender, Major.

173
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,400
It is better than to lay it on the desk of a clerk.

174
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,810
You may keep your sidearm, Colonel.

175
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,900
Heroic dead of a combined army and marine force mark the grim battlefield of Okinawa...

176
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,230
...where one of the worst battles of the war is being fought.

177
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,700
Thousands of Yanks have been wounded...

178
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,680
Along the Jap's southern defense line...

179
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:08,080
...the Yanks progress slowly facing one of the fiercest artillery barrages of the war.

180
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,850
Each small advance is gained by sheer grit...

181
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,190
...in the face of withering fire from a suicidal enemy...

182
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,230
...being slowly hammered back into the hills.

183
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,990
The going is brutal and our casualties are high...

184
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,760
...but Okinawa is the next big step towards victory over Japan.

185
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,230
A victory that can only be won by work...

186
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,500
...war bonds, and heroic sacrifice.

187
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,710
So, when are we going? We don't have a date yet.

188
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,140
Are we to tell the men right away?

189
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,140
Some of them will have enough points to go home instead.

190
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,810
Not many if their only medal's a Purple Heart.

191
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,960
I think most of us here will have enough.

192
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,050
And each of us will have to decide what to do.

193
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,760
I don't know how long we're waiting here for orders...

194
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,360
...but I want those veterans who are staying...

195
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,060
...and all new replacements, ready to fight.

196
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,740
That means rifle ranges.

197
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,770
That means daily close order drills. That means troop reviews...

198
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,900
...but, above all, it means physical training.

199
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,170
Get your NCOs on it.

200
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,370
They're gonna love you.

201
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,250
What are you crouching down for, Perco?

202
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,320
Think the deer's gonna shoot back?

203
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,690
Leave me alone.

204
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,650
How about you all just shut up...

205
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,020
...and let Shifty kill us some dinner?

206
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,560
What's the matter, Bull?

207
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,430
You tired of eating dried up spuds three times a day?

208
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,290
Hey, you know what, I got an idea. Why don't we just shoot Bull here...

209
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,530
...and feed the company for a week?

210
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,760
Oh, goddamn it, Shifty.

211
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,460
You let him get away. Army ought to be glad to be rid of you.

212
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,600
I wish, you know. It seems they want me to stay around awhile.

213
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:23,100
Are you serious? How many points you need?

214
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,200
Fifteen.

215
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,280
Fifteen! Jesus Christ, I thought I had it bad.

216
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,910
No Purple Hearts, never was injured.

217
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,020
Company! Platoon! Attention!

218
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:43,160
Right shoulder. Arm!

219
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,530
Order. Arms!

220
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,760
At ease.

221
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,910
General Taylor is aware that many veterans...

222
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,740
...including Normandy veterans...

223
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:04,210
...still do not have the 85 points required to be discharged.

224
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,180
On this the anniversary of D-day...

225
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,340
...he has authorized a lottery to send...

226
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,350
...one man home in each company...

227
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,150
...effective immediately.

228
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:16,120
For Easy Company, the winner is...

229
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,020
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

230
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,870
Serial number 13066266.

231
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,240
Sergeant Darrell C. Powers.

232
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,340
Shifty

233
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,440
That's how it's done, Shifty.

234
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,310
Congratulations, Shifty.

235
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,940
Sergeant Grant will see to it that 2nd Platoon takes over at the crossroads checkpoint...

236
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,320
...beginning tonight at 2200 hours.

237
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,020
So much for our anniversary. No shit.

238
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,330
General Taylor has also announced that the 101st Airborne Division...

239
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,370
...will definitely be redeployed to the Pacific.

240
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:06,030
So, beginning tomorrow, at 0600 hours...

241
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,470
...we will begin training to go to war.

242
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,040
Come in.

243
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,180
I don't mean to interrupt you, sir.

244
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,390
I just wanted to say goodbye.

245
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,330
You know, you was...

246
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,760
You was...

247
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,900
Well...

248
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,630
It's been a long time.

249
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,900
You got everything you need?

250
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,940
Yes, sir.

251
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,710
I gathered up my loot. Pistols mainly.

252
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:56,480
Paperwork's all done. I even got my back pay in my pocket.

253
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,190
Back, back home in Virginia...

254
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,050
Well...

255
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,490
I just don't rightly know how I'm gonna explain all this.

256
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,830
You see, I've...

257
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:27,140
I've seen... I've seen...

258
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,680
You're a hell of a fine soldier, Shifty.

259
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,980
There's nothing more to explain.

260
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,820
Thank you, sir.

261
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:52,500
Two days later, Shifty Powers was on a truck headed for the rear and a boat home.

262
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:57,500
Unfortunately the truck was hit head-on by a drunken corporal from another regiment.

263
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,440
Shifty had a broken pelvis...

264
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:02,070
...a broken arm, and a bad concussion.

265
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:06,380
He survived, but spent the next few months in a series of hospitals.

266
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:09,750
I wish I could say that he was our only casualty in Austria.

267
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,180
I've made up my mind, Nix.

268
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,520
I got the points, I'm going back to Kitty.

269
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:19,120
Harry, do you really think that Kitty hasn't run off with some 4-F by now?

270
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,690
Son of a bitch. That's not even funny.

271
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,350
Harry, ignore him.

272
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:28,230
How am I supposed to tell her I had the chance to go home to her finally...

273
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,770
...but decided not to, so I could go jump on Tokyo?

274
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,170
All right, so don't tell her.

275
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:37,070
Besides, she's waited for you for three years, right?

276
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,800
We'll be to Tokyo and back in two years, three tops.

277
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,040
It'll probably be over before you even get there.

278
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:46,140
The reality is you're gonna sit here in Austria for six months waiting to go...

279
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,810
...and I'm gonna be back in Wilkes-Barre making babies.

280
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:52,050
You didn't tell him? No, I couldn't get him to shut up.

281
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,790
What, tell me what?

282
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,590
Guts and Glory here applied for a transfer.

283
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,820
What?

284
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,260
13th Airborne are heading out for the Pacific right away.

285
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,770
If I'm going, I wanna get it over with.

286
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,470
Are you in on this too?

287
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:17,580
I can't let him go by himself. He doesn't know where it is.

288
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,880
You're leaving the men?

289
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,180
They don't need me anymore.

290
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,850
Wounded in Normandy?

291
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:43,200
Yes, sir. In the leg. It was a minor flesh wound.

292
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,570
Company E lost 24 men killed there.

293
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,030
Yes, sir.

294
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,370
Seventeen of those were in my company commander's plane. It went down on D-day.

295
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:55,870
So, you were given command of the company on D-day?

296
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,710
That's right.

297
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,960
Fall back to your original positions!

298
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,520
Everyone else maintain your pace of fire!

299
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:28,300
In Holland they bumped you to battalion X O.

300
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,910
Yes, sir.

301
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,310
Bastards took your company away.

302
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,980
I fired my last shots there.

303
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,710
For the whole damn war?

304
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,980
Yes, sir.

305
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,720
You got through Bastogne without having to fire your weapon?

306
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,780
That is correct, sir.

307
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,130
And you were on the line the whole time?

308
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,420
Yes, sir.

309
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:31,330
Can't imagine a tougher test for a leader...

310
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:36,240
...having to sit through a siege like that under those conditions.

311
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,270
We got through it.

312
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,770
Find some cover, find a foxhole!

313
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,340
Come on, take cover! Take cover!

314
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,810
Come on, find some cover!

315
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,760
Why do you want a transfer?

316
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,520
Sorry, sir?

317
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,320
I said, why do you want to leave your men?

318
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,490
It's not that, sir.

319
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,430
It's just that if the war was still on in the Pacific...

320
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,490
...and I could do some good over there.

321
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,410
Looking to have your own division someday?

322
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,940
No, sir.

323
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,370
Not going to make a career of the army?

324
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:21,570
No. Well, I don't know, sir.

325
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,080
Because if you think you need more combat experience...

326
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,520
...to get stars on your helmet...

327
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,920
...let me tell you something, son.

328
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,090
You've done enough.

329
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:39,220
Thank you, sir. That's not my objective.

330
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:52,500
Major, I took this meeting out of respect for your achievements and for the 101st.

331
00:30:53,750 --> 00:31:00,210
If they do go to the Pacific eventually you should be running one of the battalions.

332
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,380
Thank you, sir.

333
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,650
And frankly, your men have earned the right to keep you around.

334
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,560
Yes, sir.

335
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,120
Thank you, sir.

336
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:29,600
So, I would stay in Austria for the time being waiting for orders...

337
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,480
...and trying to watch over soldiers who had no enemy to fight.

338
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,520
Lieb, I fucking hate this.

339
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,310
Oh, Jesus Christ, they fingered him.

340
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,180
He was in the fucking room, Web.

341
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,790
A Polack who was at the slave camps said this is where he lives, here.

342
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,990
Which camp? Whatever camp.

343
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,590
I'm under direct orders and I'm happy to follow it.

344
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,140
Is this a personal thing, Joe?

345
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,050
What?

346
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,750
Is this personal to you?

347
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,550
No, it's a goddamn order.

348
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,420
Does Major Winters know about this?

349
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,790
Doesn't matter here.

350
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,220
Oh, the fuck it doesn't.

351
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,950
What if this guy's just a soldier?

352
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,220
What if he's an officer with no ties to the SS?

353
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,520
If he's innocent? You know...

354
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,400
...what if he's a fucking Nazi commandant of a slave camp?

355
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,970
Which one, which camp? You don't have any proof.

356
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,630
Were you at Landsberg?

357
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,440
You know I was.

358
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,310
You think he's a soldier like you and me?

359
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,640
A fucking innocent German officer?

360
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,310
Where the hell have you been for the past three years?

361
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,550
Wer sind Sie?

362
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,150
Was machen Sie hier?

363
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,250
What?

364
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,250
Ich habe gar nichts.

365
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:56,920
Shut up.

366
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,050
Was machen Sie?

367
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,020
Ruhe.

368
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,990
Sie sind der Kommandant.

369
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,220
Gehen Sie raus.

370
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,920
Sie sind der Kommandant.

371
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,060
Welcher Kommandant?

372
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,120
Vom Arbeitslager.

373
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,100
Ich weiss von keinem Arbeitslager.

374
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,000
Sie haben die falsche Person.

375
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:13,830
Nein, nein.

376
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,610
Don't fucking lie to me.

377
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,080
Sie tauschen sich.

378
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:21,140
See what you did to my fucking people?

379
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,740
Nein.

380
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,830
He's guilty.

381
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:57,770
Liebgott says so. He probably is.

382
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,580
Goddamn son of a bitch. Shoot him.

383
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,350
Shoot him!

384
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,520
No.

385
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,650
Officers don't run.

386
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,280
The war's over, anybody would run.

387
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:47,980
Summer in this Alpine paradise should have been a welcome relief...

388
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,860
...especially now that we were at peace with the Germans.

389
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,830
Everyone just wanted to go home.

390
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,690
France. France was the best.

391
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:56,390
Really?

392
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:59,700
Yeah, five years.

393
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:04,000
I think I was in every country, but France was the best.

394
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,680
Italy would be second for me.

395
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,650
Russia is not desirable. Ukraine, it was okay.

396
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,250
So, when do you get out?

397
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:24,360
The unit is discharged. We leave when my captain gets transferred.

398
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,860
It is the end of my second war.

399
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,160
Jesus.

400
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,160
I'm going home now to Mannheim.

401
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,670
I'll take this one.

402
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,700
Passkarte, bitte.

403
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,040
Okay.

404
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,700
Hey, Webster.

405
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,540
My relief. Don't salute the Germans.

406
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:50,380
Come on. I sort of get a kick out of it.

407
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:53,610
Anyway, I got me a new enemy. The Japs.

408
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:58,320
75 points. How about you? I mean, you're a Toccoa guy, right?

409
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,160
How many you got? Wouldn't you like to know?

410
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,430
Discharged, huh?

411
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:11,690
Go ahead, take off, it's my turn. Okay, see you back at the farm.

412
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,100
Eighty-one.

413
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:16,900
What?

414
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,240
I have 81 points.

415
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,040
Well, that's just not good enough.

416
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,420
See about getting you a ride.

417
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,250
Hey!

418
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,490
Hey!

419
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,230
Where are they going?

420
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:38,890
Munich. Munchen, Munich.

421
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,860
Wanna go to Munich?

422
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,360
Mochten Sie nach Munchen gehen?

423
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:44,630
Ja, bitte.

424
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,870
Get in.

425
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,200
Too bad.

426
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,280
Turn the wheel!

427
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,850
Oh, Jesus.

428
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,300
It's Private Janovec.

429
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,740
He was dead when they brought him in.

430
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,040
75 points.

431
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,810
What? He was 10 points short.

432
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:45,110
The enemy had surrendered, but somehow men were still dying.

433
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,620
Young men, who wanted to be home with their families by now...

434
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,250
...who'd served with distinction since before Normandy...

435
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,920
...were stuck here because they didn't have the points.

436
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,460
What they did have plenty of were weapons, alcohol, and too much time on their hands.

437
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,030
When all of a sudden, from out of nowhere...

438
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,770
...a guy jumps out of the hedgerow...

439
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,100
...onto this guy's chest.

440
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,640
Shoves a trench knife up against his throat and screams, "Whose side are you on?"

441
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,610
I don't get it.

442
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,980
It's D-day.

443
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:18,580
It's 2nd platoon's own Bill Guarnere. Old' Gonorrhea himself.

444
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,620
Just landed in Normandy and wound up like I don't know what.

445
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,420
"Whose side are you on?" What a fucking character!

446
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,020
What happened to him?

447
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,360
Got his leg blown off in Bastogne.

448
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,090
Wait here.

449
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,470
Are you okay, Mac, do you need some help?

450
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,110
They wouldn't give me any gas.

451
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,110
Krauts.

452
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,350
I tried to explain.

453
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,050
This fucking limey wouldn't listen.

454
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:08,160
I think he was a Major.

455
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,770
Look, Private, we've got a problem here.

456
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,390
Do you have any gas?

457
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,400
Why don't you give me your weapon?

458
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,740
Well, I guess I'll just use his Jeep. I don't think he's gonna be needing it.

459
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,970
Hold on a second there, all right?

460
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,280
Jesus.

461
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:30,350
Sarge! Sergeant Grant!

462
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,150
Sarge!

463
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,800
Jesus.

464
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,530
What?

465
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,530
He's not gonna make it.

466
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,360
You can't operate on him?

467
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,200
Not me.

468
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,800
You'd need a brain surgeon.

469
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:54,000
And even if you had one, I don't think there's any hope.

470
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,740
Find the shooter. Alive. Come on, help me.

471
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,710
What are you doing?

472
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,980
We're gonna go find a brain surgeon.

473
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,020
Hey, Lieb. He wants a noncom guarding each roadblock...

474
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,280
...and two men watching every road out of town.

475
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,220
Bull, Malark, you each pick a squad...

476
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,350
...and one witness on a house to house search.

477
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,590
Can we shoot this bastard on sight?

478
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,430
Try and take him alive.

479
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,900
Where's Grant now?

480
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,900
They took him to a Kraut hospital...

481
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,770
...to see if they could drum up any good doctors.

482
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,240
Open up.

483
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,610
Come with me.

484
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:42,720
Why?

485
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,750
Get in the Jeep.

486
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,220
Where're we going?

487
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:49,990
To the hospital, get in.

488
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,960
If you're going to shoot me, shoot me.

489
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,790
If you're not, put the gun away.

490
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,860
Get in the Jeep, now.

491
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,360
What happened to him? He was shot in the head.

492
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:06,670
Half hour ago. Come on.

493
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,180
If you want him to live, you'll help me.

494
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:11,300
First by putting that away.

495
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,380
Let's go. Let me drive.

496
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,250
We'll get there faster.

497
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:34,960
Jesus. Again, what a hand.

498
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,960
I don't know who's taking a bigger beating, me or him.

499
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,510
Wanna play a different game?

500
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,100
No.

501
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,640
Same game, just shuffle them up good, huh?

502
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:50,740
You all right? Yeah, I'm all right.

503
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,140
You wanna go in there and join in?

504
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:58,320
I should go in there and stop this.

505
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,090
Floyd, let's just play cards, all right?

506
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,470
Where is he?

507
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,560
How's Grant?

508
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,430
Is he okay?

509
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,300
This him?

510
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,440
That's him.

511
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,250
Replacement I Company.

512
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,460
Where's the weapon?

513
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:38,190
What weapon?

514
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:43,530
When you talk to an officer, you say "sir."

515
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:36,970
Have the MPs take care of this piece of shit.

516
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,080
Grant's dead? No.

517
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:45,650
Kraut surgeon says he's gonna make it.

518
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:53,290
Hey, tough guy, on your feet. Come on, move, move it.

519
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,960
I'm guessing they were Hitler's photo albums, sir.

520
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:00,430
Sure had a lot of pictures of him in it.

521
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,000
You looked at them, but you didn't take them?

522
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:04,200
That's right, sir.

523
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:05,830
I don't believe you.

524
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:12,940
I'll be watching you.

525
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,950
You're dismissed.

526
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:20,180
You'd better not be lying to me.

527
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:26,620
What?

528
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:30,860
Sir, if it's not gonna put you in too much of a bind...

529
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,290
...I'd like to resign as Company 1st Sergeant.

530
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,660
If I had my choice I miss being back amongst the men.

531
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:44,010
I'd be happy to go to Staff Sergeant whichever platoon you wanna put me in.

532
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:52,310
Well, I guess you've earned your right to demote yourself.

533
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,210
Thank you, sir.

534
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:58,150
You wanna take over Sergeant Grant's platoon?

535
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,920
That would do fine, sir.

536
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:06,990
All right then, report to Lieutenant Peacock.

537
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:12,330
Let me know if he gives you any trouble.

538
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,230
Oh, sir, you make your decision yet?

539
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,640
Yeah, I did.

540
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:28,580
So, what else is on your mind?

541
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,980
I know Easy Company's gonna need a Commanding Officer post-war.

542
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:37,290
Somebody to hold their hand keep them from killing each other.

543
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:40,290
It better be somebody who knows what they're doing.

544
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:41,790
Yep, I couldn't agree more.

545
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:46,120
It's absolutely irresponsible to leave them in the hands of the wrong person.

546
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,330
They're too much of a valuable resource to the military.

547
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,010
So, you've decided to stay in the army?

548
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:58,530
Yes, I'm gonna stay with the men.

549
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:02,540
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

550
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,020
So, some of us would stay by choice...

551
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:12,550
...but others were stuck if we couldn't find excuses to send them away.

552
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,280
So, it's an airborne exhibition.

553
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:18,560
They have one of every Allied combat plane they've used in the war.

554
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:21,030
I mean, yes, sir.

555
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:25,090
You'll be like a technical adviser to make sure they get everything right.

556
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:26,290
I understand, sir.

557
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:29,130
I'm sorry it's not a more hospitable location.

558
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:31,900
No, sir. Paris is just fine.

559
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:34,010
You know, if you need me to go...

560
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,700
...someone must be there. Yeah, we do, we absolutely do.

561
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:39,880
And your driver will drop you off at a hotel of your choice.

562
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:43,540
And I don't think we'll see you back here any time soon.

563
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,450
I won't let you down, sir.

564
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,370
Carwood, yes.

565
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:06,000
I wanted to say...

566
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:08,200
...as you probably know...

567
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:12,140
...when they give a man a battlefield commission make him an officer...

568
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:14,770
...they usually don't let him stay with the same company.

569
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:17,210
Yes, sir, I figured this was coming.

570
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:23,450
Yeah, they're afraid the men won't show him the proper degree of respect as they would another officer.

571
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,950
It's a good theory, sir.

572
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,920
It's an idiotic theory especially in your case.

573
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:31,990
Nevertheless, they've given me the choice as to where to re-assign you...

574
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:36,030
...and I thought battalion headquarters might be a good place.

575
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:38,360
I can think of few better, sir.

576
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:39,830
Good.

577
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:41,240
Good.

578
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:47,870
Right now, down at the airfield there is a German general who is a little POed...

579
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:51,270
...about having to surrender to a private from South Philly.

580
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:54,550
Thinks it's beneath his stature. Understandable, sir.

581
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:59,120
Yeah. I thought 2nd Lieutenant Carwood Lipton from West Virginia...

582
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:01,380
...could soothe his ruffled feathers.

583
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,920
No problem, sir.

584
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,730
Major, is this the type of job I can expect from now on?

585
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:11,760
Yeah. Yeah.

586
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:14,390
When we're not sunning ourselves by the lake.

587
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,710
Lieutenant.

588
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:38,390
With your permission, I would like to address my men briefly.

589
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:40,220
That'll be fine, General.

590
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,170
Captain Sobel.

591
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,470
Major Winters. Captain Sobel.

592
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,670
We salute the rank, not the man.

593
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:18,150
Manner...

594
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:20,690
...es war ein langer Krieg.

595
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:23,760
Es war ein harter Krieg.

596
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:25,060
Liebgott?

597
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:29,670
Men, it's been a long war, it's been a tough war.

598
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:33,730
lhr habt tapfer und stolz fur euer Vaterland gekampft.

599
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,670
You have fought bravely, proudly for your country.

600
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:41,710
lhr seid eine besondere Gruppe...

601
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,910
You are a special group...

602
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:47,480
...die ineinander einen Zusammenhalt gefunden habt...

603
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:50,580
...who have found in one another a bond...

604
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:55,130
...wie er sich nur im Kampf entwickeln kann.

605
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,160
...that exists only in combat.

606
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,020
Unter Kameraden...

607
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,360
Among brothers...

608
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:03,560
...die Fuchshohlen geteilt haben.

609
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,500
...of shared foxholes.

610
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,100
Die sich in schrecklichen Momenten...

611
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:10,140
...gegenseitig geschtutzt haben.

612
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,610
Held each other in dire moments.

613
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:16,770
Die den Tod zusammen gesehen haben.

614
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:21,020
Und gemeinsam gelitten haben.

615
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:23,550
Who've seen death and suffered together.

616
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:26,360
Ich bin stolz...

617
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:30,890
...mit euch gedient zu haben.

618
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:34,990
I am proud to have served with each and every one of you.

619
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:39,630
Sie alle verdienen ein langes und gluckliches...

620
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,690
...Leben in Frieden.

621
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:44,640
You deserve long and happy lives of peace.

622
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,150
Towel, towel, towel, towel, towel.

623
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:05,180
Thanks.

624
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:07,530
Take a look at these two kids.

625
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,790
What the hell happened to them?

626
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:14,090
New Jersey, huh?

627
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,230
Yeah.

628
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,530
Think about it.

629
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:21,470
Yeah, I am.

630
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:25,530
You awake yet?

631
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,270
Awake?

632
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:31,680
Time to go to bed.

633
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:47,900
Bad luck, Jimmy.

634
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,430
Nice play.

635
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:52,930
Come on, we got one down.

636
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,200
Come on, Pee Wee, let's get Webster.

637
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:02,980
Buck Compton came back to see the Company. To let us know that he was all right.

638
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:05,410
He became a prosecutor in Los Angeles.

00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:24,560
In 1961, he went out on the ocean alone...

644
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,130
...and was never seen again.

645
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:32,430
Go, go, go!

646
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:36,170
Johnny Martin would return to his job at the railroad...

647
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,300
...and then start his own construction company.

648
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:42,580
He splits his time between Arizona and a place in Montana.

649
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:50,050
George Luz became a handyman in Providence, Rhode Island...

650
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:52,780
...and as a testament to his character...

00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:57,190
...1600 people attended his funeral 1998.

652
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:04,090
Doc Roe died in Louisiana in 1998.

653
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,170

He went into the earth-moving business in Arkansas.

659
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:36,800
He's still there.

00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,310

He was killed in a car accident in 1958.

663

Floyd Talbert, we all lost touch with in civilian life...

664
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:04,950
...until he showed up at a reunion just before his death in 1981.

665
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,930
How we lived our lives after the war was as varied as each man.

666
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,490
Carwood Lipton became a glass-making executive...

667

673
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,950
He retired a Lieutenant Colonel.

674
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,160
Get them round.

675
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:53,230
Easy Company, school circle!

676
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:03,610
For Easy Company, it was D-day plus 434.

677
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:06,080
A fast man would've had it, Perco.

678
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:09,480
Listen up, got some news.

679
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:16,580
This morning President Truman received the unconditional surrender from the Japanese.

680
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:18,710
War's over.

681
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:23,420
Regardless of points, medals, or wounds...

682
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,830
...each man in the 101st Airborne would be going home.

683
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,930
Each of us would be forever connected by our shared experience.

684
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:36,960
And each would have to rejoin the world as best he could.

685
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,690
Lewis Nixon had some tough times after the war.

686
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:58,090
He was divorced a couple of times.

687
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:03,190
Then in 1956, he married a woman named Grace and everything came together for him.

688
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:06,330
He spent the rest of his life with her, traveling the world.

689
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,430
My friend, Lew, died in 1995.

690
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:17,210
I took up his job offer and was a personnel manager at the Nixon nitration works until I was called back...

691
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,270
...into service in 1950 to train officers and rangers...

692
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:24,740
...but I chose not to go to Korea. I'd had enough of war.

693
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:29,050
I stayed around Hershey, Pennsylvania finally finding a little farm.

694
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,520
A little peaceful corner of the world...

695
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:33,420
...where I still live today.

696
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:39,620
And there is not a day that goes by that I do not think of the men I served with...

697
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:42,960
...who never got to enjoy the world without war.

698
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,630
It's a very unusual feeling.

699
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:53,170
It's a very unusual happening and it's a very unusual bonding.

700
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:55,910
We knew that we could depend on each other...

701
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,110
...and so, we were a close-knit group.

702
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,820
Just brave, so brave it was unbelievable.

703
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:09,420
And I don't know anybody that I admire more than Bill Guarnere and Joe Toye.

704
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:13,520
And they were very, very special.

705
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:16,490
I'm just one part of the big war, that's all.

706
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:17,900
One little part.

707
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:21,000
And I'm proud to be a part of it.

708
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,060
Sometimes it makes me cry.

709
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:27,270
The real men the real heroes are the fellows...

710
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:31,680
...that are still buried over there and those that came home to be buried.

711
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:34,540
It seemed like you thought that you could do...

712
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:39,150
...just about anything and after the war was over and you came back out.

713
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:41,190
Well, you lost a lot of that...

714
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,350
...or at least I did.

715
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,020
I lost all that confidence.

716
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:46,920
We was hoping to stay alive, that's all, you know.

717
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:53,030
Henry the Fifth was talking to his men.

718
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:58,540
He said, "From this day to the ending of the world...

719
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,600
"...we in it shall be remembered.

720
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:05,770
"We lucky few, we band of brothers.

721
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:13,050
"For he who today sheds his blood with me shall be my brother."

722
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:16,210
Do you remember...

723
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:21,390
...the letter that my granny wrote me?

724
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,960
You do? Do you remember how I ended it?

725
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:31,260
"I cherish the memories of a question...

726
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,300
"my grandson asked me the other day...

727
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:37,300
"...when he said:

728
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:41,270
"Grandpa, were you a hero in the war?"

729
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,580
Grandpa said, "No...

730
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:53,580
"...but I served in the company of heroes."

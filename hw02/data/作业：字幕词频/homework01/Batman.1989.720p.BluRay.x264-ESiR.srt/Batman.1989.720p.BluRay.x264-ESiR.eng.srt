1
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:01,629
Thank you. Hi. I'd like
to go to the Adelphi Hotel.

2
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,036
This is my cab.

3
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,474
I was here first!

4
00:03:06,711 --> 00:03:08,201
Oh, God.

5
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:18,712
Let's go across. Come on.

6
00:03:19,724 --> 00:03:22,056
We'll get one down the road.
Hurry.

7
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:30,161
For God's sake, Harold,
can we please get a taxi?

8
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:32,063
I'm trying to get a--. Taxi!

9
00:03:32,237 --> 00:03:34,398
We're going the wrong way!

10
00:03:36,074 --> 00:03:38,406
Put that away. We look like tourists.

11
00:03:39,411 --> 00:03:41,402
Let's cut over to Seventh.

12
00:03:41,646 --> 00:03:44,706
-Seventh is that way.
-I know where we are!

13
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,535
Hey, give me a dollar.

14
00:04:08,607 --> 00:04:10,598
How about it? One dollar.

15
00:04:11,276 --> 00:04:13,767
Are you deaf?
You don't speak English?

16
00:04:14,112 --> 00:04:15,943
Come on! Up here.

17
00:04:19,784 --> 00:04:21,115
Hey, lady...

18
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:23,720
...do the kid a favor. Don't scream.

19
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:45,639
Hey, all right!

20
00:04:45,977 --> 00:04:47,968
American Express card.

21
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,244
"Don't leave home without it."

22
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,913
Get out of here.

23
00:04:56,154 --> 00:04:58,145
I don' t like it up here.

24
00:04:58,323 --> 00:05:00,154
Are you scared of heights?

25
00:05:00,992 --> 00:05:03,984
I don't know. After what
happened to Johnny Gobs--

26
00:05:04,162 --> 00:05:08,496
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and
took a walk off a roof. No big loss.

27
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:11,499
That ain't what I heard at all.

28
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:15,268
I heard that The Bat got him.

29
00:05:15,507 --> 00:05:18,499
The Bat?! Give me a break, will you?

30
00:05:18,843 --> 00:05:22,506
Five stories. Straight down.
There wasn't no blood in the body.

31
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:26,180
No shit. It was all over the pavement.

32
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,784
-I'm getting out of here.
-Shut up. Listen to me.

33
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:35,356
There ain't no Bat.

34
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,961
You shouldn't have turned
the gun on that kid.

35
00:05:40,198 --> 00:05:45,033
You want your cut of this money
or not? Now shut up! Shut up!

36
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,507
Don't kill me!

37
00:06:30,749 --> 00:06:31,909
Don't kill me!

38
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,508
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

39
00:06:34,753 --> 00:06:37,586
I won't kill you.
I want you to do me a favor.

40
00:06:37,756 --> 00:06:39,417
Tell all your friends about me.

41
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:40,523
What are you?

42
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,524
I'm Batman.

43
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:06,106
Across this nation...

44
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:10,377
...the words "Gotham City"
are synonymous with crime.

45
00:07:10,955 --> 00:07:14,721
Our streets are overrun, our
public officials are helpless.

46
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,894
As mayor, I promise to root out
the source of this corruption...

47
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,121
...Boss Carl Grissom.

48
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:24,799
Now, our new District
Attorney, Harvey Dent...

49
00:07:25,136 --> 00:07:27,798
...will carry out that promise.

50
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,412
Thank you, Mayor Borg.
Thank you.

51
00:07:38,983 --> 00:07:40,644
People of Gotham City...

52
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:43,644
...l'm a man of few words.

53
00:07:44,656 --> 00:07:48,319
But those words will count,
and so will my actions.

54
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,097
Commissioner Gordon informs me that
he has targeted those businesses...

55
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:56,664
...suspected of fronting for
the syndicate in this city.

56
00:07:58,336 --> 00:07:59,997
Before this week is out...

57
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:03,497
...we are going to knock
down their doors...

58
00:08:03,842 --> 00:08:08,176
...and shed the light of the
law on that nest of vipers.

59
00:08:10,682 --> 00:08:15,619
Together we can make this
city safe for decent people.

60
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,780
Decent people shouldn't live here.

61
00:08:21,192 --> 00:08:23,683
They'd be happier someplace else.

62
00:08:24,195 --> 00:08:26,527
Pretty tough talk about Carl.

63
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:28,862
Forget about it.

64
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,137
If this clown could touch Grissom,
I'd have handed him his lungs by now.

65
00:08:35,206 --> 00:08:37,538
If Grissom knew about us...

66
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:40,374
...he might hand you something.

67
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,811
Don't flatter yourself, angel.

68
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:48,813
He's a tired old man.
He can't run this city without me.

69
00:08:50,722 --> 00:08:52,383
And besides...

70
00:08:54,726 --> 00:08:56,387
...he doesn't know.

71
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,497
You don't worry about
anything, do you, Jack?

72
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,502
You look fine.

73
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,411
I didn't ask.

74
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:29,416
Yeah. Hanging on.

75
00:09:38,837 --> 00:09:40,429
Let me guess.

76
00:09:40,672 --> 00:09:45,166
Giant, menacing, supernatural form.
Kind of like a bat.

77
00:09:45,443 --> 00:09:48,173
That's it. What are
they seeing up there?

78
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,441
They're drinking Drano.

79
00:09:50,682 --> 00:09:51,842
It's weird.

80
00:09:52,116 --> 00:09:53,606
Thanks for the tip.

81
00:09:55,453 --> 00:09:56,943
Christ. Knox.

82
00:09:57,522 --> 00:10:00,286
Lieutenant, I hear we
had another Bat attack.

83
00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:05,360
That's 8 sightings in a month. I hear
the Commissioner's opened a file.

84
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,293
Sorry, Knox. These two
slipped on a banana peel.

85
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:13,297
I'm telling you, a giant bat!

86
00:10:16,474 --> 00:10:21,309
Don't write about this. It will ruin
your already useless reputation.

87
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,872
Lieutenant, every punk
in this town is scared.

88
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:27,879
They say he can't be killed.

89
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:30,143
They say he drinks blood.

90
00:10:30,388 --> 00:10:33,551
I say you're full of shit, Knox.

91
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:38,826
You can quote me on that.

92
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:42,732
Is there a 6-foot bat in Gotham City?

93
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:45,162
Is he on the police payroll?

94
00:10:45,403 --> 00:10:48,167
What's he pulling down, after taxes?

95
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:19,692
Brought you a little snack, Eckhardt.

96
00:11:20,605 --> 00:11:24,598
-Why don't you broadcast it?
-Shut up and listen.

97
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,773
Harvey Dent has been sniffing
around one of our front companies.

98
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:34,382
That's my territory.
If there's a problem, I deal with it.

99
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:37,044
Your problems are our problems.

100
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,953
I answer to Grissom, not to psychos.

101
00:11:42,627 --> 00:11:45,460
You ought to think about the future.

102
00:11:46,064 --> 00:11:49,295
You mean when you run the show?
You got no future.

103
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:54,060
You're an A-1 nut-boy,
and Grissom knows it.

104
00:12:00,244 --> 00:12:01,472
Better be sure.

105
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:08,307
See?

106
00:12:08,987 --> 00:12:12,081
You can make a good
decision when you try.

107
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:22,661
Where you been spending your nights?

108
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:31,664
I don't care if this festival
is in debt, I want a parade.

109
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:34,175
I want hot dogs, balloons, everything.

110
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:38,108
We'll celebrate this 200th
anniversary proudly and publicly.

111
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:40,180
We may celebrate
in bankruptcy court.

112
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:43,784
It's $250,000 in debt and we
haven't seen one balloon.

113
00:12:44,022 --> 00:12:47,458
You fill the square with people,
and businesses will come back.

114
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:50,525
A lot of people may stay away.
They're scared.

115
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:53,696
They won't be scared when you
get Grissom in the courthouse.

116
00:12:53,965 --> 00:12:56,365
I promised that, remember?

117
00:12:59,303 --> 00:13:01,635
Welcome, Count Dracula.

118
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,131
Had any sightings of Big Foot lately?

119
00:13:04,642 --> 00:13:07,805
-They buried your story on Batman.
-They bury garbage.

120
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:10,808
This is Pulitzer Prize stuff.

121
00:13:11,315 --> 00:13:13,146
I got something for you.

122
00:13:15,987 --> 00:13:19,787
Very funny. You should have
put more gore under the fangs.

123
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:22,152
What a dick.

124
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:26,490
Hello, legs.

125
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,731
I'm reading your stuff.

126
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:32,663
Well, I'm reading yours.

127
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:35,004
Hi, I'm Vicki Vale.

128
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:38,231
Yeah, photographer.
Vogue, Cosmo. Yeah.

129
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:41,672
If you want me to pose nude,
you'll need a long lens.

130
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:44,510
Actually, I was in the Corto Maltese.

131
00:13:46,184 --> 00:13:48,175
You could get hurt doing this stuff.

132
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,013
What brings you here?

133
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:54,188
I'm here to see the
wildlife in Gotham City.

134
00:13:54,425 --> 00:13:56,916
Wildlife? Like what?

135
00:13:58,596 --> 00:14:00,257
Like...bats.

136
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:04,765
-Who sent you?
-Nobody, really.

137
00:14:05,036 --> 00:14:07,197
I just loved your story, and...

138
00:14:08,106 --> 00:14:10,097
...l like bats.

139
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,205
My pictures, your words.
Pulitzer Prize material. Just think.

140
00:14:16,547 --> 00:14:20,039
Okay, you're a visionary, and also
the only one who believes me.

141
00:14:20,284 --> 00:14:21,546
I need something tangible.

142
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,212
Gordon's got a file. I can't
even get him on the phone.

143
00:14:26,057 --> 00:14:28,048
He'll be at Bruce
Wayne's benefit, right?

144
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:31,625
Yeah. I don't seem to be
on the guest list. No.

145
00:14:34,465 --> 00:14:37,298
Yes, yes. Vale, will you marry me?

146
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:39,626
-No.
-Buy me lunch?

147
00:14:39,904 --> 00:14:42,395
-Maybe.
-I eat light.

148
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,741
Say this...

149
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:52,978
...son-of-a-bitch...

150
00:14:53,317 --> 00:14:56,650
...makes a connection with
us and with Axis Chemical.

151
00:14:56,921 --> 00:14:59,253
What kind of damage
are we looking at?

152
00:14:59,423 --> 00:15:02,756
If he ties us with Axis Chemical,
we're dead and buried.

153
00:15:02,994 --> 00:15:05,326
We should move immediately.

154
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,421
I say we break into the place...

155
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:10,427
...trash the office...

156
00:15:11,002 --> 00:15:15,166
...and make off with the records
and say it was industrial espionage.

157
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:20,944
Smart thinking. That's
the way to go. In fact...

158
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:24,512
...l'd like you to handle
this operation personally.

159
00:15:26,517 --> 00:15:27,609
Me?

160
00:15:35,626 --> 00:15:38,459
Would you mind waiting
in the next room?

161
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:54,308
That's all, gentlemen. Thank you.
That's all.

162
00:16:08,726 --> 00:16:10,489
Can somebody else do this?

163
00:16:11,662 --> 00:16:14,062
The fumes in that place....

164
00:16:18,002 --> 00:16:20,664
It's an important job. I need...

165
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:22,996
...someone I can trust.

166
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:26,837
You...are my number one guy.

167
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:30,678
Now...

168
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:33,677
...don't forget...

169
00:16:36,187 --> 00:16:37,848
...your lucky deck.

170
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,861
My friend...

171
00:16:51,602 --> 00:16:54,366
...your luck is about to change.

172
00:16:58,276 --> 00:16:59,766
Police Department.

173
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:02,443
Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.

174
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:46,379
Can I help you, sir?

175
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,072
-Good evening.
-A little crowded.

176
00:18:16,087 --> 00:18:18,248
Could you tell me
which is Bruce Wayne?

177
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:20,746
I'm not sure.

178
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:23,123
Thanks anyway.

179
00:18:57,528 --> 00:19:00,019
Eight. I can make that eight.

180
00:19:00,531 --> 00:19:02,362
I can make that eight.

181
00:19:03,034 --> 00:19:05,366
Commissioner!
Mrs. Gordon, you look lovely.

182
00:19:05,636 --> 00:19:09,037
Is it true the Commissioner
has a file on the Batman?

183
00:19:09,306 --> 00:19:13,299
There is no Bat. If there were,
we would find and arrest him.

184
00:19:13,544 --> 00:19:15,876
Be straight with me, Commissioner.

185
00:19:16,147 --> 00:19:17,705
How you making out?

186
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:20,041
Mr. Dent, I love that tie.

187
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:23,809
We were discussing winged vigilantes.
What's your stand?

188
00:19:24,055 --> 00:19:26,546
We have enough problems
in this city...

189
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:29,315
...without worrying about ghosts.

190
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,051
Pardon me, but that's not a denial.

191
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:35,994
Excuse me, I'll be back.

192
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:37,825
Won't anybody go on record?

193
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:41,161
-Your Honor, great suit.
-No comment.

194
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,071
What's up?

195
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:47,335
Anonymous tip. Napier's
cleaning out Axis Chemicals.

196
00:19:55,086 --> 00:19:57,418
Why wasn't I told? Who's in charge?

197
00:19:57,588 --> 00:20:00,022
-Echkhardt.
-Oh, my God!

198
00:20:00,257 --> 00:20:01,690
Come on, let's go.

199
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,020
Mr. Gordon?

200
00:20:13,604 --> 00:20:15,265
Mr. Gordon?

201
00:20:24,381 --> 00:20:27,714
Wait, wait. Living room,
dining room, arsenal.

202
00:20:28,285 --> 00:20:30,116
Look at this stuff.

203
00:20:30,454 --> 00:20:32,445
Who is this guy?

204
00:20:32,957 --> 00:20:37,451
He gives to humanitarian causes,
and then collects all this stuff.

205
00:20:37,728 --> 00:20:41,391
He probably does it to get chicks.
They like his charity balls.

206
00:20:41,632 --> 00:20:44,465
Don't leave out
his very large bankroll.

207
00:20:44,735 --> 00:20:47,636
The more they've got,
the less they're worth.

208
00:20:47,972 --> 00:20:51,305
This guy must be the most
worthless guy in America.

209
00:20:51,575 --> 00:20:56,239
Check this out. He must have been
the king of the Wicker People.

210
00:20:57,815 --> 00:20:59,578
Where'd this come from?

211
00:20:59,817 --> 00:21:01,614
I have no idea.

212
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:04,577
It's Japanese.

213
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:06,320
How do you know?

214
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:08,985
I bought it in Japan.

215
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:12,654
-Who are you?
-Sorry. Bruce Wayne.

216
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:15,489
Alexander Knox.

217
00:21:17,168 --> 00:21:19,500
I read your work. I like it a lot.

218
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,499
Thanks. Can I have a grant?

219
00:21:22,673 --> 00:21:24,004
Vicki Vale.

220
00:21:26,343 --> 00:21:28,004
Are you sure?

221
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:32,181
Yeah. I've seen your pictures
from Corto Maltese, haven't l?

222
00:21:34,185 --> 00:21:35,948
You've got a wonderful eye.

223
00:21:36,187 --> 00:21:37,848
Some people think she has two.

224
00:21:38,956 --> 00:21:42,289
This is a wonderful house.
I'd like to shoot it sometime.

225
00:21:43,294 --> 00:21:46,195
We need more champagne.
Is that all right?

226
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,191
Sure. Go ahead.

227
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,962
How many cases? Six? Six?

228
00:21:52,203 --> 00:21:53,636
Six is good.

229
00:21:57,474 --> 00:21:59,305
Will you be in Gotham for a while?

230
00:21:59,543 --> 00:22:04,480
I plan to be. I'm intrigued
by Alex's giant bat stories.

231
00:22:04,715 --> 00:22:06,979
Oh, right. The bat--. Batman.

232
00:22:09,486 --> 00:22:11,977
A bit light after the
war in Corto Maltese, no?

233
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,221
What do you do for a living?

234
00:22:15,993 --> 00:22:18,723
Commissioner Gordon
was compelled to leave.

235
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:22,496
Very unexpectedly, sir.

236
00:22:24,068 --> 00:22:25,558
Will you two excuse me?

237
00:22:26,003 --> 00:22:28,665
I think perhaps this way, sir.

238
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,075
They need wine in the front room, and
a Mrs. Daley needs a copy of the menu.

239
00:22:36,513 --> 00:22:38,174
And give Knox a grant.

240
00:22:42,853 --> 00:22:44,514
Nice talking with you, Wayne.

241
00:22:45,089 --> 00:22:46,420
The rich....

242
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,921
Know why they're so odd?
They can afford to be.

243
00:22:50,361 --> 00:22:51,692
Look at this mirror.

244
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:53,920
Maybe it should be Bruce Vain.

245
00:23:32,736 --> 00:23:35,466
-What's up?
-Anonymous tip.

246
00:23:35,739 --> 00:23:37,969
Napier's cleaning out Axis Chemicals.

247
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:41,405
If we could get him,
we'd have Grissom.

248
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:44,811
Why wasn't I told? Who's in charge?

249
00:23:45,082 --> 00:23:47,642
-Eckhardt.
-Oh, my God!

250
00:23:47,918 --> 00:23:49,476
Come on, let's go.

251
00:24:05,035 --> 00:24:06,593
Get a good look.

252
00:24:07,604 --> 00:24:10,266
Shoot to kill.
You know what I mean?

253
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:13,538
Let's move out.

254
00:24:46,744 --> 00:24:49,076
We've been ratted out, boys.

255
00:24:49,313 --> 00:24:50,405
Watch it.

256
00:24:56,754 --> 00:24:57,914
Freeze!

257
00:25:15,939 --> 00:25:18,271
You take the right. Move it.

258
00:25:19,276 --> 00:25:20,937
What the hell's going on?!

259
00:25:21,178 --> 00:25:25,512
-What are you trying to do?
-I'm in charge, not Carl Grissom.

260
00:25:27,017 --> 00:25:31,010
This is Commissioner Gordon.
I want him taken alive.

261
00:25:31,288 --> 00:25:36,021
I repeat. Any man who opens fire
on Jack Napier will answer to me.

262
00:26:23,907 --> 00:26:25,340
Let me down!

263
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,837
Let me down!

264
00:26:30,247 --> 00:26:31,339
Let me down!

265
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:34,406
Oh, my God!

266
00:27:43,587 --> 00:27:45,919
Get up on the catwalk on that side.

267
00:27:46,156 --> 00:27:48,647
You take that side. Be very careful.

268
00:28:03,907 --> 00:28:04,805
Jesus!

269
00:28:07,177 --> 00:28:10,112
Let him go...or I'll do Gordon.

270
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,451
Nice outfit.

271
00:28:36,373 --> 00:28:38,466
Come on, Jack, let's go!

272
00:28:45,315 --> 00:28:46,646
Come on!

273
00:28:48,385 --> 00:28:49,374
Eckhardt!

274
00:28:51,989 --> 00:28:53,388
Think about the future.

275
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,432
Goddamn it, we had him!

276
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,261
Hold it right there!

277
00:29:56,219 --> 00:29:58,881
-Who is this guy?
-I don't know.

278
00:30:00,891 --> 00:30:03,553
Until we find him, keep a lid on it.

279
00:30:26,416 --> 00:30:30,750
If there's no Bat, then who
dropped Napier into the acid?

280
00:30:31,088 --> 00:30:34,251
Suicide?! I want to get this on tape.

281
00:30:36,093 --> 00:30:38,994
He hung up. What have you got?

282
00:30:39,262 --> 00:30:40,923
Here's the inner city.

283
00:30:41,098 --> 00:30:42,827
Here's the sightings so far.

284
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:46,928
Maybe Batman has some
sort of flight pattern.

285
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:51,436
This is very good. Tonight we'll go
to dinner, then we'll walk the trail.

286
00:30:51,675 --> 00:30:54,269
No can do. I got a date.
Bruce Wayne.

287
00:30:54,845 --> 00:30:56,608
Wayne! Wayne! Oh, no!

288
00:30:56,947 --> 00:30:59,609
The guy's a stiff.
You could do much better.

289
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,111
Thanks for being so concerned.

290
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:18,197
How's the soup?

291
00:31:20,203 --> 00:31:21,636
Excuse me?

292
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,371
The soup. How is it?

293
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:28,140
It's great.

294
00:31:33,383 --> 00:31:34,714
Could you pass the salt?

295
00:31:55,238 --> 00:31:57,399
Did you have trouble
finding the house?

296
00:31:59,576 --> 00:32:01,407
-It was no problem.
-Good.

297
00:32:06,349 --> 00:32:07,748
Do you like eating here?

298
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:19,092
I don't think I've been
in this room before.

299
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:23,531
You want to leave?

300
00:32:23,867 --> 00:32:25,027
Yes.

301
00:32:33,043 --> 00:32:35,375
There was young Master Bruce...

302
00:32:35,712 --> 00:32:38,613
...leading his grey pony
with me on its back...

303
00:32:38,882 --> 00:32:43,444
...like a sack of old potatoes, covered
in mud and nursing a sprained ankle.

304
00:32:44,554 --> 00:32:48,547
That was the first and last time
I gave him a riding lesson.

305
00:32:49,793 --> 00:32:52,728
I think I've embarrassed
him for long enough.

306
00:32:53,563 --> 00:32:55,224
I'm off to bed.

307
00:32:55,899 --> 00:32:59,130
Please, leave everything.
I'll tidy up in the morning.

308
00:33:09,246 --> 00:33:12,477
He's really wonderful.
He loves you a lot.

309
00:33:12,749 --> 00:33:16,583
Alfred's great. I couldn't
find my socks without him.

310
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:20,153
He reminds me of my grandfather.

311
00:33:21,424 --> 00:33:22,823
Were you close to him?

312
00:33:23,326 --> 00:33:26,090
I used to spend summers with
him and my grandmother.

313
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:30,993
They had a house on the lake.
Nothing like this, but...

314
00:33:31,768 --> 00:33:33,167
...it was fun.

315
00:33:33,937 --> 00:33:35,495
That sounds nice.

316
00:33:38,275 --> 00:33:39,936
What about your family?

317
00:33:42,178 --> 00:33:44,612
Actually, Alfred is my family.

318
00:33:48,518 --> 00:33:52,614
This house and all this stuff
doesn't seem like you at all.

319
00:33:55,692 --> 00:33:57,853
Some of it is very much me.

320
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:00,860
Some isn't.

321
00:34:02,465 --> 00:34:05,298
That dining room
is definitely not you.

322
00:34:05,635 --> 00:34:06,966
The dining room isn't.

323
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,358
Let's see how we did.

324
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:54,610
Oh, my God!

325
00:34:55,118 --> 00:34:56,107
Mirror.

326
00:34:58,388 --> 00:34:59,446
Mirror!

327
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:13,062
You understand that the nerves
were completely severed.

328
00:35:18,308 --> 00:35:21,243
You see what I have
to work with here.

329
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,099
There's an awful lot of
stairs in this place.

330
00:35:46,336 --> 00:35:48,167
My feet are killing me.

331
00:35:56,846 --> 00:35:59,838
I feel a little drunk.
And you're not anything.

332
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,777
One drink and I'm flying.

333
00:36:02,852 --> 00:36:05,013
Why are you afraid of flying?

334
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,483
That you, sugar bumps?

335
00:36:39,055 --> 00:36:40,716
Who are you?

336
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,148
It's me.

337
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,321
"Sugar bumps."

338
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:53,067
You're alive! I heard you'd been--

339
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,394
Fried?

340
00:36:55,071 --> 00:36:56,732
Is that what you heard?

341
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,334
You set me up over a woman.

342
00:37:00,577 --> 00:37:02,067
A woman!

343
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,837
You must be insane.

344
00:37:19,429 --> 00:37:20,361
Don't bother.

345
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:24,425
Your life won't be worth spit!

346
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,201
I've been dead once already.

347
00:37:28,605 --> 00:37:30,436
It's very liberating...

348
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,866
...if you think of it as...therapy.

349
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,710
Jack, listen.

350
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,374
Maybe we can cut a deal.

351
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,780
Jack?

352
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:48,054
Jack is dead, my friend.

353
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,553
You can call me...

354
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:51,883
...Joker.

355
00:37:53,296 --> 00:37:54,957
As you can see...

356
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,892
...l'm a lot happier.

357
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,749
Oh, what a day.

358
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,809
Gotham City.

359
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:27,054
It always brings a smile to my face.

360
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,985
"Winged Freak...

361
00:39:36,065 --> 00:39:37,726
...Terrorizes--"

362
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,669
Wait'll they get a load of me.

363
00:39:59,088 --> 00:40:03,525
I've got an idea. How about lunch at
my place? I'll show you some photos.

364
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,250
Sure. Okay.

365
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,861
Wait a minute. No, I can't.
I can't make it.

366
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:12,027
Okay, we'll do it later in the day.

367
00:40:12,268 --> 00:40:16,705
I can't make it then, either. I've
got a very important meeting today.

368
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,430
What's wrong?

369
00:40:20,443 --> 00:40:21,535
Nothing.

370
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:25,112
I have to leave town for a few days.

371
00:40:25,615 --> 00:40:27,708
Okay, we'll do it when you get back.

372
00:40:28,618 --> 00:40:30,711
I have to go. I'm late.

373
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:50,403
-Nice to see you again.
-Nice to see you, too.

374
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:54,475
I'll talk to you guys
when you get back.

375
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:57,645
Back, Miss Vale? We'll be
here for quite a while.

376
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,757
You'll never believe what
happened to me today.

377
00:41:28,811 --> 00:41:33,475
So, gentlemen, that's how it is.
Until Grissom...resurfaces...

378
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:35,577
...l'm the acting president.

379
00:41:35,818 --> 00:41:39,310
And I say, starting with
this anniversary festival...

380
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:41,648
...we run this city
into the ground.

381
00:41:41,924 --> 00:41:43,915
Why don't we hear this from Grissom?

382
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,320
Yeah.

383
00:41:46,095 --> 00:41:48,427
And what's with that stupid grin?

384
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:52,092
Life's been good to me.

385
00:41:56,105 --> 00:41:57,834
What if we say "no"?

386
00:42:03,012 --> 00:42:05,173
Nobody wants a war.

387
00:42:05,948 --> 00:42:10,351
If we can't do business, we'll just
shake hands and that'll be it.

388
00:42:10,853 --> 00:42:11,581
Yeah?

389
00:42:22,198 --> 00:42:24,029
I got a live one here.

390
00:42:31,207 --> 00:42:35,701
There'll be a hot time
in the old town tonight.

391
00:42:53,062 --> 00:42:56,156
Antoine got a little
hot under the collar.

392
00:42:57,667 --> 00:42:58,964
You're crazy.

393
00:43:01,571 --> 00:43:05,063
Haven't you ever heard of the
healing power of laughter?

394
00:43:12,515 --> 00:43:15,416
-Now get out of here!
-Let's go! Move it!

395
00:43:16,018 --> 00:43:17,679
You think it over.

396
00:43:36,372 --> 00:43:40,433
Go to the Globe, follow that
reporter Knox. Take your camera.

397
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:43,611
See what he knows
about this Batman.

398
00:43:44,881 --> 00:43:46,280
And, Bob...

399
00:43:49,952 --> 00:43:52,284
Remember...you...

400
00:43:54,624 --> 00:43:56,114
...are my number one...

401
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:58,049
...guy.

402
00:43:59,462 --> 00:44:00,952
Yes, sir.

403
00:44:15,912 --> 00:44:17,573
Your pals...

404
00:44:18,414 --> 00:44:20,075
...they're not bad people.

405
00:44:21,317 --> 00:44:22,978
Maybe we...

406
00:44:23,986 --> 00:44:27,149
...ought to give them a
few days to think it over.

407
00:44:27,924 --> 00:44:29,084
No?

408
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:36,491
Grease them now?

409
00:44:39,435 --> 00:44:40,766
Okay.

410
00:44:42,939 --> 00:44:45,772
You are a vicious bastard, Rotelli.

411
00:44:47,677 --> 00:44:49,508
I'm glad you're dead.

412
00:44:56,953 --> 00:44:58,784
I'm glad you're dead.

413
00:45:01,691 --> 00:45:04,455
I'm glad you're dead.

414
00:45:11,367 --> 00:45:12,959
I need that.

415
00:45:13,869 --> 00:45:15,530
I'm losing confidence in you.

416
00:45:15,705 --> 00:45:17,263
I thought we were a team.

417
00:45:17,707 --> 00:45:20,198
Is this a personal issue for you?

418
00:45:20,977 --> 00:45:22,376
I just want you to do your job.

419
00:45:22,712 --> 00:45:24,043
I am doing my job.

420
00:45:24,313 --> 00:45:25,871
And I'm protecting my partner.

421
00:45:26,148 --> 00:45:29,982
There's nothing in these files.
Who is this guy?

422
00:45:30,219 --> 00:45:31,811
Who cares?

423
00:45:33,889 --> 00:45:36,722
Forget Bruce Wayne.
I'm onto Batman.

424
00:47:28,437 --> 00:47:31,929
They'll be out any second.
I can't wait to hear the explanation.

425
00:47:40,516 --> 00:47:42,279
What is this affidavit you filed?

426
00:47:42,518 --> 00:47:44,349
Grissom gave you his business?

427
00:47:44,787 --> 00:47:47,688
Mr. Grissom asked me,
as a personal favor...

428
00:47:48,023 --> 00:47:51,186
...to take over all his
businesses until he returns.

429
00:47:51,861 --> 00:47:55,854
That's a big favor. You two
must have been very close.

430
00:47:56,132 --> 00:47:58,464
Did you do time together as children?

431
00:48:41,577 --> 00:48:44,341
Our accountants are looking into it.
The affidavit is legitimate.

432
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,911
I smell fresh ink. You can prove this?

433
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:55,851
Of course you can.

434
00:48:56,091 --> 00:48:59,083
We have witnesses. Grissom's
signature is legitimate.

435
00:48:59,361 --> 00:49:00,760
It is legitimate.

436
00:49:01,864 --> 00:49:04,025
I saw it. I was there.

437
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,192
I saw it all.

438
00:49:06,435 --> 00:49:09,029
He reached up with his dead hand...

439
00:49:09,371 --> 00:49:11,771
...and signed it in his own blood.

440
00:49:12,107 --> 00:49:15,099
And he did it...with this pen.

441
00:49:16,378 --> 00:49:19,040
Hello, Vinnie. It's your uncle Bingo.

442
00:49:20,516 --> 00:49:22,143
Time to pay the check.

443
00:49:28,457 --> 00:49:29,788
The pen...

444
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:32,556
...is truly mightier than the sword.

445
00:49:49,078 --> 00:49:50,067
Get down!

446
00:50:09,665 --> 00:50:13,829
Won't this gang war dampen
the city's 200th anniversary?

447
00:50:14,103 --> 00:50:17,937
The festival opens. The police
will stop these gangsters.

448
00:50:19,174 --> 00:50:23,167
What about the theory that
the Batman is a mob enforcer?

449
00:50:23,445 --> 00:50:25,106
I don't have any comment.

450
00:50:30,853 --> 00:50:32,184
Batman.

451
00:50:33,188 --> 00:50:34,678
Batman.

452
00:50:35,691 --> 00:50:39,627
Can somebody tell me what
kind of a world we live in...

453
00:50:39,862 --> 00:50:42,854
...when a man dressed as a bat...

454
00:50:43,132 --> 00:50:45,191
...gets all my press?

455
00:50:47,636 --> 00:50:49,627
This town needs an enema!

456
00:50:57,212 --> 00:50:59,203
May I have a glass of...water?

457
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:03,041
I'm relieved that you're home.

458
00:51:03,319 --> 00:51:07,312
Miss Vale telephoned.
She was rather concerned.

459
00:51:07,656 --> 00:51:11,148
I feel there's a certain weight
that lifts when she is here.

460
00:51:12,328 --> 00:51:13,386
Alfred...

461
00:51:14,163 --> 00:51:15,824
...why don't you marry her?

462
00:51:16,498 --> 00:51:19,661
That's not exactly what
I had in mind, sir.

463
00:51:26,075 --> 00:51:28,009
I can't go over that right now.

464
00:51:28,677 --> 00:51:30,338
If not now...

465
00:51:33,082 --> 00:51:34,071
...when?

466
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,080
I don't know.

467
00:51:43,425 --> 00:51:45,586
Jack Napier's still alive.

468
00:51:48,597 --> 00:51:52,693
He's running Grissom's men.
I need any information on him.

469
00:52:05,114 --> 00:52:06,775
She is great, isn't she?

470
00:52:07,549 --> 00:52:08,607
Yes.

471
00:52:20,229 --> 00:52:21,218
Knox.

472
00:52:22,231 --> 00:52:23,892
Check something out for me.

473
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,892
Find out what's special about
the alley at Pearl and Phillips.

474
00:52:28,137 --> 00:52:29,798
Pearl and Phillips?

475
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:31,297
You got it.

476
00:52:41,417 --> 00:52:42,748
Mister Wayne.

477
00:53:07,009 --> 00:53:09,273
So much to do and so little time.

478
00:53:09,511 --> 00:53:11,103
The photos.

479
00:53:13,449 --> 00:53:15,178
Who's that loss?

480
00:53:15,451 --> 00:53:16,440
Knox.

481
00:53:16,685 --> 00:53:19,017
Bad tie. No style.

482
00:53:22,124 --> 00:53:23,785
Stop the press!

483
00:53:24,026 --> 00:53:26,017
-Who is that?
-Vicki Vale.

484
00:53:26,295 --> 00:53:28,286
The photographer
working with Knox.

485
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:30,794
That girl has style.

486
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:32,794
Jesus marimba!

487
00:53:33,135 --> 00:53:35,797
A lovely beast like
that running around...

488
00:53:36,038 --> 00:53:38,529
...could put steam in a man's strides.

489
00:53:38,807 --> 00:53:41,037
She's dating some guy named Wayne.

490
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,141
She's about to trade up.

491
00:53:44,313 --> 00:53:46,873
It's hard to stay inside the lines.

492
00:53:51,153 --> 00:53:52,552
I'm about...

493
00:53:54,223 --> 00:53:56,214
...to get a new girl.

494
00:53:57,826 --> 00:54:00,488
I'm of a mind to make some mooky.

495
00:54:01,463 --> 00:54:02,361
Phone book.

496
00:54:07,002 --> 00:54:09,163
So much to do...

497
00:54:10,072 --> 00:54:11,835
...and so little time.

498
00:54:37,366 --> 00:54:39,425
Have you shipped a million of those?

499
00:54:40,769 --> 00:54:45,263
Ship them all! We're going to
take them out a whole new door!

500
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:50,337
Ten seconds to transmission.

501
00:54:52,948 --> 00:54:55,109
Five, four...

502
00:54:59,288 --> 00:55:00,880
Cue music.

503
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:05,049
Cue Becky.

504
00:55:08,297 --> 00:55:11,630
Good evening. The fashion
world was stunned today...

505
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:15,631
...by the sudden deaths of models
Candy Walker and Amanda Keeler.

506
00:55:16,071 --> 00:55:20,064
Cause of death has been attributed
to a violent allergic reaction...

507
00:55:20,309 --> 00:55:24,973
...although authorities have not
ruled out the possibility of drug use.

508
00:55:26,148 --> 00:55:28,981
Plans continue for the
city's 200th birthday...

509
00:55:29,251 --> 00:55:32,152
...as Mayor Borg announced
today at the unveiling--

510
00:55:32,754 --> 00:55:34,312
This just in.

511
00:55:35,324 --> 00:55:38,157
Three mysterious deaths
at a beauty parlor--

512
00:55:42,598 --> 00:55:44,793
--were discovered today.

513
00:55:47,102 --> 00:55:48,501
What's going on?

514
00:55:49,771 --> 00:55:51,432
This is hardly the--

515
00:55:55,277 --> 00:55:56,175
Kill the camera.

516
00:55:56,678 --> 00:56:00,944
This is Rene on the news floor.
I need paramedics up here now!

517
00:56:06,455 --> 00:56:09,288
New and improved Joker products!

518
00:56:09,524 --> 00:56:11,458
With a new secret ingredient.

519
00:56:12,194 --> 00:56:13,525
Smylex!

520
00:56:13,695 --> 00:56:15,026
What's that?

521
00:56:15,297 --> 00:56:17,629
Let's go over...

522
00:56:18,367 --> 00:56:20,699
...to our blind taste test.

523
00:56:20,869 --> 00:56:22,530
Love that Joker.

524
00:56:22,804 --> 00:56:25,136
-Where's it coming from?
-I don't know.

525
00:56:27,042 --> 00:56:31,536
He don't look happy.
He's been using brand X.

526
00:56:33,482 --> 00:56:36,042
But with new Joker Brand...

527
00:56:36,385 --> 00:56:38,478
...l get a grin again...

528
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:40,310
...and again.

529
00:56:41,823 --> 00:56:43,654
That luscious tan...

530
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:45,820
...those ruby lips...

531
00:56:46,061 --> 00:56:50,657
...and hair color so natural, only
your undertaker knows for sure.

532
00:56:52,234 --> 00:56:53,667
You're saying:

533
00:56:53,902 --> 00:56:57,167
"Where can I get these fine,
new items?"

534
00:56:57,406 --> 00:57:01,843
That's the gag. Chances are,
you bought them already!

535
00:57:02,844 --> 00:57:04,573
Love that Joker.

536
00:57:04,913 --> 00:57:06,244
Remember...

537
00:57:06,515 --> 00:57:09,507
...put on a happy face.

538
00:57:14,089 --> 00:57:16,080
The information you requested.

539
00:57:24,533 --> 00:57:27,696
"Jack Napier assault with
a deadly weapon, age 15.

540
00:57:27,936 --> 00:57:30,530
Results of psychological profile...

541
00:57:31,106 --> 00:57:34,872
...violent mood swings, highly
intelligent, emotionally unstable.

542
00:57:35,711 --> 00:57:38,942
Aptitudes include science,
chemistry, and art."

543
00:57:41,216 --> 00:57:42,547
Chemistry.

544
00:57:49,124 --> 00:57:50,455
Let's go shopping.

545
00:58:00,235 --> 00:58:05,070
...six new deaths, with no clues
as to the Joker's deadly weapon.

546
00:58:06,308 --> 00:58:08,299
And what is the pattern?

547
00:58:08,744 --> 00:58:12,646
Foods, alcohol, or beauty
and hygiene products?

548
00:58:12,981 --> 00:58:16,644
Cologne, mouthwash,
underarm deodorant?

549
00:58:16,985 --> 00:58:19,818
Or worse yet,
there may be no pattern.

550
00:58:20,489 --> 00:58:24,152
The search goes on through
Gotham's shopping nightmare.

551
00:58:24,826 --> 00:58:29,661
We are having a festival if I have to
use a gun to get people there myself.

552
00:58:29,931 --> 00:58:33,833
Do you hear the words coming from
my mouth? The festival is on!

553
00:58:34,102 --> 00:58:37,094
Find out what this madman
is poisoning us with.

554
00:58:37,339 --> 00:58:38,772
Do you read me?

555
00:58:40,342 --> 00:58:43,505
We're working on it.
I need all the help I can get.

556
00:58:47,682 --> 00:58:49,843
Hi, it's Vicki.

557
00:58:50,118 --> 00:58:52,678
I'll be ten minutes late to the museum.

558
00:58:52,954 --> 00:58:54,683
I'll see you when you get there.

559
00:59:01,196 --> 00:59:03,528
A message from Miss Vale.

560
00:59:03,865 --> 00:59:06,527
She'll be late meeting
you at the museum.

561
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:09,797
Okay, thank you.
Wait a minute, Alfred.

562
00:59:10,372 --> 00:59:12,033
I'm not meeting her today.

563
00:59:23,485 --> 00:59:25,885
Jack, where are you going?

564
00:59:28,323 --> 00:59:30,985
Daddy's going to make
some art, darling.

565
01:00:05,694 --> 01:00:07,685
Mr. Wayne's table?

566
01:00:08,029 --> 01:00:10,520
He hasn't arrived yet.

567
01:00:10,932 --> 01:00:12,593
We have a table waiting.

568
01:00:38,126 --> 01:00:40,617
Miss Vale, this just arrived for you.

569
01:01:43,792 --> 01:01:45,020
Gentlemen!

570
01:01:45,527 --> 01:01:48,360
Let's broaden our minds. Lawrence.

571
01:02:09,484 --> 01:02:11,145
Give him a shave.

572
01:02:12,821 --> 01:02:14,652
Terence, brush.

573
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:10,204
The one-dollar bill.

574
01:03:14,449 --> 01:03:15,438
Hold it!

575
01:03:16,217 --> 01:03:19,380
I kind of like this one. Leave it.

576
01:03:33,802 --> 01:03:35,736
You can take that off now.

577
01:03:38,807 --> 01:03:42,402
You're beautiful...
in an old-fashioned kind of way.

578
01:03:42,644 --> 01:03:46,239
But I'm sure we can make you more...
today.

579
01:03:49,818 --> 01:03:51,251
Your portfolio?

580
01:03:52,821 --> 01:03:55,756
I'm meeting someone who
wants to see my work.

581
01:03:58,426 --> 01:03:59,415
Crap.

582
01:03:59,828 --> 01:04:01,659
Crap. Crap.

583
01:04:02,831 --> 01:04:04,594
Crap. Crap.

584
01:04:08,103 --> 01:04:09,934
Now that's good work.

585
01:04:13,341 --> 01:04:15,002
The skulls, the bodies.

586
01:04:15,443 --> 01:04:19,846
You give it such a glow. I don't
know if it's art, but I like it.

587
01:04:22,016 --> 01:04:24,678
Let me tell you
what I'm thinking about.

588
01:04:24,953 --> 01:04:26,784
I was in the bath one day...

589
01:04:27,021 --> 01:04:30,787
...when I realized why I
was destined for greatness.

590
01:04:31,459 --> 01:04:34,519
You know how concerned people
are about appearances.

591
01:04:34,963 --> 01:04:37,454
This is attractive, that is not.

592
01:04:37,799 --> 01:04:42,031
That is all behind me. I now do
what other people only dream.

593
01:04:42,637 --> 01:04:45,299
I make art...until someone dies.

594
01:04:45,707 --> 01:04:46,799
See?

595
01:04:48,376 --> 01:04:52,642
I am the world's first
fully-functioning homicidal artist.

596
01:04:55,049 --> 01:04:56,209
What do you want?

597
01:04:58,153 --> 01:05:00,053
My face on the one-dollar bill.

598
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:03,889
You're joking.

599
01:05:05,059 --> 01:05:06,822
Do I look like I'm joking?

600
01:05:07,662 --> 01:05:08,651
No.

601
01:05:09,063 --> 01:05:10,223
Listen.

602
01:05:10,732 --> 01:05:15,226
We mustn't compare ourselves with
regular people. We're artists.

603
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:18,903
For instance, let me challenge
you with a piece I did.

604
01:05:19,174 --> 01:05:21,335
Bob. Alicia.

605
01:05:22,177 --> 01:05:24,668
You will photograph
and record my work.

606
01:05:24,913 --> 01:05:29,247
You will join me in the
avant-garde of the new aesthetic.

607
01:05:29,684 --> 01:05:34,018
Jack, you said I could watch
you improve the paintings.

608
01:05:34,522 --> 01:05:36,854
I'm in trouble now.

609
01:05:37,592 --> 01:05:39,583
Why is she wearing a mask?

610
01:05:40,528 --> 01:05:42,189
She's just a sketch, really.

611
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:46,093
Alicia, sit down. Show the
lady why you wear this mask.

612
01:05:46,367 --> 01:05:50,269
Alicia's been made over in
line with my new philosophy.

613
01:05:50,538 --> 01:05:52,096
So now, like me...

614
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,704
...she is a living work of art.

615
01:05:59,113 --> 01:06:01,604
I'm no Picasso, but...do you like it?

616
01:06:03,117 --> 01:06:04,379
It's great.

617
01:06:05,553 --> 01:06:08,215
So...what can I do for you?

618
01:06:08,556 --> 01:06:11,616
A little song, a little dance.

619
01:06:11,893 --> 01:06:13,952
Batman's head on a lance.

620
01:06:14,229 --> 01:06:16,288
What do you know about...?

621
01:06:17,065 --> 01:06:18,464
I don't know anything.

622
01:06:20,401 --> 01:06:21,732
Really?

623
01:06:22,303 --> 01:06:24,635
Well, how about
a little "you and me"?

624
01:06:27,308 --> 01:06:28,297
You're insane.

625
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:30,903
I thought I was a Pisces. Come on.

626
01:06:31,145 --> 01:06:33,807
Let's make up. Have a little...

627
01:06:34,082 --> 01:06:35,913
...whiff of my posy.

628
01:06:41,756 --> 01:06:43,155
Help me!

629
01:06:44,092 --> 01:06:45,491
I'm melting!

630
01:06:46,261 --> 01:06:48,991
I'm melting! Help me! I'm melting!

631
01:07:12,787 --> 01:07:14,118
Hold on.

632
01:07:23,298 --> 01:07:26,290
Where does he get
those wonderful toys?

633
01:07:29,203 --> 01:07:30,966
-Get in the car.
-Which one?

634
01:08:56,691 --> 01:08:57,680
Let's go.

635
01:09:12,874 --> 01:09:13,863
Shields.

636
01:09:39,233 --> 01:09:40,723
How much do you weigh?

637
01:09:41,069 --> 01:09:42,730
About 108, I think.

638
01:09:51,846 --> 01:09:53,074
Hold on.

639
01:10:03,758 --> 01:10:05,749
Grab that thing on my belt.

640
01:10:06,194 --> 01:10:07,183
Don't let go.

641
01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:23,199
No blood.

642
01:10:23,444 --> 01:10:24,934
Who is this guy?

643
01:10:25,113 --> 01:10:26,273
Check his wallet.

644
01:10:27,882 --> 01:10:30,442
-Wait.
-What is that?

645
01:10:30,718 --> 01:10:34,279
Some kind of body armor.
He's human after all.

646
01:10:34,622 --> 01:10:35,884
Take off the mask.

647
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:43,288
Shoot her!

648
01:11:46,294 --> 01:11:47,522
Shields open.

649
01:12:12,553 --> 01:12:14,316
You weigh more than 108.

650
01:12:14,555 --> 01:12:16,580
-Really?
-Let's go.

651
01:12:20,828 --> 01:12:22,159
Stop.

652
01:12:51,025 --> 01:12:52,583
Where are we going?

653
01:14:12,173 --> 01:14:13,606
Be careful.

654
01:14:22,516 --> 01:14:23,676
Bats.

655
01:14:25,286 --> 01:14:26,844
They're great survivors.

656
01:14:52,313 --> 01:14:55,214
-What is all this?
-The police have got it wrong.

657
01:14:55,883 --> 01:14:57,976
They're looking for one product.

658
01:14:58,219 --> 01:15:01,382
The Joker's tainted hundreds
of chemicals at the source.

659
01:15:03,557 --> 01:15:06,219
Then whole shipments
would be poisoned.

660
01:15:06,494 --> 01:15:08,155
And we'd all be dead.

661
01:15:09,163 --> 01:15:10,653
No.

662
01:15:10,898 --> 01:15:15,562
The poison works when components
are mixed. Hairspray won't do it alone.

663
01:15:15,836 --> 01:15:20,330
But hairspray mixed with lipstick and
perfume will be toxic, and traceable.

664
01:15:21,008 --> 01:15:23,169
How did you figure this out?

665
01:15:29,183 --> 01:15:30,673
Take that to the press.

666
01:15:31,919 --> 01:15:34,012
I might have trouble with that.

667
01:15:35,089 --> 01:15:38,252
A lot of people think you're
as dangerous as the Joker.

668
01:15:39,593 --> 01:15:41,254
He's psychotic.

669
01:15:42,363 --> 01:15:45,093
Some people say the
same thing about you.

670
01:15:46,267 --> 01:15:47,427
What people?

671
01:15:48,436 --> 01:15:50,597
Well, let's face it.

672
01:15:52,039 --> 01:15:55,202
You're not exactly normal...are you?

673
01:15:55,943 --> 01:15:57,934
It's not exactly a normal world.

674
01:15:58,279 --> 01:16:00,042
Why did you bring me here?

675
01:16:00,381 --> 01:16:03,714
You could have sent that
stuff to the press yourself.

676
01:16:04,385 --> 01:16:05,545
You're right.

677
01:16:07,054 --> 01:16:09,454
There is something
you have that I want.

678
01:16:09,957 --> 01:16:11,049
What?

679
01:16:33,247 --> 01:16:35,078
He took the film.

680
01:16:40,754 --> 01:16:44,087
Where have you been? Are
you okay? Should I come over?

681
01:16:44,325 --> 01:16:46,418
No, Allie.

682
01:16:47,094 --> 01:16:50,495
If I bring something to you,
can we make the evening edition?

683
01:16:52,166 --> 01:16:53,827
Just barely. Is it hot?

684
01:16:54,835 --> 01:16:57,167
Yeah, it's real hot.

685
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:00,329
Copy!

686
01:17:12,353 --> 01:17:14,685
Avoid the following combinations:

687
01:17:14,922 --> 01:17:18,414
Deodorants with baby powder,
hairspray, and lipstick.

688
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:23,257
Safe products are flying in as
Gotham City goes on a forced fast.

689
01:17:23,531 --> 01:17:26,694
And all of Gotham is wondering
what to make of Batman.

690
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:28,595
Friend or foe?

691
01:17:30,204 --> 01:17:32,536
I have given a name to my pain...

692
01:17:33,707 --> 01:17:35,698
...and it is Batman.

693
01:17:40,714 --> 01:17:44,047
You must possess strength
to inflict pain, Bob.

694
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:46,942
We've got a flying mouse to kill...

695
01:17:47,221 --> 01:17:49,883
...and I want to clean my claws.

696
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:57,457
Sir, Miss Vale called again.

697
01:17:57,898 --> 01:18:00,958
Dare I suggest that your
present course of action...

698
01:18:01,235 --> 01:18:03,294
...might simply
strengthen her resolve?

699
01:18:03,904 --> 01:18:06,065
She is quite tenacious.

700
01:18:06,907 --> 01:18:08,067
You're right.

701
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:12,803
And quite special. Perhaps you
could try telling her the truth.

702
01:18:23,424 --> 01:18:24,755
Coming.

703
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:39,669
May I come in?

704
01:18:50,017 --> 01:18:51,678
This is a nice apartment.

705
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:55,344
Lots of space.

706
01:19:00,794 --> 01:19:02,625
Listen, I came over to...

707
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:05,794
-...clear--
-I don't know who you think you are!

708
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:07,694
-You hurt me.
-I know.

709
01:19:07,968 --> 01:19:12,632
I called you and called you. And you
lied! You lied about leaving town.

710
01:19:12,806 --> 01:19:15,138
-Let me tell you why.
-Let me tell you!

711
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:18,868
I thought we felt something.
And I trusted you.

712
01:19:19,146 --> 01:19:20,807
I even slept with you.

713
01:19:20,981 --> 01:19:24,644
Then you wouldn't return my calls.
You must be some kind of jerk.

714
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:29,712
You're a real nice girl and I like
you a lot, but right now, shut up.

715
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:32,889
I have something to tell you.

716
01:19:41,168 --> 01:19:45,502
You know how people have...
different sides to their personality?

717
01:19:47,341 --> 01:19:48,831
Sometimes...

718
01:19:49,677 --> 01:19:53,670
...a person will have to actually
lead a different life.

719
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:55,909
Oh, my God, you're married.

720
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:58,414
No, I'm not married.

721
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:06,752
You see...

722
01:20:08,195 --> 01:20:10,425
...my life is really...

723
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:14,756
...complex.

724
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:22,769
All right, listen. You know how
a normal person gets up and...

725
01:20:24,211 --> 01:20:26,202
...goes downstairs...

726
01:20:26,447 --> 01:20:28,278
...and eats breakfast...

727
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:32,107
...and kisses somebody
good-bye, and goes to...

728
01:20:32,886 --> 01:20:35,116
...a job, and, you know.

729
01:20:41,228 --> 01:20:42,456
Look.

730
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:48,465
What I'm trying to tell you is...

731
01:20:50,237 --> 01:20:52,398
Hey, it's okay.

732
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,129
You can tell me.

733
01:20:59,413 --> 01:21:01,404
What I'm trying to tell you is...

734
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:06,146
I'll be right back.

735
01:21:17,097 --> 01:21:18,257
Miss me?

736
01:21:23,937 --> 01:21:27,270
Nice place you got here. Lots of space.

737
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:31,166
Vicki, we've really got to talk.

738
01:21:35,182 --> 01:21:37,013
We were having dinner.

739
01:21:37,951 --> 01:21:41,284
I was a man doing well
with a beautiful woman.

740
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:44,346
And without so much as an apology...

741
01:21:44,625 --> 01:21:48,857
...you ran off with that
sideshow phony.

742
01:21:53,634 --> 01:21:54,794
You know...

743
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:59,972
...l've recently had
a tragedy in my life.

744
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:01,640
Alicia...

745
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:04,869
...threw herself out a window.

746
01:22:05,145 --> 01:22:06,203
Oh, my God.

747
01:22:08,982 --> 01:22:10,313
But...

748
01:22:10,818 --> 01:22:13,981
...you can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs.

749
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:26,991
Well, Miss Vale...

750
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:30,396
...another rooster in the hen-house?

751
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,232
Take thy beak from out my heart.

752
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:45,677
Bruce...Wayne, n'est-ce pas?

753
01:22:48,088 --> 01:22:49,248
Most of the time.

754
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:57,252
I know you.

755
01:23:00,434 --> 01:23:03,028
Let me tell you
about this guy I know.

756
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:07,270
Mean kid. Bad seed. Hurt people.

757
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:09,605
I like him already.

758
01:23:12,946 --> 01:23:15,210
You know what the problem was?

759
01:23:15,549 --> 01:23:18,541
He got sloppy. You know, crazy.

760
01:23:18,886 --> 01:23:23,220
He started to lose it. He had a
head full of bad wiring, I guess.

761
01:23:23,457 --> 01:23:25,948
Couldn't keep it straight up here.

762
01:23:27,294 --> 01:23:29,558
He was the kind of guy who...

763
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:34,130
...couldn't hear the train
until it was two feet from him.

764
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:40,898
You know what happened
to this guy?

765
01:23:45,812 --> 01:23:47,746
He made mistakes.

766
01:23:49,249 --> 01:23:52,980
Then he ended up with his lights out!
Now you want to get nuts?

767
01:23:53,253 --> 01:23:54,914
Come on! Let's get nuts!

768
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:57,980
Tell me something.

769
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,251
You ever dance with the
devil in the pale moonlight?

770
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:04,262
What?

771
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:07,327
I always ask that of all my prey.

772
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:09,832
I just like the sound of it.

773
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:18,500
Never rub another man's rhubarb.

774
01:24:25,619 --> 01:24:29,453
Why is it every time I come for you...

775
01:24:30,457 --> 01:24:32,687
...somebody always gets in the way?

776
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:35,187
I'll need a moment alone.

777
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:40,693
I'm only laughing on the outside.

778
01:24:41,635 --> 01:24:44,695
My smile is just skin deep.

779
01:24:45,872 --> 01:24:47,533
If you could see inside...

780
01:24:47,874 --> 01:24:49,865
...l'm really crying.

781
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:53,038
You might join me for a weep.

782
01:25:37,858 --> 01:25:40,019
You really wouldn't believe it.

783
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:45,195
While you were entertaining, I've been
finding out about your street corner.

784
01:25:49,202 --> 01:25:51,693
I think your friend is screwed up.

785
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:54,198
More good news.

786
01:26:02,282 --> 01:26:03,943
Oh, my God!

787
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:06,783
His parents were murdered
in that alley.

788
01:26:07,721 --> 01:26:09,712
That's why he went there.

789
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:16,956
He watched it happen in front of him.

790
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:19,295
Look at the look on his face.

791
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:22,232
It was the same at City Hall.

792
01:26:23,804 --> 01:26:26,398
What do you suppose
this does to a kid?

793
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:34,136
Don't get personal!

794
01:26:48,061 --> 01:26:50,052
The file on my parents?

795
01:26:50,730 --> 01:26:52,391
It's on your table.

796
01:27:01,141 --> 01:27:02,802
What's on your mind?

797
01:27:04,911 --> 01:27:08,904
I have no wish to fill my
few remaining years...

798
01:27:09,316 --> 01:27:11,648
...grieving for old friends...

799
01:27:15,922 --> 01:27:17,753
...or their sons.

800
01:27:35,942 --> 01:27:40,606
The 200th anniversary birthday gala
has been indefinitely postponed.

801
01:27:41,114 --> 01:27:43,105
We cannot guarantee public safety.

802
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:45,011
Joker here.

803
01:27:45,318 --> 01:27:46,649
We got interference.

804
01:27:46,953 --> 01:27:50,445
Now you fellows have said
some pretty mean things.

805
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:54,126
Some of which were true
under that fiend...

806
01:27:54,361 --> 01:27:55,692
...Boss Grissom.

807
01:27:55,962 --> 01:27:58,795
He was a thief...and a terrorist.

808
01:27:59,032 --> 01:28:02,695
On the other hand, he had
a tremendous singing voice.

809
01:28:02,969 --> 01:28:06,803
He's dead now, and he's
left me in charge.

810
01:28:10,143 --> 01:28:12,475
I can be theatrical...

811
01:28:12,812 --> 01:28:15,303
...and maybe even a little rough.

812
01:28:15,815 --> 01:28:18,215
But one thing I am not...

813
01:28:18,552 --> 01:28:20,042
...is a killer!

814
01:28:24,724 --> 01:28:26,385
I love a good party.

815
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:28,218
So, truce.

816
01:28:28,828 --> 01:28:31,991
Commence au festival!

817
01:28:33,066 --> 01:28:36,058
And I've got a surprise
for Gotham City.

818
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:41,404
At midnight, I will dump
20 million in cash...

819
01:28:41,708 --> 01:28:43,039
...on the crowd.

820
01:28:46,179 --> 01:28:48,579
Don't worry about me.
I've got enough.

821
01:28:48,848 --> 01:28:51,908
We are not prepared
to discuss any deals.

822
01:28:54,354 --> 01:28:56,686
You heard it, folks, 20 million.

823
01:28:57,424 --> 01:28:59,415
And there will be entertainment.

824
01:28:59,993 --> 01:29:04,657
The big dukeroo. With me in one
corner, and in the other corner...

825
01:29:05,265 --> 01:29:09,531
...the man who has brought
real terror to Gotham City...

826
01:29:09,936 --> 01:29:11,426
...Batman.

827
01:29:11,938 --> 01:29:13,428
Can you hear me?

828
01:29:14,107 --> 01:29:15,597
Just the two of us.

829
01:29:15,875 --> 01:29:17,866
Mano y mano.

830
01:29:18,878 --> 01:29:21,278
I have taken off my make-up.

831
01:29:22,282 --> 01:29:23,874
Let's see...

832
01:29:24,117 --> 01:29:27,052
...if you can take off yours.

833
01:31:39,252 --> 01:31:41,243
Tell me, kid.

834
01:31:41,755 --> 01:31:46,249
Did you ever dance with the
devil by the pale moonlight?

835
01:31:54,033 --> 01:31:55,591
Let's go!

836
01:31:58,538 --> 01:32:00,199
Let's go, Jack!

837
01:32:03,877 --> 01:32:05,435
See you around.

838
01:32:35,241 --> 01:32:37,072
Am I crazy?

839
01:32:39,412 --> 01:32:42,643
That wasn't just another night
for either of us, was it?

840
01:32:46,152 --> 01:32:49,144
We both got to each other, didn't we?

841
01:32:52,091 --> 01:32:54,252
Why won't you let me in?

842
01:32:59,432 --> 01:33:00,922
You got in.

843
01:33:05,772 --> 01:33:07,831
I've loved you since I met you.

844
01:33:09,342 --> 01:33:12,675
But I don't know what
to think of all this.

845
01:33:12,946 --> 01:33:17,610
Sometimes I don't know, either.
It's just something I have to do.

846
01:33:17,851 --> 01:33:19,182
Why?

847
01:33:19,786 --> 01:33:21,617
Because nobody else can.

848
01:33:24,958 --> 01:33:27,791
I tried to avoid all this, but I can't.

849
01:33:28,194 --> 01:33:30,025
This is how it is.

850
01:33:30,797 --> 01:33:32,458
It's not a perfect world.

851
01:33:32,799 --> 01:33:35,632
It doesn't have to be a perfect world.

852
01:33:39,806 --> 01:33:43,970
I just have to know, are we
going to try to love each other?

853
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:48,813
I'd like to.

854
01:33:50,316 --> 01:33:52,216
But he's out there right now.

855
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:54,482
And I've got to go to work.

856
01:35:37,256 --> 01:35:39,315
Into the air, Junior Birdman!

857
01:35:39,492 --> 01:35:40,823
Missed me!

858
01:35:42,328 --> 01:35:44,262
Yeah! Watch me!

859
01:38:05,505 --> 01:38:08,099
Get them. Take the pictures.

860
01:38:09,175 --> 01:38:10,506
Gotham's greed.

861
01:38:39,205 --> 01:38:40,968
And now, folks...

862
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:43,641
...it's time for, "Who Do You Trust?"

863
01:38:43,910 --> 01:38:46,538
Money, money! Who do you trust?

864
01:38:46,813 --> 01:38:49,646
Me? I'm giving away free money.

865
01:38:50,316 --> 01:38:53,217
And where...is the Batman?

866
01:38:54,654 --> 01:38:57,646
He's at home, washing his tights.

867
01:39:05,731 --> 01:39:10,168
Winged battle flies through
the night and finds me ready.

868
01:39:10,436 --> 01:39:12,427
Bob. Mask.

869
01:39:13,239 --> 01:39:15,230
Masks! Put them on now!

870
01:39:16,075 --> 01:39:17,565
And now...

871
01:39:18,945 --> 01:39:20,572
...comes the part...

872
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:24,013
...where I relieve you,
the little people...

873
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:26,946
...of the burden...of your failed...

874
01:39:27,253 --> 01:39:28,948
...and useless lives.

875
01:39:29,188 --> 01:39:33,181
But, as my plastic surgeon always
said, "If you got to go...

876
01:39:33,593 --> 01:39:35,458
...go with a smile."

877
01:40:06,492 --> 01:40:07,390
My God.

878
01:40:08,394 --> 01:40:09,725
Smylex gas.

879
01:40:10,229 --> 01:40:11,890
He's going to kill everybody!

880
01:40:12,064 --> 01:40:14,794
Get in the car. Get in the car!

881
01:40:23,075 --> 01:40:24,372
Hurry!

882
01:42:16,022 --> 01:42:17,182
My balloons!

883
01:42:27,867 --> 01:42:29,198
They're my balloons!

884
01:42:56,162 --> 01:42:58,289
He stole my balloons!

885
01:42:59,231 --> 01:43:03,395
Why didn't somebody tell me he
had one of those...things?!

886
01:43:05,071 --> 01:43:07,062
Bob. Gun.

887
01:43:13,579 --> 01:43:16,070
I'll need a minute or two alone, boys.

888
01:43:16,415 --> 01:43:18,246
Get out of here!

889
01:44:10,469 --> 01:44:14,132
Come on, you gruesome son-of-a-bitch.
Come to me.

890
01:45:51,337 --> 01:45:52,668
Darling.

891
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:57,775
I've got to get you to
the church on time.

892
01:46:03,515 --> 01:46:06,951
Gotham City Cathedral.
Transportation for two.

893
01:46:07,186 --> 01:46:09,518
-Right away, sir?
-Five minutes.

894
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:16,257
Better make it ten.

895
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:49,400
Let's go.

896
01:49:57,349 --> 01:50:00,682
Point those searchlights
at the tower. Now! Move!

897
01:50:31,049 --> 01:50:35,042
It can be truly said that
I have a bat in my belfry.

898
01:50:44,129 --> 01:50:45,619
Shall we dance?

899
01:52:07,646 --> 01:52:09,807
You know, without you...

900
01:52:10,716 --> 01:52:13,549
...l just wouldn't want to go on.

901
01:53:37,302 --> 01:53:39,793
We were made for each other.

902
01:53:40,238 --> 01:53:42,399
Beauty and the Beast.

903
01:53:43,141 --> 01:53:45,905
Of course, if anyone
calls you "Beast"...

904
01:53:46,144 --> 01:53:48,476
...l'll rip their lungs out.

905
01:54:19,177 --> 01:54:20,667
Mr. Joker?

906
01:54:24,449 --> 01:54:26,940
You say such beautiful things.

907
01:54:28,353 --> 01:54:31,447
And you're so powerful.
And purple!

908
01:54:33,291 --> 01:54:34,451
I love purple!

909
01:54:37,863 --> 01:54:39,023
Excuse me.

910
01:54:39,531 --> 01:54:41,965
Ever dance with the devil
in the pale moonlight?

911
01:54:46,538 --> 01:54:47,698
I'm going to kill you.

912
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:50,301
You idiot!

913
01:54:50,809 --> 01:54:52,868
You made me, remember?!

914
01:54:53,145 --> 01:54:55,136
You dropped me into the chemicals!

915
01:54:55,380 --> 01:54:59,544
That wasn't easy to get over!
And don't think I didn't try.

916
01:54:59,818 --> 01:55:01,046
I know you did.

917
01:55:28,914 --> 01:55:30,347
You killed my parents.

918
01:55:30,582 --> 01:55:31,742
What?

919
01:55:33,919 --> 01:55:34,908
What are you saying?

920
01:55:35,754 --> 01:55:38,416
I made you, but you made me first.

921
01:55:40,025 --> 01:55:41,686
I was just a kid.

922
01:55:41,860 --> 01:55:44,351
I say you made me,
you say I made you.

923
01:55:44,596 --> 01:55:46,757
How childish can you get?

924
01:55:47,032 --> 01:55:49,592
You wouldn't hit a guy
with glasses on.

925
01:56:05,951 --> 01:56:07,782
What are you laughing at?

926
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:17,019
Let me lend you a hand.

927
01:56:25,136 --> 01:56:26,467
Lend you a hand!

928
01:56:34,145 --> 01:56:36,807
They don't make them
like they used to!

929
01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:42,152
Hey, Batsy!

930
01:56:55,834 --> 01:56:57,563
There he is! Down there!

931
01:57:11,549 --> 01:57:12,880
It's time to retire.

932
01:57:14,686 --> 01:57:17,018
Feel free to drop in.

933
01:57:26,264 --> 01:57:28,926
Sometimes I just kill myself!

934
01:57:34,205 --> 01:57:35,433
Hold on!

935
01:59:46,504 --> 01:59:50,998
Our police have rounded up
all of the Joker's men.

936
01:59:51,342 --> 01:59:53,503
The reign of crime is over.

937
01:59:54,012 --> 01:59:57,504
Public safety in Gotham City is
no longer a laughing matter.

938
01:59:57,749 --> 02:00:00,343
Aren't you covering
the press conference?

939
02:00:01,419 --> 02:00:03,410
What about our Pulitzer Prize?

940
02:00:04,089 --> 02:00:05,522
What about us?

941
02:00:06,424 --> 02:00:08,085
What about your picture of Batman?

942
02:00:17,102 --> 02:00:18,194
Take care.

943
02:00:21,206 --> 02:00:23,538
We received a letter from Batman.

944
02:00:25,777 --> 02:00:28,211
"Please inform
the citizens of Gotham...

945
02:00:28,446 --> 02:00:31,279
...that Gotham City's
earned a rest from crime.

946
02:00:32,217 --> 02:00:35,550
But if the forces of evil
should rise again...

947
02:00:35,887 --> 02:00:38,788
...to cast a shadow on
the heart of the city.

948
02:00:39,224 --> 02:00:40,555
Call me."

949
02:00:40,892 --> 02:00:43,554
Question. How do we call him?

950
02:00:48,733 --> 02:00:50,564
He gave us a signal.

951
02:01:26,171 --> 02:01:29,163
I thought champagne
would be in order, ma'am.

952
02:01:29,507 --> 02:01:30,838
Hi, Alfred.

953
02:01:39,851 --> 02:01:41,614
Mr. Wayne told me to tell you...

954
02:01:41,786 --> 02:01:43,777
...that he might be a little late.

955
02:01:46,691 --> 02:01:48,955
I'm not a bit surprised.

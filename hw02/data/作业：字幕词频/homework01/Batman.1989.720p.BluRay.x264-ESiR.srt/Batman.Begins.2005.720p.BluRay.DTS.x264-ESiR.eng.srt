1
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,401
Rachel, let me see.

2
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,618
- Can I see?
- Finders keepers. And I found it.

3
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:02,328
In my garden.

4
00:01:04,038 --> 00:01:05,873
Finders keepers.

5
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,340
Bruce?

6
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,055
Bruce?

7
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:25,852
Mom! Mr. Alfred!

8
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,960
Did you have dream?

9
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:53,296
Nightmare.

10
00:01:57,675 --> 00:01:59,135
Worse than this place?

11
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:23,117
They are going to fight you.

12
00:02:23,493 --> 00:02:25,119
- Again?
- Until they kill you.

13
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,123
Can they kill me before breakfast?

14
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:34,337
You are in hell, little man.

15
00:02:37,632 --> 00:02:40,426
And I am the devil.

16
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:45,264
You're not the devil.

17
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:46,808
You're practice.

18
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:31,561
Solitary.

19
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:33,646
- Why?
- For protection.

20
00:03:34,355 --> 00:03:36,691
- I don't need protection.
- Protection for them.

21
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:42,363
Get in.

22
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:48,369
Are you so desperate
to fight criminals...

23
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:51,205
...that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time?

24
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:56,377
Actually, there were seven of them.

25
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,838
I counted six, Mr. Wayne.

26
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:03,843
How do you know my name?

27
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,055
The world is too small for someone
like Bruce Wayne to disappear...

28
00:04:07,221 --> 00:04:09,557
...no matter how deep
he chooses to sink.

29
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:10,892
Who are you?

30
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:14,228
My name is merely Ducard,
but I speak for Ra's al Ghul...

31
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:18,024
...a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld.

32
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,776
A man who can offer you a path.

33
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,196
What makes you think I need a path?

34
00:04:23,571 --> 00:04:26,199
Someone like you
is only here by choice.

35
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,743
You have been exploring
the criminal fraternity...

36
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,371
...but whatever
your original intentions...

37
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,416
...you have become truly lost.

38
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,755
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?

39
00:04:40,922 --> 00:04:44,926
The path of a man
who shares his hatred of evil...

40
00:04:45,093 --> 00:04:48,304
...and wishes to serve true justice.

41
00:04:48,763 --> 00:04:50,890
The path of the League of Shadows.

42
00:04:53,976 --> 00:04:56,270
- You're vigilantes.
- No, no, no.

43
00:04:56,437 --> 00:05:00,608
A vigilante is just a man lost in
the scramble for his own gratification.

44
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:04,445
He can be destroyed or locked up.

45
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:10,618
But if you make yourself more
than just a man...

46
00:05:10,785 --> 00:05:13,788
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...

47
00:05:13,955 --> 00:05:16,457
...and if they can't stop you...

48
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,293
...then you become
something else entirely.

49
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:22,505
Which is?

50
00:05:23,005 --> 00:05:25,967
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

51
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:28,928
Tomorrow, you will be released.

52
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:32,473
If you are bored of brawling with thieves
and want to achieve something...

53
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,144
...there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the eastern slopes.

54
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,979
Pick one of these flowers.

55
00:05:38,146 --> 00:05:41,107
If you can carry it
to the top of the mountain...

56
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:44,193
...you may find what you were
looking for in the first place.

57
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,113
And what was I looking for?

58
00:05:48,823 --> 00:05:50,783
Only you can know that.

59
00:06:57,934 --> 00:07:01,562
You turn back. You go back.

60
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:11,174
Ra's al Ghul?

61
00:08:21,392 --> 00:08:22,977
Wait.

62
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,273
What are you seeking?

63
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:30,193
I seek...

64
00:08:31,736 --> 00:08:33,988
...the means to fight injustice.

65
00:08:34,364 --> 00:08:36,491
To turn fear...

66
00:08:36,824 --> 00:08:39,660
...against those
who prey on the fearful.

67
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:04,435
To manipulate the fears in others...

68
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:08,690
...you must first master your own.

69
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:11,025
Are you ready to begin?

70
00:09:11,943 --> 00:09:14,529
I can... I can barely stand.

71
00:09:14,696 --> 00:09:17,031
Death does not wait
for you to be ready!

72
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:20,368
Death is not considerate or fair!

73
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:25,498
And make no mistake,
here you face death.

74
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:30,712
Tiger.

75
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,132
Jujitsu.

76
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,385
Panther.

77
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:43,224
You're skilled. But this is not a dance.

78
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,231
And you are afraid.

79
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,069
But not of me.

80
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,034
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...

81
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,708
...what do you fear?

82
00:10:17,842 --> 00:10:19,260
Bruce?

83
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:24,432
It's okay. It's okay.

84
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:26,100
You'll be okay.

85
00:10:26,351 --> 00:10:28,644
Will we be needing an ambulance,
Master Wayne?

86
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:31,814
No, I'll set the bone
and take him for an x-ray later.

87
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:33,232
Very good, sir.

88
00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:37,403
- I'm very sorry, sir. I've told...
- Don't worry. It's fine.

89
00:10:39,697 --> 00:10:41,657
Took quite a fall, didn't we,
Master Bruce?

90
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:43,117
And why do we fall, Bruce?

91
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:46,537
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

92
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,169
Just a little fall.
It's just a small fracture.

93
00:11:02,136 --> 00:11:03,971
The bats again?

94
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:09,268
You know why they attacked you,
don't you?

95
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,814
- They were afraid of you.
- Afraid of me?

96
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,982
All creatures feel fear.

97
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:16,484
Even the scary ones?

98
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:18,528
Especially the scary ones.

99
00:11:18,903 --> 00:11:20,697
I got something to show you.

100
00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:28,329
- You think your mother will like them?
- Yeah.

101
00:11:28,996 --> 00:11:31,165
- I think it's time to get up.
- Maybe.

102
00:11:31,332 --> 00:11:32,959
No going back to bed.

103
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,297
Did you build this train, Dad?

104
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:43,177
Gotham's been good to our family,
but the city's been suffering.

105
00:11:43,344 --> 00:11:46,848
People less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times.

106
00:11:47,015 --> 00:11:50,977
So we built a new, cheap, public
transportation system to unite the city.

107
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:52,854
And at the center...

108
00:11:53,021 --> 00:11:54,856
...Wayne Tower.

109
00:11:55,023 --> 00:11:57,900
- Is that where you work?
- No, I work at the hospital.

110
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:01,279
I leave the running of our company
to much better men.

111
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:03,322
- Better?
- Well...

112
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,742
...more interested men.

113
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:03,549
Can we go?

114
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:07,428
Please.

115
00:13:08,012 --> 00:13:10,056
Okay. Let's go.

116
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:22,151
- What's wrong, Bruce?
- No, no. It was me.

117
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:24,445
I just needed some fresh air.

118
00:13:24,612 --> 00:13:27,782
A little bit of opera goes a long way.
Right, Bruce?

119
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,121
Come on. Let's go.

120
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,336
Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.

121
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:41,879
- That's fine.
- Fast.

122
00:13:42,046 --> 00:13:43,631
Take it easy.

123
00:13:44,298 --> 00:13:45,842
Take it easy.

124
00:13:46,634 --> 00:13:48,094
Here you go.

125
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:53,683
It's fine. It's fine.

126
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,687
Now just take it and go.

127
00:13:57,854 --> 00:13:59,647
- I said, jewelry.
- Hey...

128
00:14:01,691 --> 00:14:03,026
Thomas!

129
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:12,660
Bruce.

130
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,664
It's okay.

131
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:21,544
Don't be afraid.

132
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:55,161
Is this your father's?

133
00:14:56,704 --> 00:14:58,831
It's okay.

134
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,667
Come here.

135
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:06,589
There you go.

136
00:15:09,717 --> 00:15:11,719
It's okay.

137
00:15:13,471 --> 00:15:15,390
It's okay.

138
00:15:19,394 --> 00:15:20,895
Gordon.

139
00:15:28,986 --> 00:15:30,571
Hey.

140
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:32,407
Good news.

141
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,743
We got him, son.

142
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,266
You're in excellent hands.

143
00:15:58,433 --> 00:16:00,101
We'll be watching the empire.

144
00:16:00,268 --> 00:16:03,271
When you grow up,
it'll be waiting for you.

145
00:16:19,287 --> 00:16:22,415
I thought I might prepare
a little supper.

146
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,672
- Very well.
- Alfred?

147
00:16:33,634 --> 00:16:35,636
- Yes, Master Bruce?
- It was my fault, Alfred.

148
00:16:35,803 --> 00:16:37,472
- I made them leave the theater.
- No.

149
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:40,683
- lf I hadn't gotten scared...
- It was nothing that you did.

150
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:45,146
It was him, and him alone.

151
00:16:45,646 --> 00:16:47,148
Do you understand?

152
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:53,321
I miss them, Alfred.
I miss them so much.

153
00:16:53,488 --> 00:16:55,490
So do I, Master Bruce.

154
00:16:57,909 --> 00:16:59,160
So do I.

155
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:04,248
And do you still feel responsible
for your parents' death?

156
00:17:04,415 --> 00:17:06,542
My anger outweighs my guilt.

157
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,669
Come.

158
00:17:13,341 --> 00:17:16,052
You have learned to bury
your guilt with anger.

159
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:19,263
I will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth.

160
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:26,729
You know how to fight six men.
We can teach you how to engage 600.

161
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,857
You know how to disappear.

162
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:32,235
We can teach you
to become truly invisible.

163
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:35,571
Invisible?

164
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:44,205
The ninja understands that invisibility
is a matter of patience and agility.

165
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,886
Always mind your surroundings.

166
00:18:02,056 --> 00:18:04,267
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

167
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:08,021
- As weapons?
- Or distractions.

168
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,523
Theatricality and deception
are powerful agents.

169
00:18:10,982 --> 00:18:14,027
You must become more than just a man
in the mind of your opponent.

170
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,448
- Who is he?
- He was a farmer.

171
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:21,868
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land
and became a murderer.

172
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:24,328
- Now he is a prisoner.
- What'll happen to him?

173
00:18:24,495 --> 00:18:26,914
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

174
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:31,044
Criminals thrive on the indulgence
of society's understanding.

175
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:37,925
Your parents' death
was not your fault.

176
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:47,518
It was your father's.

177
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:11,250
Anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act.

178
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,628
- The man had a gun.
- Would that stop you?

179
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,630
I've had training.

180
00:19:15,797 --> 00:19:17,632
The training is nothing!

181
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:19,467
Will is everything!

182
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,100
The will to act.

183
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:38,111
Yield.

184
00:19:38,403 --> 00:19:39,821
You haven't beaten me.

185
00:19:39,987 --> 00:19:42,699
You have sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke.

186
00:19:50,331 --> 00:19:52,125
Rub your chest.

187
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,503
Your arms will
take care of themselves.

188
00:19:58,172 --> 00:19:59,799
You are stronger than your father.

189
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,093
You didn't know my father.

190
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,554
But I know the rage that drives you.

191
00:20:04,721 --> 00:20:07,015
That impossible anger
strangling the grief...

192
00:20:07,181 --> 00:20:09,851
...until the memory
of your loved one is just...

193
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:12,020
...poison in your veins.

194
00:20:12,186 --> 00:20:16,649
And one day, you catch yourself wishing
the person you loved had never existed...

195
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:20,528
...so you'd be spared your pain.

196
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:26,909
I wasn't always here in the mountains.

197
00:20:28,536 --> 00:20:30,580
Once, I had a wife.

198
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:33,458
My great love.

199
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,753
She was taken from me.

200
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:40,131
Like you, I was forced to learn
there are those without decency...

201
00:20:40,298 --> 00:20:43,593
...who must be fought
without hesitation, without pity.

202
00:20:45,386 --> 00:20:47,722
Your anger gives you great power.

203
00:20:48,222 --> 00:20:51,768
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

204
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,228
...as it almost did me.

205
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:57,106
- What stopped it?
- Vengeance.

206
00:20:57,273 --> 00:20:59,233
That's no help to me.

207
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,235
Why, Bruce?

208
00:21:01,402 --> 00:21:04,072
Why could you not
avenge your parents?

209
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:11,371
Will you be heading back to Princeton
after the hearing, sir...

210
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:14,207
...or can I persuade you to stay on
for a day or two?

211
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:16,584
I'm not heading back at all.

212
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:18,795
- You don't like it there?
- I like it fine.

213
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:22,006
They just don't feel the same way.

214
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,469
- I've prepared the master bedroom.
- No.

215
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:28,054
My room will be fine.

216
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:30,765
With all due respect, sir,
Wayne Manor is your house.

217
00:21:30,932 --> 00:21:32,767
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

218
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:35,311
- Your father is dead.
- This place is a mausoleum.

219
00:21:35,478 --> 00:21:38,523
If I have my way, I'll pull
the damn thing down brick by brick.

220
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,777
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered
six generations of your family.

221
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:45,655
Why do you give a damn, Alfred?
It's not your family.

222
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:50,368
I give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible...

223
00:21:51,035 --> 00:21:53,204
...for what was
most precious to him...

224
00:21:53,371 --> 00:21:55,623
...in the whole world.

225
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:01,129
Miss Dawes has offered
to drive you to the hearing.

226
00:22:01,295 --> 00:22:03,339
She probably hopes
to talk you out of going.

227
00:22:03,506 --> 00:22:06,968
Should I just bury the past out there
with my parents, Alfred?

228
00:22:07,135 --> 00:22:10,221
I wouldn't presume to tell you
what to do with your past, sir.

229
00:22:10,388 --> 00:22:14,434
Just know that there are those of us who
care about what you do with your future.

230
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,311
Haven't given up on me yet?

231
00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:19,480
Never.

232
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:11,449
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf.

233
00:23:12,325 --> 00:23:14,243
Hasn't he noticed
you're tall enough to reach now?

234
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,703
Old habits die hard, I guess.

235
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:18,664
- Never used to stop us anyway.
- No, it didn't.

236
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,708
How's your mom?

237
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,378
She misses this place.

238
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:26,381
So do I.

239
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:28,049
Yeah.

240
00:23:28,216 --> 00:23:31,219
But it's nothing without the people
who made it what it was.

241
00:23:31,386 --> 00:23:34,389
- Now there's only Alfred.
- And you.

242
00:23:34,555 --> 00:23:38,101
- I'm not staying, Rachel.
- You're just back for the hearing.

243
00:23:41,729 --> 00:23:45,900
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way
to convince you not to come.

244
00:23:46,234 --> 00:23:49,737
Someone at this proceeding...

245
00:23:50,405 --> 00:23:52,573
...should stand for my parents.

246
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,867
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

247
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:58,246
- What Chill did is unforgivable.
- Then why is your boss letting him go?

248
00:23:59,622 --> 00:24:02,875
In prison, he shared a cell
with Carmine Falcone.

249
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:06,713
He learned things, and he will testify
in exchange for early parole.

250
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:09,549
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

251
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:13,261
I cannot let that pass.

252
00:24:13,428 --> 00:24:16,305
And I need you
to understand that, please.

253
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:19,267
Okay.

254
00:24:20,351 --> 00:24:23,688
The depression hit working people,
like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.

255
00:24:23,855 --> 00:24:27,066
His crime was appalling, yes,
but it was motivated not by greed...

256
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,068
...but by desperation.

257
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:33,156
Given the 14 years served, as well as
his extraordinary level of cooperation...

258
00:24:33,322 --> 00:24:35,950
...with one of this office's
most important investigations...

259
00:24:36,117 --> 00:24:39,245
...we strongly endorse his petition
for early release.

260
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:42,540
Mr. Chill?

261
00:24:46,127 --> 00:24:47,795
Your Honor...

262
00:24:48,671 --> 00:24:51,799
...not a day goes by that I don't wish
I could take back what I did.

263
00:24:54,427 --> 00:24:57,680
Sure, I was desperate,
like a lot of people back then...

264
00:24:57,847 --> 00:25:00,183
...but that don't change what I did.

265
00:25:03,811 --> 00:25:08,483
I gather there is a member
of the Wayne family here today.

266
00:25:08,649 --> 00:25:10,943
Has he got anything to say?

267
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:28,503
- He's coming out the side!
- He's coming out the side, guys!

268
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:39,472
Bruce Wayne!

269
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:43,518
Joe! Hey, Joe!

270
00:25:43,685 --> 00:25:45,186
Falcone says hi.

271
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:59,117
Come on, Bruce.
We don't need to see this.

272
00:25:59,867 --> 00:26:01,411
I do.

273
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:08,543
The DA couldn't understand
why Judge Faden...

274
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,545
...insisted on making the hearing public.

275
00:26:10,712 --> 00:26:13,131
Falcone paid him off
to get Chill out in the open.

276
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:14,590
Maybe I should thank them.

277
00:26:14,757 --> 00:26:17,343
- You don't mean that.
- What if I do, Rachel?

278
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,429
My parents deserved justice.

279
00:26:19,595 --> 00:26:22,515
You're not talking about justice.
You're talking about revenge.

280
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:25,560
- Sometimes, they're the same.
- No, they're never the same.

281
00:26:25,727 --> 00:26:29,313
Justice is about harmony. Revenge is
about you making yourself feel better.

282
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,775
- It's why we have an impartial system.
- Your system is broken.

283
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:42,702
You care about justice?
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

284
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,579
This city is rotting.

285
00:26:44,746 --> 00:26:47,540
They talk about the depression
as if it's history. It's not.

286
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:49,208
Things are worse than ever here.

287
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:51,919
Falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs...

288
00:26:52,086 --> 00:26:55,048
...preying on the desperate,
creating new Joe Chills every day.

289
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,759
Falcone may not have killed
your parents, Bruce...

290
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:00,887
...but he's destroying everything
that they stood for.

291
00:27:05,433 --> 00:27:08,311
You wanna thank him for that?
Here you go.

292
00:27:10,188 --> 00:27:13,232
We all know where to find him.
As long as he keeps the bad people rich...

293
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:15,485
...and the good people scared,
no one'll touch him.

294
00:27:15,651 --> 00:27:19,947
Good people like your parents, who'll
stand against injustice, they're gone.

295
00:27:20,114 --> 00:27:23,826
What chance does Gotham have
when the good people do nothing?

296
00:27:24,702 --> 00:27:28,122
- I'm not one of your good people, Rachel.
- What do you mean?

297
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:33,419
All these years, I wanted to kill him.

298
00:27:34,212 --> 00:27:35,797
Now I can't.

299
00:27:51,688 --> 00:27:53,398
Your father would be ashamed of you.

300
00:28:36,858 --> 00:28:39,360
You're taller than you look
in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

301
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:41,696
No gun? I'm insulted.

302
00:28:44,866 --> 00:28:48,661
- You could've just sent a thank-you note.
- I didn't come here to thank you.

303
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:51,581
I came to show you that
not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

304
00:28:51,748 --> 00:28:53,374
Only those who know me, kid.

305
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:56,210
Look around you.
You'll see two councilmen...

306
00:28:56,544 --> 00:28:59,380
...a union official,
couple off-duty cops...

307
00:28:59,797 --> 00:29:01,424
...and a judge.

308
00:29:01,591 --> 00:29:05,887
I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of
blowing your head off in front of them.

309
00:29:06,054 --> 00:29:08,765
Now, that's power you can't buy.

310
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,850
That's the power of fear.

311
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:12,518
I'm not afraid of you.

312
00:29:12,685 --> 00:29:14,604
Because you think you got
nothing to lose.

313
00:29:14,771 --> 00:29:16,439
But you haven't thought it through.

314
00:29:16,606 --> 00:29:19,692
You haven't thought about
your lady friend in the DA's office.

315
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:22,278
You haven't thought about
your old butler.

316
00:29:26,407 --> 00:29:28,743
People from your world...

317
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:31,287
...have so much to lose.

318
00:29:31,454 --> 00:29:35,792
Now, you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot...

319
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:38,920
...you know about the ugly side of life,
but you don't.

320
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:41,214
You've never tasted desperate.

321
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:43,925
You're... You're Bruce Wayne,
the prince of Gotham.

322
00:29:44,092 --> 00:29:47,512
You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet
someone who didn't know your name.

323
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,974
So don't come here with your anger,
trying to prove something to yourself.

324
00:29:52,141 --> 00:29:54,268
This is a world
you'll never understand.

325
00:29:54,435 --> 00:29:56,437
And you always fear...

326
00:29:56,604 --> 00:29:59,065
...what you don't understand.

327
00:30:01,943 --> 00:30:03,319
All right.

328
00:30:10,952 --> 00:30:13,788
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.
I'll give you that.

329
00:30:13,955 --> 00:30:15,957
More than your old man anyway.

330
00:30:16,124 --> 00:30:20,420
In the joint, Chill told me about
the night he killed your parents.

331
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:22,797
He said your father begged for mercy.

332
00:30:24,173 --> 00:30:25,925
Begged.

333
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:27,468
Like a dog.

334
00:30:40,314 --> 00:30:42,108
Should've tipped better.

335
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:53,953
- For what?
- Your jacket.

336
00:30:54,495 --> 00:30:56,122
Okay.

337
00:30:57,206 --> 00:31:00,668
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it.
It's a nice coat.

338
00:31:00,835 --> 00:31:02,962
Be careful who sees you with that.

339
00:31:03,546 --> 00:31:05,465
- They're gonna come looking for me.
- Who?

340
00:31:05,923 --> 00:31:07,633
Everyone.

341
00:31:09,927 --> 00:31:11,679
It's...

342
00:31:11,846 --> 00:31:13,848
It's a nice coat.

343
00:31:32,158 --> 00:31:36,537
When you lived among the criminals,
did you start to pity them?

344
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:40,375
The first time I stole
so that I wouldn 't starve, yes.

345
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:46,047
I lost many assumptions about
the simple nature of right and wrong.

346
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,425
And when I traveled...

347
00:31:49,592 --> 00:31:52,303
...I learned the fear before a crime...

348
00:31:53,054 --> 00:31:55,640
...and the thrill of success.

349
00:31:57,517 --> 00:31:59,394
But I never became one of them.

350
00:32:02,855 --> 00:32:05,775
Fool. What do I care what your name is?
You're a criminal.

351
00:32:07,235 --> 00:32:09,028
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

352
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,202
You've traveled the world to understand
the criminal mind and conquer your fears.

353
00:32:18,287 --> 00:32:22,417
But a criminal is not complicated.

354
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:25,920
And what you really fear
is inside yourself.

355
00:32:26,087 --> 00:32:28,631
You fear your own power.

356
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:30,091
You fear your anger...

357
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:34,804
...the drive to do great
or terrible things.

358
00:32:34,971 --> 00:32:38,433
Now you must journey inwards.

359
00:32:42,186 --> 00:32:44,272
You are ready.

360
00:32:45,273 --> 00:32:46,691
Breathe.

361
00:32:56,242 --> 00:32:58,119
Breathe.

362
00:33:03,124 --> 00:33:04,959
Breathe in your fears.

363
00:33:07,587 --> 00:33:08,629
Face them.

364
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:12,925
To conquer fear,
you must become fear.

365
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:16,471
You must bask in the fear
of other men.

366
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:21,351
And men fear most
what they cannot see.

367
00:33:38,576 --> 00:33:41,454
You have to become a terrible thought.

368
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,210
A wraith.

369
00:33:52,924 --> 00:33:55,301
You have to become an idea!

370
00:34:02,183 --> 00:34:05,228
Feel terror cloud your senses.

371
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:10,191
Feel its power to distort.

372
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,361
To control.

373
00:34:16,447 --> 00:34:20,243
And know that this power
can be yours.

374
00:34:32,797 --> 00:34:35,466
Embrace your worst fear.

375
00:34:42,473 --> 00:34:44,767
Become one with the darkness.

376
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:06,289
Focus.

377
00:35:06,581 --> 00:35:08,750
Concentrate.

378
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:11,044
Master your senses.

379
00:35:39,113 --> 00:35:41,574
You cannot leave any sign.

380
00:35:41,949 --> 00:35:43,159
I haven't.

381
00:35:51,459 --> 00:35:53,461
Impressive.

382
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:04,639
We have purged your fear.

383
00:36:05,807 --> 00:36:07,433
You are ready to lead these men.

384
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,145
You are ready to become a member
of the League of Shadows.

385
00:36:13,773 --> 00:36:17,944
But first, you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice.

386
00:36:34,669 --> 00:36:36,045
No.

387
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:38,798
I'm no executioner.

388
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:43,011
Your compassion is a weakness
your enemies will not share.

389
00:36:43,386 --> 00:36:45,680
That's why it's so important.

390
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,682
It separates us from them.

391
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:50,226
You want to fight criminals.
This man is a murderer.

392
00:36:50,393 --> 00:36:52,186
- This man should be tried.
- By whom?

393
00:36:52,353 --> 00:36:54,063
Corrupt bureaucrats?

394
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:56,733
Criminals mock society's laws.

395
00:36:56,899 --> 00:36:59,193
You know this better than most.

396
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:02,697
You cannot lead these men...

397
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:06,868
...unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil.

398
00:37:07,452 --> 00:37:09,871
And where would I be leading
these men?

399
00:37:10,413 --> 00:37:11,706
Gotham.

400
00:37:11,873 --> 00:37:13,916
As Gotham's favored son...

401
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:18,421
...you will be ideally placed
to strike at the heart of criminality.

402
00:37:18,796 --> 00:37:22,550
- How?
- Gotham's time has come.

403
00:37:22,717 --> 00:37:26,054
Like Constantinople
or Rome before it...

404
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:30,433
...the city has become a breeding ground
for suffering and injustice.

405
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,228
It is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die.

406
00:37:34,395 --> 00:37:39,567
This is the most important function
of the League of Shadows.

407
00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:42,945
It is one we've performed
for centuries.

408
00:37:43,279 --> 00:37:45,031
Gotham...

409
00:37:45,198 --> 00:37:48,076
...must be destroyed.

410
00:37:51,412 --> 00:37:52,914
You can't believe in this.

411
00:37:53,122 --> 00:37:57,669
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from
the darkest corners of our own hearts.

412
00:37:57,835 --> 00:38:02,256
What he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary.

413
00:38:02,465 --> 00:38:05,802
I will go back to Gotham
and I will fight men like this...

414
00:38:05,968 --> 00:38:08,554
...but I will not
become an executioner.

415
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:10,264
Bruce, please.

416
00:38:10,431 --> 00:38:13,267
For your own sake,
there is no turning back.

417
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:48,177
- What are you doing?
- What's necessary, my friend.

418
00:41:04,605 --> 00:41:07,734
I will tell him you saved his life.

419
00:41:26,461 --> 00:41:29,005
Master Wayne,
you've been gone a long time.

420
00:41:29,172 --> 00:41:31,466
- Yes, I have.
- You look very fashionable.

421
00:41:32,967 --> 00:41:34,469
Apart from the mud.

422
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:37,388
Are you coming back to Gotham
for long, sir?

423
00:41:37,555 --> 00:41:38,806
As long as it takes.

424
00:41:38,973 --> 00:41:40,475
I want to show the people...

425
00:41:40,641 --> 00:41:44,062
...their city doesn't belong
to the criminals and the corrupt.

426
00:41:44,228 --> 00:41:47,440
In the depression, your father nearly
bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...

427
00:41:47,607 --> 00:41:48,816
...combating poverty.

428
00:41:49,025 --> 00:41:53,529
He believed his example could inspire
the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

429
00:41:53,821 --> 00:41:55,448
Did it?

430
00:41:56,574 --> 00:41:58,034
In a way.

431
00:41:58,201 --> 00:42:01,287
Their murder shocked the wealthy
and the powerful into action.

432
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:06,334
People need dramatic examples
to shake them out of apathy.

433
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:08,169
I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

434
00:42:08,336 --> 00:42:09,879
As a man...

435
00:42:10,046 --> 00:42:12,465
...I'm flesh and blood,
I can be ignored, destroyed.

436
00:42:12,632 --> 00:42:14,550
But as a symbol...

437
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,680
As a symbol, I can be incorruptible.

438
00:42:18,846 --> 00:42:21,474
- I can be everlasting.
- What symbol?

439
00:42:22,058 --> 00:42:24,727
Something elemental...

440
00:42:24,894 --> 00:42:26,521
...something terrifying.

441
00:42:26,688 --> 00:42:28,815
I assume that as you take on
the underworld...

442
00:42:28,981 --> 00:42:34,112
...this symbol is a persona to protect
those you care about from reprisals?

443
00:42:34,278 --> 00:42:35,655
You're thinking about Rachel?

444
00:42:35,822 --> 00:42:38,199
Actually, sir, I was thinking of myself.

445
00:42:40,201 --> 00:42:41,953
Have you told anyone
I'm coming back?

446
00:42:42,161 --> 00:42:46,374
I couldn't figure the legal ramifications
of bringing you back from the dead.

447
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:48,418
- Dead?
- You've been gone seven years.

448
00:42:48,584 --> 00:42:49,877
You had me declared dead?

449
00:42:50,044 --> 00:42:52,922
Actually, it was Mr. Earle.
He's taking the company public.

450
00:42:53,089 --> 00:42:55,341
He wanted to liquidate
your majority shareholding.

451
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,885
Those shares are worth
quite a bit of money.

452
00:42:58,052 --> 00:43:00,763
Well, it's a good thing
I left everything to you, then.

453
00:43:01,305 --> 00:43:02,932
Quite so, sir.

454
00:43:03,099 --> 00:43:06,853
And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like.
Just bring it back with a full tank.

455
00:43:16,744 --> 00:43:21,457
In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much
a danger to himself as to others...

456
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:26,421
...and prison is probably not the best
environment for his rehabilitation.

457
00:43:28,715 --> 00:43:31,300
- Dr. Crane.
- Miss Dawes.

458
00:43:31,467 --> 00:43:34,762
You think a man who butchers people
for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

459
00:43:34,929 --> 00:43:37,598
I would hardly have testified to that
otherwise, would I?

460
00:43:37,765 --> 00:43:40,852
This is the third of Falcone's thugs
you've had declared insane...

461
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:42,437
...and moved into your asylum.

462
00:43:42,645 --> 00:43:47,275
The work offered by organized crime
must have an attraction to the insane.

463
00:43:48,818 --> 00:43:50,820
Or the corrupt.

464
00:43:53,072 --> 00:43:54,657
Mr. Finch.

465
00:43:54,991 --> 00:43:56,784
You should check
with Miss Dawes here...

466
00:43:56,951 --> 00:44:01,331
...just what implications your office
has authorized her to make. If any.

467
00:44:05,293 --> 00:44:07,628
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing, Carl?

468
00:44:07,795 --> 00:44:09,172
Looking out for you.

469
00:44:11,674 --> 00:44:14,594
Falcone has half the city
bought and paid for.

470
00:44:14,761 --> 00:44:16,804
- Drop it.
- How can you say that?

471
00:44:16,971 --> 00:44:20,683
Because as much as I care about
getting Falcone, I care more about you.

472
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:22,143
That's sweet.

473
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:29,942
We've been through all that.

474
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:57,470
Blessed bat again, sir.

475
00:44:57,929 --> 00:45:00,348
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

476
00:46:58,216 --> 00:47:00,927
No more favors.
Someone is sniffing around.

477
00:47:01,094 --> 00:47:04,055
Hey, I scratch your back,
you scratch mine, doc.

478
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:05,598
I'm bringing in the shipments.

479
00:47:06,307 --> 00:47:07,517
We are paying you for that.

480
00:47:07,684 --> 00:47:10,186
Maybe money isn't as interesting
to me as favors.

481
00:47:12,689 --> 00:47:17,485
I am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

482
00:47:17,652 --> 00:47:20,738
But you know who I'm working for,
and when he gets here...

483
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:22,824
He... He's coming to Gotham?

484
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,450
Yes, he is.

485
00:47:24,617 --> 00:47:27,078
And when he gets here,
he's not going to wanna hear...

486
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:32,333
...that you've endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of jail time.

487
00:47:33,334 --> 00:47:36,671
- Who's bothering you?
- There's a girl at the DA's office.

488
00:47:37,171 --> 00:47:38,965
- We'll buy her off.
- Not this one.

489
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:42,010
Idealist, huh?

490
00:47:42,176 --> 00:47:43,886
Well, there's an answer to that too.

491
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:47,223
- I don't want to know.
- Yes, you do.

492
00:47:51,394 --> 00:47:54,856
No, we are showing very healthy growth
in these sectors.

493
00:47:55,023 --> 00:47:58,192
I don't think Thomas Wayne would have
viewed heavy-arms manufacture...

494
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:00,528
...as a suitable cornerstone
for our business.

495
00:48:01,904 --> 00:48:05,700
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.

496
00:48:06,034 --> 00:48:09,203
I think after 20 years
we can allow ourselves...

497
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:12,206
...to stop thinking about what
Thomas Wayne would have done.

498
00:48:12,373 --> 00:48:14,250
Good morning, Mr. Earle's office.

499
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:17,712
Yes, he's confirmed for
the dinner tomorrow evening.

500
00:48:17,879 --> 00:48:21,215
Good morning.
I'm here to see Mr. Earle.

501
00:48:21,382 --> 00:48:22,884
Name?

502
00:48:23,343 --> 00:48:25,011
Bruce Wayne.

503
00:48:26,888 --> 00:48:30,391
Thomas would probably not
have taken the company public.

504
00:48:30,558 --> 00:48:34,645
But that is what we,
as responsible managers, are going to do.

505
00:48:35,355 --> 00:48:36,898
Jessica?

506
00:48:37,982 --> 00:48:40,526
Jessica? Where are you?

507
00:48:40,693 --> 00:48:44,947
- Eye on the ball, and...
- Why is no one answering the phone?

508
00:48:45,615 --> 00:48:48,785
It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle.
I'm sure they'll call back.

509
00:48:49,118 --> 00:48:51,621
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.

510
00:48:51,788 --> 00:48:53,748
I'm sorry to disappoint.

511
00:48:53,915 --> 00:48:56,626
- I need you to take a look at this.
- Have you seen him yet?

512
00:48:56,918 --> 00:48:58,461
- Who?
- Wayne.

513
00:48:58,795 --> 00:49:00,880
It's been all over the news.
He's back.

514
00:49:04,801 --> 00:49:07,720
I'm sure you realize
I can't stop the big machine.

515
00:49:07,887 --> 00:49:09,138
Too many wheels turning.

516
00:49:09,305 --> 00:49:11,307
- We're going public.
- I understand.

517
00:49:11,766 --> 00:49:14,602
And I'll be handsomely rewarded
for my shares.

518
00:49:14,769 --> 00:49:17,313
I'm not looking to interfere.

519
00:49:17,772 --> 00:49:19,899
- I am looking for a job.
- Oh?

520
00:49:20,066 --> 00:49:23,111
I just want to get to know the company
that my family built.

521
00:49:23,444 --> 00:49:25,196
Any ideas where you would start?

522
00:49:25,697 --> 00:49:28,074
Applied Sciences caught my eye.

523
00:49:28,449 --> 00:49:30,159
Fox's department.

524
00:49:30,326 --> 00:49:32,328
I'll let him know you're coming.

525
00:49:33,246 --> 00:49:35,999
You look like him. Your dad.

526
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:39,460
You're the only one left
of the Wayne family.

527
00:49:39,627 --> 00:49:43,589
This is where you belong.
Welcome home.

528
00:49:43,923 --> 00:49:48,428
Environmental procedures,
defense projects, consumer products.

529
00:49:48,928 --> 00:49:51,639
All prototypes. None in production.

530
00:49:51,806 --> 00:49:54,475
- On any level whatsoever.
- None?

531
00:49:55,476 --> 00:49:57,311
What did they tell you this place was?

532
00:49:57,478 --> 00:49:59,522
They didn't tell me anything.

533
00:50:01,983 --> 00:50:05,445
Earle told me exactly what it was
when he sent me down here.

534
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:07,363
Dead end.

535
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:10,867
Place to keep me from causing
the board any more trouble.

536
00:50:11,826 --> 00:50:13,328
Come on.

537
00:50:13,494 --> 00:50:15,955
- You were on the board?
- When your father ran things.

538
00:50:16,122 --> 00:50:17,999
- You knew my father?
- Oh, yeah.

539
00:50:18,166 --> 00:50:19,834
Helped him build his train.

540
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:22,045
Here we are.

541
00:50:25,715 --> 00:50:27,342
Kevlar utility harness.

542
00:50:27,717 --> 00:50:29,677
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.

543
00:50:29,844 --> 00:50:32,180
The 350-pound test monofilament.

544
00:50:35,516 --> 00:50:37,685
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

545
00:50:38,186 --> 00:50:42,815
Routed it right into Wayne Tower,
along with the water and power utilities.

546
00:50:42,982 --> 00:50:46,194
Kind of made Wayne Tower
the unofficial center of Gotham City.

547
00:50:46,402 --> 00:50:49,030
Of course, Earle let it go to rot.
Here we are.

548
00:50:50,907 --> 00:50:53,034
Nomex survival suit
for advanced infantry.

549
00:50:53,242 --> 00:50:55,995
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.

550
00:50:56,329 --> 00:50:58,706
- Tear-resistant?
- This sucker will stop a knife.

551
00:50:58,873 --> 00:51:01,084
- Bulletproof?
- Anything but a straight shot.

552
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:04,128
- Why didn't they put it into production?
- Bean counters didn't think...

553
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:06,673
...a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.

554
00:51:07,757 --> 00:51:11,219
So, what's your interest in it,
Mr. Wayne?

555
00:51:11,886 --> 00:51:13,388
I want to borrow it.

556
00:51:13,554 --> 00:51:15,348
For spelunking.

557
00:51:16,224 --> 00:51:17,517
Spelunking?

558
00:51:17,684 --> 00:51:19,394
Yeah, you know, cave diving?

559
00:51:20,687 --> 00:51:23,356
You expecting to run into
much gunfire in these caves?

560
00:51:25,692 --> 00:51:28,945
Look, I'd rather Mr. Earle
didn't know about me borrowing...

561
00:51:29,112 --> 00:51:30,363
Mr. Wayne...

562
00:51:30,571 --> 00:51:32,490
...the way I see it...

563
00:51:32,949 --> 00:51:35,410
...all this stuff is yours anyway.

564
00:51:38,371 --> 00:51:40,873
Okay. Give it a try.

565
00:51:45,003 --> 00:51:46,254
Charming.

566
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:50,883
At least you'll have company.

567
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,764
This must be the lowest foundation
of the southeast wing.

568
00:52:09,235 --> 00:52:13,406
Your great-great-grandfather was
involved in the Underground Railroad...

569
00:52:13,573 --> 00:52:16,576
...secretly transporting freed slaves
to the North...

570
00:52:16,743 --> 00:52:20,455
...and I suspect these caverns
came in handy.

571
00:52:33,134 --> 00:52:35,303
Alfred! Come up here!

572
00:52:35,511 --> 00:52:38,473
I can see everything all right
from down here, sir, thank you.

573
00:52:58,493 --> 00:53:01,162
We order the main part
of this cowl from Singapore.

574
00:53:01,329 --> 00:53:02,830
Via a dummy corporation.

575
00:53:02,997 --> 00:53:04,832
Indeed. And then, quite separately...

576
00:53:04,999 --> 00:53:09,962
...we place an order
to a Chinese company for these.

577
00:53:10,505 --> 00:53:13,466
- Put it together ourselves.
- Precisely.

578
00:53:13,633 --> 00:53:17,679
They'll have to be large orders,
to avoid suspicion.

579
00:53:17,845 --> 00:53:20,390
- How large?
- Say 10,000.

580
00:53:22,892 --> 00:53:25,812
- Well, at least we'll have spares.
- Yes.

581
00:53:42,912 --> 00:53:44,998
Don't suppose you want a taste.

582
00:53:45,164 --> 00:53:48,334
I just keep offering,
thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.

583
00:53:48,501 --> 00:53:50,670
There's nothing wise
in what you do, Flass.

584
00:53:50,837 --> 00:53:54,215
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste,
makes us guys nervous.

585
00:53:54,382 --> 00:53:56,217
I'm no rat.

586
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:02,682
In a town this bent,
who's there to rat to anyway?

587
00:54:32,378 --> 00:54:34,505
Don't turn around.

588
00:54:35,089 --> 00:54:38,176
You're a good cop.
One of the few.

589
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:39,969
What do you want?

590
00:54:40,136 --> 00:54:43,306
Carmine Falcone brings in
shipments of drugs every week.

591
00:54:43,473 --> 00:54:45,266
Nobody takes him down. Why?

592
00:54:46,684 --> 00:54:48,811
He's paid up with the right people.

593
00:54:49,103 --> 00:54:51,898
What will it take to bring him down?

594
00:54:52,607 --> 00:54:55,026
Leverage on Judge Faden...

595
00:54:55,735 --> 00:54:58,112
...and a DA brave enough
to prosecute.

596
00:54:58,529 --> 00:55:00,156
Rachel Dawes.

597
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:01,866
Who are you?

598
00:55:02,283 --> 00:55:03,910
Watch for my sign.

599
00:55:06,579 --> 00:55:08,623
You're just one man?

600
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,458
Now we're two.

601
00:55:12,585 --> 00:55:14,170
We?

602
00:55:29,811 --> 00:55:31,562
Freeze!

603
00:55:48,746 --> 00:55:50,665
What the hell was that?

604
00:55:53,584 --> 00:55:54,794
Just some nut.

605
00:55:58,214 --> 00:56:01,009
Well, what is it today?
More spelunking?

606
00:56:01,175 --> 00:56:03,678
No. Today it's BASE-jumping.

607
00:56:04,262 --> 00:56:05,888
BASE-jumping.

608
00:56:06,472 --> 00:56:09,017
- That like parachuting?
- Kind of.

609
00:56:10,226 --> 00:56:13,021
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

610
00:56:13,187 --> 00:56:15,857
You know,
I think I have just the thing.

611
00:56:17,191 --> 00:56:19,652
It's called memory cloth.
Notice anything?

612
00:56:22,989 --> 00:56:24,866
Regularly flexible...

613
00:56:25,283 --> 00:56:27,410
...but put a current through it...

614
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:32,582
...molecules realign, it becomes rigid.
- What kind of shapes can you make?

615
00:56:32,749 --> 00:56:35,877
Can be tailored to fit any structure
based on a rigid skeleton.

616
00:56:36,044 --> 00:56:37,253
Too expensive for the Army?

617
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:42,175
I don't think they tried to market it
to the billionaire, BASE-jumping crowd.

618
00:56:42,342 --> 00:56:44,135
- Look, Mr. Fox.
- Yes, sir?

619
00:56:44,802 --> 00:56:46,179
If you're uncomfortable...

620
00:56:46,346 --> 00:56:49,557
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me
exactly what you're doing...

621
00:56:49,724 --> 00:56:51,684
...when I'm asked, I don't have to lie.

622
00:56:53,436 --> 00:56:56,022
But don't think of me as an idiot.

623
00:56:57,523 --> 00:56:59,484
Fair enough.

624
00:57:01,402 --> 00:57:03,237
What's that?

625
00:57:05,323 --> 00:57:07,241
The Tumbler?

626
00:57:07,742 --> 00:57:09,702
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

627
00:57:15,708 --> 00:57:17,627
She was built as a bridging vehicle.

628
00:57:19,629 --> 00:57:24,050
During combat, two of these
would jump over a river, towing cables.

629
00:57:26,594 --> 00:57:30,223
Over here on the throttle,
flip that open and throttle up.

630
00:57:30,431 --> 00:57:32,975
This will boost you into a rampless jump...
Not now!

631
00:57:35,812 --> 00:57:37,939
Not... Not now, sir.

632
00:57:40,775 --> 00:57:42,652
Afterburner disengaged.

633
00:57:43,027 --> 00:57:46,072
We never could get
the damn bridge to work...

634
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,949
...but this baby works just fine.

635
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,751
So, what do you think?

636
00:58:00,003 --> 00:58:02,005
Does it come in black?

637
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:05,008
I need you at the docks Thursday.

638
00:58:05,258 --> 00:58:07,135
- Problems?
- I don't want any trouble...

639
00:58:07,301 --> 00:58:09,429
...with the last shipment.
- Sure.

640
00:58:11,014 --> 00:58:14,684
Word on the street is you got a beef
with somebody in the DA's office.

641
00:58:14,851 --> 00:58:17,270
- Is that right?
- And that there's a fat prize...

642
00:58:17,437 --> 00:58:20,148
...waiting for anybody willing
to do anything about it.

643
00:58:20,314 --> 00:58:22,275
So, what's your point, Mr. Flass?

644
00:58:22,734 --> 00:58:23,985
Have you seen the girl?

645
00:58:24,485 --> 00:58:27,155
It's a cute little assistant D A.

646
00:58:27,322 --> 00:58:30,992
Don 't you think that's a little too much
heat to bring down, maybe?

647
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:34,495
- Even for this town.
- Never underestimate Gotham City.

648
00:58:34,662 --> 00:58:37,498
People get mugged coming home
from work every day of the week.

649
00:58:37,665 --> 00:58:40,293
Sometimes...
Sometimes things just go bad.

650
00:58:44,172 --> 00:58:45,965
It's a problem with the graphite, sir.

651
00:58:46,174 --> 00:58:48,843
The next 10,000
will be up to specifications.

652
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:51,596
- At least they gave us a discount.
- Quite.

653
00:58:51,763 --> 00:58:57,393
In the meantime, sir, may I suggest
you try to avoid landing on your head?

654
00:59:34,389 --> 00:59:36,432
Why bats, Master Wayne?

655
00:59:36,683 --> 00:59:37,934
Bats frighten me.

656
00:59:39,227 --> 00:59:41,521
It's time my enemies shared my dread.

657
01:00:08,214 --> 01:00:10,133
What is this?

658
01:00:13,928 --> 01:00:15,263
Continue.

659
01:00:20,768 --> 01:00:22,437
Looks fine out there.

660
01:00:22,854 --> 01:00:24,772
The bears go straight to the dealers.

661
01:00:24,939 --> 01:00:27,608
Yeah, and the rabbits go
to the man in the Narrows.

662
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:30,778
- What's the difference?
- Ignorance is bliss, my friend.

663
01:00:30,945 --> 01:00:34,115
Don't burden yourself
with the secrets of scary people.

664
01:00:49,964 --> 01:00:52,967
Hey. Steiss.

665
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,740
Steiss?

666
01:01:27,669 --> 01:01:29,295
What?

667
01:01:30,046 --> 01:01:31,506
What the...?

668
01:01:40,515 --> 01:01:42,350
I better check it.

669
01:01:54,904 --> 01:01:56,906
There's a problem out here.
You better bail.

670
01:02:26,227 --> 01:02:27,854
Where are you?!

671
01:02:28,021 --> 01:02:29,063
Here.

672
01:02:50,126 --> 01:02:53,421
Get going. Oh, shit.

673
01:03:11,606 --> 01:03:13,733
What the hell are you?

674
01:03:16,778 --> 01:03:17,945
I'm Batman.

675
01:03:26,287 --> 01:03:28,247
Nice coat.

676
01:03:29,957 --> 01:03:31,501
Thanks.

677
01:04:12,542 --> 01:04:13,793
Hold it.

678
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,381
That's right, you better run.

679
01:04:27,348 --> 01:04:29,183
Falcone sent them to kill you.

680
01:04:30,309 --> 01:04:32,895
- Why?
- You rattled his cage.

681
01:04:36,691 --> 01:04:38,234
- What's this?
- Leverage.

682
01:04:38,401 --> 01:04:40,028
- For what?
- To get things moving.

683
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,322
Who are you?

684
01:04:42,697 --> 01:04:43,948
Someone like you.

685
01:04:44,115 --> 01:04:46,159
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

686
01:04:51,247 --> 01:04:54,751
Ma'am? Everything okay?

687
01:04:59,047 --> 01:05:01,549
- Falcone's men?
- Does it matter?

688
01:05:01,716 --> 01:05:04,010
We'll never tie him to it anyway.

689
01:05:04,218 --> 01:05:06,346
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

690
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,235
What the hell is that?

691
01:05:30,828 --> 01:05:32,080
Cut him down.

692
01:05:54,686 --> 01:05:55,937
Unacceptable.

693
01:05:56,104 --> 01:05:58,940
Now, I don't care if it's rival gangs,
Guardian Angels...

694
01:05:59,107 --> 01:06:01,067
...or the goddamn Salvation Army...

695
01:06:01,317 --> 01:06:03,653
...get them off the street
and off the front page.

696
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:06,406
They say it was just one guy.
Or a creature.

697
01:06:06,572 --> 01:06:09,283
It was some asshole in a costume.

698
01:06:09,784 --> 01:06:11,452
- Yeah?
- This guy did deliver us...

699
01:06:11,619 --> 01:06:14,414
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.

700
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:18,084
No one takes the law
into their own hands in my city.

701
01:06:18,251 --> 01:06:19,460
Understand?

702
01:06:19,752 --> 01:06:22,213
- No way to bury it now.
- There's still Judge Faden.

703
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:25,466
- I've got Faden covered.
- What about this bat they babble about?

704
01:06:25,633 --> 01:06:28,761
Even if these guys will swear
to being thrashed by a giant bat...

705
01:06:28,928 --> 01:06:31,097
...we've got Falcone at the scene.

706
01:06:31,264 --> 01:06:34,475
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.
This bat character gave us everything.

707
01:06:34,892 --> 01:06:36,436
Okay. Let's do it.

708
01:06:39,856 --> 01:06:41,983
- Bats are nocturnal.
- Bats may be.

709
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:45,570
But even for billionaire playboys,
3:00 is pushing it.

710
01:06:46,612 --> 01:06:49,490
The price for leading a double life,
I fear.

711
01:06:50,825 --> 01:06:53,244
Your theatrics made an impression.

712
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:57,665
Theatricality and deception...

713
01:06:57,832 --> 01:07:01,044
...are powerful weapons, Alfred.
This is a good start.

714
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:04,005
If those are to be the first
of many injuries to come...

715
01:07:04,172 --> 01:07:07,008
...it would be wise
to find a suitable excuse.

716
01:07:07,342 --> 01:07:08,676
Polo, for instance.

717
01:07:08,843 --> 01:07:10,511
I'm not learning polo, Alfred.

718
01:07:10,762 --> 01:07:14,432
Strange injuries,
a nonexistent social life.

719
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:16,059
These things beg the question...

720
01:07:16,225 --> 01:07:20,480
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne
do with his time and his money.

721
01:07:20,646 --> 01:07:22,231
What does someone like me do?

722
01:07:23,191 --> 01:07:27,403
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.

723
01:07:28,071 --> 01:07:29,656
Buy things that are not for sale.

724
01:07:29,822 --> 01:07:33,368
Who knows, Master Wayne,
you start pretending to have fun...

725
01:07:33,993 --> 01:07:35,995
...you might even have a little
by accident.

726
01:07:38,706 --> 01:07:40,166
Sir.

727
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:42,669
- We have a situation.
- All right.

728
01:07:43,044 --> 01:07:46,881
The Coast Guard picked up
one of our cargo ships last night...

729
01:07:47,423 --> 01:07:52,220
...heavily damaged, all crew missing,
probably dead.

730
01:07:54,263 --> 01:07:56,641
The ship was carrying
a prototype weapon.

731
01:07:56,849 --> 01:07:58,643
It's a microwave emitter.

732
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:01,771
It's designed for desert warfare,
but it...

733
01:08:03,439 --> 01:08:05,024
It looks like somebody...

734
01:08:09,404 --> 01:08:10,905
...turned it on.

735
01:08:15,076 --> 01:08:19,539
It uses focused microwaves to
vaporize the enemy's water supply.

736
01:08:27,463 --> 01:08:30,425
The damage to the ship
was catastrophic.

737
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:33,594
The weapon itself is...

738
01:08:34,887 --> 01:08:36,389
Missing?

739
01:08:37,223 --> 01:08:38,474
Yeah.

740
01:08:39,767 --> 01:08:41,728
Mr. Wayne.

741
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:46,899
Nice car.

742
01:08:47,066 --> 01:08:48,443
You should see my other one.

743
01:08:58,453 --> 01:09:00,413
He's done something
the police never have.

744
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:02,874
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

745
01:09:03,041 --> 01:09:05,626
Well, at least he's getting
something done.

746
01:09:05,793 --> 01:09:08,129
Bruce, help me out here.

747
01:09:08,296 --> 01:09:12,633
Well, a guy who dresses up
like a bat clearly has issues.

748
01:09:13,676 --> 01:09:15,928
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

749
01:09:16,095 --> 01:09:18,473
And now the cops want him.
What does that tell you?

750
01:09:18,639 --> 01:09:19,849
They're jealous.

751
01:09:20,016 --> 01:09:22,643
Sir, the pool is for decoration...

752
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:26,189
...and your friends
do not have swimwear.

753
01:09:27,982 --> 01:09:29,984
Well, they're European.

754
01:09:31,819 --> 01:09:34,197
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

755
01:09:35,114 --> 01:09:38,576
- It is not a question of money.
- Well, you see...

756
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,953
...I'm buying this hotel...

757
01:09:42,747 --> 01:09:47,168
...and setting some new rules
about the pool area.

758
01:09:48,336 --> 01:09:50,713
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

759
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,007
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

760
01:09:59,514 --> 01:10:01,099
Thank you.

761
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:04,185
Bruce?

762
01:10:07,772 --> 01:10:09,565
Rachel?

763
01:10:09,732 --> 01:10:11,150
I'd heard you were back.

764
01:10:13,194 --> 01:10:14,696
What are you doing?

765
01:10:15,446 --> 01:10:19,867
Just swimming here.
Wow, it is good to see you.

766
01:10:20,034 --> 01:10:21,577
You were gone a long time.

767
01:10:22,161 --> 01:10:25,081
- I know. How are things?
- The same.

768
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,668
Job's getting worse.

769
01:10:28,835 --> 01:10:31,546
Can't change the world on your own.

770
01:10:31,713 --> 01:10:33,798
What choice do I have...

771
01:10:34,465 --> 01:10:36,217
...when you're too busy swimming?

772
01:10:37,552 --> 01:10:39,595
Rachel, all of...

773
01:10:39,887 --> 01:10:41,556
All this...

774
01:10:42,974 --> 01:10:47,020
It's... It's not me. It's...

775
01:10:47,437 --> 01:10:50,064
Inside, I am...

776
01:10:51,274 --> 01:10:53,234
I am more.

777
01:10:53,901 --> 01:10:55,445
Come on, Bruce. Come on.

778
01:10:55,611 --> 01:10:59,407
Bruce, we have some more hotels
for you to buy.

779
01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:01,909
Bruce...

780
01:11:03,077 --> 01:11:06,581
...deep down you may still be
that same great kid you used to be.

781
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,586
But it's not who you are underneath...

782
01:11:12,045 --> 01:11:13,796
...it's what you do that defines you.

783
01:11:26,351 --> 01:11:27,935
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

784
01:11:28,102 --> 01:11:30,980
Not at all. He cut his wrists?

785
01:11:31,147 --> 01:11:34,817
Probably looking for the insanity plea.
But if anything should happen...

786
01:11:34,984 --> 01:11:37,945
Of course, better safe than sorry.

787
01:11:41,366 --> 01:11:44,952
Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore.
It's all too much.

788
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:47,580
The walls are closing in.
Blah, blah, blah.

789
01:11:48,122 --> 01:11:50,625
A couple of days of this food,
it'll be true.

790
01:11:51,626 --> 01:11:53,294
- What do you want?
- I wanna know...

791
01:11:53,461 --> 01:11:55,963
...how you're gonna convince me
to keep my mouth shut.

792
01:11:56,130 --> 01:11:58,299
About what?
You don't know anything.

793
01:11:58,466 --> 01:12:02,637
I know you don't want the cops to take
a closer look at the drugs they seized.

794
01:12:02,804 --> 01:12:06,974
And I know about your experiments
with the inmates of your nut house.

795
01:12:07,141 --> 01:12:10,812
See, I don't go into business with a guy
without finding out his dirty secrets.

796
01:12:11,396 --> 01:12:14,315
And those goons you used.

797
01:12:14,482 --> 01:12:16,317
I own the muscle in this town.

798
01:12:16,484 --> 01:12:19,862
Now, I've been bringing
your stuff in for months...

799
01:12:20,405 --> 01:12:24,617
...so whatever he's planning,
it's big, and I want in.

800
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:29,038
Well, I already know what he'll say.

801
01:12:29,455 --> 01:12:30,832
That we should kill you.

802
01:12:32,709 --> 01:12:36,004
Even he can't get me in here.
Not in my town.

803
01:12:41,968 --> 01:12:43,511
Would you like to see my mask?

804
01:12:45,054 --> 01:12:46,514
I use it in my experiments.

805
01:12:49,017 --> 01:12:53,479
Now, I'm probably not very frightening
to a guy like you.

806
01:12:53,855 --> 01:12:56,691
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

807
01:12:57,608 --> 01:12:59,569
So when did the nut
take over the nut house?

808
01:13:00,528 --> 01:13:03,197
They scream and they cry...

809
01:13:04,198 --> 01:13:05,825
...much as you're doing now.

810
01:13:08,161 --> 01:13:11,372
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

811
01:13:11,539 --> 01:13:14,083
I'll talk to the judge
and see if I can get him moved...

812
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:17,670
...to the secure wing at Arkham.
I can't treat him here.

813
01:13:39,692 --> 01:13:41,194
Storm's coming.

814
01:13:45,782 --> 01:13:48,785
The scum is getting jumpy
because you stood up to Falcone.

815
01:13:48,951 --> 01:13:52,497
It's a start. Your partner
was at the docks with Falcone.

816
01:13:52,664 --> 01:13:55,375
Well, he moonlights
as a low-level enforcer.

817
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:59,545
They were splitting the shipment in two.
Only half went to the dealers.

818
01:13:59,712 --> 01:14:01,631
Why? What about the other half?

819
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:04,509
- Flass knows.
- He won't talk.

820
01:14:05,134 --> 01:14:06,719
He'll talk to me.

821
01:14:06,886 --> 01:14:09,931
Commissioner Loeb set up
a massive task force to catch you.

822
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:12,934
- He thinks you're dangerous.
- What do you think?

823
01:14:14,686 --> 01:14:17,105
I think you're trying to help.

824
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:24,445
But I've been wrong before.

825
01:14:30,243 --> 01:14:31,953
Come on, I ain't got all night.

826
01:14:35,289 --> 01:14:37,125
Flass, I have kids to feed.

827
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:39,752
What, they don't like falafel?

828
01:14:55,143 --> 01:14:56,853
Where were the other drugs going?

829
01:14:58,146 --> 01:15:00,315
I never knew. I don't know.

830
01:15:00,481 --> 01:15:02,692
- I swear to God.
- Swear to me!

831
01:15:08,323 --> 01:15:11,326
I don't... I don't know.
I never knew. Never.

832
01:15:11,617 --> 01:15:15,079
They went to some guy for a couple days
before they went to the dealers.

833
01:15:15,246 --> 01:15:16,539
Why?

834
01:15:17,206 --> 01:15:20,793
There was something...
Something else in the drugs...

835
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,545
...something hidden.
- What?

836
01:15:22,712 --> 01:15:26,049
I never went to the drop-off point.
It was in the Narrows.

837
01:15:26,215 --> 01:15:29,510
- Cops only go there in force.
- Do I look like a cop?

838
01:15:29,677 --> 01:15:31,471
No...

839
01:15:45,068 --> 01:15:47,111
This is the one I'm talking about.

840
01:15:47,403 --> 01:15:49,697
- What's your problem with it?
- It shouldn't exist.

841
01:15:49,864 --> 01:15:53,701
This ship left Singapore with
246 containers, but arrived with 247.

842
01:15:53,868 --> 01:15:56,245
I'm guessing there's something
I'm not supposed to find in there.

843
01:15:56,412 --> 01:15:59,832
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna
know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

844
01:15:59,999 --> 01:16:03,336
Things are working a little
differently now. Open it up.

845
01:16:12,929 --> 01:16:14,180
What the hell is this?

846
01:16:56,764 --> 01:16:59,934
It's you, isn't it?
Everybody's been talking about you.

847
01:17:00,518 --> 01:17:02,270
Get in here!

848
01:17:02,895 --> 01:17:05,023
The other kids won't believe me.

849
01:17:28,129 --> 01:17:30,256
Get rid of all traces.

850
01:17:30,548 --> 01:17:33,468
- Better torch the whole place.
- All right.

851
01:18:09,504 --> 01:18:11,297
Having trouble?

852
01:18:12,006 --> 01:18:14,342
Take a seat. Have a drink.

853
01:18:15,051 --> 01:18:18,304
You look like a man
who takes himself too seriously.

854
01:18:22,016 --> 01:18:25,019
Do you want my opinion?
You need to lighten up.

855
01:19:16,988 --> 01:19:20,700
Alfred, help me.

856
01:19:30,585 --> 01:19:33,963
Blood. Take. Take poison.
Blood poison.

857
01:19:34,130 --> 01:19:37,133
Poisonous. Poisonous.

858
01:19:41,429 --> 01:19:43,139
Bruce...

859
01:19:44,432 --> 01:19:45,600
...why do we fall?

860
01:19:57,695 --> 01:20:01,032
- How long was I out?
- Two days.

861
01:20:01,407 --> 01:20:03,242
It's your birthday.

862
01:20:04,577 --> 01:20:05,828
Many happy returns.

863
01:20:11,042 --> 01:20:14,837
I've felt these effects before,
but this was so much more potent.

864
01:20:15,046 --> 01:20:19,592
It was some kind of hallucinogen,
weaponized, in aerosol form.

865
01:20:19,801 --> 01:20:22,720
You have been hanging out
in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

866
01:20:22,929 --> 01:20:26,015
I called Mr. Fox when your condition
worsened after the first day.

867
01:20:26,182 --> 01:20:27,558
I analyzed your blood...

868
01:20:27,725 --> 01:20:31,187
...isolating the receptor compounds
and the protein-based catalyst.

869
01:20:31,396 --> 01:20:33,189
Am I meant to understand any of that?

870
01:20:33,564 --> 01:20:36,693
Not at all. I just wanted you to know
how hard it was.

871
01:20:37,318 --> 01:20:40,989
- Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote.
- Could you make more?

872
01:20:41,197 --> 01:20:43,741
You planning on gassing yourself
again, Mr. Wayne?

873
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:47,120
Well, you know how it is.
You're out at night, looking for kicks...

874
01:20:47,328 --> 01:20:50,081
...someone's passing around
the weaponized hallucinogens...

875
01:20:50,248 --> 01:20:53,668
I'll bring what I have.
The antidote should inoculate you for now.

876
01:20:53,876 --> 01:20:56,212
Alfred, always a pleasure.

877
01:20:56,421 --> 01:20:58,047
Lucius.

878
01:21:02,593 --> 01:21:05,263
- You sure you don't want to come in?
- I have to get back.

879
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:07,140
- I wanted to leave this.
- Thank you.

880
01:21:07,306 --> 01:21:08,683
Rachel?

881
01:21:10,059 --> 01:21:13,229
Looks like someone's been
burning the candle at both ends.

882
01:21:13,438 --> 01:21:16,107
- Must've been quite an occasion.
- It is my birthday.

883
01:21:16,316 --> 01:21:19,944
I know. I'm sorry I can't come tonight.
I was just dropping off your present.

884
01:21:20,153 --> 01:21:23,573
- You've got better plans?
- My boss has been missing for days...

885
01:21:23,781 --> 01:21:27,452
...which means I should probably start
by looking at the bottom of the river.

886
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:29,120
- Rachel.
- Excuse me.

887
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,249
Rachel Dawes.

888
01:21:33,875 --> 01:21:37,462
Who authorized that? Get Crane down
there now. Don't take no for an answer.

889
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:41,507
Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our
own assessment to the judge by morning.

890
01:21:41,966 --> 01:21:43,760
- What's wrong?
- It's Falcone.

891
01:21:43,968 --> 01:21:46,429
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum
on suicide watch.

892
01:21:46,637 --> 01:21:49,640
You're going to Arkham now?
It's in the Narrows, Rachel.

893
01:21:50,892 --> 01:21:52,685
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

894
01:21:52,894 --> 01:21:55,647
- Some of us have work to do.
- You be careful.

895
01:21:57,398 --> 01:21:58,941
Happy birthday.

896
01:22:18,378 --> 01:22:20,463
But, Master Wayne,
the guests will be arriving.

897
01:22:20,672 --> 01:22:22,298
Keep them happy until I arrive.

898
01:22:22,465 --> 01:22:24,634
Tell them that joke you know.

899
01:23:03,506 --> 01:23:05,216
Having fun?

900
01:23:07,343 --> 01:23:10,888
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you
doing in a place like this?

901
01:23:11,097 --> 01:23:12,348
I need some information.

902
01:23:12,557 --> 01:23:17,312
The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1 -ME.

903
01:23:18,646 --> 01:23:20,106
1 -ME.

904
01:23:20,315 --> 01:23:24,027
It's a microwave emitter. It was designed
to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

905
01:23:24,235 --> 01:23:28,448
Rumor was they tested dispersing
water-based chemicals into the air...

906
01:23:28,614 --> 01:23:30,533
...but isn't that illegal?

907
01:23:32,285 --> 01:23:36,497
I want all the information
on the development of this project...

908
01:23:36,706 --> 01:23:40,668
...all data, files, backup disks,
on my desk right away.

909
01:23:41,085 --> 01:23:42,712
Did you lose one?

910
01:23:43,796 --> 01:23:47,383
I'm merging your department
with Archives.

911
01:23:48,634 --> 01:23:49,886
And I am firing you.

912
01:23:52,055 --> 01:23:54,015
Didn't you get the memo?

913
01:24:01,272 --> 01:24:02,899
Scarecrow.

914
01:24:06,235 --> 01:24:08,071
Scarecrow.

915
01:24:11,449 --> 01:24:12,742
Scarecrow.

916
01:24:15,787 --> 01:24:17,955
Miss Dawes, this is most irregular.

917
01:24:18,164 --> 01:24:21,084
I have nothing to add
to the report I filed with the judge.

918
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:23,461
- I have questions about your report.
- Such as?

919
01:24:23,670 --> 01:24:27,965
Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man
who has no history of mental illness...

920
01:24:28,132 --> 01:24:31,719
...to have a psychotic breakdown
just when he's about to be indicted?

921
01:24:31,928 --> 01:24:36,140
As you can see for yourself, there is
nothing convenient about his symptoms.

922
01:24:40,812 --> 01:24:42,188
- Scarecrow.
- What's "scarecrow"?

923
01:24:42,689 --> 01:24:46,275
Patients suffering delusional episodes
often focus their paranoia...

924
01:24:46,484 --> 01:24:48,569
...on an external tormentor...

925
01:24:48,778 --> 01:24:51,948
...usually one conforming
to Jungian archetypes.

926
01:24:52,198 --> 01:24:54,575
In this case, a scarecrow.

927
01:24:56,077 --> 01:25:00,206
- He's drugged?
- Psychopharmacology is my primary field.

928
01:25:00,373 --> 01:25:01,749
I'm a strong advocate.

929
01:25:02,667 --> 01:25:04,836
Outside, he was a giant.

930
01:25:05,044 --> 01:25:07,463
In here, only the mind
can grant you power.

931
01:25:07,672 --> 01:25:09,382
You enjoy the reversal.

932
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:12,593
I respect the mind's power
over the body.

933
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:14,303
It's why I do what I do.

934
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:19,350
I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone
behind bars, not in therapy.

935
01:25:19,559 --> 01:25:22,812
I want my own psychiatric consultant
to have full access to Falcone...

936
01:25:23,021 --> 01:25:26,357
...including blood work.
Find out what exactly you put him on.

937
01:25:26,524 --> 01:25:28,985
- First thing tomorrow, then.
- Tonight.

938
01:25:29,193 --> 01:25:32,613
I've already paged Dr. Lehmann
at County General.

939
01:25:34,032 --> 01:25:35,825
As you wish.

940
01:25:41,372 --> 01:25:43,333
This way, please.

941
01:25:43,499 --> 01:25:46,085
There's something
I think you should see.

942
01:25:57,013 --> 01:25:59,599
This is where we make the medicine.

943
01:26:06,439 --> 01:26:10,318
Perhaps you should have some,
clear your head.

944
01:26:35,593 --> 01:26:37,220
Who knows you're here?

945
01:26:38,262 --> 01:26:39,889
Who knows?

946
01:26:47,105 --> 01:26:48,314
He's here.

947
01:26:48,523 --> 01:26:49,732
Who?

948
01:26:49,941 --> 01:26:51,901
The Batman.

949
01:26:53,695 --> 01:26:55,571
- What do we do?
- What anyone does...

950
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:58,533
...when a prowler comes around.

951
01:26:59,492 --> 01:27:02,036
- Call the police.
- You want the cops here?

952
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:05,373
At this point, they can't stop us.

953
01:27:05,581 --> 01:27:09,085
But the Batman
has a talent for disruption.

954
01:27:09,293 --> 01:27:12,463
Force him outside,
the police will take him down. Go.

955
01:27:12,672 --> 01:27:14,757
- What about her?
- She hasn't got long.

956
01:27:14,966 --> 01:27:16,926
I gave her a concentrated dose.

957
01:27:17,093 --> 01:27:19,637
The mind can only take so much.
Now go.

958
01:27:22,181 --> 01:27:24,434
The things they say about him.

959
01:27:24,642 --> 01:27:26,185
Can he really fly?

960
01:27:26,352 --> 01:27:28,396
I heard he can disappear.

961
01:27:28,604 --> 01:27:31,607
Well, we'll find out.

962
01:27:31,899 --> 01:27:33,526
Won't we?

963
01:28:20,865 --> 01:28:22,992
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?

964
01:28:29,666 --> 01:28:31,501
What have you been doing here?

965
01:28:34,629 --> 01:28:37,006
Who are you working for?

966
01:28:41,469 --> 01:28:43,805
Ra's... Ra's al Ghul.

967
01:28:44,013 --> 01:28:48,851
Ra's al Ghul is dead.
Who are you working for?

968
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:50,061
Crane.

969
01:28:52,563 --> 01:28:55,483
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.

970
01:28:56,067 --> 01:28:57,944
But if you'd like to make
an appointment...

971
01:29:10,999 --> 01:29:13,918
Batman, put down your weapons
and surrender.

972
01:29:14,627 --> 01:29:16,004
You're surrounded.

973
01:29:21,592 --> 01:29:24,345
- What are you waiting for?
- Backup.

974
01:29:25,096 --> 01:29:27,473
- Backup?
- The Batman's in there.

975
01:29:27,682 --> 01:29:29,809
SWAT's on the way.
But if you wanna go in now...

976
01:29:30,018 --> 01:29:31,561
...I'll be right behind you, sir.

977
01:29:33,062 --> 01:29:34,605
SWAT's on the way.

978
01:29:35,690 --> 01:29:36,941
- Hey.
- Hey.

979
01:30:19,484 --> 01:30:21,194
What's happened to her?

980
01:30:23,863 --> 01:30:27,617
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic
hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.

981
01:30:29,661 --> 01:30:33,373
- Let me get her down to the medics.
- They can't help her, but I can.

982
01:30:37,335 --> 01:30:39,462
Get her downstairs.
Meet me in the alley.

983
01:30:47,470 --> 01:30:50,306
Crane's been smuggling his toxin
hidden in Falcone's drugs...

984
01:30:50,515 --> 01:30:52,642
...and they're dumping it
into the water supply.

985
01:30:53,184 --> 01:30:54,811
- What was he planning?
- I don't know.

986
01:30:55,061 --> 01:30:56,354
Was he working for Falcone?

987
01:30:56,854 --> 01:30:59,357
He mentioned someone else,
someone worse.

988
01:30:59,565 --> 01:31:02,110
She needs the antidote
before the damage is permanent.

989
01:31:02,318 --> 01:31:04,487
- How long does she have?
- Not long.

990
01:31:08,408 --> 01:31:10,201
What is that?

991
01:31:11,577 --> 01:31:13,830
- Backup.
- What the...?

992
01:32:32,075 --> 01:32:33,618
Excuse me.

993
01:32:38,373 --> 01:32:41,584
- How is she?
- She's fading. We gotta go.

994
01:32:43,461 --> 01:32:44,921
I'll get my car.

995
01:32:45,088 --> 01:32:46,881
I brought mine.

996
01:32:47,298 --> 01:32:48,925
Yours?

997
01:32:58,267 --> 01:33:00,061
I've gotta get me one of those.

998
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:03,439
- He is in a vehicle.
- Make and color?

999
01:33:03,648 --> 01:33:05,984
It's a black...

1000
01:33:07,318 --> 01:33:08,611
...tank.

1001
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:12,657
Stay calm.

1002
01:33:13,324 --> 01:33:15,118
You've been poisoned.

1003
01:33:17,829 --> 01:33:19,122
I'm on him.

1004
01:33:27,547 --> 01:33:28,589
Breathe slowly.

1005
01:33:38,725 --> 01:33:39,809
Hold on.

1006
01:33:54,324 --> 01:33:55,700
- What are you doing?
- Shortcut.

1007
01:34:04,208 --> 01:34:06,002
Air One to ground, block that ramp.

1008
01:34:10,548 --> 01:34:12,175
He's got no way off that roof.

1009
01:34:13,551 --> 01:34:16,637
Turn off your engine.
Step away from the car.

1010
01:34:19,015 --> 01:34:21,768
- Trust me.
- Weapons system activated.

1011
01:34:39,702 --> 01:34:40,953
Who is this guy?

1012
01:34:41,287 --> 01:34:42,997
- Where's he going?
- He's on the roof.

1013
01:34:57,428 --> 01:34:59,597
- What street is he taking?
- He's not on a street.

1014
01:34:59,806 --> 01:35:01,516
He's flying on rooftops.

1015
01:35:40,763 --> 01:35:42,974
At least tell me what it looks like.

1016
01:35:46,019 --> 01:35:47,478
Never mind.

1017
01:35:51,357 --> 01:35:52,734
Got him.

1018
01:36:03,619 --> 01:36:05,163
Coming right up on his butt.

1019
01:36:29,896 --> 01:36:32,315
We're tracking suspect vehicle
heading west on l- 17.

1020
01:36:37,612 --> 01:36:39,322
- Air One to ground.
- I lost him.

1021
01:36:39,489 --> 01:36:41,324
We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.

1022
01:36:41,532 --> 01:36:43,493
We'll loop back to check
the frontage road.

1023
01:36:43,701 --> 01:36:45,787
Stealth mode activated.

1024
01:36:46,454 --> 01:36:47,664
Stay with me.

1025
01:36:53,878 --> 01:36:55,338
What...? There he is.

1026
01:37:15,066 --> 01:37:16,526
Just hold on.

1027
01:37:20,488 --> 01:37:21,656
Rachel!

1028
01:37:54,439 --> 01:37:56,774
- They get any of this into the mains?
- Yeah.

1029
01:37:56,983 --> 01:37:59,819
Notify the water company.
There's gotta be a way to isolate it.

1030
01:38:00,028 --> 01:38:02,864
No. They put it all in.
They must've been at this for weeks.

1031
01:38:03,072 --> 01:38:06,617
- Gotham's entire water supply is laced.
- Why haven't we felt the effects?

1032
01:38:06,826 --> 01:38:09,078
Must be a compound that has
to be absorbed through the lungs.

1033
01:38:19,339 --> 01:38:21,049
How do you feel?

1034
01:38:23,801 --> 01:38:25,261
Where are we?

1035
01:38:25,803 --> 01:38:29,557
- Why did you bring me here?
- lf I hadn't, your mind would be lost.

1036
01:38:29,766 --> 01:38:31,768
- You were poisoned.
- It was...

1037
01:38:31,976 --> 01:38:35,563
- It was Dr. Crane.
- Rest. Gordon has Crane.

1038
01:38:35,772 --> 01:38:37,857
Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?

1039
01:38:38,733 --> 01:38:40,360
I don't have the luxury of friends.

1040
01:38:41,277 --> 01:38:44,614
I'm gonna give you a sedative.
You'll wake up back at home.

1041
01:38:44,781 --> 01:38:48,701
When you do, get these to Gordon,
and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

1042
01:38:48,910 --> 01:38:50,620
- What are they?
- The antidote.

1043
01:38:50,828 --> 01:38:54,123
One for Gordon to inoculate himself,
the other for mass production.

1044
01:38:54,540 --> 01:38:55,792
Mass production?

1045
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,128
Crane was just a pawn.
We need to be ready.

1046
01:39:25,113 --> 01:39:28,491
When you told me your grand plan
for saving Gotham...

1047
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:31,619
...all that stopped me
from calling the men in white coats...

1048
01:39:31,786 --> 01:39:34,247
...was when you said
it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1049
01:39:34,455 --> 01:39:37,458
- It's not.
- What would you call that?

1050
01:39:39,335 --> 01:39:42,005
- Damn good television.
- It's a miracle no one was killed.

1051
01:39:42,213 --> 01:39:45,842
I didn't have time to observe
the rules of the road, Alfred.

1052
01:39:46,050 --> 01:39:49,137
You're getting lost inside
this monster of yours.

1053
01:39:49,345 --> 01:39:53,725
I'm using this monster to help
other people, just like my father did.

1054
01:39:53,933 --> 01:39:55,476
For Thomas Wayne, helping others...

1055
01:39:55,685 --> 01:39:58,604
...wasn't about proving anything
to anyone, including himself.

1056
01:39:59,063 --> 01:40:02,400
It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

1057
01:40:02,859 --> 01:40:05,445
She's downstairs, sedated.
I need you to take her home.

1058
01:40:05,778 --> 01:40:09,365
Well, we both care for Rachel, but what
you're doing has to be beyond that.

1059
01:40:09,699 --> 01:40:12,618
It can't be personal,
or you're just a vigilante.

1060
01:40:12,785 --> 01:40:14,620
- Is Fox still here?
- Yes, sir.

1061
01:40:14,829 --> 01:40:16,456
We need to send these people away.

1062
01:40:16,664 --> 01:40:19,584
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests.
You have a name to maintain.

1063
01:40:19,792 --> 01:40:21,586
I don't care about my name.

1064
01:40:21,794 --> 01:40:24,964
It's not just your name, sir.
It's your father's name.

1065
01:40:26,716 --> 01:40:29,052
And it's all that's left of him.

1066
01:40:31,012 --> 01:40:32,555
Don't destroy it.

1067
01:40:47,904 --> 01:40:50,031
- Mr. Earle.
- Happy birthday, Bruce.

1068
01:40:50,239 --> 01:40:51,616
Thank you.

1069
01:40:51,949 --> 01:40:53,951
How did the stock offering go?

1070
01:40:54,243 --> 01:40:55,411
Prices soared.

1071
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:56,829
Who was buying?

1072
01:40:57,038 --> 01:40:58,915
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

1073
01:40:59,123 --> 01:41:00,833
It's a bit technical.

1074
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,710
The key thing is...

1075
01:41:02,877 --> 01:41:04,837
...our company's future is secure.

1076
01:41:06,714 --> 01:41:07,715
Great.

1077
01:41:21,437 --> 01:41:23,731
A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.

1078
01:41:29,487 --> 01:41:31,280
What was the plan, Crane?

1079
01:41:31,447 --> 01:41:33,658
How were you gonna get
your toxin into the air?

1080
01:41:34,075 --> 01:41:37,328
Scarecrow. Scarecrow.

1081
01:41:37,537 --> 01:41:39,330
Who were you working for, Crane?

1082
01:41:41,457 --> 01:41:43,626
Oh, it's too late.

1083
01:41:44,252 --> 01:41:46,337
You can't stop it now.

1084
01:41:51,426 --> 01:41:52,969
Here.

1085
01:41:53,136 --> 01:41:55,096
- Happy birthday, Bruce.
- Thank you. Thanks.

1086
01:41:55,305 --> 01:41:58,224
And thank you for that item.

1087
01:41:59,726 --> 01:42:00,935
You're welcome.

1088
01:42:01,144 --> 01:42:03,896
- I know you'll put it to good use.
- I already have.

1089
01:42:04,188 --> 01:42:07,984
How long would it take
to manufacture on a large scale?

1090
01:42:08,568 --> 01:42:09,652
Weeks. Why?

1091
01:42:09,861 --> 01:42:12,989
Somebody's planning to disperse
the toxin using the water supply.

1092
01:42:14,032 --> 01:42:17,118
The water supply won't help you
disperse an inhalant.

1093
01:42:18,036 --> 01:42:19,412
What?

1094
01:42:19,620 --> 01:42:22,123
Unless you have a microwave emitter
powerful enough...

1095
01:42:22,332 --> 01:42:25,168
...to vaporize all the water
in the mains.

1096
01:42:25,626 --> 01:42:28,880
A microwave emitter like the one
Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

1097
01:42:29,339 --> 01:42:30,506
Misplaced?

1098
01:42:30,715 --> 01:42:34,177
Earle just fired me for asking
too many questions about it.

1099
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:39,682
Go back to Wayne Enterprises now
and start making more of that antidote.

1100
01:42:39,891 --> 01:42:42,977
The police are gonna need as much
as they can get their hands on.

1101
01:42:43,186 --> 01:42:45,229
My security clearance
has been revoked.

1102
01:42:45,438 --> 01:42:47,398
That wouldn't stop a man like you,
would it?

1103
01:42:47,857 --> 01:42:49,567
I suppose not.

1104
01:42:51,611 --> 01:42:56,240
- Bruce, there's somebody you must meet.
- Not now, Mrs. Delane.

1105
01:42:56,449 --> 01:42:59,285
Now, am I pronouncing this right...

1106
01:42:59,494 --> 01:43:01,913
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?

1107
01:43:07,585 --> 01:43:09,379
You're not Ra's al Ghul.

1108
01:43:10,922 --> 01:43:12,173
I watched him die.

1109
01:43:12,382 --> 01:43:15,385
But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

1110
01:43:18,179 --> 01:43:20,598
Are his methods supernatural?

1111
01:43:25,186 --> 01:43:29,565
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your true identity, Ra's?

1112
01:43:31,442 --> 01:43:35,905
Surely a man who spends his nights
scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

1113
01:43:36,114 --> 01:43:38,116
...wouldn't begrudge me
dual identities.

1114
01:43:38,992 --> 01:43:40,785
I saved your life.

1115
01:43:40,952 --> 01:43:43,413
I warned you about compassion, Bruce.

1116
01:43:46,624 --> 01:43:48,793
Your quarrel is with me.

1117
01:43:49,711 --> 01:43:52,171
You let these people go.

1118
01:43:52,463 --> 01:43:55,717
You are welcome to explain
the situation to them.

1119
01:43:58,011 --> 01:43:59,637
Everyone.

1120
01:44:00,430 --> 01:44:02,265
Everybody?

1121
01:44:04,892 --> 01:44:06,769
I...

1122
01:44:07,228 --> 01:44:11,441
I want to thank you all for coming here
tonight and drinking all of my booze.

1123
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:15,278
No, really.

1124
01:44:16,321 --> 01:44:19,073
There's a thing about being a Wayne...

1125
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:22,785
...that you're never short of
a few freeloaders, like yourselves...

1126
01:44:22,994 --> 01:44:26,622
...to fill up your mansion with.
So here's to you people. Thank you.

1127
01:44:26,831 --> 01:44:29,417
- That's enough, Bruce.
- I'm not finished.

1128
01:44:29,792 --> 01:44:31,502
To all of you...

1129
01:44:31,669 --> 01:44:36,049
All of you phonies,
all of you two-faced friends...

1130
01:44:36,215 --> 01:44:41,262
...you sycophantic suck-ups
who smile through your teeth at me...

1131
01:44:41,471 --> 01:44:45,016
...please, leave me in peace.

1132
01:44:45,224 --> 01:44:47,810
Please go.

1133
01:44:48,186 --> 01:44:51,564
Stop smiling, it's not a joke.
Please leave.

1134
01:44:51,773 --> 01:44:53,941
The party's over, get out.

1135
01:44:54,150 --> 01:44:57,403
The apple has fallen very far
from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

1136
01:45:02,241 --> 01:45:04,494
He's turning into a jerk.

1137
01:45:10,833 --> 01:45:12,543
Amusing.

1138
01:45:12,877 --> 01:45:16,297
But pointless.
None of these people have long to live.

1139
01:45:16,506 --> 01:45:19,968
Your antics at the asylum
have forced my hand.

1140
01:45:20,176 --> 01:45:22,303
So Crane was working for you.

1141
01:45:22,512 --> 01:45:26,307
His toxin is derived from the organic
compound found in our blue flowers.

1142
01:45:26,683 --> 01:45:28,685
He was able to weaponize it.

1143
01:45:28,893 --> 01:45:30,853
He's not a member of
the League of Shadows?

1144
01:45:31,062 --> 01:45:35,608
Of course not. He thought our plan
was to hold the city to ransom.

1145
01:45:36,317 --> 01:45:40,863
But really, you are gonna release
Crane's poison on the entire city.

1146
01:45:41,030 --> 01:45:45,076
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart
through fear.

1147
01:45:57,922 --> 01:45:59,799
You're gonna destroy millions of lives.

1148
01:46:00,049 --> 01:46:03,386
Only a cynical man would call
what these people have "lives," Wayne.

1149
01:46:03,553 --> 01:46:05,346
Crime. Despair.

1150
01:46:05,555 --> 01:46:07,598
This is not how man
was supposed to live.

1151
01:46:08,266 --> 01:46:11,394
The League of Shadows has been
a check against human corruption...

1152
01:46:11,602 --> 01:46:13,062
...for thousands of years.

1153
01:46:13,271 --> 01:46:16,816
We sacked Rome.
Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

1154
01:46:17,025 --> 01:46:18,401
Burned London to the ground.

1155
01:46:18,609 --> 01:46:21,446
Every time a civilization reaches
the pinnacle of its decadence...

1156
01:46:21,612 --> 01:46:23,573
...we return to restore the balance.

1157
01:46:23,740 --> 01:46:25,283
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1158
01:46:26,617 --> 01:46:29,287
Give me more time.
There are good people here.

1159
01:46:29,495 --> 01:46:31,289
You're defending a city so corrupt...

1160
01:46:31,497 --> 01:46:34,667
...we have infiltrated
every level of its infrastructure.

1161
01:46:45,762 --> 01:46:47,138
Time to play.

1162
01:46:51,309 --> 01:46:53,978
When I found you in that jail,
you were lost.

1163
01:46:54,145 --> 01:46:56,230
But I believed in you.

1164
01:46:56,439 --> 01:47:00,151
I took away your fear,
and I showed you a path.

1165
01:47:00,443 --> 01:47:02,654
You were my greatest student.

1166
01:47:02,987 --> 01:47:06,115
It should be you standing by my side,
saving the world.

1167
01:47:06,949 --> 01:47:09,535
I'll be standing where I belong.

1168
01:47:10,203 --> 01:47:13,289
Between you
and the people of Gotham.

1169
01:47:14,999 --> 01:47:17,585
No one can save Gotham.

1170
01:47:20,963 --> 01:47:25,593
When a forest grows too wild,
a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1171
01:47:26,844 --> 01:47:31,474
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror
as its greatest city destroys itself.

1172
01:47:32,058 --> 01:47:35,311
The movement back to harmony
will be unstoppable this time.

1173
01:47:35,603 --> 01:47:37,772
- You attacked Gotham before?
- Of course.

1174
01:47:38,022 --> 01:47:40,692
Over the ages our weapons
have grown more sophisticated.

1175
01:47:40,858 --> 01:47:43,695
With Gotham we tried a new one.
Economics.

1176
01:47:44,153 --> 01:47:48,825
But we underestimated certain
of Gotham's citizens...

1177
01:47:49,283 --> 01:47:51,452
...such as your parents.

1178
01:47:55,540 --> 01:47:59,002
Gunned down by one of the very people
they were trying to help.

1179
01:47:59,293 --> 01:48:02,046
Create enough hunger
and everyone becomes a criminal.

1180
01:48:02,255 --> 01:48:04,674
Their deaths galvanized the city
into saving itself...

1181
01:48:04,882 --> 01:48:07,552
...and Gotham has limped on
ever since.

1182
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:09,554
We are back to finish the job.

1183
01:48:10,263 --> 01:48:13,516
And this time no misguided idealists
will get in the way.

1184
01:48:13,683 --> 01:48:17,228
Like your father, you lack the courage
to do all that is necessary.

1185
01:48:17,562 --> 01:48:20,398
If someone stands in the way
of true justice...

1186
01:48:20,606 --> 01:48:24,652
...you simply walk up behind them
and stab them in the heart.

1187
01:48:29,699 --> 01:48:31,826
- I am gonna stop you.
- You never did learn...

1188
01:48:32,035 --> 01:48:34,037
...to mind your surroundings.

1189
01:48:36,247 --> 01:48:38,207
Justice is balance.

1190
01:48:38,416 --> 01:48:40,543
You burned my house
and left me for dead.

1191
01:48:43,254 --> 01:48:45,381
Consider us even.

1192
01:49:01,814 --> 01:49:03,524
No one comes out. Make sure.

1193
01:49:13,451 --> 01:49:14,911
They're all gone?

1194
01:49:15,078 --> 01:49:17,830
- How many from maximum security?
- Every one of them.

1195
01:49:17,997 --> 01:49:19,791
Serial killers, rapists.

1196
01:49:19,999 --> 01:49:22,835
Raise the bridges.
We don't want any getting off the island.

1197
01:49:23,002 --> 01:49:24,462
Yeah, I'll raise the bridges...

1198
01:49:24,629 --> 01:49:28,841
...when I get every available unit out here
to catch the homicidal maniacs...

1199
01:49:29,050 --> 01:49:31,886
...that are running loose out there.
- Come on!

1200
01:49:55,118 --> 01:49:57,870
I hope you're not a member
of the fire brigade.

1201
01:50:03,876 --> 01:50:05,962
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!

1202
01:50:10,508 --> 01:50:14,887
What is the point of all those pushups
if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1203
01:50:53,343 --> 01:50:55,386
What have I done, Alfred?

1204
01:50:56,429 --> 01:50:58,348
Everything my family...

1205
01:50:58,556 --> 01:51:00,433
...my father, built...

1206
01:51:02,852 --> 01:51:06,731
The Wayne legacy is more
than bricks and mortar, sir.

1207
01:51:06,939 --> 01:51:09,150
I wanted to save Gotham.

1208
01:51:10,026 --> 01:51:11,861
I failed.

1209
01:51:13,112 --> 01:51:14,364
Why do we fall, sir?

1210
01:51:17,575 --> 01:51:21,037
So that we can learn
to pick ourselves up.

1211
01:51:23,539 --> 01:51:25,667
You still haven't given up on me?

1212
01:51:27,585 --> 01:51:29,045
Never.

1213
01:51:30,129 --> 01:51:31,422
Down!

1214
01:51:31,631 --> 01:51:34,550
Harassment! I see harassment!

1215
01:51:34,717 --> 01:51:36,761
Maybe you'd like to see
some excessive force?

1216
01:51:36,970 --> 01:51:38,846
Madman with a gun.

1217
01:51:40,056 --> 01:51:43,393
With residents furious at the
unprecedented show of police strength...

1218
01:51:43,559 --> 01:51:46,938
...to round up the inmates...
- We're about to raise these bridges.

1219
01:51:47,146 --> 01:51:50,733
Officer, I am a Gotham City
district attorney. Let me pass.

1220
01:51:58,157 --> 01:52:00,410
- Just shut up!
- Hey, Flass, cool it!

1221
01:52:00,618 --> 01:52:01,869
Hold these people back.

1222
01:52:02,078 --> 01:52:05,081
Hey, Gordon.
Somebody here to see you.

1223
01:52:05,248 --> 01:52:07,625
- What are you doing here?
- Our friend sent me with this.

1224
01:52:07,834 --> 01:52:09,293
It counteracts Crane's toxin.

1225
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:10,920
Hopefully you won't need it.

1226
01:52:11,129 --> 01:52:14,257
Not unless he's got some way
of getting that crap into the air.

1227
01:52:15,425 --> 01:52:17,844
All right, last one across.

1228
01:52:18,553 --> 01:52:22,432
People, they want this bridge up
in no more than three minutes!

1229
01:52:22,682 --> 01:52:26,019
Better get you off the island before
they raise the bridges. Patrolman!

1230
01:52:26,686 --> 01:52:27,687
Go!

1231
01:52:54,505 --> 01:52:56,299
I can't find my mom.

1232
01:52:56,674 --> 01:52:58,134
Hey!

1233
01:53:06,559 --> 01:53:08,269
What the hell are you doing?

1234
01:53:09,812 --> 01:53:11,356
Gentlemen...

1235
01:53:11,814 --> 01:53:14,317
...time to spread the word.

1236
01:53:16,069 --> 01:53:17,445
And the word is...

1237
01:53:18,738 --> 01:53:20,448
...panic.

1238
01:53:44,555 --> 01:53:46,182
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.

1239
01:53:47,183 --> 01:53:48,476
Right there.

1240
01:53:48,810 --> 01:53:51,020
That water main
is right under the Narrows.

1241
01:54:07,996 --> 01:54:09,539
It's okay.

1242
01:54:42,405 --> 01:54:43,948
This is Commissioner Loeb.

1243
01:54:44,115 --> 01:54:45,825
Come on, somebody talk to me.

1244
01:54:45,992 --> 01:54:47,452
Come on!

1245
01:55:07,138 --> 01:55:09,140
Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.

1246
01:55:09,474 --> 01:55:10,767
What the hell is going on?

1247
01:55:10,975 --> 01:55:14,395
We need reinforcements.
TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!

1248
01:55:14,604 --> 01:55:18,816
Gordon! All the city's riot police
are on the island with you!

1249
01:55:18,983 --> 01:55:20,985
Well, they're completely incapacitated!

1250
01:55:21,319 --> 01:55:25,281
It's okay, it's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.

1251
01:55:26,157 --> 01:55:27,784
Of course they are!

1252
01:55:27,992 --> 01:55:30,995
- Crane?
- No. Scarecrow.

1253
01:55:32,747 --> 01:55:34,123
Gordon...

1254
01:55:34,332 --> 01:55:36,542
...there's nobody left to send in.

1255
01:55:38,127 --> 01:55:39,837
So I'm on my own?

1256
01:55:43,925 --> 01:55:45,551
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1257
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:48,304
This is just the beginning.
If they hit the whole city...

1258
01:55:48,513 --> 01:55:51,265
...there's nothing to stop Gotham
tearing itself apart.

1259
01:55:51,432 --> 01:55:53,309
- How are they gonna do that?
- The train.

1260
01:55:53,518 --> 01:55:57,313
The monorail follows the water mains to
the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.

1261
01:55:57,522 --> 01:55:59,232
If the machine gets to the station...

1262
01:55:59,399 --> 01:56:02,860
...it'll cause a chain reaction
that'll vaporize the city's water supply.

1263
01:56:03,069 --> 01:56:04,612
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1264
01:56:04,821 --> 01:56:07,991
I'm gonna stop him from loading
that train, but I may need your help.

1265
01:56:08,199 --> 01:56:09,993
- What do you need?
- Can you drive stick?

1266
01:56:16,249 --> 01:56:17,875
There you are!

1267
01:56:18,084 --> 01:56:20,044
There is nothing to fear...

1268
01:56:20,253 --> 01:56:21,963
...but fear itself!

1269
01:56:23,047 --> 01:56:25,341
I am here to help!

1270
01:56:56,581 --> 01:56:58,708
Batman will save us. He'll come.

1271
01:57:03,963 --> 01:57:05,840
- He'll come.
- Don't peek.

1272
01:57:14,515 --> 01:57:17,852
This is Gordon.
Prepare to lower the bridge.

1273
01:57:23,775 --> 01:57:25,860
I told you he'd come.

1274
01:57:30,907 --> 01:57:32,533
Wait.

1275
01:57:33,493 --> 01:57:35,119
You could die.

1276
01:57:35,286 --> 01:57:36,537
At least tell me your name.

1277
01:57:41,959 --> 01:57:44,128
It's not who I am underneath...

1278
01:57:45,129 --> 01:57:49,425
...but what I do that defines me.

1279
01:57:49,801 --> 01:57:51,094
Bruce?

1280
01:58:24,836 --> 01:58:28,131
Well, well. You took my advice
about theatricality a bit literally.

1281
01:58:28,339 --> 01:58:30,800
- It ends here.
- For you and the police, maybe.

1282
01:58:31,009 --> 01:58:33,303
My fight, however,
lies with the rest of Gotham.

1283
01:58:33,511 --> 01:58:36,806
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a city to destroy.

1284
01:58:37,015 --> 01:58:40,685
- I can't beat two of your pawns?
- As you wish.

1285
01:58:53,531 --> 01:58:55,825
GPS online.

1286
01:59:02,707 --> 01:59:04,876
In 100 yards.

1287
01:59:35,782 --> 01:59:37,033
Gentlemen.

1288
02:00:04,477 --> 02:00:06,688
Who the hell authorized this?

1289
02:00:17,281 --> 02:00:19,325
Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.

1290
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:29,210
The pressure's moving along the mains,
blowing the pipes.

1291
02:00:29,419 --> 02:00:30,795
If that pressure reaches us...

1292
02:00:30,962 --> 02:00:33,965
...the water supply right across
the whole city is gonna blow!

1293
02:00:44,434 --> 02:00:47,270
At the next intersection, turn right.

1294
02:01:12,003 --> 02:01:13,463
You will never learn.

1295
02:01:21,012 --> 02:01:22,013
Sorry.

1296
02:01:26,017 --> 02:01:29,020
- Familiar. Don't you have anything new?
- How about this?!

1297
02:01:45,787 --> 02:01:48,039
You have arrived at Wayne Tower.

1298
02:02:01,386 --> 02:02:02,595
Evacuate the building.

1299
02:02:02,845 --> 02:02:05,306
We're on top of the main hub
and it's gonna blow.

1300
02:02:14,232 --> 02:02:16,401
Weapons system activated.

1301
02:02:20,530 --> 02:02:21,531
Nice ride.

1302
02:02:36,796 --> 02:02:37,797
Armed.

1303
02:02:49,767 --> 02:02:51,227
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

1304
02:02:54,022 --> 02:02:55,398
Come on. Come on.

1305
02:03:00,153 --> 02:03:02,196
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.

1306
02:03:02,405 --> 02:03:06,242
That's why you couldn't fight injustice,
that's why you can't stop this train.

1307
02:03:06,451 --> 02:03:08,995
Who said anything about stopping it?

1308
02:03:14,834 --> 02:03:16,377
Yes!

1309
02:03:24,552 --> 02:03:27,930
You never learned
to mind your surroundings!

1310
02:03:35,813 --> 02:03:38,274
Have you finally learned to do
what is necessary?

1311
02:03:38,608 --> 02:03:40,860
I won't kill you...

1312
02:03:45,323 --> 02:03:47,450
...but I don't have to save you.

1313
02:05:02,650 --> 02:05:05,737
- The meeting's already started.
- What meeting?

1314
02:05:09,991 --> 02:05:12,910
Fox, I seem to remember firing you.

1315
02:05:13,411 --> 02:05:14,954
You did.

1316
02:05:15,163 --> 02:05:17,206
I got another job.

1317
02:05:18,082 --> 02:05:19,542
Yours.

1318
02:05:20,001 --> 02:05:21,711
On whose authority?

1319
02:05:22,337 --> 02:05:24,213
Batman may have made
the front page...

1320
02:05:24,464 --> 02:05:27,383
...but Bruce Wayne
got pushed to page eight.

1321
02:05:34,182 --> 02:05:35,183
Bruce Wayne.

1322
02:05:35,391 --> 02:05:39,145
What makes you think you can decide
who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1323
02:05:39,354 --> 02:05:42,106
- The fact that I'm the owner.
- What are you talking about?

1324
02:05:42,357 --> 02:05:44,233
The company went public a week ago.

1325
02:05:44,442 --> 02:05:45,902
And I bought most of the shares.

1326
02:05:46,277 --> 02:05:49,697
Through various charitable foundations
and trusts and so forth.

1327
02:05:49,906 --> 02:05:53,076
Look, it's all a bit technical,
but the important thing...

1328
02:05:53,326 --> 02:05:56,579
...is that my company's future
is secure.

1329
02:05:56,996 --> 02:05:58,373
Right, Mr. Fox?

1330
02:05:58,581 --> 02:06:00,375
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1331
02:06:02,627 --> 02:06:04,170
Didn't you get the memo?

1332
02:06:23,147 --> 02:06:26,317
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel.
- No. No, Bruce...

1333
02:06:26,526 --> 02:06:27,902
...I'm sorry.

1334
02:06:28,778 --> 02:06:31,447
The day that Chill died, I...

1335
02:06:33,324 --> 02:06:34,951
I said terrible things.

1336
02:06:35,451 --> 02:06:37,161
But true things.

1337
02:06:37,829 --> 02:06:39,622
I was a coward with a gun...

1338
02:06:39,831 --> 02:06:43,584
...and justice is about more
than revenge, so thank you.

1339
02:06:44,669 --> 02:06:47,338
I never stopped thinking about you.

1340
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:50,466
About us.

1341
02:06:51,092 --> 02:06:53,052
And when I heard you were back, I...

1342
02:06:53,886 --> 02:06:56,055
I started to hope.

1343
02:07:20,163 --> 02:07:22,832
But then I found out about your mask.

1344
02:07:24,042 --> 02:07:26,878
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1345
02:07:27,503 --> 02:07:29,130
No. This...

1346
02:07:30,340 --> 02:07:32,050
...is your mask.

1347
02:07:34,010 --> 02:07:37,513
Your real face is the one
that criminals now fear.

1348
02:07:38,389 --> 02:07:40,350
The man I loved...

1349
02:07:41,100 --> 02:07:42,560
...the man who vanished...

1350
02:07:43,770 --> 02:07:45,897
...he never came back at all.

1351
02:07:50,401 --> 02:07:53,071
But maybe he's still
out there somewhere.

1352
02:07:55,239 --> 02:07:58,910
Maybe someday,
when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

1353
02:07:59,994 --> 02:08:01,954
...I'll see him again.

1354
02:08:13,007 --> 02:08:15,927
- Proved me wrong, you know.
- About what?

1355
02:08:18,763 --> 02:08:21,182
Your father would be
very proud of you.

1356
02:08:21,432 --> 02:08:23,059
Just like me.

1357
02:08:50,044 --> 02:08:51,921
What will you do?

1358
02:08:53,298 --> 02:08:54,841
Rebuild it.

1359
02:08:55,758 --> 02:08:58,094
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1360
02:09:04,976 --> 02:09:06,185
Just the way it was, sir?

1361
02:09:08,313 --> 02:09:09,522
Yeah, why?

1362
02:09:09,731 --> 02:09:12,567
I thought this might be
a good opportunity for...

1363
02:09:12,734 --> 02:09:15,153
...improving the foundations.

1364
02:09:15,361 --> 02:09:18,281
- In the southeast corner?
- Precisely, sir.

1365
02:09:34,005 --> 02:09:36,841
- Nice.
- I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1366
02:09:37,842 --> 02:09:40,511
- Well, sergeant?
- It's "lieutenant" now.

1367
02:09:40,887 --> 02:09:42,347
You really started something.

1368
02:09:42,555 --> 02:09:44,515
Bent cops running scared.

1369
02:09:44,724 --> 02:09:46,100
Hope on the streets.

1370
02:09:46,392 --> 02:09:49,979
- But?
- The Narrows is lost.

1371
02:09:50,521 --> 02:09:54,359
And we still haven't picked up Crane or
half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1372
02:09:55,068 --> 02:09:56,694
We will.

1373
02:09:56,903 --> 02:09:58,529
We can bring Gotham back.

1374
02:09:58,738 --> 02:10:01,199
- What about escalation?
- Escalation?

1375
02:10:01,407 --> 02:10:05,703
We start carrying semiautomatics,
they buy automatics.

1376
02:10:05,912 --> 02:10:10,208
We start wearing Kevlar,
they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1377
02:10:10,416 --> 02:10:13,670
- And?
- And you're wearing a mask...

1378
02:10:14,128 --> 02:10:16,005
...and jumping off rooftops.

1379
02:10:17,423 --> 02:10:19,425
Now, take this guy.

1380
02:10:19,717 --> 02:10:21,719
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1381
02:10:21,928 --> 02:10:25,181
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1382
02:10:25,431 --> 02:10:27,350
Leaves a calling card.

1383
02:10:33,272 --> 02:10:35,066
I'll look into it.

1384
02:10:38,569 --> 02:10:40,029
I never said thank you.

1385
02:10:45,118 --> 02:10:47,161
And you'll never have to.

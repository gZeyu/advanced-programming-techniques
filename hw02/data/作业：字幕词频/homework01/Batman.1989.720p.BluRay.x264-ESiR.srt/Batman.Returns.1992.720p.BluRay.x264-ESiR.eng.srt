1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,001


2
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,389
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

3
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:13,410


4
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:35,682


5
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:46,299
Penguin sighting! Man or myth?

6
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:49,678
What is he? Today's edition.
Another penguin sighting.

7
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:52,431
Another penguin sighting! Check it out!

8
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:57,187
Penguin man living in Gotham's sewers!
Read all about the latest sighting!

9
00:06:02,109 --> 00:06:04,529
May I have your attention, Gotham City?

10
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:07,908
It is time for tonight's lighting of the tree.

11
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,165
How about that?

12
00:06:30,518 --> 00:06:33,396
Part man, part penguin! All horrifying!

13
00:06:34,147 --> 00:06:36,859
Find out for only 50 cents! Come on!

14
00:06:37,318 --> 00:06:41,406
Read about the possible terror
beneath our feet! Check it out!

15
00:06:41,656 --> 00:06:43,158
Read about it!

16
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:47,955
Missing link between man and bird.

17
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:49,374
My dear boy...

18
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,502
...sometimes it's a diversion
to read such rubbish.

19
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:54,838
Usually, it's a waste of time.

20
00:06:55,005 --> 00:06:58,468
Whatever. Today's issue!
'"The Penguin: Man or myth?'"

21
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,930
The Globe! Right here! 25 cents!

22
00:07:26,543 --> 00:07:28,211
Well, here's hoping.

23
00:07:28,378 --> 00:07:32,091
With luck, Gotham will have its first
merry Christmas in years.

24
00:07:32,258 --> 00:07:34,802
I feel almost vulgar at Yuletide...

25
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:37,430
...mentioning the new power plant.

26
00:07:37,597 --> 00:07:41,393
But if we're to break ground
when we must, I'll need permits...

27
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:45,273
...variances, tax incentives.
That sort of pesky nonsense.

28
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,193
Power plant?

29
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:52,907
Studies show we've enough power to get
us into the middle of the next century.

30
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:57,538
Your analysts foresee growth
at 1 % per annum. That's a mild swelling.

31
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,458
Imagine...

32
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,251
...a Gotham City...

33
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:06,381
...of the future, lit up like a blanket
of stars...

34
00:08:06,924 --> 00:08:09,218
...but blinking on and off...

35
00:08:09,593 --> 00:08:11,804
...embarrassingly low on juice.

36
00:08:12,055 --> 00:08:13,390
Frankly...

37
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:16,059
...I cringe, Mr. Mayor.

38
00:08:17,227 --> 00:08:20,064
Sorry, any plans must go
to the usual committees...

39
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:22,150
...through the usual channels.

40
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:24,069
I have a suggestion.

41
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:33,080
Well...

42
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:36,917
...actually, really, just more like a question.

43
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:42,549
I'm afraid we haven't
properly housebroken Ms. Kyle.

44
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:45,386
In the plus column, though...

45
00:08:45,511 --> 00:08:47,305
...she makes great coffee.

46
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:56,858
Dad.

47
00:08:57,859 --> 00:09:01,530
Mr. Mayor. Time to go down
and bring joy to the masses.

48
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:13,961
'"Actually, more of a question.'"

49
00:09:14,045 --> 00:09:15,880
You stupid corn dog.

50
00:09:17,132 --> 00:09:18,884
Corn dog, corn dog.

51
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:50,046
I have enough signatures
from Shreck employees to warrant a recall.

52
00:09:50,212 --> 00:09:52,757
That's not a threat, just simple numbers.

53
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:56,970
Maybe. But you sure as hell
don't have an issue or a candidate.

54
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,391
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

55
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,563
From those of us at City Hall
to each and every one of you...

56
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,106
...happy holidays.

57
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:11,404
We have with us a man who needs
no introduction, he's given us so much.

58
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:15,701
Please welcome Gotham's
own Santa Claus, Max Shreck.

59
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,147
Pick up those contracts for Personnel and...

60
00:10:40,313 --> 00:10:43,108
...pick up the dry cleaning
and paper towels....

61
00:10:45,987 --> 00:10:46,905
Darn!

62
00:10:52,828 --> 00:10:54,330
I forgot my speech.

63
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:57,167
Remind me to take it out
on what's-her-name.

64
00:11:01,505 --> 00:11:02,965
Santa Claus?

65
00:11:03,174 --> 00:11:04,509
Afraid not.

66
00:11:05,677 --> 00:11:08,221
I'm just a poor schmo. Got lucky.

67
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:11,142
Sue me...

68
00:11:11,684 --> 00:11:13,728
...if I want to give some back.

69
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,652
I only wish I could hand out more
than just...

70
00:11:19,818 --> 00:11:21,487
...expensive baubles.

71
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:25,450
I wish I could hand out world peace...

72
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:28,454
...and unconditional love...

73
00:11:29,997 --> 00:11:32,041
...wrapped in a big bow.

74
00:11:33,668 --> 00:11:35,337
Oh, but you can.

75
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,589
Oh, but you will.

76
00:11:44,514 --> 00:11:46,058
Merry Christmas.

77
00:11:59,532 --> 00:12:00,950
Great idea.

78
00:12:01,576 --> 00:12:02,702
Not mine.

79
00:12:55,306 --> 00:12:57,684
What are you waiting for? The signal!

80
00:13:29,013 --> 00:13:32,183
We want the big guy!
The guy who runs the show!

81
00:13:34,937 --> 00:13:36,105
What do you want?

82
00:13:36,188 --> 00:13:37,440
Not you!

83
00:13:38,357 --> 00:13:39,358
Shreck!

84
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:41,778
You'll have to go through me.

85
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,616
Dad, go! Save yourself!

86
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:46,867
Dad, go!

87
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:42,421
Shut up!

88
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:53,267
Take one step closer, Mr. Manbat, and I'll--

89
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,359
You missed.

90
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,959
The Batman.

91
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,712
Or is it just '"Batman'"?

92
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:23,719
Your choice, of course.

93
00:16:26,014 --> 00:16:27,516
Well, that was...

94
00:16:27,849 --> 00:16:29,184
...very brief.

95
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:31,854
Just like all the men in my life.

96
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:34,023
What men?

97
00:16:34,816 --> 00:16:35,859
Well...

98
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,156
...then again, there's you.
But you need therapy.

99
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,728
Thanks for saving the day, Batman.
The Circus Gang is back.

100
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:07,062
We'll see.

101
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:10,650
They almost made off with our mover
and shaker, Max Shreck.

102
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:13,487
Where is that insufferable son of a bitch?

103
00:18:30,828 --> 00:18:33,790
I believe the word you're looking for is....

104
00:18:44,928 --> 00:18:47,723
Actually, this is all just a bad dream.

105
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:50,685
You're at home in bed...

106
00:18:50,852 --> 00:18:53,772
...heavily sedated, resting comfortably...

107
00:18:54,356 --> 00:18:58,110
...dying from the carcinogens
you've personally spewed...

108
00:18:59,195 --> 00:19:01,698
...in a lifetime of profiteering.

109
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:03,450
Tragic irony...

110
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:05,452
...or poetic justice?

111
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:07,079
You tell me.

112
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:10,041
My God, it's true.

113
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,544
Penguin Man of the sewer.

114
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,927
Odd as it may seem, Max...

115
00:19:19,886 --> 00:19:22,639
...you and I have something in common:

116
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:27,312
We're both perceived as monsters.

117
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,194
But somehow...

118
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,240
...you're a well-respected monster...

119
00:19:37,574 --> 00:19:39,576
...and I am, to date...

120
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:41,829
...not!

121
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,541
Frankly, I feel that's a bum rap.
I'm a businessman.

122
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:47,294
Tough, yes.

123
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,881
Shrewd, okay. But that does not
make me a monster.

124
00:19:51,632 --> 00:19:53,968
Don't embarrass yourself, Max!

125
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,137
I know all about you.

126
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,557
What you hide, I discover.

127
00:19:59,642 --> 00:20:01,769
What you put in your toilet...

128
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:04,814
...I place on my mantle. Get the picture?

129
00:20:05,482 --> 00:20:07,776
Is that supposed to hypnotize me?

130
00:20:07,985 --> 00:20:10,529
No, just give you a splitting headache.

131
00:20:11,447 --> 00:20:12,865
It's not working.

132
00:20:13,992 --> 00:20:15,702
Oh, you big baby!

133
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:17,621
Just blanks.

134
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,958
Would I go through all this trouble
just to kill you?

135
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:22,418
No, Max.

136
00:20:22,836 --> 00:20:25,339
I have an entirely other purpose.

137
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:28,092
I'm ready, Max.

138
00:20:28,634 --> 00:20:30,929
I've been down here too long.

139
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:33,598
It's time for me to ascend...

140
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:36,018
...to re-emerge...

141
00:20:37,686 --> 00:20:39,230
...with your help...

142
00:20:39,355 --> 00:20:40,982
...your know-how...

143
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:42,692
...your savvy.

144
00:20:43,527 --> 00:20:46,197
I wasn't born in the sewer, you know.

145
00:20:47,323 --> 00:20:48,866
I come from...

146
00:20:49,534 --> 00:20:50,869
...Iike you.

147
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:53,705
And, like you, I want some respect!

148
00:20:54,498 --> 00:20:57,043
A recognition of my basic humanity.

149
00:20:57,877 --> 00:20:59,337
But most of all...

150
00:21:00,338 --> 00:21:02,716
...I want to find out who I am...

151
00:21:02,883 --> 00:21:04,885
...by finding my parents...

152
00:21:05,052 --> 00:21:07,180
...Iearning my human name.

153
00:21:08,056 --> 00:21:11,977
Simple stuff that the good people
of Gotham take for granted!

154
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:14,689
And...

155
00:21:14,855 --> 00:21:17,609
...exactly why am I going to help you?

156
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:20,571
Well....

157
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,703
Let's start.

158
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:37,257
Let's see what we have in here.

159
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:43,514
A batch of toxic waste...

160
00:21:44,724 --> 00:21:47,227
...from your clean textile plant!

161
00:21:48,103 --> 00:21:51,357
There's a whole lagoon of this crud
in the back!

162
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:53,735
It could have come from anywhere.

163
00:21:54,152 --> 00:21:58,657
What about the documents that prove you
own half of the firetraps in Gotham City?

164
00:21:58,908 --> 00:22:01,077
If there were such documents...

165
00:22:01,244 --> 00:22:03,037
...that's not an admission...

166
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,165
...they would've been shredded.

167
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,418
Good idea.

168
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:12,716
A lot of tape and a little patience
make all the difference.

169
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,054
By the way...

170
00:22:17,555 --> 00:22:19,974
...how's Fred Atkins, your old partner?

171
00:22:20,224 --> 00:22:21,392
Fred?

172
00:22:22,477 --> 00:22:24,146
Fred's actually....

173
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,858
I believe he's on an extended vacation.
He's good.

174
00:22:31,404 --> 00:22:32,572
Good.

175
00:22:34,575 --> 00:22:37,453
Hiya, Max. Remember me?
I'm Fred's hand!

176
00:22:38,746 --> 00:22:41,291
Want to greet any other body parts?

177
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,335
Remember, Max...

178
00:22:43,585 --> 00:22:45,880
...you flush it, I flaunt it.

179
00:22:47,507 --> 00:22:49,926
You know what, Mr. Penguin, sir?

180
00:22:55,266 --> 00:22:56,851
I think, perhaps...

181
00:22:57,018 --> 00:23:00,439
...I could help orchestrate
a '"Welcome Home'" scenario for you.

182
00:23:00,522 --> 00:23:03,985
Once we're both back home,
perhaps we could help each other.

183
00:23:05,194 --> 00:23:07,739
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.

184
00:23:15,623 --> 00:23:17,292
Honey, I'm home!

185
00:23:19,461 --> 00:23:21,839
Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.

186
00:23:32,393 --> 00:23:33,811
Miss Kitty.

187
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:38,776
Back from more sexual escapades
you refuse to share?

188
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,989
Not that I'd ever pry.

189
00:23:44,908 --> 00:23:46,326
Drink your dinner.

190
00:23:52,917 --> 00:23:54,085
What?

191
00:23:55,587 --> 00:23:57,923
How can anyone be so pathetic?

192
00:23:59,425 --> 00:24:02,512
Yes, to you I seem pathetic,
but I'm a working girl.

193
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:06,517
Must pay the rent. Maybe if you
chipped in instead of stepping out.

194
00:24:08,352 --> 00:24:11,856
Selina, dear, it's your mother.
Just calling to say hello.

195
00:24:12,023 --> 00:24:13,358
Yeah, but....

196
00:24:13,525 --> 00:24:16,862
But I'm disappointed you're not
coming home for Christmas.

197
00:24:16,946 --> 00:24:20,450
I want to discuss why you insist
on languishing in Gotham City...

198
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:22,536
...as some lowly secretary.

199
00:24:22,703 --> 00:24:24,371
Lowly assistant.

200
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:29,461
Selina, about that Christmas getaway
we planned....

201
00:24:30,545 --> 00:24:35,384
I'll be going alone. Dr. Shaw says I need
to be my own person, not an appendage.

202
00:24:39,806 --> 00:24:41,391
Some appendage!

203
00:24:46,898 --> 00:24:50,652
The party never stops
on Selina Kyle's answering machine.

204
00:24:52,738 --> 00:24:55,825
I should've let him win
that last racquetball game.

205
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,160
Hello...

206
00:24:57,327 --> 00:24:58,829
...Selina Kyle.

207
00:24:58,996 --> 00:25:02,416
We're calling to tell you about exciting,
new Gotham Lady perfume.

208
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:07,088
It makes women feel like women...
and the men have no complaints either.

209
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:14,013
This is yourself reminding you to come
all the way back to the office...

210
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:19,019
-...if you forgot the Bruce Wayne file....
-You stupid corn dog!

211
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:40,127
Working late?

212
00:25:42,505 --> 00:25:46,593
I'm just boning up for your Bruce Wayne
meeting in the morning.

213
00:25:47,303 --> 00:25:50,807
I pulled all the files
on the proposed power plant...

214
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:57,565
...and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment.
I even opened the protected files--

215
00:25:58,816 --> 00:26:00,193
How industrious!

216
00:26:01,862 --> 00:26:04,198
How did you open the protected files?

217
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:06,367
May I ask?

218
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:16,254
I figured your password was '"Geraldo,'"
your Chihuahua, and it was.

219
00:26:24,013 --> 00:26:28,309
This is all very interesting,
though a bit on the technical side...

220
00:26:30,562 --> 00:26:34,191
...about how the power plant
is a power plant in name only...

221
00:26:34,525 --> 00:26:37,862
...since, in fact, it's going to be a big,
giant...

222
00:26:38,405 --> 00:26:40,532
...big, giant...capacitor.

223
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:47,207
And, instead of generating power,
it'll be sucking power from...

224
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:49,543
...Gotham City...

225
00:26:50,711 --> 00:26:52,254
...and storing it...

226
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,549
...stockpiling it...

227
00:26:54,924 --> 00:26:57,886
...which is a very novel approach, I'd say.

228
00:27:00,765 --> 00:27:02,391
Who'd you say this to?

229
00:27:06,062 --> 00:27:07,064
Nobody.

230
00:27:13,404 --> 00:27:15,907
What did curiosity do to the cat?

231
00:27:18,118 --> 00:27:19,537
I'm no cat.

232
00:27:20,454 --> 00:27:22,290
I'm just an assistant.

233
00:27:22,749 --> 00:27:23,917
A secretary.

234
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:26,295
And a very good one.

235
00:27:27,129 --> 00:27:28,381
Too good?

236
00:27:29,632 --> 00:27:30,717
Listen...

237
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,969
...it's our secret. Honest.

238
00:27:33,261 --> 00:27:36,098
How can you be so mean
to someone so meaningless?

239
00:27:36,265 --> 00:27:37,767
This power plant...

240
00:27:38,267 --> 00:27:40,979
...is my legacy. It's what I leave behind.

241
00:27:41,146 --> 00:27:42,397
For Chip.

242
00:27:42,773 --> 00:27:44,900
Nothing must prevent that.

243
00:27:48,446 --> 00:27:52,367
Go ahead. Intimidate me.
Bully me, if it makes you feel big.

244
00:27:52,826 --> 00:27:54,828
It's not like you can kill me!

245
00:27:55,246 --> 00:27:57,623
Actually, it's a lot like that.

246
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,273
For a second, you really frightened me.

247
00:28:28,952 --> 00:28:30,120
Really?

248
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:47,170
Honey, I'm home!

249
00:29:50,423 --> 00:29:52,509
Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.

250
00:30:28,468 --> 00:30:31,222
Selina, this is your mother. Call me.

251
00:30:32,473 --> 00:30:36,395
Selina, this is your mother.
Why haven't you called me back?

252
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,814
Hello, Selina Kyle.

253
00:30:39,648 --> 00:30:43,111
We're just calling to make sure
you've tried Gotham Lady perfume.

254
00:30:43,194 --> 00:30:47,449
One whiff of this and your boss
will ask you to stay after work...

255
00:30:47,658 --> 00:30:50,369
...for a candlelight staff meeting for two.

256
00:30:50,536 --> 00:30:54,541
Gotham Lady perfume.
Exclusively at Shreck's department store.

257
00:33:38,902 --> 00:33:42,198
I don't know about you,
Miss Kitty, but I feel...

258
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,784
...so much yummier.

259
00:34:03,431 --> 00:34:05,016
Ladies and gentlemen:

260
00:34:06,852 --> 00:34:11,774
I stand before you again to denounce
the urban chaos we live with in our city.

261
00:34:13,026 --> 00:34:14,444
It's got to stop.

262
00:34:14,611 --> 00:34:17,656
It's going to stop!
Our community is coming apart...

263
00:34:17,906 --> 00:34:21,202
...in a season when
it should be coming together.

264
00:34:21,285 --> 00:34:24,873
I don't care what the cynics may say.
This is the Christmas season...

265
00:34:24,956 --> 00:34:26,625
...and should be a healing time.

266
00:34:26,709 --> 00:34:29,253
I say that not only as an official...

267
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:32,299
...but as a husband and a father.

268
00:34:32,716 --> 00:34:35,219
Last night's violence won't happen again.

269
00:34:38,556 --> 00:34:41,643
I'm not good at speeches,
so I'll just say, "'Thanks. "'

270
00:34:50,403 --> 00:34:52,698
It's the hideous Penguin Man.

271
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,868
Take the baby. Just don't hurt me, please!

272
00:35:48,806 --> 00:35:52,894
This was the remarkable scene
only minutes ago in Gotham Plaza.

273
00:35:53,061 --> 00:35:56,565
The mysterious Penguin saving the life
of the mayor's baby...

274
00:35:56,732 --> 00:36:00,486
-...and announcing his presence.
-All I want in return...

275
00:36:01,362 --> 00:36:02,989
...is a chance...

276
00:36:03,323 --> 00:36:05,450
...to find my mom and dad.

277
00:36:07,202 --> 00:36:09,831
A chance to find out who they are...

278
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,500
...and thusly...

279
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:14,294
...who I am.

280
00:36:15,045 --> 00:36:16,380
And then...

281
00:36:16,672 --> 00:36:18,549
...with my parents...

282
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:21,010
...try to understand...why.

283
00:36:22,554 --> 00:36:26,058
Why they did what I guess
they felt they had to do...

284
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,896
...to a child...

285
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,190
...who was born...

286
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:37,154
...a little different.

287
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:40,158
A child...

288
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,245
...who spent his first Christmas...

289
00:36:44,205 --> 00:36:46,040
...and many since...

290
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:48,918
...in a sewer.

291
00:36:49,085 --> 00:36:51,338
Mr. Wayne? Something wrong?

292
00:36:54,926 --> 00:36:56,094
His parents.

293
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,597
This scene, direct from Gotham Plaza.

294
00:37:00,057 --> 00:37:01,767
I hope he finds them.

295
00:37:02,768 --> 00:37:06,689
Here he is, standing alongside
Gotham's leading citizen, Max Shreck.

296
00:37:06,898 --> 00:37:09,776
How about a statement?
People want to know.

297
00:37:20,623 --> 00:37:23,793
-Penguin's not to be disturbed!
-It's a public place!

298
00:37:23,918 --> 00:37:26,463
-Walk. Now. Move.
-Freedom of the press!

299
00:37:26,546 --> 00:37:28,090
Wait a minute.

300
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:32,553
What about the freedom
to rediscover your roots...

301
00:37:33,054 --> 00:37:35,056
...with dignity and privacy?

302
00:37:35,223 --> 00:37:37,559
Is the Penguin a personal friend?

303
00:37:37,726 --> 00:37:41,397
He's a personal friend of the whole city,
so have a heart.

304
00:37:41,647 --> 00:37:44,442
Give the Constitution a rest.
It's Christmas.

305
00:38:23,947 --> 00:38:27,785
'"Red Triangle Circus put on
a swell show with fierce lions.

306
00:38:31,999 --> 00:38:34,376

00:38:36,629 --> 00:38:37,714
Thanks.

309
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,053
It's cold!

310
00:38:43,137 --> 00:38:44,555
It's vichyssoise.

311
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,475
It's supposed to be cold.

312
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,316
'"Circus is back with a freak show,

00:39:01,242 --> 00:39:03,786
Why are you determined to prove...

317
00:39:04,037 --> 00:39:06,915
...that this Penguin is not what he seems?

318
00:39:07,332 --> 00:39:10,419

Why're you still out?

328
00:39:56,682 --> 00:40:00,603
Are you concerned about that strange,
heroic Penguin person?

329
00:40:02,314 --> 00:40:04,692
I think he knows who his parents are.

330
00:40:06,527 --> 00:40:08,321
There's something else.

331
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:05,835
Mr. Penguin....

332
00:42:05,918 --> 00:42:08,546
A penguin is a bird that cannot fly!

333
00:42:10,257 --> 00:42:11,675
I am a man!

334
00:42:12,843 --> 00:42:14,387
I have a name!

335
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:20,060
Oswald Cobblepot!

336
00:42:21,937 --> 00:42:24,816
You'll never be able to settle with them?

337
00:42:28,278 --> 00:42:29,446
True.

338
00:42:30,531 --> 00:42:32,783
I was their "Number-One"" son...

339
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:35,662
...and they treated me like number two.

340
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:39,041
But it's human nature to fear...

341
00:42:40,543 --> 00:42:41,961
...the unusual.

342
00:42:42,962 --> 00:42:44,339
Perhaps...

343
00:42:44,798 --> 00:42:46,341
...when I held my...

344
00:42:46,466 --> 00:42:48,469
...Tiffany baby rattle...

345
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,556
...with a shiny flipper...

346
00:42:51,973 --> 00:42:54,517
...instead of five chubby digits...

347
00:42:56,061 --> 00:42:57,730
...they freaked.

348
00:43:01,484 --> 00:43:03,278
But I forgive them.

349
00:43:04,988 --> 00:43:07,992
'"Penguin forgives parents!
'I'm at peace with myself and the world!

350
00:43:08,075 --> 00:43:10,620
'"'Don't need hands as long
as you got heart.

351
00:43:10,787 --> 00:43:13,999
'"'My heart is filled with love.
I feel five feet tall.""

352
00:43:14,082 --> 00:43:18,004
-He's like a frog that became a prince.
-No, he's more like a penguin.

353
00:43:23,677 --> 00:43:26,013
Now, now, pretty little thing.

354
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:27,974
Nice and easy.

355
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:37,026
I love a big, strong man who's not afraid
to show it with someone half his size.

356
00:43:39,487 --> 00:43:41,823
Be gentle, it's my first time.

357
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,500
Tic-tac-toe.

358
00:43:55,965 --> 00:43:58,218
You make it easy, don't you?

359
00:43:58,718 --> 00:44:01,472
Always waiting for some Batman
to save you.

360
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,019
I am Catwoman...

361
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:08,814
...hear me roar.

362
00:44:23,164 --> 00:44:27,252
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant
is using her vacation time.

363
00:44:27,377 --> 00:44:32,175
Good time. Everyone but the bandits'll
be slacking off till after the New Year.

364
00:44:32,759 --> 00:44:34,928
I'm not sure I like the inference.

365
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:36,930
I didn't realize I made one.

366
00:44:41,686 --> 00:44:45,774
I'm pushing this power plant now
because it'll cost more later.

367
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:48,611
A million saved is a million earned.

368
00:44:49,403 --> 00:44:52,198
I commissioned this report.
Take a look at it.

369
00:44:54,618 --> 00:44:58,289
Gotham City has a power surplus.
I'm sure you know that.

370
00:44:58,873 --> 00:45:00,458
My question is:

371
00:45:01,376 --> 00:45:02,544
What's your angle?

372
00:45:02,627 --> 00:45:05,255
'"Power surplus?'" Bruce, shame on you!

373
00:45:06,131 --> 00:45:09,427
No such thing. One can never have
too much power.

374
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:12,806
If my life has a meaning,
that's the meaning.

375
00:45:14,683 --> 00:45:18,771
I'll fight you. I've already spoken
to the mayor and we agree.

376
00:45:18,938 --> 00:45:20,440
Mayors come and go.

377
00:45:20,649 --> 00:45:22,526
Blue bloods tire easily.

378
00:45:22,818 --> 00:45:25,321
Can you go 15 rounds
with Muhammad Shreck?

379
00:45:25,529 --> 00:45:27,532
I guess we'll find out.

380
00:45:27,824 --> 00:45:30,869
Of course, I don't have a crime boss
like Cobblepot in my corner.

381
00:45:30,952 --> 00:45:33,330
'"Crime boss?'" Shows what you know...

382
00:45:33,455 --> 00:45:36,292
...'"Mr. To-The-Manor-Born-
With-A-Silver-Spoon.'"

383
00:45:36,376 --> 00:45:38,670
Oswald is Gotham's new golden boy.

384
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,591
If his parents hadn't 86'ed him,
you'd have been bunkies at prep school.

385
00:45:42,675 --> 00:45:46,721
He controls the Red Triangle Gang.
I can't prove it yet, but we both--

386
00:45:46,888 --> 00:45:49,558
I'll not stand for mud-slinging here.

387
00:45:49,725 --> 00:45:53,104
If my assistant was here,
she'd have already escorted you out--

388
00:45:53,187 --> 00:45:54,731
Anywhere he wants.

389
00:45:54,981 --> 00:45:57,526
Preferably some nightspot grotto...

390
00:45:58,902 --> 00:45:59,903
...or...

391
00:46:00,362 --> 00:46:02,198
...secluded hideaway.

392
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,577
Nice suit.

393
00:46:07,704 --> 00:46:16,089
That's my name, don't wear it out
or I'll make you buy me a new one.

394
00:46:20,386 --> 00:46:22,055
This is Bruce...

395
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:23,515
...Wayne.

396
00:46:24,307 --> 00:46:25,434
We've met.

397
00:46:25,934 --> 00:46:26,935
Have we?

398
00:46:27,102 --> 00:46:30,273
No, I'm sorry. I mistook me
for somebody else.

399
00:46:31,774 --> 00:46:33,485
You mean, '"mistook me.'"

400
00:46:34,236 --> 00:46:36,238
Isn't that what I said?

401
00:46:36,905 --> 00:46:38,532
I don't think so.

402
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:41,160
What happened?

403
00:46:42,412 --> 00:46:45,374
Did you hurt yourself...on that ski slope?

404
00:46:46,917 --> 00:46:50,255
Is that why you cut short your vacation?
Came back?

405
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:55,010
It's a blur.

406
00:46:56,470 --> 00:47:01,059
Not complete amnesia. I remember
Sister Mary Margaret puking in church...

407
00:47:01,977 --> 00:47:04,480
...and Betsy saying
it was morning sickness.

408
00:47:04,563 --> 00:47:07,734
And the time I forgot to wear
my underpants to school...

409
00:47:07,817 --> 00:47:11,655
...and the name of the boy who noticed
was Ricky Friedburg.

410
00:47:12,656 --> 00:47:14,200
He's dead now.

411
00:47:14,575 --> 00:47:16,077
But last night...

412
00:47:16,285 --> 00:47:17,996
...complete blur.

413
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:21,708
Couldn't you just die?

414
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:27,173
Please...

415
00:47:28,341 --> 00:47:29,968
...show out Mr. Wayne.

416
00:47:30,302 --> 00:47:31,679
With pleasure.

417
00:47:34,181 --> 00:47:36,059
Your coat, Mr. Wayne.

418
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,204
You don't seem like the type
who does business with Shreck.

419
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,041
No. You don't seem like the type
to take orders from him.

420
00:47:56,124 --> 00:47:57,542
Well, that's a...

421
00:47:57,793 --> 00:47:59,336
...Iong story.

422
00:48:00,129 --> 00:48:02,256
I could free up some time.

423
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,053
-I'm listed.
-I'm tempted.

424
00:48:06,303 --> 00:48:07,513
I'm working.

425
00:48:08,806 --> 00:48:10,057
I'm leaving.

426
00:48:10,558 --> 00:48:12,560
You buy that blurry business?

427
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:13,812
Women.

428
00:48:14,229 --> 00:48:16,106
Nothing surprises me...

429
00:48:16,648 --> 00:48:18,484
...except your late mother.

430
00:48:19,068 --> 00:48:21,905
Who'd have thought Selina
had a brain to damage?

431
00:48:22,071 --> 00:48:23,532
Bottom line?

432
00:48:23,907 --> 00:48:27,912
She tries to blackmail me,
I'll drop her out of a higher window.

433
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,247
Meantime...

434
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:31,708
...I've got badder fish to fry.

435
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,598
Oswald...

436
00:48:45,182 --> 00:48:46,517
...it's Max.

437
00:48:59,866 --> 00:49:01,285
You're home?

438
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:10,045
How've you been?

439
00:49:11,714 --> 00:49:13,591
Your extended family?

440
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:15,677
Good to have a family.

441
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:19,640
I'd rather not be disturbed now.

442
00:49:19,973 --> 00:49:22,893
Come on downstairs, Oswald.
I have a surprise.

443
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,063
I don't like surprises.

444
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:43,084
Come on.

445
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:57,351
Don't peek.

446
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,938
You'll spoil it.

447
00:50:24,299 --> 00:50:27,470
Adulation is a cross to bear.
God knows I know.

448
00:50:28,638 --> 00:50:32,351
But someone's got to supplant our
standing in the way of progress, Mayor.

449
00:50:32,434 --> 00:50:35,980
And don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot,
you've got the magic.

450
00:50:36,147 --> 00:50:39,651
Your charisma's bigger than both of us.
Come on down.

451
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,030
Mayor?

452
00:50:44,156 --> 00:50:45,366
Mayor.

453
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:50,580
Elections happen in November.
It's late December.

454
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:52,082
Don't worry.

455
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:55,837
I want you to meet Jen and Josh,
my image consultants.

456
00:50:57,422 --> 00:50:58,590
Here.

457
00:50:58,757 --> 00:51:00,759
Reclaim your birthright.

458
00:51:03,387 --> 00:51:04,639
I'm Jen.

459
00:51:08,226 --> 00:51:12,732
Okay, let's see. What I'd like to do first
is put these gloves on you.

460
00:51:13,065 --> 00:51:16,069
Our research tells us
that voters like fingers.

461
00:51:16,236 --> 00:51:18,780
So if we were to just lose this....

462
00:51:20,407 --> 00:51:22,368
We'll do it another time.

463
00:51:24,078 --> 00:51:27,499
Not a lot of reflective surfaces
in the sewer, huh?

464
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,848
Still, it could be worse.

465
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,977
My nose could be gushing blood.

466
00:51:47,731 --> 00:51:49,817
What do you mean by that?

467
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:56,825
Everybody, back to work!

468
00:51:57,618 --> 00:51:59,120
Let's make...

469
00:51:59,787 --> 00:52:01,206
...a mayor!

470
00:52:06,796 --> 00:52:09,799
You're right, we missed
the regular election...

471
00:52:09,966 --> 00:52:12,719
...but elected officials can be recalled,
impeached...

472
00:52:12,803 --> 00:52:15,472
...given the boot. Look at Nixon, Agnew.

473
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:17,183
Then think of you...

474
00:52:17,308 --> 00:52:20,061
...Oswald Cobblepot, filling the void.

475
00:52:20,812 --> 00:52:22,606
I'd like to fill her void.

476
00:52:25,151 --> 00:52:29,406
We'll need signatures to overturn
the ballot. I can supply those.

477
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:33,911
-Teach her my French flipper trick.
-We need one more thing.

478
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:37,707
A platform?

479
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:43,589
Stop global warming. Start global cooling.
Make the world an icebox.

480
00:52:44,006 --> 00:52:48,303
I like it. But to get the mayor recalled,
we must have a catalyst.

481
00:52:48,845 --> 00:52:51,181
'"You're doing great, Mayor Cobblepot.'"

482
00:52:51,807 --> 00:52:54,602
'"Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot.'"

483
00:52:55,311 --> 00:52:58,065
'"l need you, Oswald. I need you now! '"

484
00:52:59,983 --> 00:53:02,987
'"That's the biggest parasol I've ever seen.'"

485
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:08,744
Soon an incident like the Gulf of Tonkin,
or the Reichstag fire....

486
00:53:16,211 --> 00:53:18,714
You want my old friends up there...

487
00:53:18,881 --> 00:53:21,551
...to drive the mayor into a foaming frenzy?

488
00:53:21,717 --> 00:53:23,595
-Exactly.
-Sounds fun.

489
00:53:24,387 --> 00:53:25,472
But...

490
00:53:26,306 --> 00:53:28,934
...I mustn't get sidetracked, Maxie.

491
00:53:29,393 --> 00:53:31,562
I have my own things to tend to.

492
00:53:31,896 --> 00:53:35,400
'"Sidetracked?'" This is your chance
to fulfill your destiny...

493
00:53:35,567 --> 00:53:38,112
...that your parents carelessly discarded.

494
00:53:42,075 --> 00:53:44,161
Reclaim my birthright, you mean?

495
00:53:44,328 --> 00:53:47,331
Imagine, as mayor,
you have the ear of the media...

496
00:53:47,581 --> 00:53:50,460
...access to the captains of industry...

497
00:53:51,002 --> 00:53:52,921
...unlimited poontang.

498
00:53:56,509 --> 00:53:58,928
You drive a hard bargain, Maxie.

499
00:54:00,263 --> 00:54:02,099
All right, I'll be mayor.

500
00:54:06,103 --> 00:54:07,814
Burn, baby, burn!

501
00:56:50,089 --> 00:56:52,175
-Who is she?
-What is she?

502
00:56:52,592 --> 00:56:55,554
I don't know whether to open fire
or fall in love.

503
00:56:56,263 --> 00:56:57,765
You poor guys.

504
00:56:57,932 --> 00:57:01,227
Always confusing your pistols
with your privates.

505
00:57:03,563 --> 00:57:06,316
Don't hurt us. Our take-home's
less than $300.

506
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,444
You're overpaid. Hit the road.

507
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,634
Go ahead and hit me.

508
00:58:07,013 --> 00:58:08,724
Admiring your handiwork?

509
00:58:10,976 --> 00:58:12,979
Touring the riot scene.

510
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,025
Gravely assessing the devastation.

511
00:58:19,194 --> 00:58:21,197
'"Upstanding-Mayor'" stuff.

512
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:26,995
You're not the mayor.

513
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:30,416
Things change.

514
00:58:32,418 --> 00:58:33,837
What do you want?

515
00:58:34,713 --> 00:58:36,548
The direct approach.

516
00:58:36,882 --> 00:58:39,427
I admire that in a man with a mask.

517
00:58:44,516 --> 00:58:47,227
You don't really think you'll win, do you?

518
00:58:50,064 --> 00:58:51,608
Things change.

519
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:19,057
I saw her first. Got to fly.

520
01:00:08,574 --> 01:00:10,826
How could you? I'm a woman!

521
01:00:11,577 --> 01:00:12,829
I'm sorry.

522
01:00:26,845 --> 01:00:30,767
As I was saying, I'm a woman
and can't be taken for granted.

523
01:00:32,435 --> 01:00:34,688
Life's a bitch, now so am l.

524
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:52,876
Who are you?

525
01:00:53,543 --> 01:00:55,504
Who's the man behind the bat?

526
01:00:57,548 --> 01:00:59,634
Maybe you can help me find...

527
01:01:00,135 --> 01:01:01,553
...the woman...

528
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,806
...behind the cat.

529
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,353
No, that's not you.

530
01:01:11,982 --> 01:01:13,317
There you are.

531
01:01:29,336 --> 01:01:31,255
Saved by Kitty Litter.

532
01:01:35,259 --> 01:01:36,511
Bastard!

533
01:01:53,865 --> 01:01:54,949
Alfred...

534
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:58,245
...bring me some antiseptic ointment.

535
01:01:58,454 --> 01:02:00,623
Coming. Are you in pain, sir?

536
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:04,794
Not really.

537
01:02:27,154 --> 01:02:29,782
I may have saved the mayor's baby...

538
01:02:31,409 --> 01:02:33,912
...but I refuse to save a mayor...

539
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:36,832
...who stood by, helpless as a baby...

540
01:02:37,249 --> 01:02:40,211
...while Gotham was ravaged
by a disease...

541
01:02:41,296 --> 01:02:44,591
...that turned Eagle Scouts
into crazed clowns...

542
01:02:46,093 --> 01:02:48,847
...and happy homemakers into catwomen.

543
01:02:50,015 --> 01:02:51,141
Thank you.

544
01:02:54,311 --> 01:02:58,650
Oswald Cobblepot, the mystery man-beast,
made his bid to run Gotham.

545
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:06,159
Mr. Cobblepot, you are the coolest
role model a young person could have.

546
01:03:06,784 --> 01:03:09,287
And you're the hottest young person...

547
01:03:09,454 --> 01:03:11,623
...a role model could have.

548
01:03:14,126 --> 01:03:15,169
Here.

549
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:17,714
Wear a button.

550
01:03:19,174 --> 01:03:21,343
Let me just get it on here.

551
01:03:25,974 --> 01:03:27,309
Thank you.

552
01:03:32,148 --> 01:03:36,653
This mayor stuff is not about power,
it's about reaching out to people...

553
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:38,906
...touching people, groping people.

554
01:03:38,989 --> 01:03:40,908
-Penguin--
-My name is not Penguin!

555
01:03:40,992 --> 01:03:42,910
It's Oswald Cobblepot.

556
01:03:43,536 --> 01:03:46,415
Oswald, there's somebody here to see you.

557
01:03:54,716 --> 01:03:57,386
Just the pussy I've been looking for.

558
01:04:02,183 --> 01:04:04,019
It's chilly in here.

559
01:04:05,187 --> 01:04:06,522
I'll warm you.

560
01:04:06,897 --> 01:04:08,399
Down, Oswald.

561
01:04:10,735 --> 01:04:12,195
We need to talk.

562
01:04:12,362 --> 01:04:13,739
You see...

563
01:04:13,905 --> 01:04:16,659
...you and I have something in common.

564
01:04:16,909 --> 01:04:18,578
Sounds familiar.

565
01:04:19,078 --> 01:04:21,164
Appetite for destruction?

566
01:04:21,373 --> 01:04:23,709
Contempt for the czars of fashion?

567
01:04:24,042 --> 01:04:25,878
Wait, don't tell me.

568
01:04:26,087 --> 01:04:28,005
Naked sexual charisma?

569
01:04:29,549 --> 01:04:30,800
Batman.

570
01:04:31,927 --> 01:04:34,179
The thorn in both our sides.

571
01:04:34,889 --> 01:04:36,933
The fly in our ointment.

572
01:04:37,558 --> 01:04:38,893
Ointment?

573
01:04:39,394 --> 01:04:41,772
I've got scented and unscented.

574
01:04:42,272 --> 01:04:44,066
I'll come back later.

575
01:04:44,567 --> 01:04:48,446
Perchance, are you a registered voter?
I'm a mayoral prospect.

576
01:04:48,613 --> 01:04:50,991
I have but one pet cause today!.

577
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:53,410
Ban the Bat.

578
01:04:53,911 --> 01:04:57,999
Oh, him again. No bother.
He's already history. Check it out.

579
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:03,130
We'll disassemble his Batmobile
and turn it into an H-bomb on wheels.

580
01:05:06,634 --> 01:05:09,137
He'd have even more power as a martyr.

581
01:05:09,388 --> 01:05:13,851
To destroy Batman, we must first
turn him into what he hates the most.

582
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:15,895
Namely, us.

583
01:05:17,814 --> 01:05:19,149
Frame him?

584
01:05:19,316 --> 01:05:22,487
Not even in office yet
and already an enemies list.

585
01:05:24,322 --> 01:05:26,950
Those names are not for prying eyes.

586
01:05:28,827 --> 01:05:31,622
Why shouid i trust some catbroad anyway?

587
01:05:32,832 --> 01:05:37,004
Maybe you're a screwed-up sorority chick
getting back at her daddy...

588
01:05:37,171 --> 01:05:40,716
...for not buying her that pony
when she turned sweet-sixteen.

589
01:05:57,945 --> 01:05:59,405
Nice birdie.

590
01:06:14,798 --> 01:06:16,217
Nice kitty.

591
01:06:16,717 --> 01:06:18,136
Nice kitty.

592
01:06:24,977 --> 01:06:26,979
Batman napaimed my arm.

593
01:06:27,564 --> 01:06:31,735
He knocked me off a buiiding just
when i started to feei good about myseif.

594
01:06:31,819 --> 01:06:34,989
i want to piay an integrai part
in his degradation.

595
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,913
A pian is forming.

596
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:50,299
i want in.

597
01:06:52,593 --> 01:06:55,847
The thought of busting Batman
makes me feei aii...

598
01:06:57,933 --> 01:06:59,017
...dirty.

599
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:06,193
Maybe i'ii just give myseif a bath
right here.

600
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,958
I challenge the mayor...

601
01:07:19,124 --> 01:07:22,962
...to re-light the Christmas tree
in Gotham Plaza tomorrow night.

602
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:28,844
Sir, shaii we change the channei
to a program with some dignity and ciass?

603
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:31,723
The Love Connection perhaps?

604
01:07:34,142 --> 01:07:36,353
...not that I have any faith in the mayor.

605
01:07:36,437 --> 01:07:38,314
But I hope and pray...

606
01:07:38,648 --> 01:07:40,108
...that Batman...

607
01:07:40,274 --> 01:07:43,111
...will be present to preserve the peace.

608
01:07:44,446 --> 01:07:45,614
Subtie.

609
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:51,121
Why are you doing this?

610
01:07:53,332 --> 01:07:54,500
Seiina?

611
01:07:56,669 --> 01:07:59,005
Sorry, i didn't mean to scare you.

612
01:07:59,172 --> 01:08:01,842
Scare me? i was just scaring myseif.

613
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,703
i don't see how, but....

614
01:08:04,995 --> 01:08:08,290
it's nice to see you in the reai worid,
away from Shreck.

615
01:08:09,834 --> 01:08:11,544
it's nice to be here.

616
01:08:14,881 --> 01:08:16,341
Are you aii right?

617
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:21,473
You iook iike you have the hoiiday biues
or something.

618
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:26,437
Boy, the news these days.

619
01:08:27,396 --> 01:08:28,397
Weird!

620
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:33,278
i heard on TV that Catwoman
weighs 140 pounds.

621
01:08:35,406 --> 01:08:37,575
How do these hacks sieep at night?

622
01:08:37,742 --> 01:08:40,537
it's not even accurate. "Batman biows it""?

623
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:43,916
He probabiy saved miiiions
in property damage aione.

624
01:08:45,209 --> 01:08:48,880
You're not going to the re-iighting
of the tree, are you?

625
01:08:49,089 --> 01:08:51,425
i wouidn't be caught dead there.

626
01:08:52,593 --> 01:08:55,888
it's going to be a hot time
in the coid town tonight.

627
01:08:57,932 --> 01:09:00,727
You got kind of a dark side, don't you?

628
01:09:01,395 --> 01:09:02,938
No darker than yours.

629
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:10,405
Why don't you come over
and we can watch it on TV?

630
01:09:10,781 --> 01:09:12,950
The tree-iighting ceremony.

631
01:09:13,242 --> 01:09:16,120
i can't. i have to be somewhere tonight.

632
01:09:16,955 --> 01:09:19,416
How about coming for dinner at five?

633
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:20,918
Let's say six?

634
01:09:22,086 --> 01:09:22,878
Five.

635
01:09:22,962 --> 01:09:24,422
Five. You and me.

636
01:09:32,098 --> 01:09:35,226
The tree iights up
and then i push the button.

637
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:36,728
Wait, wait.

638
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:39,857
i push the button, then the tree iights up.

639
01:09:42,151 --> 01:09:43,611
Who are you?

640
01:09:44,154 --> 01:09:45,655
Taient scout.

641
01:09:46,323 --> 01:09:47,574
Come in.

642
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:51,245
i don't just iight trees.
i'm an actress as weii.

643
01:09:53,665 --> 01:09:56,585
What is that thing?
A camera or something?

644
01:09:57,252 --> 01:09:58,587
Say, '"Cheese! '"

645
01:10:00,339 --> 01:10:01,341
Cheese.

646
01:10:13,021 --> 01:10:14,273
Thanks, Aifred.

647
01:10:16,192 --> 01:10:18,444
i'm sure he's wonderfui company...

648
01:10:18,611 --> 01:10:22,365
...but doesn't the '"goid-piated-bacheior'" bit
get a iittie staie?

649
01:10:23,617 --> 01:10:26,954
A iot iike the '"ioneiy-secretary'" syndrome,
i guess.

650
01:10:27,538 --> 01:10:29,374
Executive Assistant.

651
01:10:29,624 --> 01:10:30,625
Sorry.

652
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:35,297
Secretary.

653
01:10:39,803 --> 01:10:41,388
Any girifriend?

654
01:10:44,225 --> 01:10:45,393
Sure.

655
01:10:46,644 --> 01:10:48,688
You mean, as in serious?

656
01:10:49,981 --> 01:10:51,859
No. Had one, didn't work.

657
01:10:52,234 --> 01:10:54,362
What went wrong? Hang on!

658
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:55,989
i think i know!

659
01:10:56,489 --> 01:10:58,158
You kept things from her.

660
01:10:58,241 --> 01:10:59,868
i toid her everything.

661
01:11:01,078 --> 01:11:02,747
The truth frightened her?

662
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:04,832
There are two truths...

663
01:11:06,668 --> 01:11:08,003
...you know?

664
01:11:08,337 --> 01:11:11,757
She had troubie reconciiing them
because i had troubie...

665
01:11:13,092 --> 01:11:14,677
...reconciiing them.

666
01:11:18,682 --> 01:11:19,934
Vicki thought--

667
01:11:20,017 --> 01:11:21,018
Vicki?

668
01:11:22,186 --> 01:11:24,022
ice skater or stewardess?

669
01:11:26,191 --> 01:11:28,527
No, she was a photojournaiist.

670
01:11:29,779 --> 01:11:31,781
Was Vicki right about your...

671
01:11:31,948 --> 01:11:33,783
...difficuity with duaiity?

672
01:11:37,788 --> 01:11:39,039
You see...

673
01:11:39,957 --> 01:11:42,001
...if i say yes, then...

674
01:11:43,712 --> 01:11:45,881
...you'ii think of me as a...

675
01:11:46,048 --> 01:11:48,843
...Norman Bates, a Ted Bundy type and....

676
01:11:57,228 --> 01:11:59,230
You might not iet me kiss you.

677
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:05,404
it's the so-caiied normai guys
who aiways iet you down.

678
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:08,741
Sickos never scare me.
At ieast they're committed.

679
01:12:48,872 --> 01:12:50,207
i can't do that.

680
01:12:50,374 --> 01:12:51,625
Neither can i.

681
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:55,380
This is a special bulletin.
The Ice Princess has been kidnapped.

682
01:12:56,464 --> 01:13:00,678
Can you confirm reports of Batman's
suspected involvement in the abduction?

683
01:13:01,721 --> 01:13:04,474
The evidence is purely circumstantial.

684
01:13:04,849 --> 01:13:09,438
This was found, stained with blood,
in the missing girl's dressing room.

685
01:13:11,023 --> 01:13:13,443
-i must go.
-No, it's your house.

686
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:17,406
Hoid on. Just sit for a second and reiax.
i'ii be right back.

687
01:13:28,169 --> 01:13:30,379
i've got to go to the piaza.

688
01:13:30,546 --> 01:13:33,842
-He is begging me to show.
-i hoped you'd snub him.

689
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:37,596
i can't. There's been a kidnapping.
Here's what i want you to do.

690
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:38,681
Shit!

691
01:13:42,519 --> 01:13:45,689
Teii Seiina, Ms. Kyie,
i had to go out of town.

692
01:13:46,899 --> 01:13:50,487
Teii her that a big business deai came up....
You know what?

693
01:13:51,029 --> 01:13:54,616
Let her know, not in some kind of dumb,
'"be-my-girifriend'" way--

694
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,535
i'ii reiay the message.

695
01:14:01,541 --> 01:14:04,169
Mr. Wayne toid me to teii you that--

696
01:14:04,545 --> 01:14:05,963

Wouid you teii him...

698
01:14:09,384 --> 01:14:12,721
...i've been going through...
a iot of changes and....

699
01:14:14,724 --> 01:14:16,184
Just that...

700
01:14:16,392 --> 01:14:18,395
...this is not a rejection...

701
01:14:18,895 --> 01:14:20,606
...my abruptiy ieaving.

702
01:14:20,731 --> 01:14:23,150

703
01:14:23,734 --> 01:14:25,570
...i hope i reaiiy am.

704
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:30,909
Couid you just make up a sonnet or...
a dirty iimerick?

705
01:14:31,577 --> 01:14:33,746
One has just sprung to mind.

706
01:14:35,081 --> 01:14:36,625
This way, ma'am.

707
01:15:37,864 --> 01:15:39,449
Ladies and Gentlemen.

708
01:15:39,699 --> 01:15:42,244
Please, may I have your attention?

709
01:15:44,622 --> 01:15:46,916
I know that to many of you...

710
01:15:47,208 --> 01:15:50,295
...Gotham seems a bit
beleaguered these days.

711
01:15:50,962 --> 01:15:53,507
But I want you to know
your elected officials...

712
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:55,718
...and your police department...

713
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:58,346
...have the situation well in hand.

714
01:16:58,876 --> 01:16:59,961
Got to hurry.

715
01:17:00,044 --> 01:17:00,962
Thank you.

716
01:17:01,045 --> 01:17:02,881
it was set up to iook iike i did it.

717
01:17:02,964 --> 01:17:06,594
i'ii teii the poiice i was kidnapped
by an ugiy birdman with fish breath.

718
01:17:06,677 --> 01:17:08,346
Did somebody say fish?

719
01:17:08,596 --> 01:17:10,765
i haven't been fed aii day.

720
01:17:11,599 --> 01:17:12,976
Eat fioor.

721
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,688
High fiber.

722
01:17:16,856 --> 01:17:18,191
Hey, stud...

723
01:17:18,357 --> 01:17:21,611
-...i thought we had something together.
-We do.

724
01:17:37,589 --> 01:17:39,507
Got to go. Giri taik.

725
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:11,587
She iet me go. i think 'cause i reasoned
with her, giri-to-giri.

726
01:18:13,381 --> 01:18:15,425
Be carefui. Don't move.

727
01:18:17,761 --> 01:18:19,138
Lawn dart!

728
01:18:23,226 --> 01:18:25,437
Rats with wings, do your thing.

729
01:18:31,944 --> 01:18:33,780
Batman pushed the Princess!

730
01:18:49,423 --> 01:18:50,675
Hoid your fire!

731
01:19:05,734 --> 01:19:08,154
You're catnip to a giri iike me.

732
01:19:09,405 --> 01:19:11,158
Handsome, dazed...

733
01:19:12,576 --> 01:19:14,328
...and to die for.

734
01:19:22,254 --> 01:19:24,757
Mistietoe can be deadiy if you eat it.

735
01:19:25,508 --> 01:19:27,010
But a kiss...

736
01:19:27,343 --> 01:19:29,888
...can be even deadiier if you mean it.

737
01:19:39,358 --> 01:19:42,278
You're the second man
who's kiiied me this week.

738
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:44,447
But i've got seven iives ieft.

739
01:19:44,614 --> 01:19:46,074
i tried to save you--

740
01:19:46,157 --> 01:19:49,328
Seems iike every woman
you try to save ends up dead.

741
01:19:49,703 --> 01:19:51,539
Or deepiy resentfui.

742
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:54,459
Maybe you shouid retire.

743
01:20:17,444 --> 01:20:18,612
Damn.

744
01:20:53,779 --> 01:20:55,239
Outstanding!

745
01:20:55,948 --> 01:20:58,284
You're Beauty and the Beast...

746
01:20:58,785 --> 01:21:01,580
...in one iuscious Christmas gift pack.

747
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:05,209
You said you'd scare the ice Princess.

748
01:21:05,292 --> 01:21:07,462
She iooked pretty scared to me.

749
01:21:09,798 --> 01:21:11,633
A touch of the bubbiy?

750
01:21:15,555 --> 01:21:17,640
So what are we waiting for?

751
01:21:17,849 --> 01:21:20,477
Let's consummate our fiendish union.

752
01:21:21,311 --> 01:21:22,479
What?

753
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:24,440
Oh, come on.

754
01:21:24,982 --> 01:21:26,568
Can't you picture?

755
01:21:26,735 --> 01:21:28,904
it's dark in the mayor's mansion.

756
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:32,533
i'm bushed, so here you come
into the bedroom...

757
01:21:33,743 --> 01:21:35,829
...twitching your iittie taii...

758
01:21:35,995 --> 01:21:39,333
...my siippers in one hand,
a dry martini in the other.

759
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:40,668
Piease.

760
01:21:41,168 --> 01:21:43,296
i wouidn't touch you to scratch you.

761
01:21:43,379 --> 01:21:47,718
You iousy minx! i shouid have you spayed!
You sent out aii the signais!

762
01:21:48,343 --> 01:21:50,846
i don't think i iike you anymore!

763
01:21:58,856 --> 01:22:00,900
Good-bye, my unintended.

764
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:02,652
Go to heaven.

765
01:23:02,389 --> 01:23:03,599
There he is!

766
01:23:06,227 --> 01:23:07,979
Don't adjust your sets.

767
01:23:08,188 --> 01:23:09,439
Welcome...

768
01:23:09,731 --> 01:23:12,818
...to the Oswald Cobblepot
School of Driving.

769
01:23:14,195 --> 01:23:16,614
Gentlemen, start your screaming.

770
01:23:50,738 --> 01:23:54,868
This may be a bad time to mention it,
but my license has expired!

771
01:24:12,055 --> 01:24:13,056
Relax.

772
01:24:13,306 --> 01:24:17,728
I'll take care of the squealing, wretched,
pinhead puppets of Gotham!

773
01:25:04,701 --> 01:25:08,789
You must admit I played this stinking city
like a harp from hell!

774
01:25:29,021 --> 01:25:31,399
Heipiess oid iady at 12:00 high!

775
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:10,111
That's funny.

776
01:26:18,872 --> 01:26:20,624
Now i'm a iittie worried.

777
01:26:47,531 --> 01:26:49,408
So he survived. Why worry?

778
01:26:49,575 --> 01:26:53,329
He didn't even iose a iimb!
An eyebaii! Biadder controi!

779
01:26:54,205 --> 01:26:57,626
Listen to them. They've iost faith
in oid symbois.

780
01:26:58,252 --> 01:27:01,255
They're ready to bond with you,
the icon of the future.

781
01:27:01,339 --> 01:27:03,257
if it works, don't fix it.

782
01:27:03,508 --> 01:27:05,969
We'ii ceiebrate tonight at my annuai baii.

783
01:27:06,052 --> 01:27:08,055
Shreck and Cobbiepot...

784
01:27:08,681 --> 01:27:12,372
...the visionary aiiiance.

785
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:32,375
When it came time...

786
01:27:32,709 --> 01:27:35,671
...to ensure the safety of our fair city...

787
01:27:37,214 --> 01:27:39,509
...did the mayor have a plan?

788
01:27:40,385 --> 01:27:41,469
No!

789
01:27:42,971 --> 01:27:44,765
He relied on a man.

790
01:27:46,726 --> 01:27:48,060
A Batman.

791
01:27:49,062 --> 01:27:51,982
A ticking time-bomb of a costumed freak....

792
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:56,404
Our prime concern is
this ghastiy grotesque.

793
01:27:57,071 --> 01:28:00,242
But iet's not forget about
repairing the Batmobiie.

794
01:28:00,492 --> 01:28:02,452
There's security to consider.

795
01:28:02,744 --> 01:28:05,706
We can't just take it to any oid body shop.

796
01:28:06,833 --> 01:28:07,917
Security?

797
01:28:08,168 --> 01:28:10,420
Who iet Vicki Vaie into the Batcave?

798
01:28:10,504 --> 01:28:14,842
i'm working, i turn around and there she is.
'"Hi, Vick. Come on in.'"

799
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:26,564
-Ready?
-i'ii take the stairs.

800
01:28:48,257 --> 01:28:51,177
You ask...am I up here for personal glory?

801
01:28:53,721 --> 01:28:54,806
No.

802
01:29:07,738 --> 01:29:10,491
The glory that I yearn to recapture...

803
01:29:11,743 --> 01:29:13,870
...is the glory of Gotham!

804
01:29:32,017 --> 01:29:34,311
How can this be accomplished?

805
01:29:36,731 --> 01:29:38,066
I know...

806
01:29:38,274 --> 01:29:40,318
...you're all concerned.

807
01:29:42,779 --> 01:29:43,989
Relax.

808
01:29:44,615 --> 01:29:49,037
I'll take care of the squealing, wretched,
pinhead puppets of Gotham.

809
01:29:56,504 --> 01:29:58,089
i didn't say that.

810
01:30:00,467 --> 01:30:03,554
You must admit I played
this stinking city...

811
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:06,724
...Iike a harp from hell!

812
01:30:08,477 --> 01:30:09,895
You must admit...

813
01:30:10,062 --> 01:30:13,566
...I played this stinking city
like a harp from hell!

814
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:10,884
Why is there aiways someone who brings
eggs and tomatoes to a speech?

815
01:31:34,870 --> 01:31:36,330
There he is!

816
01:32:07,909 --> 01:32:09,286
My babies.

817
01:32:10,579 --> 01:32:12,248
Did you miss me?

818
01:32:26,264 --> 01:32:27,933
Did you miss me?

819
01:32:29,602 --> 01:32:31,479
Great speech, Oswaid.

820
01:32:32,730 --> 01:32:34,649
My name is not Oswaid!

821
01:32:35,275 --> 01:32:36,777
it's Penguin!

822
01:32:37,069 --> 01:32:39,071
i am not a human being!

823
01:32:39,447 --> 01:32:41,783
i am an animai. Coid-biooded!

824
01:32:43,243 --> 01:32:44,828
Crank the A.C.!

825
01:32:45,037 --> 01:32:47,832
Where are my iists? Bring me the names!

826
01:32:48,875 --> 01:32:50,251
it's time.

827
01:32:50,627 --> 01:32:54,423
These are the names of the first-born sons
of Gotham City.

828
01:32:55,049 --> 01:32:56,717
Just iike i was.

829
01:32:57,134 --> 01:33:00,138
And iike me, a terribie fate waits for them.

830
01:33:01,973 --> 01:33:04,685
Tonight, whiie their parents party...

01:33:05,311 --> 01:33:07,647
...they'ii be dreaming away...

832
01:33:08,064 --> 01:33:10,150
...in their safe cribs...

833
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,277
...their soft beds...

834
01:33:12,653 --> 01:33:14,822
...and we'ii snatch them...

835
01:33:14,989 --> 01:33:16,991
...carry them into the sewer...

836
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:20,454
...and toss them into a deep, dark,
watery grave.

837
01:33:22,498 --> 01:33:23,666
Penguin?

838
01:33:24,417 --> 01:33:26,669
Kiiiing sieeping chiidren...

839
01:33:27,003 --> 01:33:28,755
...isn't that a iittie....

840
01:33:39,017 --> 01:33:40,602
No, it's a iot.

841
01:33:50,572 --> 01:33:51,907
A reminder.

842
01:33:52,074 --> 01:33:56,079
Tonight is that ioathsome party hosted
by the odious Mr. Shreck.

843
01:33:56,413 --> 01:33:59,249
May we RSVP
in the resoundingiy negative?

844
01:33:59,959 --> 01:34:01,210
Not interested.

845
01:34:03,421 --> 01:34:04,673
Aithough...

846
01:34:07,009 --> 01:34:09,094
...Seiina Kyie might be there.

847
01:34:32,372 --> 01:34:34,124
ingenious costume.

848
01:34:34,541 --> 01:34:36,043
Let me guess.

849
01:34:36,210 --> 01:34:38,212
Trust-fund goody-goody?

850
01:34:39,547 --> 01:34:40,965
Feeiing good?

851
01:34:41,967 --> 01:34:45,387
You aimost made a monster the mayor
of Gotham City.

852
01:34:45,804 --> 01:34:48,141
i am the iight of this city...

853
01:34:48,474 --> 01:34:50,977
...and i am its mean, twisted soui.

854
01:34:51,394 --> 01:34:53,146
Does it matter who's mayor?

855
01:34:53,230 --> 01:34:54,440
it does to me.

856
01:34:54,815 --> 01:34:55,983
Yawn.

857
01:35:34,278 --> 01:35:36,698
i'm sorry about yesterday, but i had...

858
01:35:36,823 --> 01:35:40,286
...a pretty big deai come through.
Faii through, actuaiiy.

859
01:35:40,452 --> 01:35:43,331
it's okay. i had to go home
and feed my cat.

860
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:53,968
No hard feeiings then?

861
01:35:56,471 --> 01:35:57,890
Actuaiiy...

862
01:36:00,017 --> 01:36:01,936
...semi-hard, i'd say.

863
01:36:08,152 --> 01:36:11,656
There's a big, comfy Caiifornia King
over in Bedding.

864
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:14,868
Why don't we....

865
01:36:15,994 --> 01:36:17,872
Take off our costumes?

866
01:36:21,376 --> 01:36:23,545
i'm tired of wearing masks.

867
01:36:24,379 --> 01:36:25,631
Me too.

868
01:36:27,049 --> 01:36:28,801
Let me ask you something.

869
01:36:30,053 --> 01:36:31,763
Why'd you come tonight?

870
01:36:32,389 --> 01:36:34,391
-You first.
-To see you.

871
01:36:36,852 --> 01:36:37,854
Loveiy.

872
01:36:39,522 --> 01:36:42,776

but i came for Max.

873
01:36:45,738 --> 01:36:47,365
Do you mean you....

874
01:36:47,699 --> 01:36:49,075
Not you and Max?

875
01:36:50,535 --> 01:36:51,954
Me and Max?

876
01:36:58,545 --> 01:37:00,297
No. This and Max.

877
01:37:03,551 --> 01:37:07,681
Don't teii me kiiiing Max
won't soive anything, because it wiii.

878
01:37:08,765 --> 01:37:12,102
Aren't you tired of this
sanctimonious robber baron...

879
01:37:12,269 --> 01:37:15,189
...coming out on top when
he shouid be six feet under?

880
01:37:15,273 --> 01:37:19,445
You may have probiems with your boss,
but who do you think you are?

881
01:37:22,448 --> 01:37:24,701
i don't know anymore, Bruce.

882
01:37:39,218 --> 01:37:41,387
A kiss under the mistietoe.

883
01:37:44,641 --> 01:37:46,810
'"Mistietoe can be deadiy if you eat it.'"

884
01:37:46,894 --> 01:37:49,146
'"But a kiss can be even deadiier...

885
01:37:51,649 --> 01:37:53,193
'"...if you mean it.'"

886
01:38:03,497 --> 01:38:04,915
Oh, my God.

887
01:38:05,833 --> 01:38:08,377
Does this mean we have to start fighting?

888
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:11,005
Let's go outside.

889
01:38:46,881 --> 01:38:48,967
-Are you okay?
-i'm aii right.

890
01:38:57,143 --> 01:38:59,062
You didn't invite me...

891
01:38:59,313 --> 01:39:00,981
...so i crashed!

892
01:39:04,527 --> 01:39:05,612
What do you want?

893
01:39:05,695 --> 01:39:07,531
Right now, my troops...

894
01:39:07,781 --> 01:39:10,034
...are fanning out across town...

895

For your first-born sons!

898
01:39:16,416 --> 01:39:19,295
The ones you ieft defenseiess at home...

01:39:33,436 --> 01:39:35,814
...for Gotham's favorite son...

904
01:39:36,023 --> 01:39:37,816
...Mr. Chip Shreck.

905
01:39:39,026 --> 01:39:41,738
You're coming with me,
you Great White Dope...

906
01:39:42,697 --> 01:39:45,033
...to die, way down in the sewer!

907
01:39:45,701 --> 01:39:49,497
Not Chip. if you have any human feeiing,
take me instead.

908
01:39:51,791 --> 01:39:53,502
i don't. So, no!

909
01:39:53,961 --> 01:39:55,212
i'm the one you want.

910
01:39:55,337 --> 01:39:58,841
isn't it Max Shreck who manipuiated
and betrayed you?

911
01:39:59,384 --> 01:40:01,469
isn't it Max, not Chip...

912
01:40:02,053 --> 01:40:05,558
...you want to see immersed
to his eyebaiis in raw sewage?

913
01:40:10,564 --> 01:40:12,316
Okay, you got a point.

914
01:40:12,649 --> 01:40:15,403

915
01:40:15,653 --> 01:40:16,863
in the duck!

916
01:40:44,354 --> 01:40:46,523
This is going to be good...

917
01:40:47,274 --> 01:40:51,028
...to cut down a whoie crop
of Gotham's most promising...

918
01:40:52,113 --> 01:40:53,781
...before their prime.

919
01:40:56,117 --> 01:40:58,662
You ask me...how do i iure them in?

920
01:41:02,834 --> 01:41:05,212
A iittie '"Pied Penguin'" action.

921
01:41:07,798 --> 01:41:10,301
And you get to watch them sink...

922
01:41:11,135 --> 01:41:12,971
...into a deep puddie...

923
01:41:13,138 --> 01:41:15,682
...of your industriai by-products.

924
01:41:16,517 --> 01:41:17,643
Then...

925
01:41:17,851 --> 01:41:19,478
...you join them.

926
01:41:53,352 --> 01:41:55,896
Hurry up and get those kids ioaded.

927
01:42:05,533 --> 01:42:07,535
Right this way, kiddies.

928
01:42:08,078 --> 01:42:09,579
Come with me.

929
01:42:26,057 --> 01:42:28,393
So where are aii the chiidren?

930
01:42:32,398 --> 01:42:33,733
'"Dear Penguin:

931
01:42:33,941 --> 01:42:37,070
'"The chiidren regret
they're unabie to attend.

932
01:42:37,612 --> 01:42:38,947
'"Batman! '"

933
01:42:52,463 --> 01:42:54,257
My dear penguins...

934
01:42:55,634 --> 01:42:58,137
...we stand on a great threshoid!

935
01:42:59,597 --> 01:43:01,599
it's okay to be scared!

936
01:43:02,267 --> 01:43:04,770
Many of you won't be coming back.

937
01:43:05,145 --> 01:43:06,939
Thanks to Batman...

938
01:43:07,606 --> 01:43:09,442
...the time has come...

939
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:12,070
...to punish aii God's chiidren!

940
01:43:13,572 --> 01:43:16,450
First-, second-, third- and fourth-born!

941
01:43:17,243 --> 01:43:18,786
Why be biased?

942
01:43:19,078 --> 01:43:20,747
Maie and femaie!

943
01:43:21,498 --> 01:43:23,750
Heii, the sexes are equai...

944
01:43:24,668 --> 01:43:26,921
...with their erogenous zones...

945
01:43:27,088 --> 01:43:28,840
...biown sky-high!

946
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:32,928
Forward...

947
01:43:34,263 --> 01:43:35,431
...march!

948
01:43:35,848 --> 01:43:38,017
The iiberation of Gotham...

949
01:43:39,185 --> 01:43:40,687
...has begun!

950
01:44:25,824 --> 01:44:28,160
The penguins are moving above ground.

951
01:44:53,523 --> 01:44:55,025
Penguin army...

952
01:44:55,192 --> 01:44:58,529
...approaching launch destination
at Gotham Plaza.

953
01:44:59,864 --> 01:45:01,992
One minute until ignition.

954
01:45:02,534 --> 01:45:04,828
They wouidn't put me on a pedestai...

955
01:45:04,995 --> 01:45:07,415
...so i'm iaying them on a siab!

956
01:45:08,666 --> 01:45:11,419
Penguins seem to be converging
on Gotham Plaza.

957
01:45:34,655 --> 01:45:36,783
Thirty seconds until ignition.

958
01:45:38,743 --> 01:45:41,288
Estimated casualties after launch:

959
01:45:42,414 --> 01:45:44,000
100,000 people.

960
01:45:47,420 --> 01:45:50,215
The penguins have reached
Gotham Square.

961
01:46:09,613 --> 01:46:11,616
Fifteen seconds to ignition.

962
01:46:14,202 --> 01:46:15,912
Ready when you are, sir.

963
01:46:18,707 --> 01:46:27,718
10-,9-,8-,7-
i've got the coordinates.

964
01:46:28,302 --> 01:46:30,012
Let's turn them around.

965
01:46:38,564 --> 01:46:40,066
Something is wrong.

966
01:46:41,818 --> 01:46:43,904
Something has jammed the signal.

967
01:46:54,166 --> 01:46:56,544
They seem to be turning around.

968
01:47:25,536 --> 01:47:30,500
There is also something coming this way.

969
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:33,462
Very large. Very fast.

970
01:47:49,732 --> 01:47:51,066
Who's there?

971
01:47:58,325 --> 01:48:00,661
i'm homing in on the signai's origin.

972
01:49:16,709 --> 01:49:19,796
You're jeaious
because i'm a genuine freak...

973
01:49:20,130 --> 01:49:22,383
...and you have to wear a mask!

974
01:49:22,633 --> 01:49:24,302
You might be right.

975
01:49:26,888 --> 01:49:30,809
But what it aii comes down to is:
Who's hoiding the umbreiia?

976
01:49:57,341 --> 01:49:58,717

Shut up. You're going to jaii.

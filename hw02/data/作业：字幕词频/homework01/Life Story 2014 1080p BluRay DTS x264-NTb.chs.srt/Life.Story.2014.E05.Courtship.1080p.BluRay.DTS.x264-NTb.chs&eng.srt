1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,200
到目前为止生命的故事里

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,560
我们见到了动物们采取他们的第一步...

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,840
..成长...

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,080
..寻找一个家...

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,680
..并且获得力量...

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,480
现在 他们需要一个伴侣
Now, they need a mate.

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,000
为了赢得伙伴而竞争
Competition to win a partner

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,120
在自然界里是如此的激烈
is so intense in nature,

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,440
它创造了最不同寻常的美丽
it has created
both the most extraordinary beauty

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,120
和威胁生命的暴力
and life-threatening violence.

11
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,800
一只雄性信天翁
A male waved albatross

12
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,600
在他超过二十年的一生里都只
will have the same partner
for his lifetime

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,920
将拥有一个伴侣
of over 20 years.

14
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,560
在独自沿着太平洋觅食后
After feeding alone
over the Pacific Ocean,

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,800
这只雄性回到了加拉帕戈斯群岛
this male has returned here
to the Galapagos,

16
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,040
正如同他每年所做的那样
as he does every year,

17
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,320
来等待他的配偶过来找他
to wait for his mate
to come back to him.

18
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,080
其他的已经在重新确立加深羁绊
Others are already
reaffirming their bonds.

19
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,800
随着年份的流逝他们变得越来越老
As the years go by
and they get older,

20
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,080
他们其中之一没法回来的可能性总是存在的
there is always the possibility that
one of them will not make it back.

21
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,360
但是他与他的伴侣的联系是如此的紧固
But his bond with his partner
is so strong,

22
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,280
他将只会坐着等待她
he will simply sit and wait for her.

23
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,960
在自然界里  要想形成这样终身的承诺是很稀少的
In nature, it's rare to form
such a lifelong commitment.

24
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,000
对于大多数动物而言 
交配的游戏既单纯又充满暴力竞争性的
For most animals, the mating game is
both brief and fiercely competitive.

25
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,480
一只雌性绿蠵龟
A female green turtle

26
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,520
必须在开放海域里冒着危险生活三十年
must survive the dangers
of the open ocean for 30 years

27
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,800
在她变得足以成熟得以交配之前
before she's mature enough to mate.

28
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,000
她来到了这里  马来西亚浅水滩岸边  来进行繁殖
She's come here, to the shallow
waters off Malaysia, to breed.

29
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,560
一只雄性
A male.

30
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,720
他等待这个机会有好几周了
He's been waiting weeks
for this opportunity.

31
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,840
求偶仪式从最简单的绕圈开始
Courtship begins
with the gentlest of circling...

32
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,360
直到她接受他更进一步之前
..before she accepts his advances.

33
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,280
他们首次一同呼吸
Their first breath together

34
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,520
是交配开始的头几个小时
is the beginning
of several hours of mating.

35
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,680
他将尽他所能的坚持住
He will hold on as tight as he can

36
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,240
来保持使她全身心投入到他一人身上
to keep her all to himself.

37
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,320
不幸地  他们有伙伴
Unfortunately, they have company.

38
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,040
另外一只雄性
Another male.

39
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,280
他将尽一切所能来拆散这对情侣
He will do anything he can
to separate the pair

40
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,480
并且自己和雌性进行交配
and mate with the female himself.

41
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,480
他瞄准了柔软脆弱的部位
He targets
the soft, vulnerable parts.

42
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,880
他把他对手的空气敲了出来
He knocks the air out of his rival.

43
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,680
雌性现在正在为她背上额外的重量而挣扎着
The female is struggling now
with the extra weight on her back,

44
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,000
不久她将需要浮出水面来吸一口气
and soon she will need to surface
to take a breath.

45
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,280
另一只雄性
Another male.

46
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,720
更多竞争
MORE competition.

47
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,720
又来了一只
And here's another.

48
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,720
现在这只雌性在他背上有两只雄性
Now, the female has two males
locked on her back

49
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,560
对于她而言要想上浮到水面上难度倍增
and it's twice as hard for her
to get to the surface.

50
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,480
经过了一小时的争斗后
After an hour of battling,

51
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,360
这对情侣已经被骚扰了七英里
the pair are being harassed
by seven males.

52
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,120
但是雄性们是如此的兴奋
他们开始攻击彼此
But the males are so excited,
they start attacking each other.

53
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,560
在骚乱中  这对情侣脱离了表面
In the commotion, the couple
break away for the surface.

54
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,000
这对情侣做出了逃脱
The pair manage to make their escape...

55
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,840
留下处于混乱困惑状态中的雄性对手们
..leaving the rival males
milling around in confusion.

56
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,400
最终  他们可以和平的进行交配了
Finally, they can mate in peace.

57
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,520
在这场交配的游戏当中  通常是雄性
In the mating game, it's usually
the males who take the risks

58
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,200
承担起风险并且付出最多的那方

59
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,680
他叫

60
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,760
新几内亚火焰别墅鸟不通过打架的方式赢取伴侣

61
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,920
它的战略是奉献上一场表演
His strategy is to put on a show.

62
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,640
他首先撘筑个舞台
First, he builds a stage.

63
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,760
在繁殖的季节里 他花费一个星期建造这个建筑
In the breeding season, he spends
a week creating this construction,

64
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,880
叫做凉亭    在巴布亚新几内亚的森林里
called a bower,
in the forests of Papua New Guinea.

65
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,640
他痴迷于细节
He's a stickler for detail.

66
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,000
舞台准备好了
The stage is set.

67
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,400
是用泥巴粉刷的时间了
Time to paint it with mud.

68
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,760
这形成了一个较暗的背景
That makes a darker background,

69
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,520
这将对比凸显其明亮的色彩
which will set off
his magnificent colours.

70
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,440
接下来  关于服装的方面有着不同的选择
Next, there are difficult
decisions about the set-dressing.

71
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,560
或许有点太无趣了
Perhaps a bit dull.

72
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,320
仍有进步的余地
There's still room for improvement.

73
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,480
完美
Perfect.

74
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,120
是时候叫上观众了
Time to call in the audience...

75
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,680
他鸣叫着
HE SQUAWKS

76
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,920
如果有任何人感兴趣的话
..if anyone's interested.

77
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,360
这可能需要花费一些时间
This could take some time.

78
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,800
吸引注意力是吸引伴侣重要关键的部分
Attracting attention is
an essential part of winning a mate.

79
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,400
世界的海洋被明亮的颜色所覆盖
The world's oceans
are filled with brilliant colours,

80
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,520
所有都是被设计使得外表更加显眼
all designed
to make their wearers conspicuous.

81
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,920
不幸的是，这只小的，日本河豚是平淡的
Unfortunately this small,
Japanese puffer fish is dull,

82
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,720
几乎就看不见
almost to the point of invisibility,

83
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,200
但为了补偿
but to compensate,

84
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,000
他或许是大自然界里最伟大的艺术家
he is probably nature's
greatest artist.

85
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,440
为了获取雌性的注意力
To grab a female's attention,

86
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,600
它创造了一些令人难以置信的东西
he creates something that almost
defies belief.

87
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,800
他唯一的工具是他的鳍
His only tools are his fins.

88
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,480
在他的脑海里
一个完美的数学计划
In his head,
a plan of mathematical perfection.

89
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,480
他挖开沙子  把它们分开成细小的粒子
He ploughs the sand, breaking it up
into the finest of particles.

90
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,240
这些不仅仅是要拿来当做垃圾扔掉的贝壳
These shells aren't just
rubbish to be removed.

91
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,440
他用他来搭建他建筑物的桥梁
He uses them to decorate
the bridges of his construction.

92
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,040
他一刻都不能停息
He can't rest for more
than a moment,

93
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,840
必须连续不断的工作上一周每天二十四小时
but must work 24 hours a day
for a week,

94
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,080
否则水流将会毁掉他的建筑
or the current
will destroy his creation.

95
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,560
一个最后的清理 然后他的建筑物大功告成
A final tidy-up
and his masterpiece is complete.

96
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,760
自然界里没有任何一种其他动物
Nowhere else in nature
does an animal construct something

97
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,120
建一个像他一样又复杂又如此完美的东西
as complex and perfect as this.

98
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,520
如果这都不能让他获得瞩目  没东西会了
If this doesn't get him noticed,
nothing will.

99
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,840
现在他准备好要接受视察了
Now it's ready for inspection.

100
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,400
一只雌性  膨胀搭载着满满的卵
A female, swollen with eggs.

101
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,360
为了保证她能够获得最佳的视野
他鼓励她进入中心区域内
To make sure she gets the best view,
he encourages her into the centre.

102
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,080
审查完毕 她退了出去
Inspection over, she withdraws

103
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,840
等待着最后阶段的过程
to await the final stage
of the process.

104
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,000
到了下一个清晨  所有最柔软的沙子现在都到了中间
By the next morning, all the softest
sand is now in the middle.

105
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,800
展示场的中间现在被弄平了
The centre of the arena
has been flattened.

106
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,560
就在这个点  她来了
Right on cue, here she is.

107
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,520
这正是她想要的
This is what she wanted.

108
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,120
对于她的卵而言  这是个理想的床
It's a perfect bed for her eggs.

109
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,960
雄性抓住了她的脸颊  并且开始对她微小的卵进行受精
The male now grasps her cheek and
then fertilises her minuscule eggs.

110
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,800
快速轻弹他的鳍   他将卵埋了起来
And with a quick flick of his fins,
he buries them.

111
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,400
他们继续着如此进行直到她完成生蛋的过程
They carry on like this
until she has finished laying.

112
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,440
他一个小时毫不修饰的感情在她的脸颊上留下了一个爱的咬痕
An hour of his rough affection
leaves a love bite on her cheek.

113
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,120
最终，她离开
Finally, she leaves.

114
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,440
他留下来翻转这些卵直到他们孵化
He stays to fan the eggs
until they hatch,

115
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,680
直到他出众的艺术品从他周围旁边消散
while his extraordinary work of art
fades away around him.

116
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,560
南极的南乔治亚
South Georgia in the Antarctic.

117
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,320
一只雄性海狗
A male fur seal.

118
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,960
他大约处于风华正茂的十岁年华
He's about ten years old
and in his prime.

119
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,480
他即将上岸面对他一生中的战斗
He's coming ashore to face
the fight of his life.

120
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,400
他甚至可能死在海滩上
He may even die on this beach.

121
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,120
首次  它强大到足以赢取一块
For the first time,
he is strong enough to try to win

122
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,360
能够吸引一群雌性的领土
a territory that could attract
a harem of females.

123
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,040
但与他们拥有着同样想法的对手还有很多
But there are plenty of rivals here
with the same idea.

124
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,040
这些只是前面几轮
These are only
the preliminary rounds.

125
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,080
真正的战斗会在雌性到来后展开
The real struggle will begin
once the females arrive.

126
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,240
仅仅几个星期后  海滩上挤满了
Just a week later,
females have filled the beach

127
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,680
正在为她们幼崽的诞生选择着最好领土的雌性
choosing the best territories in
which to give birth to their pups.

128
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,720
这只雄性现在有一群雌性
This male now has a harem
of a dozen females

129
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,840
他现在必须防御他们
and he's going to have
to defend them.

130
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,920
他嫉妒的邻居们将会准备利用任何虚弱的迹象
His jealous neighbours will be ready
to exploit any sign of weakness.

131
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,640
只有雌性完成了交配
It's only once the females
have given birth

132
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,640
雄性才能与之交配
that males can mate with them.

133
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,680
现在这只雄性现在必须确保他一个人养育着下一年的后代
Now this male must ensure that he
alone fathers next year's offspring.

134
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,680
但这同时也是对手的机会
But this is the rival's chance too.

135
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,200
他必须动作快
He must act fast.

136
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,160
她将不会发现他们全像这只一样这么好威胁
He won't find them all
as easy as this to intimidate.

137
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,520
新的雄性们从海洋里上岸
New males pound up from the sea,

138
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,960
意图着测试领土所有者
intent on testing
the territory holders.

139
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,160
随着在他的后面有越来越多等待中的人
With many more waiting behind them.

140
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,760
最大的战斗尚未到来呢
The biggest battles are yet to come.

141
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,720
在交配游戏中  通常不是雄性
Usually in the mating game,
it's not the males

142
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,120
而是雌性做主
but the females who call the shots.

143
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,480
但这只雄性长尾侏儒鸟正尝试着
And this male long-tailed manakin
is trying to win over

144
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,160
赢取世界上最挑剔之一的雌性的芳心
one of the world's
choosiest females.

145
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,920
他在这里  哥斯达黎加练习着他的动作
He's been practising his moves
here in Costa Rica

146
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,640
长达数十年
for as long as a decade.

147
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,120
这里有另外一只雄性
There's another male here too.

148
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:34,080
这只新来的不是对手
而是一个年轻的伙伴
Only the newcomer is not a rival,
he is a junior partner.

149
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,880
他们彼此知己知彼
他们可以承接完成彼此的呼唤
They know each other so well,
they can finish each other's calls.

150
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,280
但这并不是他们同步了的意思
But that's not all that
they have synchronised.

151
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,320
他们是师傅和学徒
They are master and apprentice.

152
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,240
学徒为这个练习了好几年了
The apprentice has also been
practising for many years.

153
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,840
但现在他必须模仿老师的每一个动作
But now he must copy
the master's every move.

154
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,760
实际上
老师也需要他的同僚
In fact,
the master needs his wingman

155
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,080
正是由于雌性甚至不会正眼瞧一个独奏者
as a female won't even
look at a solo performer,

156
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,080
更重要的是   他希望看到完美无间的配合
and what's more,
she will expect perfect harmony,

157
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,920
因此他们每天一起练习
so they practice together every day.

158
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,560
最终他们准备好了
At last they're ready.

159
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,600
她来了
Here she is.

160
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,320
排演完毕
Rehearsal over,

161
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,360
他们的表演是超过十年辛勤工作的结果
their performance is the result
of more than ten years' hard work.

162
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,720
她不能忍受出错
She won't tolerate a single slip-up.

163
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,800
突然间大师跳舞的时间到了
Suddenly the master
calls time on the dance...

164
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,800
学徒被驱赶走了
..and the apprentice is banished.

165
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,680
只有大师能得以交配
Only the master gets to mate.

166
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:45,280
对于这个学徒  在他的老师死掉之前
For the apprentice, there will be
no reward until his master dies

167
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,960
他都将没有回报  然后才得以取而代之
and he can take his place.

168
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,920
交配有时可以是一场很长的游戏
The mating game can sometimes be
a long game.

169
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,960
一只来自澳大利亚的雄性孔雀跳蛛
A male peacock jumping spider
from Australia

170
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,640
寻找着伴侣 
on a quest for a mate.

171
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,320
当你的体型只有一颗米粒大小的时候
And when you're the size
of a grain of rice,

172
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,400
几乎这里的任何东西都会变得很危险
almost anything here
could be dangerous.

173
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,000

他正在寻找着任何雌蜘蛛朝着这里前进的迹象
He's searching for any sign that
a female spider came this way.

174
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,440
而他发现了什么
And he's found something.

175
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,680
带着雌性味道的蜘蛛丝
Spider silk,
with the scent of a female.

176
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,040
他所需要的只是跟着他
He just needs to follow it...

177
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,280
无论这将引领他至何处
..wherever it leads him.

178
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,960
其他的雄性展开了相同的追求并引起了很可怕的结果
Other males have gone on the same
quest and have come to a grisly end.

179
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,480
这就是那只雌性而且他看起来并不十分处于交配状态
Here's the female
and she doesn't look very amorous.

180
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,840

事实上 他把任何一只达不到她要求
In fact, she kills every male

181
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,440
的雄性都给杀了
who doesn't match up
to her expectations.

182
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,360
为了赢取她的芳心他能做些什么呢
What can he do to win her over?

183
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,800
跳舞
Dance.

184
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,280
为他的生命而跳舞
Dance for his life.

185
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,840
他将需要一种停止表演的把戏来避免成为盘中餐
He will need a show-stopping trick
to avoid becoming lunch.

186
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,640
他的扇子展了开来
With his fan unfurled,

187
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,840
他开始了一系列更加复杂的舞蹈动作
he begins an ever more complicated
series of dance moves

188
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,920
尝试着勾引他
to try and seduce her.

189
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:21,080
最终她屈服于他的推进并且允许和她进行交配
At last she succumbs to his advances
and allows him to mate with her.

190
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,360
他达到了她的预期
He matched her expectations.

191
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,800
但她仍然杀死了他
But she kills him anyway.

192
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,200
最终  他的尸体将成为
After all, his body will make
the perfect meal

193
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,320
养育她的卵的完美的午餐
with which to nourish their eggs.

194
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,480
回到巴布亚新几内亚Back in Papua New Guinea,

195
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,800
这只雄性火焰园丁鸟仍在在为吸引异性尽力做着尝试
the male flame bowerbird is still
doing his best to attract a female.

196
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,480
最终他得到了回复
And at last he gets a response.

197
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,880
不幸的是  这是个年轻的男性
Unfortunately, it's a young male.

198
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,280
更糟的是   他带了个朋友
And worse, he's brought a friend.

199
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,760
他们正在无拘无束地用他的巢进行着练习
They're taking liberties,
practising on his bower.

200
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,080
他看起来不知如何是好
He doesn't seem to know
what to do about it.

201
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,040
但是  够就是够了
But enough is enough.

202
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,400
骚动引起了另外一只成年雄性的注意
The commotion attracts the attention
of another adult male,

203
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,920
一个邻居和对手
a neighbour and rival.

204
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,760
摧毁掉了他的凉亭
他甚至把他的装饰品给偷走了
Having destroyed the bower,
he even steals the decorations.

205
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,560
凉亭的主人回头只发现一片废墟的景象
The owner arrives back
to find a scene of destruction.

206
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,240
没有一只雌性将朝这种废墟看第二眼
No female's going to look twice
at this mess.

207
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,080
他必须重头再做一遍
He'll just have to start
all over again.

208
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,680
在生命里   在求偶的过程里总会有对手
In life, there will always be rivals
in the mating game.

209
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,560
日本森林的秋天
Autumn in the forests of Japan.

210
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,760
日本猕猴的交配季节
The mating season
for Japanese macaques.

211
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,880
猴群的领导者现在应经超过了二十岁
This dominant male
is over 20 years old.

212
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,000
年龄使得他的视力变得模糊
Age has clouded one eye.

213
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,800
多年来他有着一群雌性
He has had a harem of females
for many years.

214
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,680
他可以随心所欲与她们交配
And he can mate with them unopposed.

215
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,920
但岁月不饶人
But time catches up with everyone.

216
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,320
年轻的雄性竞争者们都在领土范围外面溜达着
Young rival males are hanging out
on the perimeter,

217
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,720
监视着她的雌性们
eyeing up his females.

218
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:52,640
多年以来   年长的蓝眼猕猴一直是这棵树的权威
For years, Old Blue-eye has asserted
his authority from this tree.

219
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,080
但他的权威正逐渐消逝
But his authority is waning

220
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,720
此刻他被背叛了
and the moment his back is turned,

221
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,920
他的雌性们被年轻的雄性给吸引走了
his females are lured away
by younger males.

222
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,600
在整个森林里  他的雌性正在私底下进行着秘密的事情
Throughout the forest, his females
are conducting secret affairs.

223
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,360
蓝眼  尝试着通过在森里的边缘巡逻来保护她的女性
Blue-eye tries to guard his females
by patrolling the edge of the troop.

224
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,600
抓个现行 
Caught in the act.

225
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,360
他攻击了这个不忠诚的女性
He attacks his unfaithful female.

226
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,520
他重新确认了他的统治地位
He has reasserted his authority.

227
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,440
或者他是如此认为的
Or so he thinks.

228
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,920
一旦这只年老的雄性合上眼睛
The moment the old male
shuts his eyes,

229
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,160
他的后宫们又出去浪了
his females are off again.

230
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:53,000
大部分下一年的幼儿们将由他的对手们抚养
Most of next year's babies
will be fathered by his rivals.

231
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,200
他将永远无从得知
And he will never know.

232
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,600
在巴布亚新几内亚
In Papua New Guinea,

233
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,960
园丁鸟仔细地重建并且重新装饰了他的凉亭
the bowerbird has lovingly rebuilt
and redecorated his bower.

234
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,080
另外一个拜访者
Another visitor.

235
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,520
这次是个雌性
This time it's a female.

236
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,520
这正是他需要她的地方
This is just where he wants her.

237
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,040
是时候开始表演了
Time to begin the show.

238
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,440
首先  他的眼孔缩小放大着
First, he expands
his pupils alternately.

239
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,400
这是一次很迷人的展示
It's an oddly mesmerising display.

240
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,160
一点准备
A spot of limbering up

241
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,960
伴随着一阵奇怪的喘息呼唤
accompanied by a weird
and wheezy call

242
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,760
从他的喉咙深处发出
from deep in his throat.

243
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,000
现在 是时候轮到他精彩的表演了
Now, it's time for his
grand performance.

244
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:54,360
她摇晃着他的尾巴就像斗牛士的披风
He waves his wing
like a matador's cape.

245
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,360
她看起来似乎惊呆了
She appears to be transfixed.

246
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,600
这是引人注目的
但看起来他似乎必须做得更多
This is certainly eye-catching
but it seems he needs to do more.

247
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,600
很慷慨地   她留给了他个提示
Generously, she drops him a hint.

248
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,840
是有关鸟和花束的关系
It's the bird equivalent
of a bouquet of flowers.

249
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,360
一切进行的很顺利
It's all going so well,

250
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:17,800
是时候给她的胸部几个头槌了
it's time to get physical
with a few head-butts to her chest.

251
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,600
一次最后的奋斗来为几个星期的努力划上句号
One final flourish
to cap weeks of effort.

252
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,920
但有什么搞错了
But something's wrong.

253
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,520
他的对手回来了
在最糟糕的时刻
His rival is back,
and at the worst possible moment.

254
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,280
他该怎么办
What should he do?

255
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,440
对于这支雌性   已经错过时间了
For the female, the moment has gone.

256
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,880
有时候 无论你做什么  总没有效果
Sometimes, whatever you do,
things just don't work out.

257
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,680
在南乔治亚海滩上的海狗
On the fur seal beach
in South Georgia,

258
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,680
争斗已经持续不间断了两星期
the fighting has been relentless
for two weeks.

259
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,200
血迹斑斑伤痕累累
这只海牛在他的领土上坚守着  还有他的后宫们
Bloodied and scarred,
this bull has held on to his ground

260
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,960
面对着侵略者们
and his harem against allcomers.

261
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,400
但这还没完
But it's not over yet.

262
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,440
对手们不断前来
The rivals keep coming.

263
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,320
这个新来的看起来十分强壮
This new one looks
particularly powerful.

264
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,360
当两只雄性像这样势均力敌的时候
When two bulls are as evenly matched
as this,

265
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,920
它们能够互相捶打攻击长达二十分钟
they can trade blows
for 20 minutes.

266
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,200
地主海牛十分疲乏
The resident bull is tiring.

267
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,280
几个星期的战斗使得他精疲力竭
The weeks of fighting
have taken too great a toll.

268
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,040
突然之间  他的邻居加入了攻击
Suddenly, his neighbours
join in the attack.

269
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,680
被打败  他被赶出了他的领土
Overwhelmed, he's driven
from his territory

270
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,680
和永远离开了这个社区
and out of the colony forever.

271
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:37,280
繁殖季节几乎要结束了
而海豹们即将离开
The breeding season is almost over
and the seals will soon leave.

272
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:53,520
这个被遗弃的   这只受到了致命伤的海牛将死在这里
Now an outcast, this mortally
wounded bull will die here...

273
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,800
但他将作为赢家死去
..but he will die a winner.

274
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,280
他掌控领土的时间够长足以繁衍下一代
He held his territory for
long enough to father offspring.

275
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:29,880
自然界的成功全关乎繁衍下一代
Success in nature is all about
creating the next generation,

276
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,720
无论付出什么代价
whatever it takes.

277
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:57,280
一只雄性信天翁等待着他的伴侣从开阔的海洋回来
A male waved albatross waits for his
mate to return from the open sea.

278
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,680
这会是她吗
Could this be her?

279
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,640
或是这个
Or this?

280
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,240
有任何她身上熟悉的东西吗
Is there something familiar
about her?

281
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,520
相识
Recognition.

282
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,160
重逢
Reunited.

283
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:22,600
他们得以回复他们长久的关系
And they can resume
their long-standing relationship.

284
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,160
如果爱情 正如同我们所了解的那样 存在于大自然中
If love, as we understand it,
exists in nature,

285
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,720
这必定就是它了
then surely this must be it.

286
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:18,200
他们一生的纽带将帮助他们一起
Their lifelong bond will help them
face the final chapter

287
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,200
面对生命故事里的最后篇章
of life's story together,

288
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,000
父母关系
parenthood.

289
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:43,360
生命的故事团队发现的最意想不到的故事
One of the most unexpected stories
found by the Life Story team

290
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:48,120
是一只小鱼在沙子里做了一个麦田圈
was that of a small fish who makes
crop circles in the sand.

291
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,920
不幸的是 他是在南日本海的
Unfortunately, it builds them right
at the bottom of a bay

292
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,600
海湾正下方建造它的
in southern Japan.

293
00:49:54,600 --> 00:50:00,680
所以你将要如何拍摄一只在海底十三英尺深的小鱼呢
So how do you film a tiny fish,
13 metres under the sea?

294
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,520
水下专家卡梅隆 Hugh米勒的解决方案是 HughSpecialist underwater cameraman
Hugh Miller's solution

295
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,920
在海床建造一个影视棚
is to build a film studio
on the sea bed.

296
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,080
这是一个方框，一个方框盒
This is a quad, a quad pod.

297
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,880
它有点像三脚架但是他有四条腿
It's a bit like a tripod
but it's got four legs

298
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,640
使得我们能够将摄影机下沉到非常低的海床上
and lets us get the camera
very, very low to the sea bed.

299
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:27,760
这个金属三角形将会作为浮力光亮船桅
This metal triangle is going to be
the buoyant light rig,

300
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,640
因此他就像在海底的一丝微弱的光线
so it's like a little ray
of sunshine down at the bottom

301
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,000
但这是它首次被投入使用
of the sea, but this is
the first time it's been used

302
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,920
我们将看看它能否行得通
and we're going to find out
if it works or not.

303
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,760
Hugh也设计了一种水下起重机
Hugh has also designed
an underwater crane

304
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,240
来展示整个结构的复杂程度
to reveal the full complexity
of the nest structure.

305
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,400
但无论器具有多好   队伍仍需在一个巨大的海湾中
But however good the equipment,
the team will still have to find

306
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,560
寻找这条十二厘米长的鱼
the 12cm-long fish
in a big bay.

307
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,720
为了这个  他们前往请教专家
For that, they turn to the expert.

308
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,480
七十岁的 绘理 绪方
70-year-old Yogi Okata

309
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,400
首次发现神秘的麦田怪圈
first discovered the mysterious
crop circles

310
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,720
和制造它们的河豚鱼
and the puffer fish that makes them.

311
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,840
他和他的潜水伙伴东洋即将
He and his dive buddy Toyo
are going to search

312
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:16,760
探索海床方圆数英里的地希望能找到鱼
several square miles of sea bed,
hoping to locate a fish.

313
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,560
找到鱼很困难  伪装得很好
Fish is very difficult,
almost camouflaged very well,

314
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:31,360
就像沙子一样
因此我只能看到眼睛或者影子
like almost sandy, so just
I can see shadow or just eye.

315
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,720
这将会很困难
So it's very difficult.

316
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,280
但最终东洋和与仪得到了好消息
But eventually Toyo and Yogi
have good news,

317
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,520
他们找到了这个海湾里被证明是唯一的雄性河豚鱼
they've found what turns out to be
the only male fish in the bay.

318
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,720
十二英尺 好的
12 metres, yeah.

319
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,800
他们甚至画了一幅地图来让Hugh找到他
They've even drawn a map for
Hugh to find it.

320
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,800
如果我跟丢了
我就拿着这个
If I get lost,
I'll be holding this.

321
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,320
是时候搭建摄影棚了
Time to build the studio.

322
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,200
所有的器材都被带到了海床上以细心组装
All the kit is taken to the sea bed
to be carefully assembled.

323
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,400
最后的问题是几乎没有阳光
The last thing in place
is Hugh's little ray of sunshine.

324
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,600
鱼在几天内将不会开始筑巢
The fish won't start building
a new nest for several days,

325
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,160
所以仍有时间测试他对器材的反应
so there's time to test
his reaction to the kit

326
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:43,120
随着他将卵扇到他的老旧的 崩坏的巢穴
while he fans his eggs on his old,
disintegrating nest.

327
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,160
他显然面对摄像机不感到害羞
He's certainly not camera shy.

328
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,800
现在Hugh首次仔细看这条鱼
And now Hugh's had his first good
look at the fish.

329
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,920
最大的惊讶是这条鱼
The biggest surprise was the fish
is a little bit smaller

330
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,320
比我所希望的小了一点
than I first hoped.

331
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,800
事实上他大约只有，好吧，这点大小
In fact he's only, well,
he's really only about this big.

332
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,120
因此突然间面对可能只有我预计
And so to suddenly be faced
with a fish

333
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,560
中一半大小的鱼
that's probably half the size
of what I was hoping,

334
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,960
我认为这可能比我一开始所想的
I thought, well, this is going to be
a little bit harder

335
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,320
还要困难一点
than I first thought.

336
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,280
东洋和与仪保持着注意
Yogi and Toyo keep watch

337
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,040
而且不久他们便发现了这条鱼准备筑一个新巢
and it's not long before they spot
the fish starting to construct

338
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:24,960
与仪一度认为需要几天才能完工的
a new nest, which Yogi expects will
take him seven days to complete.

339
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,920
他三小时内完成了的事实惊讶了所有的人
He surprises everyone
by finishing it in three.

340
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:38,000
Yogi示意摄制组明天黎明要为
Yogi warns the crew
to be ready at dawn the next day

341
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,480
雌鱼的拜访做好准备
for a visit from a female fish.

342
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,160
他们花费三小时蹲在相机前
They spend three hours
crouched over the camera

343
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,800
来拍摄正如Yogi预料所展开的那样的行动
to film the action as it unfolds,
just as Yogi predicted.

344
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:00,960
发生了什么？  产卵
So what happened? Spawning!

345
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,680
逮到你们了！
We've got it.

346
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,000
这个小伙子做得很好了
The little chap was doing
very well for himself.

347
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,800
但这只雄性巢建得太快
But the male built his nest so fast

348
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,280
以至于Hugh没有时间拍摄从上而下的镜头
that Hugh never had time
to film a top-down shot

349
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,480
来揭示他最终辛勤工作的结果
for the ultimate reveal
of his hard work.

350
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:19,600
这要求摄制团队也成为建筑者
This requires the crew
to become builders too.

351
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:23,320
他们搭建了‘A’字骨架以
They build an A frame to hold
the camera perfectly steady

352
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,400
在巢穴之上稳固地支撑摄像机
well above the nest.

353
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:45,600
Yogi和东洋把框架放在老的巢穴附近
Yogi and Toyo position
the frame near to the old nest.

354
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,120
现在队伍只需要等待
Now the crew just have to wait

355
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:55,920
鱼完成照料他的蛋并且恢复继续建筑
for the fish to finish tending
his eggs and resume building.

356
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,080
但是几天之后
传来了坏消息
But a few days later,
there's bad news.

357
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:07,440
我们几天以来正收听着来自于南方的台风的新闻
We've been watching a typhoon system
far to the south of us

358
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,040
而到目前为止我们仍未确切感受到它
for a number of days, and we haven't
really felt its effects until now,

359
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,880
今天将会是河豚鱼
and today was going to be
the first day of the puffer fish

360
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,560
进行他下一轮建设的第一个循环
beginning its next cycle
of nest building,

361
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,200
它彻底被毁了
and it's been completely blown.

362
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,320
因此比起继续拍摄
So rather than going in
with the cameras

363
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,960
开始新一轮的循环
and starting the new cycle,
we're actually going in

364
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,480
我们开始修复起器材
这实在是很遗憾
just to recover equipment,
which is a real shame,

365
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,160
因为我们不知道接下来会发生什么
cos we don't know what's going
to happen next, really.

366
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:48,760
自从风暴过境以来已经经过了五天
It's five days before
the storm blows through.

367
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:53,360
最终海洋平静了下来  并且视线清晰度得以恢复
Finally, the sea calms down
and the visibility returns.

368
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,320
但对于Yogi和东洋
一切又回到了原点
But for Yogi and Toyo,
it's back to square one.

369
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,080
它们必须重新找一遍鱼
They must find the fish
all over again.

370
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:08,520
他们一天又一天地找  而东洋
担任着译员的角色，回复报告道：
Day after day they search, and Toyo,
acting as interpreter, reports back.

371
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:13,640
嗯...没巢穴...没有雄性
Um... No nest, no male.

372
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,200
消息稍微好了一些
The news gets slightly better.

373
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,120
我们找到了一条鱼
We find a fish.

374
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,280
只有一条但是没巢
Just one fish but no nest.

375
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,160
我们在二十米深处发现了他
We find the male
at the 20 metre deeps,

376
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,800
但是没有制作圆圈
but not make circle.

377
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,320
风暴拖延了这只鱼的建筑工作
The storm has put the fish off
his construction work.

378
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:43,800
时间到了  而队伍不情愿地开始
Time is up and the team reluctantly
start to dismantle

379
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,200
拆分摄影器材
the underwater studio.

380
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,440
但是这条鱼即将带给我们一个惊喜
But the fish has one more surprise
in store.

381
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,920
它发生在不能再更晚的时候  最后一次下潜
Well, it just couldn't come at
a later point, the last dive.

382
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,320
我们正准备收拾器材
We're, we're going in
to pull out the kit,

383
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:00,960
而那里正有一只正在筑巢的雄性

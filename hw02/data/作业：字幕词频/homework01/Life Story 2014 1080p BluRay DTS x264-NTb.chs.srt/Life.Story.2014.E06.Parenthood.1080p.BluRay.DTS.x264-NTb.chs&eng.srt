1
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,280
目前为止生命的故事里,
So far on life story

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,940
我们见到动物面对童年的挑战
we have seen animals face
the challenges of childhood...

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,170
成长
grow up

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,610
寻找他们在成年世界里的一席之地
..find their place
in the adult world...

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,820
赢得个伴侣
..and win a mate.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,390
现在 在生命故事里的最终章节里
Now, in the final chapter
of Life Story,

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,010
动物们成了父母
animals become parents.

8
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,540
他们的后代将成为未来的遗产
Their offspring will be
their legacy to the future

9
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,410
假如他们能够成功哺育它们的话
if they can raise them successfully.

10
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,320
在自然界里面没有什么能比
There is no stronger bond in nature

11
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,310
父母和他们的后代间更紧的联系了
than that between some parents
and their offspring.

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,320
刚过森林里的倭黑猩猩
Bonobos in the Congo rainforest.

13
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,380
他们是我们最亲近的亲戚
They are our closest relatives.

14
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,970
这个母亲的孩子将托付于她一生
This mother's youngster
is a lifelong commitment.

15
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,780
他在五岁之前将完全依靠他母亲
He will be totally dependent on her
until he's five years old.

16
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,300
并且他将在她剩余的生命里支持她
And she will continue to support him
for the rest of her life.

17
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,460
他们的关系或将持续三十年
Their relationship may last
30 years.

18
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,160
尽管他们之间的羁绊
Although the length of her
commitment is longer

19
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,470
比其他大部分的动物要长
than for most animals,

20
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,390
她同样承受着与其他父母同样巨大的挑战
she shares with many other parents
the same great challenge -

21
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,390
使她的后代儿女们健康安全
keeping her offspring healthy and
safe.

22
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,290
父母和年轻人之间的联系将会遭受各种各样的测试
The bond between parents and young
will be tested in many ways,

23
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,190
有些是次要的
有些则是生或死的区别
some minor,
and some a matter of life or death.

24
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,340
一个母亲的照料可能在孩子出生很早之前就开始了
And a parent's commitment
may begin long before birth.

25
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,620
在大珊瑚礁遥远的北方一角
The remote northern tip
of the Great Barrier Reef.

26
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,640
在海里度过三十年以后
After over three decades at sea,

27
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,890
这只雌性绿蠵龟即将回到
this female green turtle is
returning to the island

28
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,220
她产卵的海滩上
where she hatched.

29
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,110
轮到她产卵了
It's time for her to lay eggs...

30
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,540
但他们只会在干燥的沙地上产卵
..but they will only hatch
on dry land.

31
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,740
她必须离开凉爽的海洋 并且进入一个陌生的世界
She must leave the cool sea
and enter an alien world.

32
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,960
没有了水的支持
Without the support of water,

33
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,750
她感受到了重力的压力
she feels the full force of gravity.

34
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,230
她的蹼  专门用来游泳的
Her flippers,
so effective for swimming,

35
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,910
在沙地上几乎无用武之地
are almost useless on land.

36
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,030
但无论如何  他都必须拖着她笨重的身躯到海滩上
But, nonetheless, she has to haul
her great weight up the beach

37
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,420
并且远离潮汐的范围内
and get beyond
the reach of the tide.

38
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,190
乌龟们计算到达的时间
Turtles time their arrival

39
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,890
所以他们可以在凉爽的黑暗里
so that their laborious journey
up the beach

40
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,290
完成辛苦的旅程
is made in the cool of darkness.

41
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,240
在某一个夜晚里
On any one night,

42
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,700
三千只雌性绿蠵龟会聚集挤在这个岛屿来挖她们的巢
3,000 female turtles may crowd
this island to dig their nests.

43
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,860
现在留下后代的压力可能会使她丢掉她的性命
Now her compulsion to leave
offspring may cost her her life.

44
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,300
退去的潮水暴露了岩岸  一墙崎岖不平的岩石
The receding tide has exposed
the reef, a wall of jagged rock.

45
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,910
看起来就像不可翻越的屏障
It looks
an almost impassable barrier

46
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,260
对于一只精疲力竭的乌龟而言
for an already exhausted turtle.

47
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,370
但她不能等到潮水再次到来
But she can't wait for the tide
to return

48
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,240
因为很快这个岛屿
在火辣辣的热带太阳底下
because soon the island,
under the blazing tropical sun,

49
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,150
将热的难以忍受
will be intolerably hot.

50
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,990
除非她能翻越这座石头山
Unless she can get over
this rocky wall,

51
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,260
否则她将在她的壳里被烤熟
she will be baked in her shell.

52
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,850
这个致命的障碍物在每个繁殖季节都要了很多受害者的性命
This lethal obstacle course claims
many victims every nesting season.

53
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,500
一次的滑落可能会带来灾难
Just one slip could bring disaster.

54
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,780
她是如此地接近
She was so close.

55
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,730
但不代表着错过了所有的机会
But all may not be lost.

56
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,570
涨潮了
The tide is turning.

57
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,290
如果她被楔形物困住的话
她将会被淹死
If she is completely wedged,
she will drown.

58
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,060
但是上升的海水有可能将抬升助她脱困
But there is a chance that the
rising water could lift her free.

59
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,040
对于这个繁殖季节而言
For this breeding season,

60
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,020
他作为母亲的义务已经达成
her obligations as a mother
are over.

61
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,970
他将永远不会见到她的孩子们
She will never see her babies.

62
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,680
他们过两个月才能得以诞生，假如他们可以的话
They won't hatch for another
two months and, when they do,

63
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,580
他们必须在没有她的帮忙的情况下生存
they will have to survive
without any help from her.

64
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,680
其他的父母必须在孩子身旁形影不离地照顾着
Other parents have to remain close
to their young at all times

65
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,020
来保护他们远离危险
to protect them from danger.

66
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,870
加拿大的阿尔伯塔  一只水牛
A mother bison in Alberta, Canada.

67
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,130
他的小牛有一个星期多大
Her calf is little more
than a week old.

68
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,150
狼群们  很明智地  选择了最简单的目标
Wolves, sensibly,
select the easiest targets.

69
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,590
小牛们
The calves.

70
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,840
所以水牛母亲们尝试让小牛们呆在牛群的中间
So bison mothers try to keep their
young in the centre of the herd

71
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,270
在那里他们最安全
where they are safest.

72
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,190
但是当牛群在奔跑时就不完全是如此了
But that is not always possible
when the herd is on the run.

73
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,250
追逐或将持续二十五千米
The chase may continue
for 25km

74
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,200
狼群们尝试着追直到目标精疲力竭
as the wolves try to run
their targets to exhaustion.

75
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,020
狼群做出了他们的选择
The wolves make their choice.

76
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,550
她独自一人  但对于保护小牛却毫无畏惧
She is on her own, but she's
fearless in protecting her calf.

77
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,050
通过保持接近小牛
By keeping her calf close,

78
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,430
她成功地防御住了两个攻击者
she manages to hold off
both of her attackers.

79
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:15,440
但是另一只加了进来而她无法同时与三只进行搏斗
But another wolf joins in
and she can't fight three.

80
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,310
现在狼群们协作耗尽她的体力
Now the wolves work together
to wear her down.

81
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,690
森林就在不远处
The forest is not far off.

82
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,280
如果母亲和小牛能到达树林里
If mother and calf
can reach the trees,

83
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:55,350
他们或许就可以躲避狼群们保持足够长的距离
重新加入牛群里
they may be able to dodge the wolves
for long enough to re-join the herd.

84
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,350
但是攻击是如此的无情
But the attack is so unrelenting,

85
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,270
他们无法冲刺寻找遮蔽处
they can't make a dash for cover.

86
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,200
狼群们逐渐累了下来
The wolves are beginning to tire.

87
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,630
母亲看到了突破口
She sees an opportunity
to make a break for it.

88
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,880
再一次地  她阻挡了狼群的路径
Once again,
she blocks the wolves' path.

89
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,190
狼群在树林里跟丢了他们
And the wolves lose them
amongst the trees.

90
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,870
但是狼仍然是永远存在的隐患
But the wolves remain
an ever-present threat.

91
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,350
嚎叫
HOWLING

92
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,620
而这很可能将不会是
And this is unlikely to be
the last time

93
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,190
母亲必须为了小牛而战斗的最后一次
that this mother will
have to fight for her calf.

94
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,930
父母的责任看起来似乎是天生的
The duties of parenthood
may seem to be instinctive,

95
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,840
但仍然有需要学习的技巧
but there are some skills
that have to be learned.

96
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:09,410
一群哈奴曼叶猴 五十只 生活在印度的一个悬崖上
A troop of Hanuman langurs, 50
strong, living on a cliff in India.

97
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,320
这是一个巨大的家庭
有着各个年纪的成员
This is one huge family,
with members of all ages.

98
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,180
但只有一只成年雄性
But there is only one adult male.

99
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:25,300
他脸上的伤疤是他暴力过去的证明
His scarred face is
evidence of his violent past.

100
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,180
它是所有这些年轻人的父亲
He is the father
of all these youngsters.

101
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,420
对于这个初为父亲的刀疤脸而言
任务很少而且有不少好处
Fatherhood for Scarface
has few duties and many perks.

102
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,640
他获得了来自雌性很多的注意力
He gets plenty of attention
from the females...

103
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,960
作为父母采取了放任自由的方式
..and takes a somewhat hands-off
approach to parenting.

104
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,890
但是他的保护给了他的家庭
But his protection gives his family

105
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,250
成员们所需要用来成长和学习的
the safety and the space they need

106
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,780
安全和空间
to grow and learn.

107
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,120
这个群体最新加入的成员
The newest addition to the troop.

108
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,960
这个婴儿完全依靠着他的母亲而她溺爱着他
The baby is totally dependent
on his mother and she dotes on him.

109
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,400
但要想成为一个好母亲需要练习
But becoming a good mother
takes practice.

110
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,650
而一个年轻的雌性，未来的母亲
And a young female, a future parent,

111
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,190
正通过与其他母亲的婴儿玩耍学习者
is learning by playing mum
with someone else's baby.

112
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,990
她看起来含情脉脉
She seems affectionate enough.

113
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,680
这对于这个保姆而言是个宝贵的经验
This is valuable experience
for the baby-sitter.

114
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,470
现在她开始与他玩耍
But now she starts to play with it.

115
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,950
事情很快就失控了
And things get quickly out of hand.

116
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,110
婴儿尖叫
BABY SQUEALS

117
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,630
她看起来像要把婴儿从身上摇下来
She seems to want to
shake off the baby.

118
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,190
看起来需要增援了
Rescue, it seems, is at hand.

119
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,760
但这不是这个婴儿的母亲
But this isn't the baby's mother,

120
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,390
而是个经验甚至比前一只还要匮乏的另一个初学者
it's another learner with even
less of a clue than the last.

121
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,010
最终  婴儿真正的母亲
Eventually, the baby's real mother

122
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,760
觉得游戏进行的够久了
decides that this game has
gone on long enough.

123
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,190
她救下了她的婴儿并给与了一些正确的母亲的照料
She rescues her baby and gives it
some proper motherly care.

124
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,570
或许她容忍着这些未来或将成为保姆的行为
Perhaps she tolerates the behaviour
of these would-be baby-sitters

125
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,550
的原因是他们是近亲
because they're close relatives.

126
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,280
如此多的雌性在这个悬崖边聚集在一起不可避免的
So many females gathered together
on this cliff inevitably attract

127
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,900
吸引了敌对成年雄性的注意力
the attention of a rival adult male.

128
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,550
他的目标是打败刀疤脸并将他的妻子们抢过来
His aim is to defeat Scarface
and take over his females.

129
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,600
他带着一群被遗弃的单身汉上阵
He leads a group of outcast
bachelors into battle.

130
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,060
刀疤脸注意到了他
Scarface spots them.

131
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,610
刀疤脸没有输的余地 因为一旦他输了
He has everything to lose because,
if the bachelors defeat him,

132
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,970
他们将不仅仅夺走他的雌性们
they won't just take his females,

133
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,660
还会把孩子杀掉
they will kill his babies.

134
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,080
单身汉尝试着占领高地从而发动进攻
The bachelors try to reach the
high ground to launch their attack.

135
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,090
刀疤脸警告他们别靠近
Scarface warns them to keep
their distance,

136
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,590
但单身汉们持续前进
but the bachelors
continue their advance.

137
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,840
凶狠的吼叫
HARSH BARKS

138
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,980
刀疤脸磨着牙齿表示他已经动真格了
Scarface grinds his teeth to show
he means business.

139
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,330
但是单身汉领袖爬到了悬崖的顶端
But the bachelor leader
reaches the cliff top

140
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,200
同样磨牙进行回击
and grinds his teeth in response.

141
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,790
如果刀疤脸输掉了这场战斗
他将失去他的后代
If Scarface loses this battle,
he will lose his legacy.

142
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,830
进攻的时刻到了
Time to strike.

143
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,430
他瞄准了单身的领袖
He targets the bachelor leader.

144
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,470
叽叽叫
SCREECHING

145
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,080
刀疤脸获得了胜利
Scarface has won.

146
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,160
他回来受到了英雄般的欢迎
And he returns to a hero's welcome.

147
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,640
但这只是一个短暂的喘息
But it's only a temporary respite.

148
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,650
对于像刀疤脸一样的煞星而言
For a male langur like Scarface,

149
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,570
亲子关系既简单又危险
parenthood is simple, but dangerous.

150
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:24,720
她阻击了单身汉们并且拯救了他的后代
He has banished the bachelors
and saved his offspring,

151
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,650
至少到目前为止而言
for now at least.

152
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:37,830
其他的父母要想成功则需要专心致志
Success for other parents requires
total dedication.

153
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,670
一只非洲卷尾鸡
An African drongo.

154
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:50,650
她必须为她三颗蛋找到遮蔽酷热光线的地方
She has to shade her three eggs
from the scorching heat of the sun.

155
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,570
一旦小鸡孵化
As soon as the chicks hatch,

156
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:00,460
她将立刻与他们形成牢不可破的关系
she will form an immediate bond
with them that is unbreakable,

157
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,030
无论发生了什么
whatever happens.

158
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:18,110
经过了数百个小时的孵育后  她第一只小鸡
After hundreds of hours
of incubation...her first chick.

159
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,450
现在辛苦的工作真正开始了
Now the hard work really begins

160
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,030
因为新孵出的小鸡需要食物
because the newly hatched
chick needs food.

161
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,340
距离剩余两只加入进来不会太久了
It won't be long before one mouth
is joined by two more

162
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,110
这只小鸡将需要一起分享母亲带回来的食物
and this chick will then have to
share what the female brings back.

163
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,920
或者他会吗
Or will it?

164
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,070
小鸡排除着任何有可能的竞争
The chick is getting rid of any
competition.

165
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,600
他想要母亲只注意他一个
It wants its mother's sole
attention.

166
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,560
喂食时间
Feeding time.

167
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,400
有什么变化  但是什么呢
Something has changed. But what?

168
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,610
疯狂的啾啾叫
FRANTIC CHIRRUPING

169
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,370
她小鸡明亮橙色的嘴
The sight of her chick's bright
orange mouth

170
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,040
要求她带来更多的食物
demands that she brings more food.

171
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,780
蛋几乎和小鸡一样重
The egg weighs
almost as much as the chick.

172
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,830
这就像把一块石头推上山坡
It's like pushing a boulder uphill.

173
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:52,010
小鸡在他的背部上有空心的构造
能够帮助他支撑这个重量
The chick has a hollow in its back
that helps it manoeuvre its load.

174
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,260
母亲的后代被减少到了只剩这只小鸡
The mother's brood has been reduced
to just this one chick

175
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,600
现在他获得了她全部的注意力了
and it now has her total attention.

176
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,290
当她没有外出寻找食物的时候
她将小鸡藏了起来
When she's not away gathering food,
she shades the chick.

177
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:44,920
但任何时候他需要食物的时候她将立刻做出反应
And she responds instantly
whenever it demands to be fed.

178
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,930
超过三个星期内每天如此
Every day for over three weeks,

179
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,430
她带来数打顿饭
she brings it dozens of meals.

180
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:13,250
她的小鸡看起来从不停止进食  或者成长
Her chick never seems to stop
eating, or stop growing.

181
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,420
附近还有一个卷尾鸡的巢
There is another drongo's nest
nearby

182
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,550
里头有三只小鸡
and that has three chicks in it.

183
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,160
但他们看起来不太像她的东西
But they don't look quite
the same as hers.

184
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:04,820
那是因为她正哺育着陌生人
That is because she is raising
an alien...

185
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,390
杜鹃的幼鸟
the chick of a cuckoo.

186
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,520
杜鹃把他们的蛋生到其他鸟类的巢里
Cuckoos lay their eggs
in the nests of other birds

187
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,550
把辛苦的养育工作留给其他人
and leave the hard labour of rearing
the chick to someone else.

188
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,010
杜鹃的蛋和卷尾鸟的蛋如此相似
The cuckoo's egg matched
the drongo's egg so perfectly

189
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,600
以至于收养的母亲也被欺骗了
that this foster mother
has been completely deceived.

190
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,030
在其他的卷尾巢里
小鸟们即将起步
Over at the other drongo nest,
the chicks are now fledging.

191
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,140
他们的父母们成功地
Their parents have succeeded

192
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:45,140
创造了他们的下一代
in producing their very own
next generation,

193
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,400
而她养育了一只怪物
while she has raised a monster.

194
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,720
她的爱
是盲目的Her love is blind.

195
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,890
回到刚果
Back in the Congo,

196
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:40,400
倭黑猩猩母亲对她婴儿的照料持续着
the mother bonobo's long-term
commitment to her baby continues.

197
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,500
今天 她正展示着
Today, she's demonstrating

198
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:56,710
如何在距离地三十公尺的空中建造一张床
the tricky art of making
a bed 30 feet above the ground,

199
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,880
来为午间的小睡做准备
in preparation for a midday siesta.

200
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,550
教学完毕
她很好地使用了这个手工作品
Lesson over,
she puts her handiwork to good use.

201
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,720
对于一个忙绿的母亲而言
额外的午睡总是很受欢迎的
For a busy mother,
an extra nap is always welcome.

202
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:40,250
但婴儿看起来很无聊
But Baby seems bored.

203
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,740
他的母亲仍然是他世界的中心
His mother is still
the centre of his world

204
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,550
和他最欢的玩伴
and his favourite playmate.

205
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,480
她尝试着无视他
但是他不会因此而消停
She tries to ignore him,
but he won't be put off.

206
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,720
最终 她放弃了
Eventually, she gives in.

207
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,920
整个家庭都在行动当中
The whole family is on the move.

208
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,170
在倭黑猩猩的社会里
In bonobo society,

209
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:02,110
知识一代又一代地被传递下去
knowledge is passed down
from one generation to the next.

210
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:06,180
他们的母亲即将向年轻人展示
The mothers are going to show
their youngsters

211
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,990
森林里最重要的地方之一
one of the most important places in
the forest.

212
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,990
一个生长着百合花的特别的池塘
A special pool
where water lilies grow.

213
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:29,250
水百合含有对健康重要的矿物质
Water lilies contain minerals
important for health,

214
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:32,600
倭黑猩猩们无法从别处获得
and the bonobos can't get them
anywhere else.

215
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,680
孩子们通过观察母亲学习该吃什么东西
Baby learns
what to eat by watching Mum.

216
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:10,000
她把百合茎分给了他们
And she shares
the lily stalks with him.

217
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:29,140
她已经向他们展示到哪里获取重要的食物补充
She's shown him where to get
an important supplement to his diet

218
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,400
他甚至不用弄湿他的脚
and he didn't even
have to get his feet wet.

219
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:40,550
她将继续帮助他认识这片森林
She will continue to help him
to learn about the forest

220
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:45,200
再过五年
在他家庭的保护下
for another five years,
within the protection of his family.

221
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:00,080
但是很少有年轻人能在在像这样安全的环境下长大
But few youngsters are raised
in such a secure environment.

222
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:26,610
这只年轻斑马诞生的地方正逐渐变得干燥
The land where this young zebra
was born is drying out.

223
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:31,680
他的母亲必须带领着他横渡河流来获取新鲜的青草
Its mother must lead it across
the river to reach fresh grazing.

224
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,480
她面临着关键的选择
She faces a critical decision.

225
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,360
从哪里跨越过去
Where to cross.

226
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:53,090
她六个星期大的小马驹的生命由她决定
The life of her six-week-old foal
hangs on her decision.

227
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,040
不光光是鳄鱼形成了威胁
It's not just crocodiles
that pose a threat.

228
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,280
从这里跨越太危险了
Crossing here is too dangerous.

229
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:58,730
在较远的下流处   或许有一个更适合穿越的地方
Further downstream, perhaps
this is a better place to cross.

230
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,630
那里猎食者比较少  但流速快
There are fewer predators,
but the river is fast

231
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,280
还有危险的急流
and has treacherous rapids.

232
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,450
这是一次艰难的选择
It's a difficult decision.

233
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:02,700
一旦母亲做出了决定
同时做出了小马驹的决定
Once a mother commits herself,
she commits her foal,

234
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:05,240
她将对此爱莫能助
and there will be nothing
she can do to help it.

235
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:47,270
水流如此之强
以至于带着他们顺流而下
The current is so strong,
it carries them downstream

236
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:50,130
穿越坏脾气的河马群
through the territory of
ill-tempered hippos...

237
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,840
前往危险的湍流里
..and towards the rapids.

238
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,740
断断续续的叫声
STACCATO BARKING

239
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:04,340
穿越这里的决定被证明是个好想法
The decision to cross here
has proved to be a good one,

240
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,090
但仅仅是这次
but only just.

241
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:28,600
母亲引领者小马驹
This mother has led her foal

242
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:32,560
度过了他年轻的生命里最危险的时光
through the most dangerous
moment of its young life.

243
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,350
通过保证小马驹的安全
By keeping her foal safe,

244
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,930
他通过了作为母亲重要的测试
she has passed
this critical test of motherhood.

245
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,020
东非 安博塞利的黎明
Dawn in Amboseli, East Africa.

246
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,700
一个象群
A family of elephants.

247
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,580
年轻人正安稳地睡着觉
The young are sleeping peacefully,

248
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,480
被一堵由母亲们和祖母们
surrounded by a protective wall

249
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,730
所组成的包围墙所包围
of mothers and grandmothers.

250
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:11,520
每个早上带领着小象朝着自立更进一步
Each morning brings the calves
a little closer to independence.

251
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:36,830
他们或许是成功的父母
They may be successful parents,

252
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,250
但是对于他们在早晨唤醒年轻人仍有困难
but they still have trouble getting
the youngsters up in the morning.

253
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:11,330
在这个族群里有三代人  家庭成功的证明
There are three generations in this
herd, proof of the family's success.

254
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:29,780
他们找到了一个年长雄性的骸骨
They have found
the bones of an old female.

255
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:57,220
即使是幼儿们也被他们祖先的骨头给吸引了
Even the babies are intrigued
by these relics of their ancestors.

256
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,810
我们当然无从得知他们在想什么
We can't, of course,
know what they're thinking,

257
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,310
但是他们碰这些骨头的时候有种敏锐的感觉
but there is a delicacy in the way
they touch these bones,

258
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,870
这暗示着他们有些特殊的关系在里面
which suggests that they have some
special relevance.

259
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:33,590
或许大象有一种共同历史的感觉
Perhaps elephants have a sense
of a shared history.

260
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,870
这种经验似乎带领着他们彼此更近了
The experience seems to bring them
even closer together.

261
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,720
兽群里的每只动物都属于某个家庭谱系
Every animal in the herd belongs
to a family line

262
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:28,220
可以延伸追溯到数不清的代数之前
that stretches back through
numberless generations.

263
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,750
每只能在这里
And each is here

264
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,620
因为他们的祖先全都是生存游戏的胜者
because their ancestors were
all winners in the game of life.

265
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,840
某只个体动物成功的机会
An individual animal's
chance of success

266
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:09,660
根据他的种类而不同
varies according to its kind,

267
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:13,250
和他们的父母施与它们身上的爱
and to the care lavished upon it
by its parents.

268
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,610
大多数的年轻倭黑猩猩都能存活
Most young bonobos survive
childhood.

269
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:31,790
但最终  每个都必须找出属于自己通往世界的道路
But, eventually, each will have
to find its own way in the world.

270
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:50,770
他可能需要同伴一同面对危险
It may need allies to face
up to danger.

271
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:59,610
他将需要寻找自己在社会上的位置
It will have to find its own
place in society.

272
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,460
它将上演求爱的游戏
It will play the mating game...

273
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:19,770
..成为一个父母....
..become a parent...

274
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:28,710
..最终通过留下自己的后代
..and eventually achieve
a form of immortality

275
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,660
获得一种形式上的不朽
by leaving its own offspring.

276
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:44,050
不曾有过两段完全相同的生命旅程
No two journeys through life
are ever the same...

277
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,220
每个就像手指印一样独一无二
..each is as unique as a
fingerprint.

278
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:03,850
母亲的生命是成功的
This mother's life has been
a success.

279
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:10,940
但对于每一个新一代而言  旅途将全部重新开始
But for each new generation, the
journey will begin all over again.

280
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:15,090
这就是生命伟大的故事
It's life's great story.

281
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:35,600
倭黑猩猩生活在地球上最人迹罕至的地方
Bonobos live in the most
impenetrable forest on Earth -

282
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:37,130
刚果
the Congo.

283
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,560
卡梅隆。罗夫。斯坦曼
Cameraman, Rolf Steinmann,

284
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:43,870
在世界上某些最壮观的开阔土地上工作
has worked in some of the world's
great open landscapes,

285
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,950
但不曾有地方如此
but never anywhere like this.

286
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,920
他的愿望是拍摄倭黑猩猩
His hope is to film scenes
of the bonobos' lives

287
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:53,210
之前从未被捕捉到的生活情景
that have never been captured before

288
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:56,220
并且或许能对我们的过去一窥究竟
and perhaps gain a glimpse
into our own past.

289
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,080
随同的有摄像助手  艾德 安德森
Accompanied by camera assistant,
Ed Anderson,

290
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:04,980
他们深入到非洲雨林里旅行
they journey deep
into the African rainforest.

291
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,310
尽管到探索营地有六英里
Despite a 16—mile walk to the
research camp,

292
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,080
洛夫的情绪很高昂
Rolf's spirits are high.

293
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:15,560
这真的很令人激动并且我认为
It's really exciting and I think...

294
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:19,220
毫无疑问这是我走到的最偏远的地方
it's definitely the most remote
location I have ever walked to.

295
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:28,020
Luikotale探索营地将会是接下来七星期里他们的家
The LuiKotale research camp will be
their home for the next seven weeks.

296
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,360
他们前往到森林里
They head out into the forest

297
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:36,670
穿着面罩  以免把人类病毒传染给了倭黑猩猩们
wearing facemasks to protect
the bonobos from human diseases.

298
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:46,200
他们为了追踪倭黑猩猩徒步行走超过十二英里
They hike over 12 miles
following the bonobos

299
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:48,480
并且最终 罗夫首次看到了
and, eventually,
Rolf gets his first view.

300
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,520
我会说   这是相当特殊的一天
It was a pretty special day,
I would say.

301
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:55,410
这是我第一个倭黑猩猩日
That was my first bonobo day.

302
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,920
这毫无疑问很令人叹为观止
It was absolutely breathtaking,

303
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:00,290
看着他们的脸
looking into their faces,

304
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:01,840
照看婴儿们
seeing the babies.

305
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:05,560
我的意思是  你可以确实感受到他们是我们的近亲
I mean, you can really feel
that they're close relatives to us.

306
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:10,130
我的意思是  就好像你被一群非常小的人类包围了起来
I mean, it feels like you are
surrounded by very little humans.

307
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,800
但他很快就发现这样好的天气并不典型
But he quickly discovers
that such a good day isn't typical.

308
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,640
大声叹气
HE SIGHS HEAVILY

309
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:22,510
植物太多了  我看不清楚
There is so much vegetation,
I can't get a clear view,

310
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,940
完全不可能
it's totally impossible.

311
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,740
这片丛林的茂密程度带来了另外一个问题
And the very density of this forest
creates other filming problems.

312
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,360
我们正从森林里走回来
We're walking back to
camp from the forest,

313
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:48,290
现在是下午三点三十分   这并非拍摄效果  毫无疑问是昏暗
it's 3.30pm, this is not a camera
effect, it really is this dark.

314
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:50,040
当太阳尚未出现的时候
When the sun isn't out,

315
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,820
有时感觉就像夜里一样
it feels like the middle of the
night sometimes.

316
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:02,380
艾德和罗夫的困难不断在增加者
Ed and Rolf's difficulties
just continue to mount.

317
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,360
倭黑猩猩进入到了森立最深处，最茂密的地方
The bonobos went into the deepest,
densest part of the forest,

318
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:11,460
要跟踪他们真的很困难
it's really hard to follow them.

319
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:19,740
高达百分之九十的湿度正给相机带来麻烦
The 90% humidity is causing
trouble for the camera.

320
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,980
更糟的是  他们很快就遭遇到了其他森林的住户
And worse, they soon encounter some
of the other forest inhabitants.

321
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,710
这里全是蚂蚁
It's all full of ants here.

322
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,300
我没法带着这个背包穿越这里
I can't get through there with
the big backpack.

323
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,510
到处都是蚂蚁！
Ants are everywhere!

324
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,140
啊蚂蚁到处咬我
Ah, they're biting me everywhere.

325
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,380
他们总想要鲜肉
They always want to
get to the flesh.

326
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,000
不  你不可以进入那里
No, you don't get in there.

327
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:58,230
(和谐)  他们那里都咬
BLEEP! They are biting everywhere!

328
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:03,380
啊 （和谐） 这一点都不有趣  真的很痛  走开 哦我的老天
 Ah, BLEEP! It's not really fun, it's
really painful. Go away. Ah. Oh, God.

329
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,180
我必须从这里出去
I just have to get out of this.

330
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:13,890
哇
Wow.

331
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,390
我们如何除掉这些白蚁呢
How should we get rid of
all these termites?

332
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,900
我意思是  那很糟糕
I mean, that is serious.

333
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,090
热量和湿度
The heat and humidity,

334
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,560
这个跋山涉水的旅程和昆虫
比罗夫所担心的还要更糟
the trekking and the insects
are worse than Rolf had feared.

335
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:32,450
但带给他最大的挫折是
But causing him most distress

336
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,930
几乎没法拍摄那些倭黑猩猩们
is hardly ever being able to
film the bonobos.

337
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:40,400
你看到的东西里面有九成没法被拍摄
90% of the things you see
you can't film.

338
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:44,360
如此昏暗   植被又如此之多
It's so dark,
there's so much vegetation

339
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:47,830
动物们总是在错误的地点
and the animals are always
in the wrong spot.

340
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,750
我觉得这变得越来越让人沮丧了
It is pretty much as frustrating
as it gets, I think.

341
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,930
你真的必须学习如何面对这些挫折
You really have to learn to deal
with all the frustration

342
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:02,580
变成类似于禅师那样  并且控制你的情绪
and become some kind of Zen master
and suppress your emotions.

343
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:07,240
否则你将这里将冒着相当高的疯掉的可能性
Otherwise you face a high risk here
to get insane.

344
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,550
*我是摄影人*
*我是摄影人*
I am the lucky cameraman.
I am the lucky cameraman.

345
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,140
*我是幸运的摄影人*
I am the lucky cameraman.

346
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,900
三个星期的跋山涉水
Three weeks of trekking

347
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:28,990
最终猩猩家庭出现了  在空旷地里
and finally the bonobo family
appear, briefly, in the open.

348
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,670
（就在那里 倭黑猩猩在一根圆木头上 彻底放松着
(There the bonobos are on a log,
totally relaxed.

349
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:42,220
（我拍摄到的到目前为止最棒的镜头  太惊人了）
(I've got my best shots so far,
it's amazing!)

350
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,160
但是倭黑猩猩很快再次消失
But the bonobos soon disappear again

351
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,020
又回到了每天艰苦的丛林生活里了
and it's back
to the daily grind of forest life.

352
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,100
嗡嗡
BUZZING

353
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,930
啊 这些汗蜂要让我抓狂了
Ah, these sweat bees make me crazy.

354
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:11,740
他们开始拍摄时的乐观态度已经无影无踪了
The optimism with which they began
this shoot is long gone.

355
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:16,550
今天到目前为止我们已经前进了二十五公里
Today, we've already
walked 25km

356
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:20,900
穿过了一些最浓密，最厚的森林
through some of the densest,
thickest jungle so far.

357
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,750
我们没拍到任何一张倭黑猩猩的镜头
We didn't get a single
shot of the bonobos.

358
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,420
是的 经常这里就像个海军训练的营地
Yeah, it sometimes
feels like a boot camp here.

359
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:33,660
总有一天....你只想忘记这些...
Some days...you just want to forget.

360
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,420
这种经历让人精疲力竭
The experience is simply exhausting.

361
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,380
最终  完美的瞬间
Finally, the perfect moment.

362
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:58,720
就在我们白天第一次扎营的时候
Right when we get our first
nesting in the daytime,

363
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,910
真的相当漂亮的角度   完美的位置
really beautiful angle,
perfect position,

364
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:03,550
相机停止了运行
the camera stopped working

365
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,910
现在我们必须返回营地  离开倭黑猩猩们
and now we have to go back to camp,
leaving the bonobos,

366
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:10,560
希望我们能让相机重新工作
and hope that we can make
the camera work again.

367
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,630
是的  我们真的不知道该说什么了
Yeah, don't know really what to say.

368
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:15,840
等到拿到新相机的时候
By the time they've got
a new camera,

369
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,280
倭黑猩猩们都彻底消失了
the bonobos have
completely disappeared.

370
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,190
保罗 保罗 保罗 这是艾德
保罗 保罗  这是艾德
Paul, Paul, Paul, this is Ed.
Paul, Paul, this is Ed.

371
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:23,780
保罗进来
 Come in, Paul.

372
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,440
我们听不见他们
We can't hear them,

373
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,840
我们找不到任何踪迹
we can't find any tracks,

374
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,430
因此看起来不是很乐观
so it doesn't look very promising.

375
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:36,830
罗夫能对艰苦环境免疫
Rolf is hardened
to tough conditions,

376
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:40,750
但无法承受拍摄不到清晰照片的挫折
but not the frustration of
so rarely getting a clear shot.

377
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,810
四天以后
Four days later,

378
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:50,270
倭黑猩猩们被定位
the bonobos have been located,

379
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:51,650
但他们仍然处于移动当中
but they're on the move.

380
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:56,080
他们正朝着北方前进
They're heading north

381
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,840
因此他们将有相当大进入到沼泽范围的可能性
so there's a good chance that they
go into the swamps

382
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,920
因此我们只能观察
and so we just speculate

383
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,550
朝着沼泽跑过去
and run towards the swamps

384
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:04,460
或许我能在那里发现他们
and perhaps we find them there.

385
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,110
在如此多的失望之后
After so much disappointment,

386
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:13,710
罗夫的艾德决心找到他们
Rolf and Ed are determined
to find them.

387
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:24,680
与胜算反常 相当不可思议地
Quite against the odds,

388
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,550
他们的决心获得了回报
their determination pays off.

389
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,830
罗夫捕捉到了第一张照片
Rolf captures the first-ever images

390
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:33,860
倭黑猩猩采集百合花的照片
of a family of bonobos
harvesting lilies.

391
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:43,070
一个仿佛窥视到我们过去的场景
A scene that feels much
like a glimpse into our own past.

392
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,300
这就是罗夫所希望的一切
It's everything Rolf had hoped for.

393
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:58,470
在这片土地上   我们能够办到简直是荒唐的 这是荒唐的
In this terrain, it's ridiculous that
we made it, that is ridiculous!

394
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:00,130
要想拍摄是不可能的
It's impossible to film that,


395
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:02,630
这简直就是不可能的  而我们办到了！
it's simply impossible
and we filmed it!

396
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:05,140
我难以置信  太棒了！
I can't believe it, it's so good!

397
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:18,280
我们的生活或许和我们最接近的亲戚看起来有许多不同
Our lives may seem very different
from those of our closest relatives,

398
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:22,200
但是在表面之下
我们仍然共同面对着
but beneath the surface,
we still share the same challenges

399
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:26,820
每一个动物在他的一生中所需要面对的挑战
that every animal faces in its
own Life Story.

00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:37,20

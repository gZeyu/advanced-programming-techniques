不是所多玛  而是塞勒姆
Not Sodom, but Salem.

31
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,200
{\an8}所多玛是因其罪恶被上帝所灭的城镇

32
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,800
如果我们能容忍这种伤风败俗的人或事
We cannot expect god to be on our side

33
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,050

34
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,770
你们俩将被通宵被锁在这里

He tolerated your father,

但他可不会容你在这放肆

Yes, yes, if I have to spend one more night

59
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,680

我宁愿死在战场上
I'd rather die fighting the French and the Indians

61
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,580
也不愿在这被人侮辱
than get pissed on by the good souls of Salem.

So, you're really leaving.

This is all that I have.

虽然战争无情
Though there are things to be said for war.

82
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,360
但对某些人来说  战死沙场
Gives a certain kind of man someplace to end up

83
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,160
远比被处以极刑
other than the end of a brand...

84
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,000
更有意义
or a rope.

You'll thank me one day.

塞勒姆没有那孩子的容身之地
There is no place for that child in Salem.

George Sibley drove John Alden off to die in the war.

What do you think he's gonna do to you

不要害怕森林
Do not fear the woods.

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,210
不  是他儿子柯顿
No, his son -- Cotton.

148
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,460
只可惜他比起父亲差远了  就是个废物
And not a chip off the old block -- barely a splinter.

149
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,890
我记得我们小时候
I remember when we were kids

150
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,190
他就穿得跟个姑娘似的
he used to dress like a girl.

151
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,460
打起架来也扭扭捏捏
Fought like one, too.

152
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,620
他现在长大了
Well, he's all growed-up now.

153
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,130
长成了满身缠着绫罗绸缎的傻子
A fine fool in fine silk clothes,

154
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,560
但不是普通的傻子  而是最危险的那种
and not just any fool, the most dangerous kind --

155
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,570
自以为无所不知
the kind that thinks he knows everything.

156
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,260
你回来不是为了听这些屁话的吧
But you didn't come back for all this horseshit.

157
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,960
你回来的目的只有一个
You come back for one thing and one thing only.

158
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,320
说实话  她现在过得很好
Truth told, she's finer than ever.

159
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,090
她是塞勒姆最富有的女人
And she's the richest woman in Salem.

160
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,900
为什么呢
And why not?

161
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,660
因为她现在是西布里的妻子
She's mary Sibley now.

162
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,470
{\pos(222.154,201.273)}西布里宅

163
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,590
西布里
Sibley?

164
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,730
乔治·西布里
George Sibley.

165
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,050
但他妻子...
But his wife --

166
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,700
几年前去世了
Died a few years ago.

167
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,990
你离开太长时间了  约翰
You've been gone a long time, John.

168
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,220
时刻做好准备吧
Keep your powder in your bag.

169
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,170
有一天
One day,

170
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,230
你的玛丽会成为我们国家最富有的寡妇
your Mary will be the richest widow in the country.

171
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,100
司机来了
The driver's at the door

172
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,680
带来了您的包裹  夫人
with some packages for you, ma'am.

173
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:25,980
让他进来
Send him in.

174
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,070
纳撒尼尔  带西布里先生一起走吧
And, Nathaniel, take Mr. Sibley with you.

175
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,640
到洗澡时间了
Time for his bath.

176
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,910
艾萨克  现在告诉我都有哪些新闻吧
Now, Isaac, tell me some news of the world.

177
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,720
今天看到一个人风尘仆仆地进城了
Saw a dusty fella walking into town today.

178
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,880
我简直不敢相信自己的眼睛
I couldn't believe my eyes.

179
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,160
为什么
Why?

180
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,900
那个人是约翰·奥登
It was John Alden.

181
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,120
欢迎回来  麦哲牧师
Welcome back, Reverend Mather.

182
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,090
朗姆酒   杜松子酒和麦芽酒
Rum, gin, ale?

183
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,620
好
Yes.

184
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,970
我需要三个身强体壮的人
I need three strong men.

185
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,920
我会付钱的
I can pay.

186
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,020
干什么
For what?

187
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,710
去制服一个姑娘
To subdue a girl.

188
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,510
路易丝牧师
Reverend Lewis.

189
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,240
求你帮帮我女儿
Please help my daughter.

190
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,120
注意安全
And be careful.

191
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,040
绑住她
Tie her down!

192
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,960
绑住她
Tie her down!!

193
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,580
求你了  牧师  求你了  救救我
Please, I beg you, sir. Please, make this stop.

194
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,950
梅西  我也无能为力  除非你告诉我
I can do nothing, Mercy, unless you tell me...

195
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,780
是谁在折磨你
Who is it torments you?

196
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,300
她就在那里
S-she's right there.

197
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,540
她
"She"?

198
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,890
谁在这里
Who is here?

199
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,480
梅西  你必须告诉我
Mercy, you must tell me!

200
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,220
这里还有谁
Who is in this room with us?!

201
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,370
那个女巫  那个老太婆
The hag! The old woman!

202
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,430
她就站在那里
She's standing right there!

203
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,740
求你了
Please.

204
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,630
这是药
A simple physic.

205
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,650
帮你入睡
To sleep.

206
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,400
求你了  求你了
Please. Please.

207
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,610
我们称之为魔鬼侵袭...
We call it a spectral attack --

208
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,470
是女巫所为
The work of witches.

209
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,580
为她祈祷吧
Pray for her.

210
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,220
一派胡言
I call bullshit.

211
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,580
她显然是精神失常了
She's clearly touched in the head.

212
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,730
她需要医生  不是祷告
She needs a doctor, not your prayers.

213
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,380
别磨蹭  孩子
Don't dawdle, child.

214
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,270
我要你坐到前排
I want you in the front row

215
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,120
柯顿·麦哲定会为你的魅力而倾倒
Where Cotton Mather can't help but be dazzled by your charms.

216
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,470
看在上帝的份上  母亲
For heaven's sake, mother,

217
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,030
干脆把我裹进丝绸  放到拍卖会上好了
why not just wrap me in silk and parade me on the auction block?

218
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,400
人类的战争不足为惧
Fear no man's war.

219
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,980
只有来自地狱的战火能摧毁塞勒姆
For only a war from hell could destroy Salem.

220
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,530
决不能让魔鬼
The devil was never going to let

221
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,780
不费一兵一卒
a promised land be built here

222
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,400
就攻占这里
without a fight, without a battle!

223
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,150
巫师所拥有致命的恶意
And witches armed with deadly malice

224
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,740
便是最为狠毒而阴险的武器
are the most malignant and insidious weapons

225
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,280
在这场战役
in that battle,

226
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,670
这场战争中
in that war.

227
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,340
只要塞勒姆有一个巫师  便足以毁灭
Even a single witch in Salem is enough to destroy

228
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,440
我们所建立的一切  和我们所有的远大愿景
everything we have built and ever hope to build here!

229
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,260
如今  我们已经处决了三名巫师
Now, we have already killed three of them,

230
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,480
但他们的恶意仍未消逝
and yet their malice continues unabated.

231
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,480
为什么
Why?

232
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,070
因为我们之中仍有巫师存在
Because there are still witches here among us!

233
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,670
或许就在这座大厅里
Perhaps in this very hall!

234
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,540
设想这些在暗处的敌人  拥有未知的武器和巫术
Imagine a foe you can't see armed with weapons unknown

235
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,450
看上去却和常人别无二致
and the ability to appear as any one of us!

236
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,970
既然如此  你希望谁来指认罪犯
Then how can you hope to identify the correct culprit?

237
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,330
你见过那个女孩了吗  先生
Have you seen the girl, sir?

238
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,740
即使现在  梅西·路易丝遍体鳞伤
Even now, Mercy Lewis bleeds from 100 wounds --

239
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,370
这些伤绝不会是自残所致
some impossible to self-inflict.

240
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,910
她将向我们指认犯罪之人
She is the one who will tell us who does this.

241
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,020
我明白了
I see.

242
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,660
重病缠身的可怜女孩  她的疯言疯语
The ravings of a poor, sick girl

243
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,480
就能解释你这说不清的逻辑了吗
will help you identify what your reason fails to deliver.

244
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,510
我父亲
My father --

245
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:36,070
是  没错  你父亲
Yes, of course. Your father.

246
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:41,030
备受大家尊崇的  你的父亲
Did your father, whom we all so respect,

247
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,600
让你代替他过来帮忙的时候
offer you any advice when he sent you in his stead

248
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,970
提供什么建议了吗
to our aid?

249
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,420
他给出了警告
He...advised caution.

250
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,410
警告
Caution?

251
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,620
因为小麦哲的警告
And are we to take three people hung

252
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,150
我们就要将三人绞死吗
as the measure of Mather Junior's caution?

253
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,190
在塞勒姆  甚至在全国
There could be nothing worse for Salem,

254
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,050
没有比巫师追捕行动更可怕的事了
for the country, than a witch hunt.

255
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,160
巫师
Witches.

256
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,840
巫师
Witches.

257
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,280
正是
Indeed.

258
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:26,580
正如我亲爱的丈夫  你们的执行官所言
As my beloved husband, the head of your selectmen, reminds me,

259
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,480
还有比巫师追捕行动更可怕的东西
there is something worse than a witch hunt --

260
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,400
那就是巫师
a witch.

261
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,360
巫师
A witch?

262
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,220
那一定很可怕
Sure, that's bad.

263
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,880
为什么不是食人魔
But why not an ogre...

264
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,100
或是哥布林
or a goblin?

265
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,940
既然要说神话生物  为什么不能是龙
Why not a dragon, long as we're talking about fairy tales?

266
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,430
约翰·奥登
John Alden.

267
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,770
感谢你多年来对我们的英勇守护
We all welcome captain alden home from his long,

268
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,040
欢迎回家  奥登上尉
long service in our defense.

269
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,670
清教徒自知势力衰减
Puritans know their sun is setting.

270
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,910
没什么比新的敌人  或者新的老对手
Nothing like a new enemy or a new old enemy

271
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,650
更能笼络人心了
to get people behind you.

272
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,360
奥登上尉
Captain Alden.

273
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,170
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley.

274
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,550
西布里先生和我明晚会举办小型晚宴
Mr. Sibley and I are hosting a small dinner tomorrow night.

275
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,890
你的到来将使舍下蓬荜生辉
We'd be honored if you'd join.

276
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,880
为什么盯着我
Why are you staring at me?

277
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,130
我甚至不认识你
I don't even know you.

278
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,290
艾萨克
Isaac?

279
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,460
私通者艾萨克
Isaac the fornicator.

280
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,670
藏好你的妻子
Hide your wives.

281
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,720
你的女儿  连羊都得小心点
Hide your daughters. Hell, your sheep!

282
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,620
好吧
All right, look.

283
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,810
你想要我怎么做
So, what do you want from me?

284
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,230
听我说  约翰·奥登
Listen to me, John Alden.

285
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,480
离开战场回到塞勒姆
Coming home to Salem to get out of the war

286
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,920
就好比穿越刀山  又跳入火海
is like jumping in the ocean to get out of the rain.

287
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,020
真相秘而不宣
Truth hides.

288
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,310
谁都可能会是他们
They could be anyone.

289
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,810
拜托  他们  他们是谁
Oh, they who? Who's they?

290
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,040
巫师
Witches!

291
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,170
不是神话传说
Ain't no fairy tale.

292
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,700
巫师是真实存在的
They're real.

293
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,750
这些年来
All these years,

294
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,790
你的玛丽是唯一向我施以援手的人
your Mary's the only one who's ever done me a good turn.

295
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,050
她不再是我的玛丽了
She's not my Mary now.

296
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,630
你已经离开过一次了
You left once before.

297
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,540
看看都发生了些什么
Look what happened.

298
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,310
不要再抛下我们了
Don't walk out on us again.

299
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,480
真的有必要如此吗
Is this really necessary?

300
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,120
巫师的亲信
A witches' familiars --

301
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,360
魔鬼  常以动物之形存在
demons, usually in the form of an animal.

302
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,560
猫  鼠  鸟  或者蟾蜍
Cat, rat, a bird, or a toad --

303
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,360
它们只要填饱肚子
they perform all sorts of useful tasks

304
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,150
就能执行各种任务
as long as they're fed.

305
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,850
你也听到她说的话了
You heard what she told us.

306
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,200
她被迫喂养他们的亲信
She was forced to feed their familiars.

307
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,020
因此她身上一定有标志
She must be searched for the marks --

308
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,830
那些它们用以吮吸的裂口
teats where she suckled them.

309
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,110
请帮帮她
Please help her.

310
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,480
"可是地与海的居民有祸了
"Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea!

311
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,840
因为魔鬼知道自己的时日无多
"For the devil has come down unto you with great wrath

312
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,440
就怀着烈怒下到你们那里去了"
because he knoweth that he hath but a short time."

313
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,820
《启示录》12章12节
Revelations chapter 12:12.

314
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,570
看得出世界末日
I see the end of the world

315
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,030
让你更卖力了
urges you onto greater efforts.

316
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,080
它敦促着我们每个人
Mm, as it must us all.

317
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,500
我的祖母以前总喜欢
Our granny used to scare us silly

318
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,220
用女巫的故事吓唬我们
with those witch stories.

319
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,020
不过她真的吓到我兄弟们了
But she'd really terrify my brothers.

320
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,400
她说女巫能偷走男人的
She told them witches could steal a man's --

321
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,140
你喜欢这样吗  格里安娜
Would you like that, Gloriana,

322
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,000
不必受到任何男人的束缚
without the bother of the man attached?

323
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,480
你不同
Not this man.

324
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,640
亲爱的
My darling.

325
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,560
下次见  长官
See you next time, governor.

326
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,520
我只是来关照穷苦人民
Just attending to the poor.

327
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,330
毫无疑问  精神匮乏的穷人
No doubt -- and the poor in spirit.

328
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,020
奥登上尉是吗
Captain alden, right?

329
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,450
孩提之后我就没有见过你
I haven't seen you since we were children.

330
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,140
本来期待能在哈佛见到你
I expected to see you up at Harvard.

331
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,830
没想到你却加入了民兵团
Surprised to hear that you'd run off to join the militia --

332
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,220
像那些仆人一样
like a servant.

333
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,480
我很乐意花上四年
I would have loved to spend four years

334
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,130
去数数针头上有多少天使  不过
counting angels on the heads of pins, but...

335
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,980
战争当前
...there was a war on.

336
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,200
真是可惜
Pity.

337
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,900
学习让我受益匪浅
I owe everything to my education.

338
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,450
学校教你怎么追捕巫师了吗
Taught you everything about hunting witches?

339
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,010
没有
No.

340
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,600
不过我父亲在艾塞克斯时便对此颇有研究
But my father burnt scores back in Essex,

341
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,240
而且我读过与之相关的一切书籍
and I've read every book there is on the subject --

342
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,050
八种语言的
in eight languages.

343
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,070
那你就是从书上学会怎么捉巫师了
So, you learned your hunting from books.

344
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,260
就像是从你未经世事的小姨那里
Well, that's a bit like learning the facts of life

345
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,770
学习生活真相
from your maiden aunt.

346
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,220
但也无所谓了
But never mind.

347
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:18,990
你刚好在这
You're here now,

348
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,950
又是巫师专家
and you're the expert on witches,

349
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,820
让我问问你
So let me ask you.

350
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,940
那些可怕的巫师想要什么
What do these awful witches want, huh?

351
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,480
与我们渴望的一样
The same thing we all want...

352
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,520
一个属于自己的国家
...a country of their own.

353
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,140
我却在这浪费时间攻打区区印第安人
And here I've been wasting my time fighting mere Indians.

354
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,480
晚安  高材生
Good night, Harvard.

355
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,040
喂食时间到了
Time for your feeding.

356
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,260
很好
Yes.

357
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,440
很好
Yes.

358
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,000
来人啊  帮帮我
Someone, help me!

359
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,680
救命
Help me.

360
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,490
很好
Yes.

361
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:57,890
不要
No.

362
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,590
救我 救我
Help me! Help!

363
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,640
救命
Help!

364
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,220
乔治  别挣扎
George, don't fight it.

365
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,140
那只会让你更痛苦
You know it only hurts more.

366
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,090
你夺走了我的一切  乔治·西布里
You took away everything I had, George Sibley...

367
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,330
我深爱的一切
everything I loved.

368
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:29,350
你知道这种感觉多美妙吗
Can you imagine how good it feels

369
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,760
夺走你的所有
to take everything you have,

370
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,820
摧毁你建立的一切
destroy all you've built,

371
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,420
并亲手毁灭你的灵魂
and devour your very soul?

372
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,650
好了
All done.

373
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,690
我想敬我们的女主人
I would like to make a toast to our hostess,

374
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,200
玛丽·西布里
Mary sibley,

375
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,550
她向我们展示了真正的虔诚和美丽
who has shown us that true piety and true beauty

376
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,510
同样值得赞颂
amount to the same worship.

377
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,730
没错
Indeed.

378
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,570
美丽是丑陋堕落的世界上
Beauty is the last miracle allowed in an ugly...

379
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,540
最后一个奇迹
fallen world.

380
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,090
霍尔法官和我
Magistrate Hale and I are concerned

381
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,880
为我们女儿的内在美而担忧  麦哲牧师
about our daughter's inner beauty, Reverend Mather.

382
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,870
或许你可以为她推荐一个导师
Perhaps you could suggest a tutor for her,

383
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,670
一个哈佛毕业生  向您本人这样的
a Harvard man -- like yourself?

384
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,370
我觉得书上能学到的东西有限
I believe there is only so much you can learn from books.

385
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,410
经验才是真正的老师
Experience is our true teacher.

386
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,440
你同意吗  奥登上尉
Don't you agree, captain Alden?

387
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,490
这取决于那些经验是什么了
Well, that depends on the experience.

388
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:35,180
你的经验一定非常吸引人  那些印第安人
Yours must have been fascinating -- with the indians.

389
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,140
他们如此神秘
They're so mysterious,

390
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,350
如此接近自然
So...natural.

391
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,510
自然
Natural?

392
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,890
要我说是反常
"Unnatural," I'd say.

393
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,660
没有灵魂的野蛮人
Soulless savages.

394
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,870
相信我  夫人  印第安人有灵魂
I assure you, ma'am, the indians do have souls,

395
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,600
如果我们有的话
if any of us do.

396
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,930
"如果"
"If"?

397
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,830
那巫师呢
And what about witches?

398
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,840
他们也有灵魂吗
Do they have souls, too?

399
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,340
他们有
They do.

400
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,740
但他们将自己的灵魂出卖给了魔鬼
But they have deeded them to the devil himself

401
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:09,980
以换取权力和他们渴望的一切事物
in exchange for powers and all that they desire.

402
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,750
-魔鬼协议吗  -没错
- A contract? - Indeed.

403
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,780
真是讽刺
Ironic.

404
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,910
我相信在法律中
As I believe, by law,

405
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,790
女性只有通过丈夫
a woman's not allowed to enter a contract

406
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,250
才能与别人签订合同
but through the agency of their husband.

407
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,890
纳撒尼尔
Nathaniel.

408
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,960
好的  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

409
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,830
并不是所有的巫师都是女巫
Not all witches are women.

410
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,960
你认为呢  奥登上尉
And what do you think, captain Alden?

411
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,430
我不知道
I don't know.

412
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,850
我认为有些事情还是得眼见为实
I think some things just beggar belief,

413
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,540
就像是诚实的法国人  或是忠诚的女人
like an honest frenchman or a faithful woman,

414
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,740
这些我只有亲眼见到了才会相信
things that I'll believe in if and when I see one.

415
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,210
我发现比起巫师
I find I worry more

416
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,800
我还是更担心法国人和
about the french and the indian attacks

417
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,630
印第安人的入侵
than I do witches.

418
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,770
你怎么看  奥登上尉
What's your opinion, captain Alden?

419
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,120
我们的防守如何
Just how vulnerable are we?

420
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,780
你还好吗  奥登上尉
Are you all right, captain Alden?

421
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,480
可能这些丰盛的食物我还是不太习惯
I think this rich food doesn't agree with me.

422
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,830
呼吸一下新鲜空气或许能有所帮助
Some fresh air might help.

423
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,450
有人跟我说你死了
I was told you were killed.

424
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,970
那是在你嫁给西布里之前还是之后
Was that before or after you married Sibley?

425
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,150
我记得有人对我说过
I remember being told once

426
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,310
战争不会超过一年
that the war wouldn't last a year.

427
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,290
这不是我能决定的
That wasn't up to me.

428
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,040
我一直在等着你
I waited for you.

429
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:59,260
年复一年  你却杳无音讯
Years and years without a word.

430
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,010
我没法写信
I couldn't write.

431
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,390
当然了
No, of course not.

432
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,450
忙于拯救国家
Too busy saving the country.

433
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,440
不是的
Not exactly.

434
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,530
我被俘虏了
I was captured.

435
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,360
他们的神父对其他人说不要夺走这个
Their priest man told the others not to take this away from me.

436
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,900
他说宇宙由誓言所构成
He said the universe itself was made out of vows,

437
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,570
破坏誓言会带来严重后果
and breaking them carries consequences.

438
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:37,010
我知道这只是半枚银币
I know that this is just half a silver coin,

439
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:40,420
如今  你的金银珠宝享之不尽
and you have... no shortage of silver now.

440
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,430
玛丽  跟我走吧
Mary, come with me.

441
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,640
现在  今晚
Now...tonight.

442
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,890
我在纽约的银行有一些积蓄
I have money in a bank in new york.

443
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,550
那里很不一样
It's different there.

444
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,580
你不会见到一个清教徒
There's not a puritan in sight.

445
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,120
现在还来得及
It's not too late.

446
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,830
我们能在一起
We can be together

447
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,460
无论何地
anywhere.

448
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,060
除了这里
Anywhere but here.

449
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,940
纽约
New York?

450
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,960
对
Yeah.

451
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,610
那是在你被俘虏之前还是之后
Is that before or after you were captured?

452
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,600
那个晚上你离开了这里
You walk out of here one night,

453
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,280
这么多年后你才回来
and you come back years later.

454
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,690
你以为我...
A-and you think that --

455
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,900
玛丽
Mary.

456
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,330
过来
Come here.

457
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,480
不
No.

458
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,070
我不能
I can't.

459
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,390
不可能了
It's impossible.

460
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,370
他不会允许
He'd never let me.

461
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,080
西布里夫人
Now, now, Mrs. Sibley.

462
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,540
就算是您也不能独占咱们的贵客
Even you have no right to monopolize a guest

463
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,740
我们的奥登上尉
as fascinating as Captain Alden,

464
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,960
我可是有珍贵的礼物要送你
for whom I have a rare gift,

465
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,620
咱们来点圭亚那的雪茄和白兰地如何
a cigar of tobacco from Guyana with some Brandy.

466
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,600
恐怕这一切
I'm afraid all this...

467
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,020
文明的吃饭喝酒的方式让我不适  长官
civilized eating and drinking has laid me out, magistrate.

468
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,560
你告诉我他死了
You told me he was dead!

469
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,870
预言从不会如此精确  亲爱的
It's not like counting sheep, honey.

470
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,470
总会有模糊的盲点
more like counting shadows.

471
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,620
但这都无关紧要
But it don't change a thing.

472
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:37,050
约翰·奥登比起你眼前的一切算得了什么
What's John Alden compared to all that lies before you?

473
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,440
别哭了  女人
Stop your weeping, woman.

474
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,860
那个人不配得到你的眼泪
That boy don't deserve those tears.

475
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,440
不是为他而流
They're not for him.

476
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,160
是为了我曾经的少女心
They're for the girl I once was.

477
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,630
你早已回不去了
That girl belongs to somebody else now.

478
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,360
是他把你留给了一群狼吗
Was it he that left you to the wolves?

479
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,370
不是的  孩子
No, child.

480
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,710
是他从狼群中把你救出
It was he that saved you from the wolves

481
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,920
造就成今日的你
and raised you up to all of this.

482
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:08,900
你有更伟大的目标
You have a grand vision.

483
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,800
不要忘记
Don't lose sight of it.

484
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,900
明天  月亮将与我们同在
Tomorrow, the moon is with us.

485
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,340
明天  序幕拉开
Tomorrow, it begins.

486
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:20,860
将你所有的愤怒和痛苦交给卡耐马恶鬼吞噬
Leave your anger and your pain for the kenaima to feed on.

487
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,620
他违背过自己的誓言吗
Has he not been true to his vow?

488
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,540
如今  你的敌人都已成为你的奴隶
Are not your enemies now your slaves?

489
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,710
难道你不是拥有了渴望的一切
Do you not have everything that you desire --

490
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,710
财富  权力
Wealth, power?

491
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,610
几乎一切
Almost everything.

492
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,120
抱歉  夫人  有人求见
Pardon me, ma'am. A gentleman to see you.

493
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,940
科里先生
Mr. Corey.

494
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,940
阁下有何贵干
To what do I owe the pleasure?

495
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:00,890
我在想是不是应该和你谈谈  夫人
I was wondering if I might talk to you, ma'am.

496
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,720
我有过一个小农场
I had a small farm.

497
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,550
它先是伤了我的心
First, it broke my heart.

498
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,490
然后伤了我的后背
then it broke my back.

499
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:14,870
你我都知道  心会痊愈
As you and I both know, the heart heals.

500
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,430
背伤却永远不会
The back never does.

501
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,890
从此我开始靠设陷阱捕猎为生
I took up trapping.

502
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:22,090
这种拮据的生活当初毁了印第安人
It's a meager living -- ruined the Indians.

503
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,980
现在正在逐渐毁掉我
Now it's ruining me.

504
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,520
设陷阱的时候  猎物通常都在夜里踏入陷阱
Thing about trapping is you get your good catch at night.

505
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,080
可到了早上  却通常成了别人的食物
But by morning, it's someone else's meal.

506
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,130
至于我  我会守着我的陷阱
Me, I stay with my traps.

507
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,440
很精彩  科里先生  但是
Fascinating, Mr. Corey, but --

508
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,400
这就是为什么我来到这
That's why I was there...

509
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,320
我知道那天晚上
The night you did it...

510
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,880
你和你的仆人都干了些什么
You and your cinnamon girl.

511
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,870
你等了很久才来找我啊
You waited a long time.

512
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,010
因为之前不涉及到任何人
Nobody's business till now.

513
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:54,090
但那个被你烧掉的孩子是约翰·奥登的
But that was John Alden's baby that you buried out there.

514
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,170
他为你如此着迷  他有权知道真相
And the way he feels about you, he has a right to know.

515
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:02,580
所以该由你来说呢
So, are you gonna tell him?

516
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,750
还是我来
Or am I?

517
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,700
该死的
Oh, blast this wretched thing.

518
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,800
画得很不错
That's not bad.

519
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,990
路易斯牧师说绘画是邪神崇拜
Reverend Lewis says drawing is idolatry,

520
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,430
如同崇拜自然或者什么
like worshiping nature or something.

521
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,930
总比崇拜些更糟糕的东西好
Well, there might be worse things to worship.

522
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,920
有机会的话  我想为你画像
I'd like to draw you sometime.

523
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,240
我可不确定是否想看到画中的自己
I'm not sure I'd like to see a portrait of me.

524
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,890
再说了  我也没有时间
Besides, I have no time to sit.

525
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,770
我要离开了
I'm on way out of town.

526
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,840
这么快
So soon?

527
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,510
是因为害怕巫师吗
Afraid of witches...

528
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,060
还是怕被当成是巫师
or being taken for one?

529
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,470
纽约离这可有一段路程
It's a long way to New York.

530
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,860
祝你有愉快的一天
Good day.

531
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,010
我不是故意吓你的
Oh, I didn't mean to frighten you.

532
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,590
我没被吓到
Oh, I'm not frightened.

533
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,650
只是感到意外
Just surprised.

534
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,480
那是当然
Yes, of course --

535
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,250
对一个敢独自在墓地里素描的女孩这算什么
A girl brave enough to sketch in a graveyard.

536
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,900
我不害怕死人
I'm not afraid of the dead,

537
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,390
活人也不怕
nor the living for that matter.

538
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,700
那是因为你对死亡一无所知
That's because you know nothing of death

539
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,710
对生命更加的无知
And less of life.

540
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,360
我可以教给你
I could teach you --

541
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,200
关于生命
about life...

542
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,690
和死亡
and death...

543
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,800
还有二者之间的东西
and many things in between.

544
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,570
你知道几乎每个埋在这的女人都死于什么
Do you know what killed nearly every woman buried here?

545
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,480
爱情
Love.

546
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,270
大多数都死于分娩
Most died in childbirth.

547
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,770
所以说爱情之于女人就好比战争之于男人
So, love is to a woman what war is to a man --

548
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,570
都是所能做的最致命的事情
the most deadly thing they'll do.

549
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:14,350
只有傻子才会迫不及待的奔向战争和爱情
Only a fool runs quickly to war or love.

550
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,380
你自己小心为妙
You'd best watch yourself.

551
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,320
谢谢您  西布里夫人
Thank you...Mrs. Sibley.

552
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,550
对于您的智慧我真是望尘莫及
I can only aspire to your happy wisdom.

553
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,350
巫师们在哪里见面
Where do the witches meet?

554
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,750
树林里
In the woods.

555
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,250
有多少人
How many?

556
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,710
我不知道
I don't know.

557
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,640
他们是谁
Who are they?

558
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,640
我
I --

559
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,730
我看不到他她们的脸
I can't see their faces.

560
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,160
好像是一些动物的头颅
Like there's these heads of animals

561
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,550
一头牡鹿  一头猪和一只狼
like a stag and a pig and a wolf.

562
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,310
可你还是知道他们是谁
But you know who they are?

563
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,640
是的
Yes.

564
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,860
是的
Yes.

565
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,500
他们的名字
Their names.

566
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,200
为什么你不告诉我他们的名字
Why won't you tell me their names?

567
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,140
她不允许我
She won't let me.

568
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:26,850
她
"She"?

569
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,380
-是的  -谁
- Yes. - Who?

570
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,840
她是谁
Who is she?

571
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,070
告诉我
Tell me.

572
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,290
-我不能  -把名字告诉我
- I can't. - Tell me the names!

573
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,790
天哪  梅西
My god, Mercy.

574
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,720
尽管她不能说出名字
Though she cannot speak a name,

575
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,500
她会指出女巫是谁
she will show us the witch.

576
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,050
天呐  不要
Oh, no!

577
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,260
抱歉  上尉
Sorry, Captain.

578
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,410
你现在不能离开塞勒姆
You can't leave Salem just yet.

579
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,370
有些东西你得看看
Something you've got to see.

580
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,070
是他吗  那个巫师
Is this him, the witch?

581
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,580
我想是吧
I think so.

582
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,080
所有的书籍上都说如果受害者
All the books say if the victim --

583
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,820
别管的你书怎么说
Never mind your books.

584
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,180
他是不是巫师
Is this the witch?

585
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,370
他不愿开口  既不承认也不否认
He won't plead either way.

586
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,720
这样吗
Is that so?

587
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,170
本来也不是什么真正的指控
Won't dignify the accusation.

588
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,740
一个小女孩朝着你吐口水
If you can call a young girl's

589
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,920
这也能算是指控吗
spit an accusation.

590
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,690
要我开口的话
What I have to say,

591
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:02,810
我要跟约翰·奥登上尉谈
I'll say to Captain John Alden.

592
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,670
只要你把奥登上尉找来
You just find me Captain Alden.

593
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,590
我可是有不少话要讲呢
I'll have plenty to say.

594
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:15,170
我已经派人找过奥登上尉
I have sent men for captain Alden,

595
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,250
但是我被告知他已经离开了
but I'm told he's left town.

596
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,770
想办法让他招供
Just obtain a plea.

597
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,950
如果他还是不肯说呢
And if he remains silent?

598
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,730
大家赋予了你权力
You've been granted power.

599
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,490
好好利用它  从他嘴里逼出答案
Use it. Press him for an answer.

600
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,300
看看令他守口如瓶的恶魔是否
Let the same devil that holds his tongue

601
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,170
经得起巨石的碾压
hold the stones.

602
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,420
快点  集会马上就要开始了
Hurry. The sabbath is about to begin.

603
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,980
一  二  三 四
One, two, three, and four.

604
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,770
魔鬼  听吾之召唤
Raise the devil to our door.

605
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,190
众生之灵  猪  狼  羊
Call the pig, the wolf, the ram.

606
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:28,140
应吾之召  众灵重现
Come to the circle, all who can.

607
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:32,520
他将再次行走于这片土地
Make him walk on floor to roof.

608
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,260
我们将与他举杯共饮
Drink to him with horn and hoof.

609
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:39,020
一  二  三  四
One, two, three, and four.

610
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,710
魔鬼已至
The devil is here.

611
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,560
别再沉睡
Now sleep no more.

612
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,250
世间万物将尽在你掌握
And all the world shall be yours in return.

613
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:13,340
如果你说的巫师们在这集会
If your witches meet here,

614
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,670
那他们夜视一定不错
they got better night eyes than I do.

615
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,820
他们根本不需要视力
They don't need night eyes.

616
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:21,710
夜晚就是他们的眼睛
The night is their eyes.

617
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,440
这都是什么鬼东西
What the hell is this?

618
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:29,880
给恶魔的献祭
Gifts to the devil himself --

619
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:31,680
都是未出生的婴儿
The unborn.

620
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,990
无辜者之血
Cruor innocentia.

621
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:38,470
巫师  瘟疫
Maleficarum. Pestilentia.

622
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:40,070
五朔节之夜
Walpurgisnacht.

623
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:40,070
{\an8}根据德国神话  四月三十日夜晚女巫将与恶魔一起狂欢

624
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:42,600
仪式已完成
Consummatum est.

625
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,190
一切即将开始
Now it begins.

626
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,550
祭祀圈被破坏了
The circle was broken.

627
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:09,730
被谁
By who?

628
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,560
撒旦
Satan!

629
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:20,530
我请求你  先生
Please, sir.

630
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:22,430
我也不愿这么做
I don't want to to do this.

631
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:23,880
那就别这么做
Then don't.

632
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,860
讲讲道理吧
Be reasonable, man.

633
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,410
我有合法的权力对你进行逼供
I have the power to press you for an answer.

634
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:32,480
只要你开口  承认自己有罪
All you have to do is say the words "Guilty"

635
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,970
或是无罪
or "Not guilty,"

636
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:36,180
我们就能停止这一切
And we can stop all of this.

637
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:39,130
如果我承认有罪  黎明之前我就会被绞死
If I say "Guilty," you'll hang me before dawn.

638
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:40,810
如果我坚持自己无罪
And if I say not,

639
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:43,520
我的命运仍将握在你们这群混蛋手中
my fate is still in the hands of you bastards.

640
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,940
所以我宁愿沉默  将命运交给上帝
I'll hold my peace and trust in the Lord.

641
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:58,330
把石头放下来
Lower the stones!

642
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:14,850
我再问你一次
I ask you again.

643
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:18,090
你承认自己有罪
Are you guilty...

644
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,350
或是无罪
or not?

645
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,570
我们死定了
We're dead.

646
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,060
不会的
No, we are not.

647
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,630
离死期也不远了
Good as.

648
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,470
这一切你不是早就见识过吗
I thought you've seen them before.

649
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:32,420
你想让我看到这些  我也确实看到了
You wanted me to see them, and I saw them.

650
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:33,800
可他们也看见了我们
And they saw us.

651
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,490
我跟你说过  他们可能是任何人
And I told you they could be anybody.

652
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:36,660
好吧
Okay, just...

653
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,100
冷静点
calm down.

654
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,140
你有什么话要说吗
Have you something to say?

655
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,370
再加点石头吧
More stones.

656
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:06,910
吉尔斯
Giles!

657
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:09,010
都给我离他远点
Get the hell off of him!

658
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,850
奥登
Alden!

659
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,220
他死了
He's dead!

660
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,400
"地与海的居民
"Woe to the inhabitants...

661
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,840
你们有祸了
"of the earth and of the sea.

662
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,460
因为魔鬼即将降临"
For the devil has come down unto you."

663
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,460
{\an8}出自圣经《启示录》12:12

664
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,070
你这个狗娘养的
Son of a bitch. Son of a...

665
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,190
不
No! No!

666
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:42,470
放手
Get!

667
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:57,880
我父亲是最早踏上塞勒姆这片土地的人
My father's boots were the very first in Salem.

668
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:02,370
我警告你们这里每一个杀人如麻
And I'm warning every goddamn one of you murdering,

669
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,530
虚假伪善的清教徒混蛋
hypocritical puritan bastards

670
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:07,650
你们都不会有好下场
that these boots will be the last!

671
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,320
我再问你一次
I will ask you once again.

672
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:34,220
谁在那里
Who was there?

673
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:36,370
谁看见了我们
Who saw us?

674
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:38,820
我也再回答你一次
I will tell you again.

675
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:40,950
我不知道
I do not know.

676
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:45,600
当时枪口的火焰太亮了  很难看清
It is difficult to see past a muzzle flash.

677
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,290
那我建议你尽快查清楚  霍尔先生
Then I suggest you find out, Mr. Hale.

678
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,160
现在已经没法回头了
There's no turning back.

679
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:54,360
巫师追捕行动已经开始
The witch hunt has begun,

680
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,950
而主持审判的会是我们
and we will be running the trials.

681
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:01,120
你明白吧  乔治  不是吗
You understand that, don't you, George?

682
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,610
你应该最清楚
You best of all.

683
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:06,100
我们会利用审判
We will use the trials

684
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,910
让那些清教徒自相残杀
to turn the puritans against each other.

685
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:12,130
他们将会追捕  屠杀
They will hunt and kill

686
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:15,130
最终淹没于自己的鲜血当中
and drown in their very own blood

687
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:17,750
直到再无一名清教徒生还
till there's no puritans left standing...

688
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,190
而塞勒姆
And Salem...

689
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,130
将属于我们
is ours.

690
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,970
{\an5}{\pos(195.2,191.935)}塞勒姆

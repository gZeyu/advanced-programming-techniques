30
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,200
不是所多瑪  而是塞勒姆
Not Sodom, but Salem.

31
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,200
{\an8}所多瑪是因其罪惡被上帝所滅的城鎮

32
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,800
如果我們能容忍這種傷風敗俗的人或事
We cannot expect god to be on our side

33
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,050
上帝還怎么保佑我們
if we tolerate abominations or those who commit them.

34
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,770
你們倆將被通宵被鎖在這里
You two will remain in the stocks overnight.

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,850
而你小子  將一生背負

No, please. Please!

For god's sakes, Sibley.

39

別以為有我對你父親的那點尊重
My respect for your father's memory

49

你就可以在這里肆無忌憚
can only shield you so long.

It's a good thing you're mustering out tonight.

51

52
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,370
他或許能容忍你父親
He tolerated your father,

53
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,610
但他可不會容你在這放肆
but he won't be happy till he sees you swing.

Didn't you learn anything today?

Yes, yes, if I have to spend one more night

56

under the same stars as that bastard George Sibley,

57
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,310
我會像殺豬樣宰了他
I will gut him like the pig that he is.

58
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,520
你說這話會被當眾懲罰的
If -- talking like that will land you in the stocks.

59
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,680
沒機會了
No day soon.

60
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,260
我寧愿死在戰場上
I'd rather die fighting the French and the Indians

61
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,580
也不愿在這被人侮辱
than get pissed on by the good souls of Salem.

62
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,480
所以你是真要走了
So, you're really leaving.

This is all that I have.

And I swear on my parents' grave.

這就是我的誓言
This is my vow.

雖然戰爭無情
Though there are things to be said for war.

82
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,360
但對某些人來說  戰死沙場
Gives a certain kind of man someplace to end up

83
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,160
遠比被處以極刑
other than the end of a brand...

00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,000

塞勒姆沒有那孩子的容身之地
There is no place for that child in Salem.

91
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,000
喬治·西布里讓約翰·奧登戰死沙場
George Sibley drove John Alden off to die in the war.

92
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,970

What do you think he's gonna do to you

93
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,250
他會怎么對你
when he finds out you're pregnant with John's baby?

不要害怕森林
Do not fear the woods.

147
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,210
不  是他兒子柯頓
No, his son -- Cotton.

148
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,460
只可惜他比起父親差遠了  就是個廢物
And not a chip off the old block -- barely a splinter.

149
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,890
我記得我們小時候
I remember when we were kids

150
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,190
他就穿得跟個姑娘似的
he used to dress like a girl.

151
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,460
打起架來也扭扭捏捏
Fought like one, too.

152
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,620
他現在長大了
Well, he's all growed-up now.

153
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,130
長成了滿身纏著綾羅綢緞的傻子
A fine fool in fine silk clothes,

154
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,560
但不是普通的傻子  而是最危險的那種
and not just any fool, the most dangerous kind --

155
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,570
自以為無所不知
the kind that thinks he knows everything.

156
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,260
你回來不是為了聽這些屁話的吧
But you didn't come back for all this horseshit.

157
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,960
你回來的目的只有一個
You come back for one thing and one thing only.

158
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,320
說實話  她現在過得很好
Truth told, she's finer than ever.

159
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,090
她是塞勒姆最富有的女人
And she's the richest woman in Salem.

160
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,900
為什么呢
And why not?

161
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,660
因為她現在是西布里的妻子
She's mary Sibley now.

162
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,470
{\pos(222.154,201.273)}西布里宅

163
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,590
西布里
Sibley?

164
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,730
喬治·西布里
George Sibley.

165
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,050
但他妻子...
But his wife --

166
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,700
幾年前去世了
Died a few years ago.

167
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,990
你離開太長時間了  約翰
You've been gone a long time, John.

168
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,220
時刻做好準備吧
Keep your powder in your bag.

169
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,170
有一天
One day,

170
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,230
你的瑪麗會成為我們國家最富有的寡婦
your Mary will be the richest widow in the country.

171
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,100
司機來了
The driver's at the door

172
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,680
帶來了您的包裹  夫人
with some packages for you, ma'am.

173
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:25,980
讓他進來
Send him in.

174
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,070
納撒尼爾  帶西布里先生一起走吧
And, Nathaniel, take Mr. Sibley with you.

175
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,640
到洗澡時間了
Time for his bath.

176
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,910
艾薩克  現在告訴我都有哪些新聞吧
Now, Isaac, tell me some news of the world.

177
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,720
今天看到一個人風塵仆仆地進城了
Saw a dusty fella walking into town today.

178
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,880
我簡直不敢相信自己的眼睛
I couldn't believe my eyes.

179
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,160
為什么
Why?

180
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,900
那個人是約翰·奧登
It was John Alden.

181
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,120
歡迎回來  麥哲牧師
Welcome back, Reverend Mather.

182
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,090
朗姆酒   杜松子酒和麥芽酒
Rum, gin, ale?

183
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,620
好
Yes.

184
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,970
我需要三個身強體壯的人
I need three strong men.

185
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,920
我會付錢的
I can pay.

186
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,020
干什么
For what?

187
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,710
去制服一個姑娘
To subdue a girl.

188
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,510
路易絲牧師
Reverend Lewis.

189
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,240
求你幫幫我女兒
Please help my daughter.

190
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,120
注意安全
And be careful.

191
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,040
綁住她
Tie her down!

192
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,960
綁住她
Tie her down!!

193
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,580
求你了  牧師  求你了  救救我
Please, I beg you, sir. Please, make this stop.

194
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,950
梅西  我也無能為力  除非你告訴我
I can do nothing, Mercy, unless you tell me...

195
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,780
是誰在折磨你
Who is it torments you?

196
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,300
她就在那里
S-she's right there.

197
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,540
她
"She"?

198
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,890
誰在這里
Who is here?

199
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,480
梅西  你必須告訴我
Mercy, you must tell me!

200
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,220
這里還有誰
Who is in this room with us?!

201
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,370
那個女巫  那個老太婆
The hag! The old woman!

202
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,430
她就站在那里
She's standing right there!

203
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,740
求你了
Please.

204
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,630
這是藥
A simple physic.

205
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,650
幫你入睡
To sleep.

206
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,400
求你了  求你了
Please. Please.

207
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,610
我們稱之為魔鬼侵襲...
We call it a spectral attack --

208
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,470
是女巫所為
The work of witches.

209
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,580
為她祈禱吧
Pray for her.

210
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,220
一派胡言
I call bullshit.

211
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,580
她顯然是精神失常了
She's clearly touched in the head.

212
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,730
她需要醫生  不是禱告
She needs a doctor, not your prayers.

213
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,380
別磨蹭  孩子
Don't dawdle, child.

214
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,270
我要你坐到前排
I want you in the front row

215
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,120
柯頓·麥哲定會為你的魅力而傾倒
Where Cotton Mather can't help but be dazzled by your charms.

216
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,470
看在上帝的份上  母親
For heaven's sake, mother,

217
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,030
干脆把我裹進絲綢  放到拍賣會上好了
why not just wrap me in silk and parade me on the auction block?

218
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,400
人類的戰爭不足為懼
Fear no man's war.

219
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,980
只有來自地獄的戰火能摧毀塞勒姆
For only a war from hell could destroy Salem.

220
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,530
決不能讓魔鬼
The devil was never going to let

221
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,780
不費一兵一卒
a promised land be built here

222
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,400
就攻占這里
without a fight, without a battle!

223
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,150
巫師所擁有致命的惡意
And witches armed with deadly malice

224
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,740
便是最為狠毒而陰險的武器
are the most malignant and insidious weapons

225
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,280
在這場戰役
in that battle,

226
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,670
這場戰爭中
in that war.

227
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,340
只要塞勒姆有一個巫師  便足以毀滅
Even a single witch in Salem is enough to destroy

228
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,440
我們所建立的一切  和我們所有的遠大愿景
everything we have built and ever hope to build here!

229
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,260
如今  我們已經處決了三名巫師
Now, we have already killed three of them,

230
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,480
但他們的惡意仍未消逝
and yet their malice continues unabated.

231
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,480
為什么
Why?

232
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,070
因為我們之中仍有巫師存在
Because there are still witches here among us!

233
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,670
或許就在這座大廳里
Perhaps in this very hall!

234
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,540
設想這些在暗處的敵人  擁有未知的武器和巫術
Imagine a foe you can't see armed with weapons unknown

235
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,450
看上去卻和常人別無二致
and the ability to appear as any one of us!

236
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,970
既然如此  你希望誰來指認罪犯
Then how can you hope to identify the correct culprit?

237
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,330
你見過那個女孩了嗎  先生
Have you seen the girl, sir?

238
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,740
即使現在  梅西·路易絲遍體鱗傷
Even now, Mercy Lewis bleeds from 100 wounds --

239
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,370
這些傷絕不會是自殘所致
some impossible to self-inflict.

240
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,910
她將向我們指認犯罪之人
She is the one who will tell us who does this.

241
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,020
我明白了
I see.

242
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,660
重病纏身的可憐女孩  她的瘋言瘋語
The ravings of a poor, sick girl

243
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,480
就能解釋你這說不清的邏輯了嗎
will help you identify what your reason fails to deliver.

244
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,510
我父親
My father --

245
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:36,070
是  沒錯  你父親
Yes, of course. Your father.

246
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:41,030
備受大家尊崇的  你的父親
Did your father, whom we all so respect,

247
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,600
讓你代替他過來幫忙的時候
offer you any advice when he sent you in his stead

248
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,970
提供什么建議了嗎
to our aid?

249
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,420
他給出了警告
He...advised caution.

250
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,410
警告
Caution?

251
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,620
因為小麥哲的警告
And are we to take three people hung

252
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,150
我們就要將三人絞死嗎
as the measure of Mather Junior's caution?

253
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,190
在塞勒姆  甚至在全國
There could be nothing worse for Salem,

254
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,050
沒有比巫師追捕行動更可怕的事了
for the country, than a witch hunt.

255
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,160
巫師
Witches.

256
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,840
巫師
Witches.

257
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,280
正是
Indeed.

258
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:26,580
正如我親愛的丈夫  你們的執行官所言
As my beloved husband, the head of your selectmen, reminds me,

259
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,480
還有比巫師追捕行動更可怕的東西
there is something worse than a witch hunt --

260
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,400
那就是巫師
a witch.

261
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,360
巫師
A witch?

262
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,220
那一定很可怕
Sure, that's bad.

263
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,880
為什么不是食人魔
But why not an ogre...

264
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,100
或是哥布林
or a goblin?

265
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,940
既然要說神話生物  為什么不能是龍
Why not a dragon, long as we're talking about fairy tales?

266
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,430
約翰·奧登
John Alden.

267
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,770
感謝你多年來對我們的英勇守護
We all welcome captain alden home from his long,

268
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,040
歡迎回家  奧登上尉
long service in our defense.

269
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,670
清教徒自知勢力衰減
Puritans know their sun is setting.

270
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,910
沒什么比新的敵人  或者新的老對手
Nothing like a new enemy or a new old enemy

271
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,650
更能籠絡人心了
to get people behind you.

272
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,360
奧登上尉
Captain Alden.

273
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,170
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley.

274
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,550
西布里先生和我明晚會舉辦小型晚宴
Mr. Sibley and I are hosting a small dinner tomorrow night.

275
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,890
你的到來將使舍下蓬蓽生輝
We'd be honored if you'd join.

276
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,880
為什么盯著我
Why are you staring at me?

277
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,130
我甚至不認識你
I don't even know you.

278
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,290
艾薩克
Isaac?

279
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,460
私通者艾薩克
Isaac the fornicator.

280
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,670
藏好你的妻子
Hide your wives.

281
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,720
你的女兒  連羊都得小心點
Hide your daughters. Hell, your sheep!

282
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,620
好吧
All right, look.

283
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,810
你想要我怎么做
So, what do you want from me?

284
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,230
聽我說  約翰·奧登
Listen to me, John Alden.

285
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,480
離開戰場回到塞勒姆
Coming home to Salem to get out of the war

286
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,920
就好比穿越刀山  又跳入火海
is like jumping in the ocean to get out of the rain.

287
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,020
真相秘而不宣
Truth hides.

288
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,310
誰都可能會是他們
They could be anyone.

289
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,810
拜托  他們  他們是誰
Oh, they who? Who's they?

290
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,040
巫師
Witches!

291
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,170
不是神話傳說
Ain't no fairy tale.

292
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,700
巫師是真實存在的
They're real.

293
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,750
這些年來
All these years,

294
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,790
你的瑪麗是唯一向我施以援手的人
your Mary's the only one who's ever done me a good turn.

295
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,050
她不再是我的瑪麗了
She's not my Mary now.

296
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,630
你已經離開過一次了
You left once before.

297
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,540
看看都發生了些什么
Look what happened.

298
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,310
不要再拋下我們了
Don't walk out on us again.

299
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,480
真的有必要如此嗎
Is this really necessary?

300
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,120
巫師的親信
A witches' familiars --

301
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,360
魔鬼  常以動物之形存在
demons, usually in the form of an animal.

302
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,560
貓  鼠  鳥  或者蟾蜍
Cat, rat, a bird, or a toad --

303
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,360
它們只要填飽肚子
they perform all sorts of useful tasks

304
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,150
就能執行各種任務
as long as they're fed.

305
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,850
你也聽到她說的話了
You heard what she told us.

306
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,200
她被迫喂養他們的親信
She was forced to feed their familiars.

307
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,020
因此她身上一定有標志
She must be searched for the marks --

308
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,830
那些它們用以吮吸的裂口
teats where she suckled them.

309
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,110
請幫幫她
Please help her.

310
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,480
"可是地與海的居民有禍了
"Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea!

311
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,840
因為魔鬼知道自己的時日無多
"For the devil has come down unto you with great wrath

312
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,440
就懷著烈怒下到你們那里去了"
because he knoweth that he hath but a short time."

313
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,820
《啟示錄》12章12節
Revelations chapter 12:12.

314
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,570
看得出世界末日
I see the end of the world

315
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,030
讓你更賣力了
urges you onto greater efforts.

316
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,080
它敦促著我們每個人
Mm, as it must us all.

317
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,500
我的祖母以前總喜歡
Our granny used to scare us silly

318
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,220
用女巫的故事嚇唬我們
with those witch stories.

319
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,020
不過她真的嚇到我兄弟們了
But she'd really terrify my brothers.

320
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,400
她說女巫能偷走男人的
She told them witches could steal a man's --

321
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,140
你喜歡這樣嗎  格里安娜
Would you like that, Gloriana,

322
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,000
不必受到任何男人的束縛
without the bother of the man attached?

323
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,480
你不同
Not this man.

324
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,640
親愛的
My darling.

325
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,560
下次見  長官
See you next time, governor.

326
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,520
我只是來關照窮苦人民
Just attending to the poor.

327
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,330
毫無疑問  精神匱乏的窮人
No doubt -- and the poor in spirit.

328
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,020
奧登上尉是嗎
Captain alden, right?

329
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,450
孩提之后我就沒有見過你
I haven't seen you since we were children.

330
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,140
本來期待能在哈佛見到你
I expected to see you up at Harvard.

331
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,830
沒想到你卻加入了民兵團
Surprised to hear that you'd run off to join the militia --

332
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,220
像那些仆人一樣
like a servant.

333
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,480
我很樂意花上四年
I would have loved to spend four years

334
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,130
去數數針頭上有多少天使  不過
counting angels on the heads of pins, but...

335
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,980
戰爭當前
...there was a war on.

336
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,200
真是可惜
Pity.

337
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,900
學習讓我受益匪淺
I owe everything to my education.

338
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,450
學校教你怎么追捕巫師了嗎
Taught you everything about hunting witches?

339
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,010
沒有
No.

340
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,600
不過我父親在艾塞克斯時便對此頗有研究
But my father burnt scores back in Essex,

341
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,240
而且我讀過與之相關的一切書籍
and I've read every book there is on the subject --

342
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,050
八種語言的
in eight languages.

343
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,070
那你就是從書上學會怎么捉巫師了
So, you learned your hunting from books.

344
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,260
就像是從你未經世事的小姨那里
Well, that's a bit like learning the facts of life

345
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,770
學習生活真相
from your maiden aunt.

346
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,220
但也無所謂了
But never mind.

347
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:18,990
你剛好在這
You're here now,

348
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,950
又是巫師專家
and you're the expert on witches,

349
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,820
讓我問問你
So let me ask you.

350
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,940
那些可怕的巫師想要什么
What do these awful witches want, huh?

351
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,480
與我們渴望的一樣
The same thing we all want...

352
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,520
一個屬于自己的國家
...a country of their own.

353
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,140
我卻在這浪費時間攻打區區印第安人
And here I've been wasting my time fighting mere Indians.

354
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,480
晚安  高材生
Good night, Harvard.

355
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,040
喂食時間到了
Time for your feeding.

356
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,260
很好
Yes.

357
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,440
很好
Yes.

358
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,000
來人啊  幫幫我
Someone, help me!

359
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,680
救命
Help me.

360
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,490
很好
Yes.

361
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:57,890
不要
No.

362
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,590
救我 救我
Help me! Help!

363
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,640
救命
Help!

364
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,220
喬治  別掙扎
George, don't fight it.

365
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,140
那只會讓你更痛苦
You know it only hurts more.

366
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,090
你奪走了我的一切  喬治·西布里
You took away everything I had, George Sibley...

367
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,330
我深愛的一切
everything I loved.

368
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:29,350
你知道這種感覺多美妙嗎
Can you imagine how good it feels

369
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,760
奪走你的所有
to take everything you have,

370
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,820
摧毀你建立的一切
destroy all you've built,

371
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,420
并親手毀滅你的靈魂
and devour your very soul?

372
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,650
好了
All done.

373
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,690
我想敬我們的女主人
I would like to make a toast to our hostess,

374
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,200
瑪麗·西布里
Mary sibley,

375
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,550
她向我們展示了真正的虔誠和美麗
who has shown us that true piety and true beauty

376
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,510
同樣值得贊頌
amount to the same worship.

377
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,730
沒錯
Indeed.

378
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,570
美麗是丑陋墮落的世界上
Beauty is the last miracle allowed in an ugly...

379
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,540
最后一個奇跡
fallen world.

380
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,090
霍爾法官和我
Magistrate Hale and I are concerned

381
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,880
為我們女兒的內在美而擔憂  麥哲牧師
about our daughter's inner beauty, Reverend Mather.

382
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,870
或許你可以為她推薦一個導師
Perhaps you could suggest a tutor for her,

383
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,670
一個哈佛畢業生  向您本人這樣的
a Harvard man -- like yourself?

384
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,370
我覺得書上能學到的東西有限
I believe there is only so much you can learn from books.

385
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,410
經驗才是真正的老師
Experience is our true teacher.

386
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,440
你同意嗎  奧登上尉
Don't you agree, captain Alden?

387
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,490
這取決于那些經驗是什么了
Well, that depends on the experience.

388
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:35,180
你的經驗一定非常吸引人  那些印第安人
Yours must have been fascinating -- with the indians.

389
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,140
他們如此神秘
They're so mysterious,

390
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,350
如此接近自然
So...natural.

391
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,510
自然
Natural?

392
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,890
要我說是反常
"Unnatural," I'd say.

393
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,660
沒有靈魂的野蠻人
Soulless savages.

394
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,870
相信我  夫人  印第安人有靈魂
I assure you, ma'am, the indians do have souls,

395
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,600
如果我們有的話
if any of us do.

396
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,930
"如果"
"If"?

397
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,830
那巫師呢
And what about witches?

398
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,840
他們也有靈魂嗎
Do they have souls, too?

399
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,340
他們有
They do.

400
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,740
但他們將自己的靈魂出賣給了魔鬼
But they have deeded them to the devil himself

401
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:09,980
以換取權力和他們渴望的一切事物
in exchange for powers and all that they desire.

402
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,750
-魔鬼協議嗎  -沒錯
- A contract? - Indeed.

403
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,780
真是諷刺
Ironic.

404
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,910
我相信在法律中
As I believe, by law,

405
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,790
女性只有通過丈夫
a woman's not allowed to enter a contract

406
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,250
才能與別人簽訂合同
but through the agency of their husband.

407
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,890
納撒尼爾
Nathaniel.

408
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,960
好的  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

409
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,830
并不是所有的巫師都是女巫
Not all witches are women.

410
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,960
你認為呢  奧登上尉
And what do you think, captain Alden?

411
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,430
我不知道
I don't know.

412
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,850
我認為有些事情還是得眼見為實
I think some things just beggar belief,

413
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,540
就像是誠實的法國人  或是忠誠的女人
like an honest frenchman or a faithful woman,

414
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,740
這些我只有親眼見到了才會相信
things that I'll believe in if and when I see one.

415
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,210
我發現比起巫師
I find I worry more

416
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,800
我還是更擔心法國人和
about the french and the indian attacks

417
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,630
印第安人的入侵
than I do witches.

418
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,770
你怎么看  奧登上尉
What's your opinion, captain Alden?

419
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,120
我們的防守如何
Just how vulnerable are we?

420
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,780
你還好嗎  奧登上尉
Are you all right, captain Alden?

421
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,480
可能這些豐盛的食物我還是不太習慣
I think this rich food doesn't agree with me.

422
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,830
呼吸一下新鮮空氣或許能有所幫助
Some fresh air might help.

423
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,450
有人跟我說你死了
I was told you were killed.

424
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,970
那是在你嫁給西布里之前還是之后
Was that before or after you married Sibley?

425
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,150
我記得有人對我說過
I remember being told once

426
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,310
戰爭不會超過一年
that the war wouldn't last a year.

427
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,290
這不是我能決定的
That wasn't up to me.

428
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,040
我一直在等著你
I waited for you.

429
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:59,260
年復一年  你卻杳無音訊
Years and years without a word.

430
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,010
我沒法寫信
I couldn't write.

431
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,390
當然了
No, of course not.

432
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,450
忙于拯救國家
Too busy saving the country.

433
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,440
不是的
Not exactly.

434
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,530
我被俘虜了
I was captured.

435
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,360
他們的神父對其他人說不要奪走這個
Their priest man told the others not to take this away from me.

436
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,900
他說宇宙由誓言所構成
He said the universe itself was made out of vows,

437
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,570
破壞誓言會帶來嚴重后果
and breaking them carries consequences.

438
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:37,010
我知道這只是半枚銀幣
I know that this is just half a silver coin,

439
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:40,420
如今  你的金銀珠寶享之不盡
and you have... no shortage of silver now.

440
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,430
瑪麗  跟我走吧
Mary, come with me.

441
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,640
現在  今晚
Now...tonight.

442
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,890
我在紐約的銀行有一些積蓄
I have money in a bank in new york.

443
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,550
那里很不一樣
It's different there.

444
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,580
你不會見到一個清教徒
There's not a puritan in sight.

445
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,120
現在還來得及
It's not too late.

446
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,830
我們能在一起
We can be together

447
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,460
無論何地
anywhere.

448
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,060
除了這里
Anywhere but here.

449
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,940
紐約
New York?

450
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,960
對
Yeah.

451
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,610
那是在你被俘虜之前還是之后
Is that before or after you were captured?

452
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,600
那個晚上你離開了這里
You walk out of here one night,

453
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,280
這么多年后你才回來
and you come back years later.

454
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,690
你以為我...
A-and you think that --

455
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,900
瑪麗
Mary.

456
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,330
過來
Come here.

457
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,480
不
No.

458
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,070
我不能
I can't.

459
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,390
不可能了
It's impossible.

460
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,370
他不會允許
He'd never let me.

461
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,080
西布里夫人
Now, now, Mrs. Sibley.

462
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,540
就算是您也不能獨占咱們的貴客
Even you have no right to monopolize a guest

463
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,740
我們的奧登上尉
as fascinating as Captain Alden,

464
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,960
我可是有珍貴的禮物要送你
for whom I have a rare gift,

465
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,620
咱們來點圭亞那的雪茄和白蘭地如何
a cigar of tobacco from Guyana with some Brandy.

466
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,600
恐怕這一切
I'm afraid all this...

467
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,020
文明的吃飯喝酒的方式讓我不適  長官
civilized eating and drinking has laid me out, magistrate.

468
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,560
你告訴我他死了
You told me he was dead!

469
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,870
預言從不會如此精確  親愛的
It's not like counting sheep, honey.

470
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,470
總會有模糊的盲點
more like counting shadows.

471
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,620
但這都無關緊要
But it don't change a thing.

472
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:37,050
約翰·奧登比起你眼前的一切算得了什么
What's John Alden compared to all that lies before you?

473
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,440
別哭了  女人
Stop your weeping, woman.

474
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,860
那個人不配得到你的眼淚
That boy don't deserve those tears.

475
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,440
不是為他而流
They're not for him.

476
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,160
是為了我曾經的少女心
They're for the girl I once was.

477
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,630
你早已回不去了
That girl belongs to somebody else now.

478
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,360
是他把你留給了一群狼嗎
Was it he that left you to the wolves?

479
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,370
不是的  孩子
No, child.

480
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,710
是他從狼群中把你救出
It was he that saved you from the wolves

481
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,920
造就成今日的你
and raised you up to all of this.

482
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:08,900
你有更偉大的目標
You have a grand vision.

483
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,800
不要忘記
Don't lose sight of it.

484
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,900
明天  月亮將與我們同在
Tomorrow, the moon is with us.

485
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,340
明天  序幕拉開
Tomorrow, it begins.

486
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:20,860
將你所有的憤怒和痛苦交給卡耐馬惡鬼吞噬
Leave your anger and your pain for the kenaima to feed on.

487
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,620
他違背過自己的誓言嗎
Has he not been true to his vow?

488
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,540
如今  你的敵人都已成為你的奴隸
Are not your enemies now your slaves?

489
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,710
難道你不是擁有了渴望的一切
Do you not have everything that you desire --

490
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,710
財富  權力
Wealth, power?

491
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,610
幾乎一切
Almost everything.

492
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,120
抱歉  夫人  有人求見
Pardon me, ma'am. A gentleman to see you.

493
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,940
科里先生
Mr. Corey.

494
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,940
閣下有何貴干
To what do I owe the pleasure?

495
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:00,890
我在想是不是應該和你談談  夫人
I was wondering if I might talk to you, ma'am.

496
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,720
我有過一個小農場
I had a small farm.

497
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,550
它先是傷了我的心
First, it broke my heart.

498
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,490
然后傷了我的后背
then it broke my back.

499
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:14,870
你我都知道  心會痊愈
As you and I both know, the heart heals.

500
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,430
背傷卻永遠不會
The back never does.

501
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,890
從此我開始靠設陷阱捕獵為生
I took up trapping.

502
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:22,090
這種拮據的生活當初毀了印第安人
It's a meager living -- ruined the Indians.

503
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,980
現在正在逐漸毀掉我
Now it's ruining me.

504
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,520
設陷阱的時候  獵物通常都在夜里踏入陷阱
Thing about trapping is you get your good catch at night.

505
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,080
可到了早上  卻通常成了別人的食物
But by morning, it's someone else's meal.

506
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,130
至于我  我會守著我的陷阱
Me, I stay with my traps.

507
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,440
很精彩  科里先生  但是
Fascinating, Mr. Corey, but --

508
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,400
這就是為什么我來到這
That's why I was there...

509
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,320
我知道那天晚上
The night you did it...

510
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,880
你和你的仆人都干了些什么
You and your cinnamon girl.

511
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,870
你等了很久才來找我啊
You waited a long time.

512
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,010
因為之前不涉及到任何人
Nobody's business till now.

513
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:54,090
但那個被你燒掉的孩子是約翰·奧登的
But that was John Alden's baby that you buried out there.

514
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,170
他為你如此著迷  他有權知道真相
And the way he feels about you, he has a right to know.

515
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:02,580
所以該由你來說呢
So, are you gonna tell him?

516
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,750
還是我來
Or am I?

517
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,700
該死的
Oh, blast this wretched thing.

518
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,800
畫得很不錯
That's not bad.

519
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,990
路易斯牧師說繪畫是邪神崇拜
Reverend Lewis says drawing is idolatry,

520
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,430
如同崇拜自然或者什么
like worshiping nature or something.

521
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,930
總比崇拜些更糟糕的東西好
Well, there might be worse things to worship.

522
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,920
有機會的話  我想為你畫像
I'd like to draw you sometime.

523
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,240
我可不確定是否想看到畫中的自己
I'm not sure I'd like to see a portrait of me.

524
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,890
再說了  我也沒有時間
Besides, I have no time to sit.

525
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,770
我要離開了
I'm on way out of town.

526
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,840
這么快
So soon?

527
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,510
是因為害怕巫師嗎
Afraid of witches...

528
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,060
還是怕被當成是巫師
or being taken for one?

529
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,470
紐約離這可有一段路程
It's a long way to New York.

530
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,860
祝你有愉快的一天
Good day.

531
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,010
我不是故意嚇你的
Oh, I didn't mean to frighten you.

532
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,590
我沒被嚇到
Oh, I'm not frightened.

533
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,650
只是感到意外
Just surprised.

534
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,480
那是當然
Yes, of course --

535
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,250
對一個敢獨自在墓地里素描的女孩這算什么
A girl brave enough to sketch in a graveyard.

536
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,900
我不害怕死人
I'm not afraid of the dead,

537
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,390
活人也不怕
nor the living for that matter.

538
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,700
那是因為你對死亡一無所知
That's because you know nothing of death

539
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,710
對生命更加的無知
And less of life.

540
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,360
我可以教給你
I could teach you --

541
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,200
關于生命
about life...

542
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,690
和死亡
and death...

543
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,800
還有二者之間的東西
and many things in between.

544
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,570
你知道幾乎每個埋在這的女人都死于什么
Do you know what killed nearly every woman buried here?

545
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,480
愛情
Love.

546
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,270
大多數都死于分娩
Most died in childbirth.

547
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,770
所以說愛情之于女人就好比戰爭之于男人
So, love is to a woman what war is to a man --

548
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,570
都是所能做的最致命的事情
the most deadly thing they'll do.

549
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:14,350
只有傻子才會迫不及待的奔向戰爭和愛情
Only a fool runs quickly to war or love.

550
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,380
你自己小心為妙
You'd best watch yourself.

551
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,320
謝謝您  西布里夫人
Thank you...Mrs. Sibley.

552
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,550
對于您的智慧我真是望塵莫及
I can only aspire to your happy wisdom.

553
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,350
巫師們在哪里見面
Where do the witches meet?

554
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,750
樹林里
In the woods.

555
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,250
有多少人
How many?

556
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,710
我不知道
I don't know.

557
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,640
他們是誰
Who are they?

558
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,640
我
I --

559
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,730
我看不到他她們的臉
I can't see their faces.

560
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,160
好像是一些動物的頭顱
Like there's these heads of animals

561
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,550
一頭牡鹿  一頭豬和一只狼
like a stag and a pig and a wolf.

562
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,310
可你還是知道他們是誰
But you know who they are?

563
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,640
是的
Yes.

564
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,860
是的
Yes.

565
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,500
他們的名字
Their names.

566
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,200
為什么你不告訴我他們的名字
Why won't you tell me their names?

567
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,140
她不允許我
She won't let me.

568
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:26,850
她
"She"?

569
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,380
-是的  -誰
- Yes. - Who?

570
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,840
她是誰
Who is she?

571
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,070
告訴我
Tell me.

572
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,290
-我不能  -把名字告訴我
- I can't. - Tell me the names!

573
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,790
天哪  梅西
My god, Mercy.

574
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,720
盡管她不能說出名字
Though she cannot speak a name,

575
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,500
她會指出女巫是誰
she will show us the witch.

576
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,050
天吶  不要
Oh, no!

577
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,260
抱歉  上尉
Sorry, Captain.

578
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,410
你現在不能離開塞勒姆
You can't leave Salem just yet.

579
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,370
有些東西你得看看
Something you've got to see.

580
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,070
是他嗎  那個巫師
Is this him, the witch?

581
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,580
我想是吧
I think so.

582
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,080
所有的書籍上都說如果受害者
All the books say if the victim --

583
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,820
別管的你書怎么說
Never mind your books.

584
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,180
他是不是巫師
Is this the witch?

585
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,370
他不愿開口  既不承認也不否認
He won't plead either way.

586
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,720
這樣嗎
Is that so?

587
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,170
本來也不是什么真正的指控
Won't dignify the accusation.

588
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,740
一個小女孩朝著你吐口水
If you can call a young girl's

589
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,920
這也能算是指控嗎
spit an accusation.

590
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,690
要我開口的話
What I have to say,

591
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:02,810
我要跟約翰·奧登上尉談
I'll say to Captain John Alden.

592
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,670
只要你把奧登上尉找來
You just find me Captain Alden.

593
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,590
我可是有不少話要講呢
I'll have plenty to say.

594
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:15,170
我已經派人找過奧登上尉
I have sent men for captain Alden,

595
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,250
但是我被告知他已經離開了
but I'm told he's left town.

596
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,770
想辦法讓他招供
Just obtain a plea.

597
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,950
如果他還是不肯說呢
And if he remains silent?

598
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,730
大家賦予了你權力
You've been granted power.

599
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,490
好好利用它  從他嘴里逼出答案
Use it. Press him for an answer.

600
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,300
看看令他守口如瓶的惡魔是否
Let the same devil that holds his tongue

601
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,170
經得起巨石的碾壓
hold the stones.

602
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,420
快點  集會馬上就要開始了
Hurry. The sabbath is about to begin.

603
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,980
一  二  三 四
One, two, three, and four.

604
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,770
魔鬼  聽吾之召喚
Raise the devil to our door.

605
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,190
眾生之靈  豬  狼  羊
Call the pig, the wolf, the ram.

606
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:28,140
應吾之召  眾靈重現
Come to the circle, all who can.

607
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:32,520
他將再次行走于這片土地
Make him walk on floor to roof.

608
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,260
我們將與他舉杯共飲
Drink to him with horn and hoof.

609
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:39,020
一  二  三  四
One, two, three, and four.

610
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,710
魔鬼已至
The devil is here.

611
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,560
別再沉睡
Now sleep no more.

612
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,250
世間萬物將盡在你掌握
And all the world shall be yours in return.

613
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:13,340
如果你說的巫師們在這集會
If your witches meet here,

614
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,670
那他們夜視一定不錯
they got better night eyes than I do.

615
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,820
他們根本不需要視力
They don't need night eyes.

616
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:21,710
夜晚就是他們的眼睛
The night is their eyes.

617
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,440
這都是什么鬼東西
What the hell is this?

618
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:29,880
給惡魔的獻祭
Gifts to the devil himself --

619
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:31,680
都是未出生的嬰兒
The unborn.

620
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,990
無辜者之血
Cruor innocentia.

621
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:38,470
巫師  瘟疫
Maleficarum. Pestilentia.

622
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:40,070
五朔節之夜
Walpurgisnacht.

623
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:40,070
{\an8}根據德國神話  四月三十日夜晚女巫將與惡魔一起狂歡

624
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:42,600
儀式已完成
Consummatum est.

625
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,190
一切即將開始
Now it begins.

626
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,550
祭祀圈被破壞了
The circle was broken.

627
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:09,730
被誰
By who?

628
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,560
撒旦
Satan!

629
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:20,530
我請求你  先生
Please, sir.

630
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:22,430
我也不愿這么做
I don't want to to do this.

631
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:23,880
那就別這么做
Then don't.

632
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,860
講講道理吧
Be reasonable, man.

633
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,410
我有合法的權力對你進行逼供
I have the power to press you for an answer.

634
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:32,480
只要你開口  承認自己有罪
All you have to do is say the words "Guilty"

635
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,970
或是無罪
or "Not guilty,"

636
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:36,180
我們就能停止這一切
And we can stop all of this.

637
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:39,130
如果我承認有罪  黎明之前我就會被絞死
If I say "Guilty," you'll hang me before dawn.

638
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:40,810
如果我堅持自己無罪
And if I say not,

639
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:43,520
我的命運仍將握在你們這群混蛋手中
my fate is still in the hands of you bastards.

640
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,940
所以我寧愿沉默  將命運交給上帝
I'll hold my peace and trust in the Lord.

641
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:58,330
把石頭放下來
Lower the stones!

642
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:14,850
我再問你一次
I ask you again.

643
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:18,090
你承認自己有罪
Are you guilty...

644
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,350
或是無罪
or not?

645
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,570
我們死定了
We're dead.

646
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,060
不會的
No, we are not.

647
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,630
離死期也不遠了
Good as.

648
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,470
這一切你不是早就見識過嗎
I thought you've seen them before.

649
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:32,420
你想讓我看到這些  我也確實看到了
You wanted me to see them, and I saw them.

650
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:33,800
可他們也看見了我們
And they saw us.

651
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,490
我跟你說過  他們可能是任何人
And I told you they could be anybody.

652
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:36,660
好吧
Okay, just...

653
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,100
冷靜點
calm down.

654
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,140
你有什么話要說嗎
Have you something to say?

655
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,370
再加點石頭吧
More stones.

656
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:06,910
吉爾斯
Giles!

657
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:09,010
都給我離他遠點
Get the hell off of him!

658
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,850
奧登
Alden!

659
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,220
他死了
He's dead!

660
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,400
"地與海的居民
"Woe to the inhabitants...

661
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,840
你們有禍了
"of the earth and of the sea.

662
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,460
因為魔鬼即將降臨"
For the devil has come down unto you."

663
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,460
{\an8}出自圣經《啟示錄》12:12

664
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,070
你這個狗娘養的
Son of a bitch. Son of a...

665
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,190
不
No! No!

666
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:42,470
放手
Get!

667
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:57,880
我父親是最早踏上塞勒姆這片土地的人
My father's boots were the very first in Salem.

668
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:02,370
我警告你們這里每一個殺人如麻
And I'm warning every goddamn one of you murdering,

669
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,530
虛假偽善的清教徒混蛋
hypocritical puritan bastards

670
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:07,650
你們都不會有好下場
that these boots will be the last!

671
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,320
我再問你一次
I will ask you once again.

672
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:34,220
誰在那里
Who was there?

673
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:36,370
誰看見了我們
Who saw us?

674
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:38,820
我也再回答你一次
I will tell you again.

675
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:40,950
我不知道
I do not know.

676
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:45,600
當時槍口的火焰太亮了  很難看清
It is difficult to see past a muzzle flash.

677
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,290
那我建議你盡快查清楚  霍爾先生
Then I suggest you find out, Mr. Hale.

678
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,160
現在已經沒法回頭了
There's no turning back.

679
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:54,360
巫師追捕行動已經開始
The witch hunt has begun,

680
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,950
而主持審判的會是我們
and we will be running the trials.

681
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:01,120
你明白吧  喬治  不是嗎
You understand that, don't you, George?

682
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,610
你應該最清楚
You best of all.

683
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:06,100
我們會利用審判
We will use the trials

684
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,910
讓那些清教徒自相殘殺
to turn the puritans against each other.

685
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:12,130
他們將會追捕  屠殺
They will hunt and kill

686
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:15,130
最終淹沒于自己的鮮血當中
and drown in their very own blood

687
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:17,750
直到再無一名清教徒生還
till there's no puritans left standing...

688
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,190
而塞勒姆
And Salem...

689
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,130
將屬于我們
is ours.

690
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,970
{\an5}{\pos(195.2,191.935)}塞勒姆

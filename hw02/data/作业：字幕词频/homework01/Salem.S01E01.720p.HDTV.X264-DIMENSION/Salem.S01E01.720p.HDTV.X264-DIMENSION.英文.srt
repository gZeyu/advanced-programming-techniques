17
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,980
I, Isaac Walton...

18
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,860
Have gazed upon the nakedness of Abigail Cook...

19
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,110
...and did kiss her.

20
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,430
And?

21
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,980
And -- and did commit the sin of self-pollution.

22
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,850
And committed the sin of self-pollution.

23
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,570
10 hard ones.

24
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,940
On this glorious day,

25
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,300
Our brave boys muster

26
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,000
to face the devil's shock troops...

27
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,110
French and Indian savages

28
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,740
massing in the woods right outside our doors.

29
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,240
And what are you going off to defend?

30
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,200
Not Sodom, but Salem.

32
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,800
We cannot expect god to be on our side

33
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,050
if we tolerate abominations or those who commit them.

34
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,770
You two will remain in the stocks overnight.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,850
And you, boy, will bear the mark of your sins

36
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,490
the rest of your life.

37
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,130
No, please. Please!

38
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,850
For god's sakes, Sibley.

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,780
The stocks and the lashings are punishment enough.

40
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,510
No!

41
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,600
Fornicator!

42
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,670
Judge not...

43
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,010
lest ye be judged.

45
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,630
Who said that?

46
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,230
Jesus. You might have heard of him.

47
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,570
John Alden.

48
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,300
My respect for your father's memory

49
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,680
can only shield you so long.

50
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,370
It's a good thing you're mustering out tonight.

51
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,900
Like it or not, Sibley's in charge.

52
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,370
He tolerated your father,

53
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,610
but he won't be happy till he sees you swing.

54
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,070
Didn't you learn anything today?

55
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,400
Yes, yes, if I have to spend one more night

56
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,580
under the same stars as that bastard George Sibley,

57
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,310
I will gut him like the pig that he is.

58
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,520
If -- talking like that will land you in the stocks.

59
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,680
No day soon.

60
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,260
I'd rather die fighting the French and the Indians

61
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,580
than get pissed on by the good souls of Salem.

62
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,480
So, you're really leaving.

63
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,390
Mary, trust me.

64
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,500
I will come back for you.

65
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,720
Look.

66
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,160
This is all that I have.

67
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,830
And I swear on my parents' grave.

68
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,380
This is my vow.

69
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,130
This war will not last a year.

70
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,150
Forward!

71
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,230
Stay in formation, gentlemen.

72
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,260
Isn't but a half-day's ride.

73
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,380
I can't make it.

74
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,210
I think I'm gonna be sick again.

75
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,110
As soon as you sit down inside, it will settle.

76
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,410
Wait your betters, girl.

77
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,740
Peace be upon you.

78
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,350
And upon you.

79
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,390
Peace be upon you.

80
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,660
And upon you.

81
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,210
Though there are things to be said for war.

82
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,360
Gives a certain kind of man someplace to end up

83
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,160
other than the end of a brand...

84
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,000
or a rope.

85
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,900
You'll thank me one day.

86
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,500
Stay strong.

87
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,910
After tonight, it will all be over.

88
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,990
Tituba, wait.

89
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,770
I've changed my mind. I want to go back.

90
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,570
There is no place for that child in Salem.

91
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,000
George Sibley drove John Alden off to die in the war.

92
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,970
What do you think he's gonna do to you

93
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,250
when he finds out you're pregnant with John's baby?

94
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,750
Do not fear the woods.

95
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,990
The woods are gonna take care of that little soul...

96
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,290
and you.

97
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,440
What is this place?

98
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,770
You want to live? Lie still.

99
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,410
Please.

100
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,470
It's all that I have left of him.

101
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,240
Hush.

102
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,160
No, wait. I-I-I don't want to do this.

103
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,010
You don't have a choice, Mary.

104
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,590
Please.

105
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,460
- This is what you want. - Please.

106
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,790
This is what you want.

107
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,000
- No...please. - Let him in.

108
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,860
No, please.

109
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,420
Stay there!

110
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,470
John. John. John, help me.

111
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,650
Help me!

112
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,670
Now tell him.

113
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,320
Say it. This is what you want.

114
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,790
Yes. Yes!

115
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,650
Yes!

116
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,380
All the world shall be yours in return.

117
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,340
All the world.

120
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,040
...from heaven in flaming fire,

121
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,650
taking vengeance upon all those who know not God,

122
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,700
who have disobeyed the gospel! Read for yourself the truth.

123
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,260
The terrible truth --

125
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,860
Witches among us, the devil in Salem.

126
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,540
For you, sir.

127
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,650
For you, sir.

128
00:09:59,050 --> 00:09:59,850
No.

130
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,960
Easy. Easy.

131
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,150
This is the Alden house,

132
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,030
and there ain't any Aldens left.

133
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:11,170
So you are either a ghost, or you're about to be one.

134
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,470
That's a harsh way to say "Welcome home."

135
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,090
Johnny?

136
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,540
Can't be.

137
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,130
I heard you was dead -- killed in the war.

138
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,100
I wished I was a couple of times.

139
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,940
Ah, well, they can't keep a good man down.

140
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,300
Saw three men strung up on the way into town

141
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,580
and a new gallows being built in the heart of the common.

142
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,810
What the hell is that?

143
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,890
Precious Salem caught up in a stinking witch panic.

144
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,980
Witch panic?

145
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,650
Who did the bigwigs send in to put out the fire,

146
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,470
the Almighty increase Mather?

147
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,210
No, his son -- Cotton.

148
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,460
And not a chip off the old block -- barely a splinter.

149
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,890
I remember when we were kids

150
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,190
he used to dress like a girl.

151
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,460
Fought like one, too.

152
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,620
Well, he's all growed-up now.

153
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,130
A fine fool in fine silk clothes,

154
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,560
and not just any fool, the most dangerous kind --

155
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,570
the kind that thinks he knows everything.

156
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,260
But you didn't come back for all this horseshit.

157
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,960
You come back for one thing and one thing only.

158
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,320
Truth told, she's finer than ever.

159
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,090
And she's the richest woman in Salem.

160
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,900
And why not?

161
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,660
She's mary Sibley now.

163
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,590
Sibley?

164
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,730
George Sibley.

165
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,050
But his wife --

166
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,700
Died a few years ago.

167
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,990
You've been gone a long time, John.

168
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,220
Keep your powder in your bag.

169
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,170
One day,

170
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,230
your Mary will be the richest widow in the country.

171
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,100
The driver's at the door

172
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,680
with some packages for you, ma'am.

173
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:25,980
Send him in.

174
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,070
And, Nathaniel, take Mr. Sibley with you.

175
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,640
Time for his bath.

176
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,910
Now, Isaac, tell me some news of the world.

177
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,720
Saw a dusty fella walking into town today.

178
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,880
I couldn't believe my eyes.

179
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,160
Why?

180
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,900
It was John Alden.

181
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,120
Welcome back, Reverend Mather.

182
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,090
Rum, gin, ale?

183
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,620
Yes.

184
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,970
I need three strong men.

185
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,920
I can pay.

186
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,020
For what?

187
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,710
To subdue a girl.

188
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,510
Reverend Lewis.

189
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,240
Please help my daughter.

190
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,120
And be careful.

191
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,040
Tie her down!

192
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,960
Tie her down!!

193
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,580
Please, I beg you, sir. Please, make this stop.

194
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,950
I can do nothing, Mercy, unless you tell me...

195
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,780
Who is it torments you?

196
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,300
S-she's right there.

197
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,540
"She"?

198
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,890
Who is here?

199
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,480
Mercy, you must tell me!

200
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,220
Who is in this room with us?!

201
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,370
The hag! The old woman!

202
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,430
She's standing right there!

203
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,740
Please.

204
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,630
A simple physic.

205
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,650
To sleep.

206
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,400
Please. Please.

207
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,610
We call it a spectral attack --

208
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,470
The work of witches.

209
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,580
Pray for her.

210
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,220
I call bullshit.

211
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,580
She's clearly touched in the head.

212
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,730
She needs a doctor, not your prayers.

213
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,380
Don't dawdle, child.

214
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,270
I want you in the front row

215
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,120
Where Cotton Mather can't help but be dazzled by your charms.

216
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,470
For heaven's sake, mother,

217
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,030
why not just wrap me in silk and parade me on the auction block?

218
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,400
Fear no man's war.

219
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,980
For only a war from hell could destroy Salem.

220
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,530
The devil was never going to let

221
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,780
a promised land be built here

222
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,400
without a fight, without a battle!

223
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,150
And witches armed with deadly malice

224
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,740
are the most malignant and insidious weapons

225
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,280
in that battle,

226
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,670
in that war.

227
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,340
Even a single witch in Salem is enough to destroy

228
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,440
everything we have built and ever hope to build here!

229
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,260
Now, we have already killed three of them,

230
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,480
and yet their malice continues unabated.

231
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,480
Why?

232
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,070
Because there are still witches here among us!

233
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,670
Perhaps in this very hall!

234
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,540
Imagine a foe you can't see armed with weapons unknown

235
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,450
and the ability to appear as any one of us!

236
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,970
Then how can you hope to identify the correct culprit?

237
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,330
Have you seen the girl, sir?

238
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,740
Even now, Mercy Lewis bleeds from 100 wounds --

239
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,370
some impossible to self-inflict.

240
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,910
She is the one who will tell us who does this.

241
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,020
I see.

242
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,660
The ravings of a poor, sick girl

243
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,480
will help you identify what your reason fails to deliver.

244
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,510
My father --

245
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:36,070
Yes, of course. Your father.

246
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:41,030
Did your father, whom we all so respect,

247
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,600
offer you any advice when he sent you in his stead

248
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,970
to our aid?

249
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,420
He...advised caution.

250
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,410
Caution?

251
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,620
And are we to take three people hung

252
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,150
as the measure of Mather Junior's caution?

253
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,190
There could be nothing worse for Salem,

254
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,050
for the country, than a witch hunt.

255
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,160
Witches.

256
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,840
Witches.

257
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,280
Indeed.

258
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:26,580
As my beloved husband, the head of your selectmen, reminds me,

259
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,480
there is something worse than a witch hunt --

260
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,400
a witch.

261
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,360
A witch?

262
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,220
Sure, that's bad.

263
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,880
But why not an ogre...

264
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,100
or a goblin?

265
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,940
Why not a dragon, long as we're talking about fairy tales?

266
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,430
John Alden.

267
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,770
We all welcome captain alden home from his long,

268
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,040
long service in our defense.

269
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,670
Puritans know their sun is setting.

270
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,910
Nothing like a new enemy or a new old enemy

271
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,650
to get people behind you.

272
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,360
Captain Alden.

273
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,170
Mrs. Sibley.

274
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,550
Mr. Sibley and I are hosting a small dinner tomorrow night.

275
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,890
We'd be honored if you'd join.

276
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,880
Why are you staring at me?

277
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,130
I don't even know you.

278
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,290
Isaac?

279
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,460
Isaac the fornicator.

280
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,670
Hide your wives.

281
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,720
Hide your daughters. Hell, your sheep!

282
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,620
All right, look.

283
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,810
So, what do you want from me?

284
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,230
Listen to me, John Alden.

285
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,480
Coming home to Salem to get out of the war

286
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,920
is like jumping in the ocean to get out of the rain.

287
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,020
Truth hides.

288
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,310
They could be anyone.

289
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,810
Oh, they who? Who's they?

290
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,040
Witches!

291
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,170
Ain't no fairy tale.

292
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,700
They're real.

293
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,750
All these years,

294
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,790
your Mary's the only one who's ever done me a good turn.

295
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,050
She's not my Mary now.

296
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,630
You left once before.

297
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,540
Look what happened.

298
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,310
Don't walk out on us again.

299
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,480
Is this really necessary?

300
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,120
A witches' familiars --

301
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,360
demons, usually in the form of an animal.

302
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,560
Cat, rat, a bird, or a toad --

303
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,360
they perform all sorts of useful tasks

304
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,150
as long as they're fed.

305
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,850
You heard what she told us.

306
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,200
She was forced to feed their familiars.

307
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,020
She must be searched for the marks --

308
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,830
teats where she suckled them.

309
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,110
Please help her.

310
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,480
"Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea!

311
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,840
"For the devil has come down unto you with great wrath

312
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,440
because he knoweth that he hath but a short time."

313
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,820
Revelations chapter 12:12.

314
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,570
I see the end of the world

315
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,030
urges you onto greater efforts.

316
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,080
Mm, as it must us all.

317
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,500
Our granny used to scare us silly

318
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,220
with those witch stories.

319
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,020
But she'd really terrify my brothers.

320
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,400
She told them witches could steal a man's --

321
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,140
Would you like that, Gloriana,

322
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,000
without the bother of the man attached?

323
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,480
Not this man.

324
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,640
My darling.

325
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,560
See you next time, governor.

326
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,520
Just attending to the poor.

327
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,330
No doubt -- and the poor in spirit.

328
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,020
Captain alden, right?

329
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,450
I haven't seen you since we were children.

330
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,140
I expected to see you up at Harvard.

331
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,830
Surprised to hear that you'd run off to join the militia --

332
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,220
like a servant.

333
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,480
I would have loved to spend four years

334
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,130
counting angels on the heads of pins, but...

335
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,980
...there was a war on.

336
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,200
Pity.

337
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,900
I owe everything to my education.

338
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,450
Taught you everything about hunting witches?

339
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,010
No.

340
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,600
But my father burnt scores back in Essex,

341
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,240
and I've read every book there is on the subject --

342
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,050
in eight languages.

343
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,070
So, you learned your hunting from books.

344
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,260
Well, that's a bit like learning the facts of life

345
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,770
from your maiden aunt.

346
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,220
But never mind.

347
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:18,990
You're here now,

348
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,950
and you're the expert on witches,

349
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,820
So let me ask you.

350
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,940
What do these awful witches want, huh?

351
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,480
The same thing we all want...

352
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,520
...a country of their own.

353
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,140
And here I've been wasting my time fighting mere Indians.

354
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,480
Good night, Harvard.

355
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,040
Time for your feeding.

356
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,260
Yes.

357
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,440
Yes.

358
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,000
Someone, help me!

359
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,680
Help me.

360
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,490
Yes.

361
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:57,890
No.

362
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,590
Help me! Help!

363
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,640
Help!

364
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,220
George, don't fight it.

365
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,140
You know it only hurts more.

366
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,090
You took away everything I had, George Sibley...

367
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,330
everything I loved.

368
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:29,350
Can you imagine how good it feels

369
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,760
to take everything you have,

370
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,820
destroy all you've built,

371
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,420
and devour your very soul?

372
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,650
All done.

373
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,690
I would like to make a toast to our hostess,

374
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,200
Mary sibley,

375
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,550
who has shown us that true piety and true beauty

376
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,510
amount to the same worship.

377
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,730
Indeed.

378
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,570
Beauty is the last miracle allowed in an ugly...

379
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,540
fallen world.

380
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,090
Magistrate Hale and I are concerned

381
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,880
about our daughter's inner beauty, Reverend Mather.

382
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,870
Perhaps you could suggest a tutor for her,

383
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,670
a Harvard man -- like yourself?

384
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,370
I believe there is only so much you can learn from books.

385
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,410
Experience is our true teacher.

386
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,440
Don't you agree, captain Alden?

387
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,490
Well, that depends on the experience.

388
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:35,180
Yours must have been fascinating -- with the indians.

389
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,140
They're so mysterious,

390
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,350
So...natural.

391
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,510
Natural?

392
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,890
"Unnatural," I'd say.

393
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,660
Soulless savages.

394
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,870
I assure you, ma'am, the indians do have souls,

395
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,600
if any of us do.

396
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,930
"If"?

397
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,830
And what about witches?

398
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,840
Do they have souls, too?

399
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,340
They do.

400
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,740
But they have deeded them to the devil himself

401
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:09,980
in exchange for powers and all that they desire.

402
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,750
- A contract? - Indeed.

403
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,780
Ironic.

404
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,910
As I believe, by law,

405
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,790
a woman's not allowed to enter a contract

406
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,250
but through the agency of their husband.

407
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,890
Nathaniel.

408
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,960
Yes, ma'am.

409
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,830
Not all witches are women.

410
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,960
And what do you think, captain Alden?

411
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,430
I don't know.

412
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,850
I think some things just beggar belief,

413
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,540
like an honest frenchman or a faithful woman,

414
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,740
things that I'll believe in if and when I see one.

415
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,210
I find I worry more

416
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,800
about the french and the indian attacks

417
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,630
than I do witches.

418
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,770
What's your opinion, captain Alden?

419
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,120
Just how vulnerable are we?

420
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,780
Are you all right, captain Alden?

421
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,480
I think this rich food doesn't agree with me.

422
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,830
Some fresh air might help.

423
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,450
I was told you were killed.

424
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,970
Was that before or after you married Sibley?

425
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,150
I remember being told once

426
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,310
that the war wouldn't last a year.

427
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,290
That wasn't up to me.

428
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,040
I waited for you.

429
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:59,260
Years and years without a word.

430
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,010
I couldn't write.

431
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,390
No, of course not.

432
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,450
Too busy saving the country.

433
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,440
Not exactly.

434
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,530
I was captured.

435
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,360
Their priest man told the others not to take this away from me.

436
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,900
He said the universe itself was made out of vows,

437
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,570
and breaking them carries consequences.

438
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:37,010
I know that this is just half a silver coin,

439
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:40,420
and you have... no shortage of silver now.

440
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,430
Mary, come with me.

441
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,640
Now...tonight.

442
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,890
I have money in a bank in new york.

443
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,550
It's different there.

444
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,580
There's not a puritan in sight.

445
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,120
It's not too late.

446
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,830
We can be together

447
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,460
anywhere.

448
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,060
Anywhere but here.

449
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,940
New York?

450
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,960
Yeah.

451
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,610
Is that before or after you were captured?

452
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,600
You walk out of here one night,

453
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,280
and you come back years later.

454
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,690
A-and you think that --

455
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,900
Mary.

456
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,330
Come here.

457
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,480
No.

458
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,070
I can't.

459
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,390
It's impossible.

460
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,370
He'd never let me.

461
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,080
Now, now, Mrs. Sibley.

462
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,540
Even you have no right to monopolize a guest

463
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,740
as fascinating as Captain Alden,

464
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,960
for whom I have a rare gift,

465
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,620
a cigar of tobacco from Guyana with some Brandy.

466
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,600
I'm afraid all this...

467
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,020
civilized eating and drinking has laid me out, magistrate.

468
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,560
You told me he was dead!

469
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,870
It's not like counting sheep, honey.

470
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,470
more like counting shadows.

471
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,620
But it don't change a thing.

472
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:37,050
What's John Alden compared to all that lies before you?

473
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,440
Stop your weeping, woman.

474
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,860
That boy don't deserve those tears.

475
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,440
They're not for him.

476
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,160
They're for the girl I once was.

477
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,630
That girl belongs to somebody else now.

478
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,360
Was it he that left you to the wolves?

479
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,370
No, child.

480
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,710
It was he that saved you from the wolves

481
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,920
and raised you up to all of this.

482
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:08,900
You have a grand vision.

483
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,800
Don't lose sight of it.

484
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,900
Tomorrow, the moon is with us.

485
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,340
Tomorrow, it begins.

486
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:20,860
Leave your anger and your pain for the kenaima to feed on.

487
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,620
Has he not been true to his vow?

488
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,540
Are not your enemies now your slaves?

489
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,710
Do you not have everything that you desire --

490
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,710
Wealth, power?

491
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,610
Almost everything.

492
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,120
Pardon me, ma'am. A gentleman to see you.

493
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,940
Mr. Corey.

494
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,940
To what do I owe the pleasure?

495
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:00,890
I was wondering if I might talk to you, ma'am.

496
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,720
I had a small farm.

497
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,550
First, it broke my heart.

498
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,490
then it broke my back.

499
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:14,870
As you and I both know, the heart heals.

500
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,430
The back never does.

501
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,890
I took up trapping.

502
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:22,090
It's a meager living -- ruined the Indians.

503
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,980
Now it's ruining me.

504
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,520
Thing about trapping is you get your good catch at night.

505
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,080
But by morning, it's someone else's meal.

506
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,130
Me, I stay with my traps.

507
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,440
Fascinating, Mr. Corey, but --

508
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,400
That's why I was there...

509
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,320
The night you did it...

510
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,880
You and your cinnamon girl.

511
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,870
You waited a long time.

512
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,010
Nobody's business till now.

513
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:54,090
But that was John Alden's baby that you buried out there.

514
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,170
And the way he feels about you, he has a right to know.

515
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:02,580
So, are you gonna tell him?

516
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,750
Or am I?

517
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,700
Oh, blast this wretched thing.

518
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,800
That's not bad.

519
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,990
Reverend Lewis says drawing is idolatry,

520
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,430
like worshiping nature or something.

521
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,930
Well, there might be worse things to worship.

522
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,920
I'd like to draw you sometime.

523
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,240
I'm not sure I'd like to see a portrait of me.

524
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,890
Besides, I have no time to sit.

525
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,770
I'm on way out of town.

526
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,840
So soon?

527
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,510
Afraid of witches...

528
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,060
or being taken for one?

529
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,470
It's a long way to New York.

530
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,860
Good day.

531
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,010
Oh, I didn't mean to frighten you.

532
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,590
Oh, I'm not frightened.

533
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,650
Just surprised.

534
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,480
Yes, of course --

535
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,250
A girl brave enough to sketch in a graveyard.

536
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,900
I'm not afraid of the dead,

537
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,390
nor the living for that matter.

538
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,700
That's because you know nothing of death

539
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,710
And less of life.

540
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,360
I could teach you --

541
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,200
about life...

542
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,690
and death...

543
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,800
and many things in between.

544
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,570
Do you know what killed nearly every woman buried here?

545
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,480
Love.

546
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,270
Most died in childbirth.

547
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,770
So, love is to a woman what war is to a man --

548
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,570
the most deadly thing they'll do.

549
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:14,350
Only a fool runs quickly to war or love.

550
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,380
You'd best watch yourself.

551
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,320
Thank you...Mrs. Sibley.

552
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,550
I can only aspire to your happy wisdom.

553
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,350
Where do the witches meet?

554
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,750
In the woods.

555
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,250
How many?

556
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,710
I don't know.

557
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,640
Who are they?

558
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,640
I --

559
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,730
I can't see their faces.

560
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,160
Like there's these heads of animals

561
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,550
like a stag and a pig and a wolf.

562
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,310
But you know who they are?

563
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,640
Yes.

564
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,860
Yes.

565
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,500
Their names.

566
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,200
Why won't you tell me their names?

567
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,140
She won't let me.

568
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:26,850
"She"?

569
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,380
- Yes. - Who?

570
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,840
Who is she?

571
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,070
Tell me.

572
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,290
- I can't. - Tell me the names!

573
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,790
My god, Mercy.

574
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,720
Though she cannot speak a name,

575
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,500
she will show us the witch.

576
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,050
Oh, no!

577
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,260
Sorry, Captain.

578
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,410
You can't leave Salem just yet.

579
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,370
Something you've got to see.

580
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,070
Is this him, the witch?

581
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,580
I think so.

582
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,080
All the books say if the victim --

583
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,820
Never mind your books.

584
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,180
Is this the witch?

585
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,370
He won't plead either way.

586
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,720
Is that so?

587
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,170
Won't dignify the accusation.

588
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,740
If you can call a young girl's

589
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,920
spit an accusation.

590
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,690
What I have to say,

591
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:02,810
I'll say to Captain John Alden.

592
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,670
You just find me Captain Alden.

593
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,590
I'll have plenty to say.

594
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:15,170
I have sent men for captain Alden,

595
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,250
but I'm told he's left town.

596
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,770
Just obtain a plea.

597
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,950
And if he remains silent?

598
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,730
You've been granted power.

599
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,490
Use it. Press him for an answer.

600
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,300
Let the same devil that holds his tongue

601
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,170
hold the stones.

602
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,420
Hurry. The sabbath is about to begin.

603
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,980
One, two, three, and four.

604
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,770
Raise the devil to our door.

605
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,190
Call the pig, the wolf, the ram.

606
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:28,140
Come to the circle, all who can.

607
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:32,520
Make him walk on floor to roof.

608
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,260
Drink to him with horn and hoof.

609
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:39,020
One, two, three, and four.

610
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,710
The devil is here.

611
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,560
Now sleep no more.

612
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,250
And all the world shall be yours in return.

613
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:13,340
If your witches meet here,

614
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,670
they got better night eyes than I do.

615
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,820
They don't need night eyes.

616
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:21,710
The night is their eyes.

617
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,440
What the hell is this?

618
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:29,880
Gifts to the devil himself --

619
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:31,680
The unborn.

620
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,990
Cruor innocentia.

621
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:38,470
Maleficarum. Pestilentia.

622
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:40,070
Walpurgisnacht.

624
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:42,600
Consummatum est.

625
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,190
Now it begins.

626
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,550
The circle was broken.

627
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:09,730
By who?

628
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,560
Satan!

629
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:20,530
Please, sir.

630
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:22,430
I don't want to to do this.

631
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:23,880
Then don't.

632
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,860
Be reasonable, man.

633
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,410
I have the power to press you for an answer.

634
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:32,480
All you have to do is say the words "Guilty"

635
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,970
or "Not guilty,"

636
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:36,180
And we can stop all of this.

637
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:39,130
If I say "Guilty," you'll hang me before dawn.

638
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:40,810
And if I say not,

639
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:43,520
my fate is still in the hands of you bastards.

640
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,940
I'll hold my peace and trust in the Lord.

641
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:58,330
Lower the stones!

642
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:14,850
I ask you again.

643
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:18,090
Are you guilty...

644
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,350
or not?

645
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,570
We're dead.

646
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,060
No, we are not.

647
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,630
Good as.

648
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,470
I thought you've seen them before.

649
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:32,420
You wanted me to see them, and I saw them.

650
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:33,800
And they saw us.

651
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,490
And I told you they could be anybody.

652
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:36,660
Okay, just...

653
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,100
calm down.

654
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,140
Have you something to say?

655
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,370
More stones.

656
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:06,910
Giles!

657
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:09,010
Get the hell off of him!

658
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,850
Alden!

659
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,220
He's dead!

660
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,400
"Woe to the inhabitants...

661
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,840
"of the earth and of the sea.

662
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,460
For the devil has come down unto you."

664
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,070
Son of a bitch. Son of a...

665
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,190
No! No!

666
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:42,470
Get!

667
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:57,880
My father's boots were the very first in Salem.

668
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:02,370
And I'm warning every goddamn one of you murdering,

669
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,530
hypocritical puritan bastards

670
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:07,650
that these boots will be the last!

671
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,320
I will ask you once again.

672
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:34,220
Who was there?

673
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:36,370
Who saw us?

674
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:38,820
I will tell you again.

675
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:40,950
I do not know.

676
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:45,600
It is difficult to see past a muzzle flash.

677
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,290
Then I suggest you find out, Mr. Hale.

678
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,160
There's no turning back.

679
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:54,360
The witch hunt has begun,

680
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,950
and we will be running the trials.

681
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:01,120
You understand that, don't you, George?

682
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,610
You best of all.

683
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:06,100
We will use the trials

684
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,910
to turn the puritans against each other.

685
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:12,130
They will hunt and kill

686
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:15,130
and drown in their very own blood

687
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:17,750
till there's no puritans left standing...

688
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,190
And Salem...

689
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,130
is ours.

第一季  第二集

14
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,070
《塞勒姆》前情提要
Previously on "Salem"...

15
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,820
今天看到一个人风尘仆仆地进城了
Saw a dusty fella walking into town today.

16
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,570
我简直不敢相信自己的眼睛
I couldn't believe my eyes.

17
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,710
是约翰·奥登
It was John Alden.

18
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,160
你告诉我他死了
You told me he was dead!

19
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,590
这就是我的誓言
This is my vow.

20
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,880
为了你我会回来的
I will come back for you.

21
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,850
约翰·奥登比起你眼前的一切算得了什么
What's John Alden compared to all that lies before you?

22
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,400
你回来的目的只有一个
You come back for one thing and one thing only.

23
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,260
如今她可是玛丽·西布里
She's Mary Sibley now.

24
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,520
她是塞勒姆最富有的女人
And she's the richest woman in Salem.

25
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,070
喂食时间到了
Time for your feeding.

26
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:37,010
塞勒姆因为巫师的事人心惶惶
Precious Salem caught up in a stinking witch panic.

27
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,500
若无一场血战  魔鬼绝不会轻易
The devil was never going to let

28
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,210
让我们在这里建立应许之地  
a promised land be built here without a fight!

29
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,820
我不害怕死人
I'm not afraid of the dead,

30
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,330
活人也不怕
nor the living for that matter.

31
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,120
那些可怕的巫师想要什么
What is it that these witches want?

32
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,130
一个属于他们的国家
A country of their own.

33
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,050
我年复一年地一直在等着你
I waited for you. Years and years.

34
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,510
那晚的事我都看到了
I was there the night you did it.

35
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,340
他留给我的只有这个孩子了
It's all that I have left of him.

36
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,780
那是约翰·奥登的孩子
That was John Alden's baby.

37
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,260
你是想自己告诉他呢  还是我来
Are you gonna tell him, or am I?

38
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,870
她会指出女巫是谁
She will show us the witch.

39
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,270
谁看见了我们
Who saw us?

40
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,440
我也再回答你一次
I will tell you again.

41
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,450
我不知道
I do not know.

42
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,700
巫师追捕行动已经开始  而主持审判的会是我们
The witch hunt has begun, and we will be running the trials.

43
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,530
你承认自己有罪
Are you guilty...

44
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,660
或是无罪
or not?

45
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,790
大部分之前活着的人如今都死了
Most of those who have ever lived are now dead.

46
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,630
但有极少数人一定会被地狱之火焚烧
All but very few must surely burn in hell.

47
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,850
我们希望有天这片幅员辽阔的土地能人丁兴旺
We may someday over-people this vast, empty new land,

48
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,650
但恐怕地狱已经先声夺人
but I fear that we have already over-peopled hell.

49
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,700
如此  就如以赛亚书中所述
So that, as it is written in Isaiah,

50
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,130
"阴间扩张其欲"
"Hell hath enlarged herself."

51
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,130
{\an8}以赛亚书5:14  
故此  阴间扩张其欲  开了无限量的口
他们的荣耀  群众  繁华  并快乐的人  都落在其中

52
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,590
如今这里被称作...
And is now called...

53
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,970
美国
America.

54
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,050
我来塞勒姆才两周
I have been in Salem a fortnight,

55
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,270
就已处死了三名巫师
and I have already hung three witches.

56
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,710
建立人间天堂就要付出如此的代价吗
Is this the price of building heaven on earth?

57
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,070
我已将黑手伸向他那些最致命的仆人
I have laid my hands upon his most deadly servants...

58
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,570
那些巫师
the witches.

59
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,190
我到底有没有
Or have I?

60
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,390
我遵从你的每一条命令
I obeyed every one of your instructions.

61
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,770
我甚至逼死了一个可能无辜的男人
I even pressed a possibly innocent man to death.

62
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,340
我依然能尝到他飞溅在我唇上的鲜血
I still taste his spattered blood on my lips.

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,050
主啊  我求求你
Please, Lord, I beg thee.

64
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,120
给我一个征兆
Give me a sign.

65
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,950
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

66
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,020
*鼓鸣震天*
*Witch drums*

67
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,400
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

68
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,930
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

69
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,960
*鼓鸣震天*
*The witch drums*

70
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,500
*宁入地狱*
*Better pray for hell*

71
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:12,330
*不留人间*
*Not hallelujah*

72
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,190
原谅我
Forgive me.

73
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,720
你对生活失去性趣了吗
Have you lost your lust for life?

74
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,380
别告诉我你已经玩够了
Don't tell me that you are full up.

75
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,210
或许是某个黑洞欲求不满
Perhaps some holes cannot be filled.

76
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,390
是吗  大人
Really, my lord?

77
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,490
那是什么洞啊
Which holes are those?

78
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,080
那个我们为自己挖的洞
The ones we dig for ourselves.

79
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,010
亲爱的  你的神情为何如此沉重
What weighs so heavy on you, love?

80
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,120
怕我父亲用鞋底抽我
By the taste of it, my father's boot.

81
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,560
你现在是大人了
You're a big boy now.

82
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,290
成熟男人可不怕他们的父亲
Grown men don't fear their fathers.

83
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,070
你又不认识我父亲
You don't know my father.

84
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,650
是个人都认识他
Everyone knows your father.

85
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,920
也对
Precisely.

86
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,320
不  你不能进去
No, you can't go in there!

87
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,360
奥登上尉
Captain Alden!

88
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,210
不  不  不
No! No! No!

89
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,460
放开他
Leave him alone!

90
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,620
滚
Get out.

91
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,310
这就是你赎罪的方法吗
This is how you wipe the innocent blood off your hands?

92
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,400
干得爽吗
On the ass of a whore?

93
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,310
吉尔斯·科里从没为自己辩白过
Giles Corey never pled!

94
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,080
所以我们如何得知他是清白的
Ergo, we don't know he was innocent!

95
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,830
给我一个
Give me one good reason

96
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,960
不杀你的理由
why I don't put you in the ground.

97
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,210
我说不出来
Sir, I cannot.

98
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,710
自我十岁起  我就期望死神的到来
I've been expecting the angel of death since I was 10.

99
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,660
我没亲眼看到过他  但在我祖父临死前
I didn't see him myself, but I knew from the look

100
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,980
我在他的眼神里
in grandfather's eyes just before he went,

101
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,410
看到了死神恐怖的面孔
the angel bore a most terrible face.

102
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,910
正如你现在这样
Quite like yours, I expect.

103
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,640
动手吧  天使
So come, angel.

104
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,120
你会发现我已完全准备好
You find me fully prepared

105
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,200
成为一支人肉蜡烛  和所有那些该死的人一起
to burn like a human candle for eternity

106
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,580
在燃烧着黑焦油的深渊里照亮永恒
in a pit of burning black tar with all the other damned.

107
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,360
燃烧的黑焦油
Burning black tar?

108
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,360
不应该是地狱火吗
I thought hell was fire.

109
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,130
那是种普遍的错误观念
A common misconception.

110
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,410
地狱之火形态似火
Hellfire burns like fire

111
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,100
但其实是粘稠的黑沥青
But is the consistency of thick black pitch.

112
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:36,750
怎么了
What?

113
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,860
你看到什么了
What have you seen?

114
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,350
不知道
Not sure.

115
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:49,750
可能是世间的地狱吧
Hell on earth, maybe.

116
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,350
穿好衣服
Get dressed.

117
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,930
我有东西给你看
I've got something to show you.

118
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,430
这是去哪里
Where are we going?

119
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,350
树林
The woods.

120
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,150
去那里干什么
To what end?

121
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,950
虽然你道德败坏如同蝼蚁
You have the moral compass of a meat ant,

122
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,910
但巫师的事你确实知道点
but you do know something about witches.

123
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:09,870
我看到过他们
I saw them.

124
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,660
就跟梅西·路易丝描述的一样
Just like Mercy Lewis described them.

125
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,180
人体兽头之类的
Animal heads and all.

126
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,190
奥登上尉
Captain Alden.

127
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,710
作为塞勒姆的治安官  我以你昨晚
As magistrate of Salem, I hereby place you under arrest

128
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,390
在绞刑架下的暴力抗议罪逮捕你
for violent remonstrations in the common last night.

129
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,580
你将面临妨碍公共秩序
You shall face charges of disorderly, riotous mischief

130
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,470
和煽动混乱罪的起诉
and incitement to mayhem.

131
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,520
去找艾萨克  他会带你去的
Talk to Isaac. He'll show you the way.

132
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,240
你想怎样  霍尔
What are you gonna do, Hale?

133
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,110
像逼死吉尔斯·科里一样把我逼死吗
Press me to death just like you did to Giles Corey?

134
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,190
这该怪你的牧师新朋友吧
I suggest you take that up with your new friend,

135
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,800
都是他干的  与我无关
the reverend, as it was his doing, not mine.

136
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,190
带他走
Away with him.

137
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,080
你今晚够忙的啊
You've had a busy night.

138
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,490
你打算什么时候告诉我你逮捕了约翰·奥登
When were you planning to tell me you'd arrested John Alden?

139
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,450
把他绞死前还是绞死后呢
Before or after you hang him?

140
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,340
他就是个不定时炸弹
The man is a loose canon.

141
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,690
他在全镇一半的人面前公然威胁镇长
He threatened the selectmen in front of half the town.

142
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,360
如果他是个麻烦  那也是我的麻烦
If he's a problem, he's my problem.

143
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,750
恕我直言
With all due respect,

144
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,770
他可能会成为我们所有人的麻烦
he could become a problem for us all.

145
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,570
塞勒姆我丈夫说了算  而他又对我言听计从
My husband controls Salem, and I control him.

146
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,460
所以我没发话你不许轻举妄动
You do nothing without my say.

147
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,540
无意冒犯
With all due respect.

148
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,800
是  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

149
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,080
你的任务只有一个  霍尔先生
Concern yourself with one thing, Mr. Hale --

150
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,900
找到破坏祭祀圈的人
Find out who broke our circle.

151
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,340
再去树林
Head back to the woods.

152
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,760
找到鬼眼
Find the seer.

153
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,320
他当时有眼线在场
His eyes were there.

154
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,000
我们就是在这里看到巫师的
It was right here we saw the witches.

155
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,710
奥登上尉也看到了吗
Captain Alden saw all this, too?

156
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,670
对
Yeah.

157
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,660
还有别的...
And something else...

158
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,940
我之前从未见过
Something I ain't seen before.

159
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,270
他们刺死了一只鸟
They stabbed a bird --

160
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,850
一只白鸽
A white dove.

161
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,240
我自己杀过不少鸽子
I killed more than a few pigeons myself,

162
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,510
白鸽不过就是只好看点的鸽子
and a dove ain't nothing but a prettier pigeon,

163
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,060
但这次感觉不同
but this felt different.

164
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,780
我也说不上原因
I can't say why...

165
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,780
就好像那是世上最悲伤的事
Like it was the saddest thing in the world...

166
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,080
让一只白鸽血流至死
To bleed a dove to death.

167
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,160
只是一只白鸽
Just the one dove.

168
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,960
果然  就像巫师之釜
Of course. Like a witch's cauldron.

169
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,920
一棵树  像釜
A tree? Like a cauldron?

170
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,800
人们还说我疯了
And folks say Isaac's touched.

171
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,680
找到了
Got you.

172
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,100
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley.

173
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,660
-打开  -是  夫人
- Open it. - Yes, ma'am.

174
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,200
退下吧
Now leave.

175
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,050
你的行为在塞勒姆可是要处以绞刑的
Salem still hangs men for what you did...

176
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,460
你威胁了镇长
Threatening the selectmen.

177
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,250
什么都阻止不了他们
Nothing stopping them.

178
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,900
我绝不会让那种事发生的
I'd never let that happen.

179
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,980
那么吉尔斯·科里被大石压死时
And where was that compassion

180
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,300
你那怜悯之心哪去了
when Giles Corey was being crushed to death?

181
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,050
你可以走了
You're free to go.

182
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,440
但是镇长要你离开塞勒姆  永不回来
But the selectmen urge you to leave Salem and never come back.

183
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,400
是镇长要我离开
The selectmen...

184
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,540
还是玛丽·西布里
...or Mary Sibley?

185
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,600
我这是在救你
I am trying to save you.

186
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,760
你不属于这里
You don't belong here.

187
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,220
你也不属于这里
And neither do you.

188
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,890
我告诉过你了  我不能走
I told you... I can't leave.

189
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,960
据我所知
Well, last time I checked,

190
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,470
你丈夫可没那个本事阻止你
your husband was in no shape to stop you.

191
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,160
真没想到你如此自信啊  上尉
Your confidence astounds me, Captain.

192
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,850
你是不是一直想象我会满含喜悦的泪水
But did you imagine that I would welcome you back

193
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,620
欢迎你回来
with tears of joy?

194
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,250
你真是天真啊
How incredibly naive you are.

195
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,310
太晚了
You're too late.

196
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,610
都结束了
It's over.

197
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,170
我不想在这里看到你
I don't want you here.

198
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,800
我差点就相信你了
I almost believe you.

199
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,820
马上离开塞勒姆
Get out of Salem... now...

200
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,650
否则你会被绞死的
Or you will hang.

201
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:53,950
先生
Sir.

202
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,970
加把劲  你可以的
All right, you can do this.

203
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,550
我做不到
I can't do it.

204
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,480
-太大了  -你可以的
- It's too big. - Yes, you can.

205
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,440
比你小的姑娘都能顺利生下更大的孩子呢
I have gotten bigger babies out of smaller girls.

206
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,850
不能让这个姑娘生下孩子
Not this baby out of this girl,

207
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,790
除非她肯说出孩子父亲的名字
not until she tells us the name of the father.

208
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,890
西布里夫人  恕我直言
Mrs. Sibley, excuse me,

209
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,710
这孩子必须得生下来
but this baby has got to come out.

210
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,750
塞勒姆不会接受这个野种
Salem won't shoulder another bastard.

211
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,030
你在这里做什么
What are you doing here?

212
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,670
我的朋友布里奇特在教我
My friend Bridget teaches me

213
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,850
上帝造物的神奇
the wonders of God's own creation.

214
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,600
汉娜
Hannah,

215
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,460
把他的名字说出来好吗
will you tell us the name of your man?

216
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,790
我不能说  小姐  否则他就当不成学徒了
I cannot, miss. He'll lose his apprenticeship.

217
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,380
这几年他是不能结婚的
He ain't allowed to marry for some years yet.

218
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,690
那是他的问题  不是塞勒姆的
That is his problem, not Salem's.

219
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,000
玛丽  你也是女人
Mary, you're a woman.

220
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,130
也曾穷困潦倒
You were even a poor one once.

221
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,620
但现在你是玛丽·西布里
But now you're Mary Sibley.

222
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,540
就一次  用你在清教徒中的地位
For once, use your position among the puritans

223
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,080
帮帮自己人吧
to help one of your own.

224
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,360
没有男人值得你如此  孩子
No man is worth it, child,

225
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,310
如果他值得  他就宁愿你说出他的名字
or if he is, he would rather you tell us his name

226
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,030
也不要你为保护他而死
than die trying to protect him.

227
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,100
比利
Billy!

228
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,820
是比利·贝林  桶匠的学徒
It was Billy Bailyn, the cooper's apprentice.

229
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,110
放轻松  听我说
Just relax. Stay with me.

230
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,470
没事的  汉娜
All right, Hannah.

231
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,760
我需要你再用点力
I want you to give me a big push.

232
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,410
就差一点
Almost there!

233
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,550
就这样
That's it.

234
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,750
用力  很好
Big push. Well done!

235
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,810
继续
Keep going.

236
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,630
生出来了
That's it.

237
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,000
救救我
Help me!

238
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,380
没事的
It's going to be all right.

239
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,650
抱歉  夫人
Excuse us, madam.

240
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,830
来吧  进去
Come on, now. In you go.

241
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,700
彼得鲁斯  不是吧
Petrus, really.

242
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,450
你真该挂个铃铛了
You ought to wear a little bell.

243
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,770
而您  治安官大人  就大可不必了
And you, Magistrate, need none.

244
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,670
您一上路我们就听到动静了
We heard you the moment you left the road.

245
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,270
来
Come.

246
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,980
这地方可真不好找
I had a bit of trouble finding the place.

247
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,120
让我记起  上次你还去了更北的地方
Seemed to recall you having been farther north last time.

248
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,680
也许我真去过  霍尔治安官
Perhaps I was, Magistrate Hale.

249
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,930
眼睛是用来洞察
Eyes are for seeing,

250
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,340
而不是被发现的
not for being seen.

251
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,550
这也是你们这种人来找我的原因
That's why your kind come to me.

252
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,400
需要的时候你就会找到我
You find me when you need me.

253
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,480
说吧  这次需要什么
So, what do you need?

254
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,440
昨晚我们在树林里的祭祀圈被破坏了
Someone broke our circle in the woods last night.

255
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,360
我们得知道有谁看见了
We need to know who saw us.

256
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,820
雄鹿满月
Full buck moon?

257
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,380
那晚你在场  是吧  小家伙
You were there that night, weren't you, little friend?

258
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,950
该醒醒了
Time to wake up.

259
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,540
你看见什么了
What did you see?

260
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,510
告诉玛丽·西布里我们会查清
Tell Mary Sibley we will find out

261
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,880
昨晚谁在那片树林里
who was in the woods last night,

262
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,750
但需要时间
but it takes time.

263
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,840
主...
Lord...

264
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,830
我们的祷告有回应了吗
Have our prayers been answered?

265
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,310
这可怜的姑娘好些了吗
Has the poor girl improved?

266
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,220
我们自己能做的事
We should not be praying for God to do

267
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,690
不该恳求上帝完成
what we can accomplish ourselves.

268
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,930
梅西·路易丝所受的折磨并非来自巫师或魔鬼
Mercy Lewis is not suffering the work of witches or demons,

269
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,400
只是自然疾病  或是头脑发烧了
but some natural malady or fever of the mind,

270
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,420
可她却被吊在这里  像牲畜一样
yet she hangs here like an animal.

271
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,880
她在家中三次挣脱绳索
She broke her ropes three times at home,

272
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,800
更不必提她父亲手臂的伤了
not to mention her father's arm.

273
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,240
她咬断自己的手指
She bit off her own finger

274
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,230
撕裂自己的血肉
and tears at her flesh.

275
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,490
必须保护她不能伤害自己和大家
Mercy must be protected from herself and we from her.

276
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,310
没有比上帝之所更适合的地方了
There's no better place to do both than in the house of God.

277
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,280
我认为执行官只是利用她的处境
I think the selectmen are exploiting her condition

278
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,010
在塞勒姆制造恐慌
to create fear in Salem.

279
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,300
这种所谓的"巫师恐慌"
This so-called "witch panic"

280
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,280
只是清教徒试图控制我们的把戏
is yet another attempt by the puritans to control us.

281
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,410
毕谢普小姐  请你...
Miss Bishop, please...

282
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,580
请你注意自己的言辞
Be careful of the words that you speak.

283
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,310
若是让狠心的人听了去
To less sympathetic ears,

284
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,320
会以为这是魔鬼本人在说话呢
they could sound like the words of the devil himself.

285
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,450
很抱歉...我失言了
I'm...sorry if my words were harsh.

286
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,240
我有时候说话不经大脑
Sometimes, my tongue runs ahead of my mind.

287
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,480
可以理解
It's understandable.

288
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,720
这对我们所有人都是种考验
These are trying times for all of us.

289
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,590
小心点  夫人
Careful, mistress.

290
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,060
你的泪水可能会让乳汁酸腐
Your tears may sour the milk.

291
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,450
曾经的我
There was a time

292
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,550
也能哺育其他生命  而不是蟾蜍
that I might have suckled something other than a toad.

293
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,920
现在都无关紧要了
It doesn't matter now.

294
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:36,500
重要的是  下一个目标是谁
What matters is, who will be next?

295
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,260
大祭典已经开始
The grand rite has begun,

296
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,530
土地渴求着纯洁鲜血的滋养
and the earth cries out for innocent blood.

297
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,660
我很清楚自己的职责
I know well my duties.

298
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,700
顾好你自己吧
Attend to your own.

299
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,390
我的职责就是看好你履行职责
Your duties and seeing that you fulfill them

300
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,510
不管你愿不愿意 
is my duty, like it or not.

301
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,120
我已经做出决定了
I've made my choice.

302
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,850
但我们需要的不只是祭品
But we need more than another victim --

303
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,800
还需要一个征兆
We need a sign.

304
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,060
而我正好知道一个人可以同时提供这两者
And I know just the person to deliver us both.

305
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,650
我们的柯顿·麦哲神父对征兆颇为着迷
Our Cotton Mather is quite obsessed with signs --

306
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,300
在他的书里时有提起
wrote chapter and verse on them.

307
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,540
但有一个征兆比其它的都要可怕
But there is one sign they dread more than any other.

308
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,340
那就是畸婴出世
The sign of a monstrous birth.

309
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,900
你做得出这样的事情吗
You would do such a thing?

310
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:18,800
不  根本不需要我
No, I have no need

311
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,180
亲手从生命之树上摘除那片叶子
to pluck a single leaf from the tree of life

312
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,860
因为它在枝头便已然枯萎
when a leaf is already dead on the branch.

313
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,990
镇里有一个女孩
There's a girl out there

314
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,960
她怀了一个死婴
who carries death inside.

315
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,450
我能闻到它的气味
I could smell the baby,

316
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,060
那个死于母亲腹中的畸形婴儿
floating dead and malformed in her mother's womb.

317
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,230
无需为她惋惜
Don't weep for her.

318
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:43,150
至少她永远不会尝到被命运背叛的苦涩
She never tasted a single bitter breath of life's betrayals.

319
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,990
而当我将她作为
Yet her brief flicker of life

320
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,770
厄运即将降临塞勒姆的征兆时
will burn like a comet over earth

321
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,790
她转瞬即逝的人生
when I make of her a sign...

322
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,790
将如流星般耀眼
of the doom that's come upon Salem.

323
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,740
你知道我最享受的是什么吗  乔治
Do you know what I enjoy most, George?

324
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:07,120
让塞勒姆的善良人们如你教导的那般
Turning the good souls of Salem against one another,

325
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,240
像疯狗一样自相残杀
like the rabid dogs you trained them to be.

326
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,150
我活着就是为了有一天
The only thing that keeps me alive

327
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,490
能亲眼见到
is the look on your face

328
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,470
当约翰·奥登发现你真正身份时你脸上的表情
when John Alden finds out what you really are

329
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,000
看着他亲手勒死你
and throttles you with his bare han--

330
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,670
别忘了  乔治
Just think, George.

331
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,730
我只需要在猎月到来之前
I need only kill nine more innocents

332
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,720
再杀死九名无辜者
before full hunter's moon,

333
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,450
我的大祭典就将完成
and my grand rite is complete.

334
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,350
没事的  姬蒂
Shush now, Kitty.

335
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,430
如果那个老胖子弗雷德在床上都没折腾死你
If lying with old fat Fred didn't kill you,

336
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,160
那生他的孩子也一定不会
delivering his child won't, neither.

337
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,450
不  它快将我撕成两半了
No! It feels like it'll tear me in two.

338
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,100
是时候了
It's almost time.

339
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,450
快去叫布里奇特过来
Go fetch Bridget.

340
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,140
布里奇特小姐
Miss Bridget!

341
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,290
我正准备去找你
I was just coming to get you.

342
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,000
我听到她的惨叫了  可怜的姬蒂
I heard poor Kitty's screams.

343
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,330
姬蒂  姬蒂
Kitty, Kitty, Kitty.

344
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,250
这下不用怕了
Nothing to fear now.

345
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,000
布里奇特小姐丰富的接生经验可是无人能比
Miss Bridget's seen more babes through the narrow gate than any.

346
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,840
别害怕孩子  这婴儿只是胎位不正
Don't fret, child. The baby's just the wrong way 'round.

347
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,840
纠正过来很容易的
It is a simple thing to turn it.

348
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:43,940
不
No!

349
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,050
不要  不要
No! No! No! No!

350
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,890
她在伤害我的孩子
She's hurting my baby!

351
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,080
{\an8}巫师与幽灵真实存在之证

352
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,520
你亲眼见证了巫师集会
You witnessed a real witches' sabbat --

353
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,180
这是任何巫师猎手
Something no witch hunter 

354
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,890
至今都没有机会亲眼见证的
has ever seen with his own eyes.

355
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:22,340
所有的图像与描述都源于人们的忏悔
All of our images and accounts come from confessions,

356
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,910
只能说  当中有些并不十分可信
some...rather more believable than others.

357
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:35,860
就是这个
It's this one.

358
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,400
如果这是真的  那情况比我想象的更加严重
If this is true, it's far worse than I thought.

359
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,210
上面说的什么
What's it say?

360
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,560
不认识拉丁文吗  上尉
No Latin, captain?

361
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,760
当然了  你无暇阅读书籍
Oh, of course not. You've no time for books.

362
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,490
"伟大的仪式"
"Ritum Magni."

363
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,160
大祭典
The Grand Rite --

364
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,220
巫师们最大的秘密
The greatest secret of the witches.

365
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,320
目前我们只听说过数次失败尝试的传言
All we have are scraps of rumors of failed attempts.

366
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,180
不幸的是  巫师们从不写书
Unfortunately, there are no books by witches -- 

367
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,660
只有巫师猎手写的
only witch hunters.

368
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,530
所以说  这么多书
So all of these books...

369
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,260
实际上一无所用
tell you exactly nothing.

370
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,310
住手
Stop it.

371
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,450
如果你们互相争斗
You fight each other. 

372
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,870
那谁去对抗他们
Who fights them?

373
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,430
他说得有理
He has a point.

374
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,910
那么  我们从何入手
So, where do we begin?

375
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,370
在那棵树中  我发现了他们汲取能量的来源
Inside the tree, I found what fuels their work...

376
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,680
正如生火需要的薪柴一般
like the wood of a fire.

377
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,630
巫师们的一切巫术都需要两样东西提供能量
See, everything the witch does is powered by two things --

378
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,530
肉欲与死亡
Lust and death.

379
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,990
她们可以靠自身获得肉欲
The lust they provide for themselves,

380
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,550
但必须从别处获得死亡
but they must look elsewhere for the dead parts.

381
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,010
如果塞勒姆的墓地被人破坏的话
The town would be aware if their own Salem burial ground

382
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,450
镇里的人们一定会发现的
was being disturbed by corpse grinding.

383
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,630
那他们要从哪得到它
So where do they get them?

384
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,710
艾萨克  你能好心
Isaac, if you'd be so kind

385
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,880
向上尉解释下你的工作吗
as to explain to the captain your duties.

386
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,720
我有各种工作
I got all kind of duties --

387
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,490
比如说运送包裹
Packages to deliver.

388
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,880
我还负责将被遗弃者运去山壑
I also deliver the unwanteds to the crags.

389
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,650
被遗弃者
The unwanteds?

390
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,940
你知道的  印第安人  奴隶  还有罪犯
You know, Indians, slaves, criminals --

391
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,380
就是那些没有资格葬在塞勒姆墓地的人
pretty much anybody ain't fit to be laid in salem ground.

392
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,520
那就是巫师们收获能量的地方
This is where the witches harvest.

393
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,410
尽管这么说可能会再次挑起你的怒火
And at the risk of another thrashing,

394
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,430
但在那里
it is also your best hope

395
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,810
你才能取回你朋友的尸骨
of reclaiming your friend's remains.

396
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,580
你将他的尸体丢进了山壑
You dumped his body into the crags?!

397
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,540
半个小镇都是吉尔斯·科里一手建起来的
Giles Corey built half this town,

398
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,850
你却把他丢在一条破水沟里吗
And you threw him into a goddamn ditch?!

399
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,280
咱们走
Let's go.

400
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,900
去哪
Where?

401
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,390
去带吉尔斯离开那个鬼地方
To get Giles out of that shithole.

402
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,370
整个塞勒姆都为你的损失感到悲痛
All of salem is diminished by your loss.

403
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,770
我无法想象你有多么痛苦
I can only imagine your suffering.

404
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,180
谢谢您  西布里夫人
Thank you, Mrs. Sibley.

405
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:03,750
他们说你很害怕
The others said that you were frightened...

406
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,760
你以为有人想害你的孩子
You thought that someone was trying to hurt your baby?

407
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,760
跟我说说怎么回事
Tell me what happened.

408
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,670
说吧
Tell me.

409
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,490
我先告诉你一些事
I'm going to tell you something.

410
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,530
我从来没告诉过任何人
I've never told anyone before.

411
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,480
我也失去过一个孩子
I, too, have lost a child.

412
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,250
我了解你那种痛楚
Oh, I know the pain you feel.

413
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,420
时至今日  我仍心如刀绞
I feel it even now.

414
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,170
你一定得告诉我发生了什么
You must tell me what happened

415
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,910
这样你的孩子才不会白白死去
So that your child did not die in vain.

416
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,000
我向你保证
I promise you...

417
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,820
不会有人伤害你的
No harm will come to you.

418
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:55,870
告诉我吧
Tell me.

419
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,160
我感觉到了恶魔的存在
I felt the presence of evil...

420
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,570
并且...
And...

421
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,440
继续说
Go on.

422
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,620
我看到了一个邪恶的女巫
...I saw a foul hag.

423
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,400
她抚摸着我的肚子
And she was touching my belly.

424
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,130
那助产士呢
What of the midwife?

425
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,940
她怎么了
What of her?

426
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,820
她们是同一个人
They were one and the same.

427
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,250
一天来两次  还是晚上
Two times in as many nights?

428
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,360
这鬼地方根本不是人该来的
Two times too many.

429
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,780
带路  你把他的尸体扔哪了
Show me where you dumped his body.

430
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,730
天啊
Jesus Christ.

431
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,560
他在哪
Where is he?

432
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,330
那边
There.

433
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,650
别拿你的脏手碰他
You do not lay a hand on that man.

434
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:36,970
抱歉
Oh, forgive me.

435
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,640
正常情况下应该是乔治来的
Ordinarily, this would be George's domain,

436
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,460
但我丈夫...他的情况...
But my husband... his condition...

437
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,830
这东西我怕他只看一眼都会心脏骤停
I fear that the very sight of this would stop his heart.

438
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,770
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley, please...

439
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,170
请冷静
Calm yourself.

440
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,390
怎么了
What is wrong?

441
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,100
最糟糕的事情发生了
Oh, a most terrible thing...

442
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,470
一个征兆
A sign.

443
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,820
征兆
A sign?

444
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,360
没错  就像你书里描述的一样
Yes, just as you described in one of your books.

445
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,300
畸婴出世
A monstrous birth.

446
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,650
什么
What?

447
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,230
在塞勒姆吗
Here in salem?

448
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,110
由我们的助产士亲手接生
Delivered by our very own midwife...

449
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,890
布里奇特·毕谢普
Bridget Bishop.

450
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,360
这个...
And where is ...

451
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,220
这个怪物现在在哪
What has become of this monster now? 

452
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,480
它在哪
Where is it?

453
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,440
就在这个房间里
In this very room.

454
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,800
兰姆先生把它泡在了一个瓶子里  我...
Mr. Lamb floated it in a bottle. I...

455
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,190
多苦多难的上帝啊
By the wounds of Christ!

456
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,080
这景象  哪怕只是一瞥
The mere sight of this would 

457
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,920
便足以再次狠狠伤害他
pierce our dear lord yet again!

458
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,670
您找我来是对的
You were right to send for me.

459
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:55,410
这真是太恐怖了
This is most terrible.

460
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,230
这预示着什么
But what does it portend?

461
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,760
这是什么征兆
What is this a sign of?

462
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,250
毫无疑问
There can be no doubt.

463
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,370
这一切就是魔鬼本人
'tis nothing less than a declaration of war upon us

464
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,640
在向我们宣战
by the devil himself.

465
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,080
牧师
Reverend...

466
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,480
我们能做什么吗
Is there anything we can do?

467
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,750
我会竭尽所能
I will do whatever is in my power

468
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,230
保护塞勒姆
to protect Salem...

469
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:29,890
和您  夫人
and you, madam.

470
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,820
感谢上帝你在这里  牧师
I thank God you're here, reverend.

471
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,480
若没有你  我们真不知如何是好了
We would be lost without you.

472
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,210
父亲  请等等
Father, please wait.

473
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,250
父亲  您认识布里奇特
Father, you know Bridget.

474
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,560
您怎能认为她犯下了这种罪孽
How could you think her guilty of this?

475
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,510
我怎么认为无关紧要
It isn't a matter of what I think.

476
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,480
父亲
Father.

477
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,370
又一次草率的审判吗  麦哲
Another rush to judgment, Mather?

478
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,090
恐怕正相反
Quite the contrary, I fear.

479
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,330
是上帝的最后审判正在向我们逼近
It is judgment that is rushing towards all of us.

480
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,820
请看证据
Behold the warrant of judgment.

481
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:15,490
无论是个人  还是我们共同的罪恶
For our sins, individual and collective,

482
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,870
他代表着撒旦的印记
he has signed the seal of Satan,

483
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,160
一个来自地狱的讯息
a message straight from hell

484
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,890
宣告着恶魔在塞勒姆的降临
to herald the arrival of the devil in Salem.

485
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,500
那么是谁为他传达的信息呢
And who delivered his message for him?

486
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,030
布里奇特·毕谢普
Bridget Bishop.

487
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,160
你是否
Did you or did you not

488
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,040
从那女孩身体里接生了这个怪物
deliver this monster from that girl?

489
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,630
是的  可是...
Yes, but..

490
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,020
你是否
Did you or did you not

491
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,160
在她带孕期间一直照料着她
minister to this girl while she carried it?

492
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,690
是的先生  可我照顾...
Yes, sir, but I minister...

493
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,720
你是否
Did you or did you not

494
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:49,060
时常喂她服食一些药品和药剂
Frequently dose her with physics and potions

495
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,660
和自制的混合草药汤给她服用
and herbal concoctions of your own devising?

496
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,040
先生  是我做的  但是我没有
Sir, that is what I do, but I did not --

497
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,920
你有没有把你的手放在她的肚子上
And did you or did you not place your hands upon her belly,

498
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,550
如此这般按压
pressing this way and that

499
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,500
就在它出来之前
just before the thing came out?

500
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,170
我在变化胎儿的位...
I was turning the babe so --

501
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:05,170
没错  把胎儿变成了什么
Aye, but turning it into what?

502
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,210
够了
Stop!

503
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,910
不管那个石婴是什么
Whatever that poor stone child may be,

504
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,020
你才是真正的怪物
you are the true monster!

505
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,500
我为小女道歉
I apologize for my daughter.

506
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,770
被告是她的亲密好友
The accused is a dear friend of hers.

507
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,710
不过我和她持有同样的疑惑
But I share her concern.

508
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,840
你指控的是一个
You would accuse a woman --

509
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,980
我们都熟悉并信赖
a woman whom we all know and trust,

510
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,370
一心帮助其他妇女
who never did anything but help other women

511
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,220
为她们接生
to deliver their babies 

512
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,020
照料弃婴的女人
and care for those who no one wanted?

513
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,970
现在突然要我们相信她是个女巫吗
And now, suddenly, we're to believe she's a witch?

514
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,790
恶魔很耐心
The devil is patient.

515
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,420
它的仆人也是如此
And so are his servants --

516
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,790
可能是我们的朋友  可能是邻居
our friends, our neighbors --

517
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,400
直到恶魔召唤他们来服侍
Till, finally, they are called to serve him.

518
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:52,960
布里奇特·毕谢普
Bridget Bishop,

519
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,190
你助畸婴出世
You have delivered a monster into the world.

520
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,840
被受害者看穿了你的真正面目
You were seen in your true guise,

521
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,010
一个邪恶的老巫婆
the night hag, by your victim.

522
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:02,230
就算是那些曾经被你无辜形象蒙骗的人们
And even those who were duped by your innocent image

523
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:06,020
仍然能感受到明显的恶魔阴影围绕着他们
could still sense the palpable stench of evil around them,

524
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,960
因为你毁灭了
as you destroyed 

525
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,860
一个未出生的婴儿
a babe in the cradle of life --

526
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:16,770
这是你的主人向我们宣战的征兆
a sign of your master's declaration of war upon us.

527
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,250
你认罪吗
How do you plead?

528
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,770
我没做过这样的事
I did no such thing.

529
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,980
我是无辜的
I'm innocent!

530
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,700
您得相信我  我
Oh, you must belive me -- I am --

531
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,650
我有点困惑  麦哲
I'm a little confused, Mather.

532
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,430
是布里奇特制造了那个征兆
Did Bridget make that sign...

533
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,850
还是上帝
or did God?

534
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,800
不对  等等  我记起来了
No. No, no, no. Wait. I remember.

535
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,570
上帝告知恶魔  恶魔迫使她这么做
God told the devil, and the devil made her do it --

536
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,840
我说的对不对
have I got this right?

537
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:47,910
不对吗  可能是我没有你那么聪明
No? Maybe I'm just not as smart as you.

538
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,930
我虽不像你读过那么多书
I haven't read all those books,

539
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:53,660
但我也算见识了不少市面
but I have seen a few things in the world.

540
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,740
在这个世界上  坏事时有发生
And in this world, bad things happen,

541
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,870
如同掷骰子一般  并说明不了什么
generally with no more meaning than the roll of a dice.

542
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,520
这个怪物
This monstrosity --

543
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,580
只是上帝掷的一次不幸的骰子吗
it's just an unlucky roll of god's dice?

544
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,080
可能是我见过最不幸的一次
Probably the unluckiest I've seen.

545
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,310
那我们的想法真是非常不同
Well, then, we have a most profound difference of opinion.

546
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,330
确实
We do.

547
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,630
但是你只根据你的想法就要绞死一个女人
But you would hang a woman on your opinion.

548
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,590
那根据你的想法  就任由恶魔的使徒
And on yours, you would let an agent of the devil himself

549
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:23,070
横行并犯下更多罪过吗
walk free to do more malice.

550
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,510
那你也得审问她
Then put her on trial, too.

551
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,450
不能只审一人就完事
Don't just stop there.

552
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,400
她们当时都在场
There were others with her.

553
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,140
可能她们都有责任
Or maybe they're all responsible.

554
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,120
不行  你不能这样  不是我的错
No, you can't! It's not my fault!

555
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,310
不是你的错吗
It's not your fault?

556
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,870
不  我想你可能说得对
No, I think that you're probably right.

557
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,820
我知道对你来说难以置信  麦哲
I think -- and I know this is unthinkable to you, Mather --

558
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:45,280
但是可能  这不是任何人的错
But maybe, just maybe, it's no one's fault.

559
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,120
而我们都知道  杀人不同
We all know that killing is different.

560
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,160
杀人一定有肇事者
Killing is always someone's fault.

561
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,840
吉尔斯·科里尸骨未寒
The stones aren't dry from the blood of Giles Corey,

562
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,280
现在你又要绞死一个女人
And now you are willing to hang a woman --

563
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,600
这个女人  布里奇特·毕谢普
This woman, bridget bishop --

564
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,820
或许再加上几个妓女
and, hell, throw in a few whores for good measure --

565
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,350
这都为了什么
and for what?

566
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,270
或许我们该听听梅西怎么说
Perhaps it's time we heard from Mercy.

567
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,030
不对吗  麦哲牧师
Isn't that right, reverend Mather?

568
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,350
她不是一定会
Isn't she bound to react

569
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:27,370
在有罪的巫师面前有所反应的吗
in front of the guilty witch or witches?

570
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,310
我父亲和所有专家同意
My father and all the experts agree --

571
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,840
那就将她们带到她面前
Then take them to her.

572
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:34,850
她们
Them?

573
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:37,360
奥登上尉说得很对
Captain Alden is quite right.

574
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,750
所有人都可能有罪
All may be guilty.

575
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,230
把助产士和三个妓女带到她面前
Take the midwife and the three whores, too.

576
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,750
可以投票了吗
Shall we vote?

577
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,050
主啊
Lord...

578
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,570
您知晓我们不为人知的内心
You who sees and knows our secret hearts

579
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:52,710
您一定知道我是无辜的
must know that I am innocent.

580
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:57,270
拜托  拜托  拜托  请给他们
Please, please, please give them

581
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:01,100
一些启示  揭露这个简单的真相
some visible sign of this simple truth.

582
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,420
求求您
Please.

583
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:43,690
干得好
Well done.

584
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,910
你又杀了一个无辜的人
Another innocent killed.

585
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,430
我不这么认为
I do not think so.

586
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,160
即便我真的滥杀了无辜
But even if I did...

587
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:53,720
就让主把这个
let the lord add it 

588
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,470
也加入我那已经长长的罪恶清单上去吧
to my already lengthy list of mortal sins.

589
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,880
我必须不惜一切代价
I must pay any price,

590
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:03,620
撒上我自己或他人的血都要阻止那些巫师
spill my own or any other's blood to stop the witches.

591
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,580
我还从来没见过这样一位
I don't think I've ever seen such a mixture

592
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,980
集理智与狗屎于一身的人
of reason and bullshit in a man.

593
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,920
如果你能知我所知
If you only knew what I know...

594
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:12,930
怎样
What?

595
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,590
我就会压死一个男人  吊死个女人
I'd crush a man or hang a woman,

596
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,690
喝个酩酊大醉
then drink myself blind

597
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:20,270
然后跟妓女翻云覆雨  誓死方休吗
and bury myself into a whore like there's no tomorrow?

598
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,050
如果我们不阻止这些邪恶的女巫
If we do not stop these foul hags,

599
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,710
那我们就不会有明...
there will be no tomorr--

600
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,520
你个禽兽
You monster!

601
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:27,960
住手
Stop!

602
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,770
看你把事情搞得多乱
What a mess you've made of things.

603
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,560
就因为你放不下那个男人
We were nearly ruined by a single sound argument

604
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,730
我们差点被他那通反驳坏了大事
from a man you can't seem to let alone.

605
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,540
我开始质疑为何让你这么做
I question now why we let you begin this.

606
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,560
为什么
Why?

607
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,880
因为这是我们所有人的梦想
Because this is the fulfillment of all our dreams --

608
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,620
报复几个世纪以来的镇压
vengeance for centuries of oppression.

609
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:47,440
现在动摇太晚了  霍尔
Too late for doubts now, Hale.

610
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,880
咱们已经是一股绳子上的了
We are all in this together.

611
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,300
是啊  这样下去咱们定会一起被烧死
Yes, and we shall all burn together at this rate.

612
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,950
你太年轻了  不理解你所经受的风险
You're too young to understand the risk you're taking.

613
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:59,080
我看着我全家人烧死在柱子上
I saw my entire family burned at the stake.

614
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,320
我亲口尝到了他们骨灰的味道
I tasted their ashes in my mouth.

615
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,430
我没有兴趣去品尝我自己的
I have no desire to taste my own...

616
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,910
亦或是我女儿的
or my daughter's.

617
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
也许你们这些旧世界巫师
Well, perhaps you old-world witches

618
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,320
只是过于胆怯
are simply too scared

619
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:14,450
没有魄力去统治这个新世界
or too scarred to claim this new world.

620
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,130
但我不会
Not me.

621
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,460
我不是一个人
I'm not alone.

622
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,560
元老们也心有动摇
The elders have their doubts, too.

623
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,810
你的恐惧完全没有必要
All your fears are unnecessary.

624
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,010
无辜之血将继续流淌
Innocent blood flows and will continue to flow.

625
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:30,540
结果  霍尔先生  那才是最重要的
Results, Mr. Hale, are all that matter.

626
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,040
而说到结果
And speaking of results,

627
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,090
你该做的事进行得如何了
What of your errand?

628
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,880
彼得鲁斯说很快就会找出目击者
Petrus assures us we'll soon know who saw us.

629
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,750
抱歉  霍尔小姐
Oh, um...sorry, Miss Hale,

630
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,110
但是  你知道规矩的
But, uh, you know the rules.

631
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,260
这个
There's, uh, 

632
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,980
女人天黑后禁止入内
no women allowed after dark.

633
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,710
没事的  兰博
It's all right, Lamb.

634
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:39,900
据麦哲说  终结即将来临
According to Mather, these are the end times.

635
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,990
我想今晚可以开个特例
I think we can make an exception for tonight.

636
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,210
你在看什么
What are you looking at?

637
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,450
你和他们一样
You're just like them --

638
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,650
喜欢高谈阔论  唇枪舌剑
happy to discuss and debate,

639
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,260
却从不敢真正行动起来
but too afraid to take any real action.

640
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,120
你还在塞勒姆干什么
Why are you even in Salem?

641
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,730
他们杀死你朋友那晚
Where's that fire I saw in your eyes

642
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,940
我在你眼中看到的怒火去哪了
the night they killed your friend?

643
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,410
你想让我干什么  霍尔小姐
What do you want from me, Miss Hale?

644
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,750
正义
Justice --

645
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,140
为吉尔斯·科里  为布里奇特·毕谢普
for Giles Corey, for Bridget Bishop,

646
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,980
还为了这场即将到来的混乱中
and for all the other innocent victims

647
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:28,110
更多的无辜受害者们
soon to come from this madness.

648
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,320
必须有人来做些什么
Someone must do something!

649
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,790
怎么了
What?

650
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,820
你让我想起了曾经认识的一个人
You just remind me of someone I once knew.

651
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:47,880
他们怎么了
What happened to them?

652
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,860
真希望我能知道
I wish I knew.

653
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,620
不请自来
Here uninvited --

654
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,430
你一定是和印第安人呆太久了
You must have stayed too long with the indians.

655
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,210
让你变得更像...
It's made you more...

656
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,980
野蛮人了
savage.

657
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:14,490
不  只是更没有耐心而已
No. Less patient.

658
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,660
有些事我认为你需要知道
There's something I think you should know.

659
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,970
你要离开塞勒姆
You're leaving Salem?

660
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,110
正相反
To the contrary.

661
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:22,870
安·霍尔提醒了我塞勒姆不应如此
Anne Hale reminded me Salem deserves better.

662
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:24,660
该做出些改变了
It always did.

663
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,650
真的
Really?

664
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,230
我还以为你厌恶这地方
I thought you hated this place.

665
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,740
我本也这么想
I thought so, too.

666
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,280
但结果发现我恨的不是塞勒姆
But it turns out it wasn't Salem that I hated --

667
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,830
而是控制他的那些人
Rather, the people who run it.

668
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,640
今天有人和我说了一些事情
Fella told me something today -- 

669
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,780
他说这种景象
he said it was a damn sight easier

670
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,900
破坏比修复要简单得多
to break things than to fix them.

671
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:46,750
而你想要来进行修复
And you intend to fix things.

672
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:47,590
也许吧
Maybe.

673
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:49,630
你准备怎么做
How do you plan on doing that?

674
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:54,480
行政委员的位子还空着一个
There's an extra seat on the board of selectmen --

675
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:58,910
一个属于奥登家族的位子
a seat with the Alden name.

676
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,400
也许是时候我来接手了
Reckoned maybe it was time I claimed it.

677
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,500
一个人的声音尽管微弱
Might just be one voice,

678
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:08,620
但这是个开始
but it is a start.

679
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,910
我们还会再见的
I'll be seeing you.

680
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,980
走开  猫咪
Go away, cat.

681
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:20,840
你会弄坏我作品的
You'll ruin my work.

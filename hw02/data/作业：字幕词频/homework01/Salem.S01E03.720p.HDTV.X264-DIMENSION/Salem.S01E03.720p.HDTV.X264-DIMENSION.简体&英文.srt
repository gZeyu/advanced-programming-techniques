第一季  第三集

14
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,950
《塞勒姆》前情提要
Previously on "Salem"

15
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,890
艾萨克
Isaac?

16
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,360
私通者艾萨克
Isaac the fornicator.

17
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,660
别以为回到塞勒姆就能远离战争
Coming home to Salem to get out of the war

18
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,060
这就像为了躲雨而一头跳进大海
is like jumping in the ocean to get out of the rain.

19
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,700
你现在不能离开塞勒姆
You can't leave Salem just yet.

20
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,930
有些东西你得看看
Something you've got to see.

21
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,180
有人破坏了我们的祭祀圈
Someone broke our circle.

22
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,610
谁看见了我们
Who saw us?

23
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,980
我不知道
I do not know.

24
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,260
我一直在等着你
I waited for you.

25
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,730
年复一年
Years and years.

26
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:23,800
跟我走吧
Come with me.

27
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,290
我不能  不可能了
I can't. It's impossible.

28
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,290
大祭典已经开始
The grand rite has begun,

29
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,550
土地渴求着纯洁鲜血的滋养
and the earth cries out for innocent blood.

30
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,770
我很清楚自己的职责
I know well my duties.

31
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,180
我活着就是为了有一天
The only thing that keeps me alive

32
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,440
能亲眼见到
is the look on your face

33
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,280
约翰·奥登发现你真正身份时你脸上的表情
when John Alden finds out what you really are.

34
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,550
父亲  您认识布里奇特
Father, you know Bridget.

35
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,570
您怎能认为她犯下了这种罪孽
How could you think her guilty of this?

36
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,260
我怎么认为无关紧要
It isn't a matter of what I think.

37
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,740
看你干的好事
What a mess you've made of things.

38
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,620
我不想在这里看到你
I don't want you here.

39
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,790
我差点就相信你了
I almost believe you.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,500
你真美
You're so beautiful.

41
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,580
人类的战争不足为惧
"Fear no man's war,

42
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,180
只有来自地狱的战火能摧毁塞勒姆
for only a war from hell could destroy Salem."

43
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,260
魔鬼绝不会轻易让我们
The devil was never going to 

44
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,030
在这建立应许之地  它必将掀起一场战争
let a promised land be built here without a battle.

45
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,860
你知道埋在这的女人几乎都死于什么吗
Do you know what killed nearly every woman buried here?

46
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,140
爱情
Love.

47
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,090
拥有致命恶意的巫师...
And witches armed with deadly malice...

48
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,960
大多数都死于分娩  所以说爱情之于女人
Most died in childbirth. So love is to a woman...

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,720
便是这场战役中最为狠毒阴险的武器
...are the most malignant and insidious weapons in that battle...

50
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,250
就好比战争之于男人
...what war is to a man.

51
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,630
-这场战争中  -是他们能做的最致命的事
- ...that war  - The most deadly thing, they'll do.

52
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,820
为了一个民族的身体与灵魂
for the body and the soul of a nation.

53
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,560
只有傻子才会迫不及待的奔向战争...
Only a fool runs quickly to war...

54
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,190
设想这些在暗处的敌人...
Imagine a foe you can't see...

55
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,510
-或者爱情  -拥有未知的武器...
- or love. - armed with weapons unknown...

56
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,290
我可以教给你...
I can teach you...

57
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,910
看上去却和常人别无二致
...and the ability to appear as anyone.

58
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,030
关于生命和死亡还有许多介于二者之间的东西
...about life and death and many things in between.

59
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,970
住手  快住手  住手
Stop it! Just stop it! Stop.

60
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,940
勿轻言  否则汝必招致审判
Judge not, lest ye be judged.

61
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,590
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

62
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,560
*鼓鸣震天*
*Witch drums*

63
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,140
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

64
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,330
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

65
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,550
*鼓鸣震天*
*The witch drums*

66
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,150
*宁入地狱*
*Better pray for hell*

67
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,080
*不留人间*
*Not hallelujah*

68
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,190
烧死在地狱里
Burn in hell!

69
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,720
罪恶
Sin!

70
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,240
放心  布里奇特小姐
Be assured, Mrs. Bridget --

71
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,220
为你哭泣之人
ones that are weepin'

72
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,080
远比唾弃诅咒之人多
far outnumber the ones that might spit or curse.

73
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,210
烧死在地狱里  烧吧
Burn in hell! Burn!

74
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,850
多给那人点钱让他把尸体
You would do well to pay that boy extra

75
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,320
送去更远的地方就更好了
to take them bodies a more circuitous route.

76
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,920
人们的围观是我们烈火的燃料
Spectacle is fuel for our fire.

77
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,210
质疑可是富人和受宠者的特权
And doubt is indulged by the rich and spoiled only.

78
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,540
记住  你以前可既不富有  也没人宠溺
Mind that you was born neither.

79
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,680
让我与你一同死去吧  而后我将重生
"Give me to die with thee that I may rise to a new life,

80
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,890
我希望自己的罪恶和自私  都被
"for I wish to be as dead and buried to sin,

81
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,130
长埋地下...
to selfishness..."

82
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,770
辛苦了  牧师
By all means, Reverend...

83
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,440
千万别说任何祈祷安慰或者鼓励的话
Do not offer prayer or comfort or words of encouragement.

84
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,340
对  就这样如一座不知所措的雕像般
No, stand as a bewildered statue

85
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,710
站在塞勒姆的人民中间
amongst the people of Salem

86
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,320
什么都不说  什么都不做
and offer them absolutely nothing.

87
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,890
那您想让我怎么做
What would you have me do?

88
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,660
我让你来是干什么的
What I brought you here to do.

89
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,380
在我们需要指引时帮助我们啊
Guide and support us in our great hour of need.

90
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,740
用你充满智慧的言辞温暖我们的心灵
Warm our hearts with your words of wisdom.

91
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,960
让大家知道除掉恶魔是上帝的旨意
Assure us it is God's will we do in ferreting out the devil.

92
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,920
或者至少...
Or at the very, very least...

93
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,210
祈祷吧
Pray.

94
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,480
悲惨的一天啊
Tragic day.

95
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,670
虽然悲惨  但有必要
Tragic but necessary.

96
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,680
很遗憾这是必要的
Tragically necessary.

97
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,880
众人的哀悼可以让你暂时歇口气了吧
Surely, the grieving of the masses gives you pause.

98
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,150
大多数人唾弃诅咒她
Most spit and curse

99
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,510
同时还召唤地狱之火的焚烧
while summoning the burning flames of hell.

100
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,210
也有人
There are also 

101
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,740
为她哭泣  觉得绞死她毫无根据
those who weep for her and find her hanging unfounded.

102
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,070
区区几个人  不足为意
Not enough to divert our intentions.

103
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,010
要让众人的恐慌不断加剧才算成功
A panic's success relies on its escalation.

104
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,410
大祭典已经开始
The grand rite has begun.

105
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,420
我们需要寻找下一个受害者
We look to our next victim.

106
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,110
我的一切反对
And that I disagree,

107
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,680
如此强烈表示出我的不赞同
that I strenuously and most vehemently oppose

108
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,000
对你毫无意义可言吗
means nothing to you?

109
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,160
我们祭祀时被人看见了
We were seen at our sabbat.

110
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,570
你竟然还这么公然行事
And you throw caution to the wind.

111
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,050
那你查出看见我们的人了吗
And have you identified who saw us?

112
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,380
如果你能完成这点简单的任务
Perhaps your disagreements and vehement opposition

113
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,490
或许你的不同意见和强烈反对
might hold more weight if you could be relied on

114
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,520
能多一些分量
to complete a simple task.

115
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,090
祝你今天愉快  霍尔
Good day, Hale.

116
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,200
我要怎么做才能得到救赎
What must I do to be saved?

117
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,820
没有比这更重要的问题了
It is impossible to ask a more weighty question.

118
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,600
恐怕我们都将永恒逝去
Lest we perish eternally.

119
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,690
感觉如何
How's it feel?

120
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,710
什么感觉如何
How does what feel?

121
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,120
两天之内杀死两个无辜之人
Killing two innocents in as many days.

122
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,850
-证据指向毕谢普小姐  -孤儿院出事了
- The evidence against Miss Bishop. - The orphanage! 

123
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,630
来人啊  他们在洗劫孤儿院
Help! They're looting the orphanage!

124
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,550
出去
Get out!

125
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,000
这不是你的
It's not yours!

126
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,770
滚...
Get...

127
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,520
下一枪就是你的脑袋了
Next one's to your head.

128
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,140
你还好吗
Are you okay?

129
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,850
太可怕了  太可怕了
It's awful. It's too awful.

130
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,120
出什么事了
W-what's happened?

131
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,880
盗贼们来抢劫孤儿院
Thieves have come to ransack the orphanage

132
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,590
把这儿的守护者绞死  如今大家尝到滋味了吧
now that the town sees fit to hang its guardian.

133
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,550
冷静点  孩子
Easy, son.

134
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,680
这都是巫师恐慌造成的
This is what comes of your witch panic.

135
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,470
你还好吗
Are you all right?

136
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,960
这都是你的错  还有他
This is your fault! And his.

137
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,720
原谅她  她受惊了
Forgive her. She's distraught.

138
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,790
我没说错
I'm right!

139
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,230
送我回家
See me home.

140
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,960
上尉  如果你不介意
Captain, if you wouldn't mind, hmm?

141
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,700
当然可以
Yes. Of course.

142
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,970
他们把她带去哪里了
Where have they taken her?

143
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,350
埋葬被遗弃者的污秽之所
Foul spot where they rest the unwanted.

144
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,470
很糟糕吗
Is it very terrible?

145
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,120
是的
Yes.

146
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,530
谢谢你
Thank you...

147
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,730
感谢你的勇敢与坦诚
for your heroism and your candor.

148
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,180
欢迎  欢迎  欢迎
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

149
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,730
来杯茶吗
A cup of tea?

150
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,080
-来口波特酒  -没空
-A touch of port? -No time.

151
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,110
在树林看见我们的是谁
Who saw us in the woods?

152
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,140
是拥有烙印之人
It was...he who is marked.

153
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,690
他的眉上烙着"F"
He of the "F" that furrows his brow.

154
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,870
-艾萨克  -私通者
-Issac? -The fornicator.

155
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,180
那个蠢货
The idiot.

156
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,400
还有一件事
One more thing.

157
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,080
艾萨克并非独自一人
Isaac was not alone.

158
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,640
还有谁跟他一起
Who else was with him?

159
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,650
我不知道
I don't know.

160
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,100
我看不清那张脸
I could not make out the face.

161
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,530
你不知道
You don't know.

162
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,580
你有何用
What good are you?

163
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,300
看不见的鬼眼
A seer who can't see.

164
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,870
我的法术并不精确
It's not an exact art.

165
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,310
看出来了
Evidently not.

166
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,730
有人吗
Hello?

167
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,870
有人吗
Hello?

168
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,640
那是什么鬼地方
What the hell was that place?

169
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,560
彼得鲁斯的窝棚
The shack belongs to Petrus,

170
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,120
他是野生及驯养动物的专家
an expert on creatures both feral and otherwise.

171
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,070
它们看起来是死的  但却不是
Yeah, well, they looked dead...until they didn't.

172
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,820
死去的动物
No, dead animal

173
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,620
可伤不到像你这样的老兵  上尉
could threaten a storied soldier such as yourself, captain.

174
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,550
要是被施了什么未知的法术  就有可能了
It could, if powered by forces we don't understand.

175
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,320
-比如  -巫术
-Such as? -Witchcraft.

176
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,190
-胡说  -是吗
-Nonsense. -Is it?

177
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,710
你很了解他吗  这个彼得鲁斯
You know him well, this Petrus?

178
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,740
没有比彼得鲁斯更普通的人了
You'll find no man more ordinary than Petrus.

179
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,880
说他平凡都高估他的激情了
To say that he's mundane is to overstate his passion.

180
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,170
那是什么普通的任务让你来到森林深处
And what ordinary task brought you deep into the forest

181
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,810
寻求他平凡的建议
to seek his mundane counsel?

182
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,070
别激动  孩子
Easy, son...

183
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,650
不然我可能都要怀疑
Or I might suspect your presence here

184
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,390
你的出现也并非偶然了
as more than a coincidence,

185
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,110
也许你有你的理由
That, perhaps, for reasons of your own

186
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,160
我相信你不希望我问起
about which I'm sure you'd rather I not inquire,

187
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,280
你怕是跟踪我来此的吧
you might have followed me here.

188
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,660
你对小女这般仁慈
And what a shame...

189
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,150
我却让怀疑之心遮蔽了感激之意
to have suspicion overtake the grace I owe

190
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,080
真是令人遗憾
for the kindness you showed my daughter.

191
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,550
就算是扯平了吧
Consider it repaid.

192
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,090
也好
Right.

193
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,770
乔治  不是吧
George, really.

194
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,660
你连个孩子都不如
You are worse than a child.

195
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,130
它听从我的吩咐  不听你的
He serves at my behest, not yours.

196
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,760
你是没法让它出来的
He won't come out for you.

197
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,850
安静点  小家伙
There, there, little man.

198
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,470
不用理会这个老怪物
Oh, pay the beast no mind.

199
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,770
先歇息  稍后我再来喂你
Rest now, and I'll see to your feeding later.

200
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,070
艾萨克把先生的药剂拿来了
Isaac's brung the master's potions.

201
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,050
让他等等
Tell him to wait.

202
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,830
乔治
Ohh, George.

203
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,640
你的睡衣都被呕吐物彻底弄脏了
Your nightdress thoroughly drenched in sick.

204
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,470
今天就穿着它吧  亲爱的
Stew in that for the day, my sweet.

205
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,520
给西布里先生的
For Mr. Sibley.

206
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,430
你要是早点来就好了
Oh, and not a moment too soon.

207
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,210
他现在状态不太好
Just now, he suffered a fit of sorts.

208
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,650
如果您不介意的话  夫人
If you don't mind me saying so, ma'am,

209
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,200
我想说这真是您一直承受着的重担
It's a burden you've took on...

210
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,190
一份不能言说  只能独自承受的重荷
A burden and load, carried out without cry or complaint.

211
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,000
我的担子跟塞勒姆的没法比
My burdens can't compare to that of salem itself.

212
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,720
广场上的气氛如今怎么样了
How do you find the spirits on the square?

213
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,620
消沉  夫人  非常消沉
Low, ma'am. Awful low.

214
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,070
或许这么想能聊以慰藉
Perhaps there is solace to be found

215
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,270
毕竟我们都曾承受过更糟的状况
in remembrance of times when we've both shouldered worse.

216
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,820
谁能想到仅仅一晚
Who could have imagined that a single night

217
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,700
影响会如此之大呢
could have consequence for so many?

218
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,390
不是所有的伤疤都能被看到
Not all scars can be seen.

219
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,380
但它们却切实存在着
But they exist nonetheless.

220
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,150
第二天一早  她走了
Next morning, she was gone.

221
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,180
逃离了这里  就这么消失了
Run away and disappeared.

222
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,710
你心爱的艾比
Oh, your sweet abby.

223
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,170
我得承认  有时候会想
I'll admit to wondering on occasion

224
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,750
如果有天能再见到她会是什么样
What it might be like to one day see her again

225
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,500
会想  如果听说了她的境况
Or know of her or hear her fate.

226
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,740
会是好事还是更糟呢
Would it be better or so much worse?

227
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,140
我向你保证  艾萨克
I can assure you, Isaac...

228
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,570
如果你还能再见到她
If you were to see her again,

229
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,070
你会发现那些感觉被埋葬得太深
you would find those feelings buried too deeply

230
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,400
已然无法复燃了
for hope of resurrection.

231
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,160
再见  艾萨克
Good afternoon, Isaac.

232
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,400
告辞  夫人
G'day, ma'am.

233
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,110
那是什么
What is that?

234
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,700
那是什么  你要干什么
What is that? What are you... what are you doing?

235
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,070
别  求你
Please. Please.

236
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,810
你在树林里看到了什么
What did you see in the woods?

237
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,220
我们知道你不是只身一人
We knew you weren't alone.

238
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,590
我们知道
We know!

239
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,240
我们知道  我们知道
We know! We know!

240
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,970
还有谁在  还有谁在
Who was there?! Who was there?!

241
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,610
只有我一个人
I was alone!

242
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,200
只有我一个人
I was alone!

243
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,240
弄干净了
Get it all.

244
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,260
千万别留下线索
Want no trace of our efforts.

245
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,990
要查也只能查到他一个人
The fault must lie with him alone.

246
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,690
把这些放进他口袋
And put these in his pockets.

247
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,800
如果要指证他是巫师
If he's to be found a witch,

248
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,100
那牧师一定会需要证据
The good reverend will require proof...

249
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,070
决定他命运的证据  懂吗
...evidence to seal his fate, hmm?

250
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,270
怎么了
What is it?

251
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,290
我看到的是同情吗
Is this sympathy that I'm sensing?

252
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,170
一个流浪汉对另一个流浪汉的同情
One outcast to the other?

253
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,130
你是这么想的吗  老怪物
Is that what you feel, you decrepit deformity?

254
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,530
玛丽
Mary!

255
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,650
现在连你都敢质疑我了
So now even you would question me?

256
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,590
照我说的做
Do as you're told!

257
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,320
你伟大的玛丽知道眼看着女巫们被烧死是什么感觉吗
Does your great Mary know what it is to watch witches burn?

258
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,820
她对传统一屑不顾
Nothing of the old ways

259
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,750
只顾着鞭策我们向新的方向前进
while she's whipping us toward the new.

260
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,060
给他下个疯狂咒
A spell of vitae cupido,

261
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,920
然后将他送去镇上
And then we send him to the one place in town

262
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,490
他绝对不允许进入的地方
That will certainly deny him entrance.

263
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,460
应该会引起他们的注意
That should get their attention.

264
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,740
你哭了
You're crying.

265
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,740
没有
I'm not.

266
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,690
你就是在哭
You are.

267
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,190
怎么了
What's wrong?

268
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,550
他们连毕谢普小姐那样的人都要绞死
If they can hang a woman like miss Bishop,

269
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,770
那我这样的人怎么办
What does that mean for someone like me?

270
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,800
你不会有事的
Nothing is going to happen to you.

271
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,270
你怎么知道
How can you be so sure?

272
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,160
昨天他们还把我推到那个路易斯面前呢
Just yesterday, it was me that they put before the Lewis girl.

273
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,510
如果我被指控  你会站出来吗
Would you have come forward had I been accused?

274
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,270
我做的一切都严守程序
I follow every protocol.

275
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,830
我遵从父亲教给我的每一个字
I adhere to every letter of what my father taught me.

276
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,080
没有人会被定罪  除非有无可争议的证据
No one is convicted without incontrovertible evidence.

277
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,410
所以你确信毕谢普小姐是个女巫
So you're certain miss Bishop was a witch?

278
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,660
我确信..
I am certain...

279
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,390
那些证据
of the evidence.

280
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,450
你为什么那么做
Why do you do it?

281
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,770
为什么
Why?

282
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,340
你相信你是在做好事吗
Is it that you believe that you're doing good?

283
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,890
还是你只想取悦你的父亲
Or is it that you wish to please your father?

284
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,190
是艾萨克  他疯了
It's Isaac! He's mad!

285
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,510
不能让人看见我在这儿
I can't be seen here.

286
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,780
来让我摸摸
Let me touch you!

287
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,630
起来
Get up!

288
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,000
艾萨克  不要
Isaac, no!

289
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,750
艾萨克  你在干什么
Isaac, what are you doing?

290
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,000
你看到了什么
What do you see?!

291
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,140
艾萨克
Isaac!

292
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,120
你终于来了
Oh there you are! 

293
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,590
私通者艾萨克  私通者艾萨克
Isaac the fornicator! Isaac the fornicator!

294
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,020
藏好你们的老婆  藏好你们的羊
Hide your wives! Hide all your sheep!

295
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,260
私通者艾萨克会在他们睡觉时发动袭击
Isaac the fornicator will get them when they sleep!

296
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,210
私通者艾萨克
Isaac the fornicator!

297
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,360
藏好你们的老婆  藏好你们的老婆
Hide your wives! Hide your wives!

298
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,710
藏好你们的羊
Hide all your sheep!

299
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,250
私通者艾萨克  藏好你们的老婆
Isaac the fornicator! Hide your wives!

300
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,810
-艾萨克  -藏好你们的羊  私通者艾萨克
- Isaac!  - Hide your sheep. Isaac the fornicator.

301
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,110
停下  艾萨克
Stop! Isaac!

302
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,920
约翰森  大事不妙  大事不妙
Jonathan, it's no good. It's no good!

303
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,600
什么不妙
What is no good?

304
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,970
他们看到我们了  他们看到我们了
They saw us. They saw us.

305
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,690
他们看到我们在树林里
They saw us in the woods.

306
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,490
他们看到我们了
They saw us.

307
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,780
他们看到我们在树林里  他们看到我们了
They saw us in the woods. They saw us.

308
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,540
闭嘴
Shut up.

309
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,490
把他送进监狱
Take him to the jail.

310
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,100
他们看到我们在树林里
They saw us in the woods.

311
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,310
他们看到我们了
They saw us.

312
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:37,890
治安官
Magistrate.

313
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,440
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley.

314
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,130
你都干了什么
What have you done?

315
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,280
那个白痴看到了我们在树林里
The idiot saw us in the woods.

316
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,510
艾萨克
Isaac.

317
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,920
所以你未经我允许就动手了
So, you did this without consent?

318
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,750
他不是一个人
He wasn't alone.

319
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,970
我们会找出和他一起的人  他会被烧死
We'll find out who was with him, and he will burn.

320
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,730
不  你什么都别想做
No, you will do nothing further.

321
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,740
-但是  -别想了
- But... - Nothing!

322
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,810
回家去  治安官
Go home, magistrate.

323
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,320
你身上有股森林的臭气
You reek of the woods.

324
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,990
把萝丝找来
Find me Rose.

325
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,780
醉鬼撒酒疯  仅此而已
A drunken romp, that's all --

326
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,150
年轻人的特权
A young man's prerogative.

327
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,190
但他身上根本没有酒味
And yet no smell of spirits on him.

328
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,640
那就烧了他  还等什么
Oh, well, burn him, then. Why wait?

329
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,140
如果他被下咒了就不该为自己的行为受罚
If he was spelled, he's blameless in his actions.

330
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,490
那你为什么还关着他
Yet you still hold him. Why?

331
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,380
在他身上找到的
Found on his person.

332
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,100
很可能是偷来对物品的主人下咒的
Likely stolen to cast a spell on its owner.

333
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,130
前一分钟他是下咒者
One minute, he's speller.

334
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,120
下一分钟就成了受害者
The next, he's bewitched.

335
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,030
拿个主意吧  牧师
Make up your mind, reverend.

336
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,210
他究竟是巫师还是巫术的受害者
Is he a witch or a victim of the craft?

337
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,770
巫师炼药的主要成分
Chief ingredient of a witch's brew.

338
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,690
艾萨克带我进入那片树林
Isaac took me into those woods.

339
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,190
他冒着生命危险带我去看那些巫师
He risked his life to show me the witches.

340
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,270
如果他是其中一员为什么要这么做
Why, if he was one?

341
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,960
我给他灌了点
I've, uh, administrated a tonic

342
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,530
能让他安静下来  不再发狂的药剂
that'll settle him down and, uh, end the fits.

343
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,900
以你作为医师的判断  你怎么看
What is your surgeon's opinion of the boy's condition?

344
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,610
我不能确定病因
I can't say for sure as to cause or source,

345
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,670
但从他胡言乱语的状况看
but going by his babble, 

346
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,710
那个孩子估计是精神失常了
that boy is good and touched.

347
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,370
我们要尽可能相信他
Every benefit of the doubt,

348
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,190
找出所有可能的原因
every avenue explored.

349
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,400
那个孩子是我们中的一员
The boy is one of our own.

350
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,130
尽管他不被人们接受  遭受唾弃
Outcast and shunned as he may be,

351
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,540
但他依然生活在塞勒姆
he still resides in the bosom of Salem.

352
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,220
我会
I'll, uh --

353
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,020
我会和他单独聊聊
I'll speak with him personally.

354
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,380
今晚不行
Not tonight, you won't.

355
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,110
为什么
And why not?

356
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,940
兰姆给艾萨克服食了一些助于入睡的药剂
Lamb gave Isaac a tonic to help him sleep.

357
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,400
我想您最好早上再来  治安官
Probably best, magistrate, to return in the morning.

358
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,170
是的  治安官
Yes, magistrate.

359
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,150
到时候你可以和他单独聊聊
You can have your personal talk with him then.

360
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,290
萝丝  抛开治安官不谈
Rose, absent the magistrate,

361
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,810
我有多大机会得到大家的忠诚
what chance have I of harnessing the body's allegiance?

362
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,100
旧派与新派的支持者各有千秋
The others are split between old and new.

363
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,250
很难说这种分歧会带来什么结果
Difficult to predict the outcome of such a divide.

364
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:22,770
你年岁不轻
You're old

365
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,180
却没有被这种恐惧所支配
and yet somehow not governed by this fear.

366
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,880
区分我们的不是年龄  而是野心
It is not age that divides us, but ambition.

367
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,640
他并非没有野心
Well, he's not without ambition.

368
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,370
屈从于女人让他愤懑
It chafes him to bend to a woman,

369
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,990
他之所以仍这么做是为了我们的大义
but he does so that our greater purpose may live.

370
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,640
我们说好了的  由我带领大家
It was to be me that led us.

371
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,660
没错  如今也依然如此
It was and it is.

372
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,080
但如今我的权威却总受到质问及挑战
Questioned and challenged at every turn,

373
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,610
每一项决定都会受到怀疑和监视
each and every decision soliciting doubt and scrutiny.

374
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,270
我们再如何渴望
Much as we may wish it,

375
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:52,600
深渊中也不存在权力
primacy does not live in the abyss.

376
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,580
一切牺牲绝不能白费
It cannot have all been in vain.

377
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,310
西布里
Sibley.

378
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,390
你的孩子
Your baby.

379
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:13,160
一切牺牲绝不能白费
It cannot have all been in vain.

380
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:19,550
这种生活  我的
This life, my...

381
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,810
你的选择
Choices.

382
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,850
有选择吗
Was there a choice?

383
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,930
还是我选择的权力早已被剥夺
Or was choice taken from me?

384
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:30,450
现在想这些事为时已晚
It's too late now to think of such things.

385
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,640
是吗
Is it?

386
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,720
再次见到他肯定不容易
It mustn't have been easy seeing him again.

387
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,710
决定权在你  孩子
It is yours to decide, my girl,

388
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,260
这些牺牲会不会白费
what is in vain and what is not.

389
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,680
你会支持我的决定吗
And you will stand behind my decision?

390
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,280
我会有限度地支持
Up to a point.

391
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,090
主人的根基很深
The magister's roots are old.

392
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,660
他见识过许多也经受了很多痛苦
He has seen much and suffered greatly.

393
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,880
不要低估他
Do not underestimate him.

394
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,320
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley.

395
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,200
奥登上尉
Captain Alden.

396
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,040
艾萨克不是巫师
Isaac is not a witch.

397
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,250
你什么都不做的话他就会被绞死
You do nothing, he'll be hung for one.

398
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,820
我们得制止这件事
We have to stop this.

399
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,610
如今的你陡剩一副躯壳
There's nothing left in you.

400
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,610
没有情感  没有恻隐之心
No feelings, no heart.

401
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,160
你不再是我曾经认识的那个女孩了
You're not the girl I once knew.

402
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,350
他们审问过他了吗
Have they questioned him?

403
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,200
还没有
No.

404
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,780
因为医师给他喝了安眠药剂
That's because he was given a sleeping tonic.

405
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,980
所以他什么都没说
So he's said nothing.

406
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,380
没说
Nothing.

407
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:02,990
但是柯顿
But Cotton is eager,

408
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,640
以及治安官都早已迫不及待
and the magistrate was hard to turn away.

409
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,070
霍尔  他也在吗
Hale? Was there?

410
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,940
他就是去审问他的
He came straight to question him.

411
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,440
相信我  我一定会站在你这边
You have my complete allegiance.

412
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,370
"行善举之机会即是我等之天资"
"Our opportunities to do good are our talents."

413
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,860
这是我父亲说的
My father said that.

414
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,950
伟大的英克里斯·麦哲
The great Increase Mather.

415
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,470
不偏不倚  公正无私
To stay impartial, to weigh without bias --

416
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,920
这就是我该做的善举吗
is this the good I am meant to do?

417
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:48,520
我不想让你了断在我手里
I don't want your life in my hands.

418
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,800
塞勒姆一半的人觉得你是个傻子
Half of Salem takes you for a fool.

419
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,300
剩下的认为你是个龌龊下流之人
The rest dismiss you as a pervert.

420
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,390
是我疯了吗  我居然在你身上看到了些什么
Am I mad to think I saw something in you?

421
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,770
一个人们该有的品质
Something of a man?

422
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,910
正是如今这恶魔横行的塞勒姆所需要的
And just the sort Salem needs to fight the devil.

423
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,370
艾萨克  艾萨克
Isaac, Isaac. Isaac, Isaac.

424
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,830
亲爱的艾萨克
Oh, sweet Isaac.

425
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:22,680
艾比
Abby?

426
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,200
艾比
Abby?

427
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,920
艾萨克
Isaac.

428
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,090
你怎么
How did you --

429
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:38,140
嘘  亲爱的
Shh. My sweet.

430
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:40,650
告诉我
Tell me --

431
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,840
和你在森林里的人是谁
who was with you in the woods?

432
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,150
什么人
Who was what?

433
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,920
那天晚上
The other night. 

434
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,970
谁和你在一起
Who was with you?

435
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:01,070
谁和你在一起  亲爱的艾萨克
Who was with you, my sweet Isaac?

436
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,060
谁和你在一起  亲爱的
Who was with you, my love?

437
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,190
没人会听到的
No one can hear us.

438
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:16,040
如果你爱我就告诉我
If you love me, you'll tell me.

439
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,380
我不能
I can't.

440
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,640
告诉我  我们就能又在一起了
Tell me, and we'll be together again,

441
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,800
像从前一样
just like we were.

442
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,680
我不能
I can't.

443
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,220
你可以的
You can.

444
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,290
我不能
I can't.

445
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,850
你不能什么
You can't what?

446
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,690
你可以的  没事的
You can. It's okay.

447
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,080
谁和你在一起  亲爱的
Who was with you, my love?

448
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,160
是约翰·奥登
It was John Alden.

449
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,770
早上好  治安官
Good morning, magistrate.

450
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,210
早上好  西布里太太
Good morning, Mrs. Sibley.

451
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,370
见到您真是意外之喜
What an unforeseen delight.

452
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,500
要和我一起喝点咖啡吗
Will you join me in some coffee?

453
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,050
我们正在尝试一种新的巴西咖啡
W-we've been experimenting with a new brazilian brew.

454
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,320
能聊聊吗
May we speak?

455
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,520
女士们在祷告
The ladies are at prayer.

456
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,630
艾萨克当时是一个人
He was alone -- Isaac.

457
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,310
你审问他了  怎么审的
You questioned him? How?

458
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,600
他一个人在森林里
He was alone in the woods.

459
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,150
不必再为这事烦恼了
And that ends this persecution.

460
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:30,990
你能确信
And you're absolutely certain

461
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,490
艾萨克说的是实话吗
that Isaac was telling the truth?

462
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,100
在那种情况下  他绝不会
The circumstances were such that a lie would not --

463
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,990
也不可能撒谎
could not -- cross his lips.

464
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,890
既然这样
Well, then, that leaves nothing

465
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,100
我们就只能让行政委员们投票
but to task the selectmen to a vote

466
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,830
以巫师罪绞死那个孩子了
and hang the boy for witchcraft.

467
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,590
不行
No.

468
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,370
少一个蠢货塞勒姆也不会更悲惨
Salem will be no poorer for one less nitwit.

469
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,900
不行
No.

470
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,050
我们不知道他到底看见了多少
We will never truly know what he saw,

471
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,640
他目击的一切可能会害死我们
and what he saw could get us all killed.

472
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,390
我能控制艾萨克
I can control Isaac.

473
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,160
大祭典怎么办
And what of the grand rite?

474
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,530
你需要另一个祭品  而现在就有一个
You wanted another victim, and now you have one.

475
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,760
时不我待  西布里太太
Tick-tock, mrs. Sibley. 

476
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,360
下轮满月很快就到了
The next moon fast approaches.

477
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,930
我不会让你绞死他的
I will not let this happen.

478
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,420
你无能为力
You're powerless to stop it.

479
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,530
委员会将全力反对
The council will rule overwhelmingly against it.

480
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,970
你不能这么做
You will not do this!

481
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,560
如今能阻止你的只有情感了
It can only be sentiment that's stopping you.

482
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,680
这些猛烈的情感
Such raw emotion.

483
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,250
会成为你致命的弱点
It makes you vulnerable.

484
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,510
别忘了你的初衷
Don't let it cloud your purpose.

485
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,930
他必须死
He has to go.

486
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,750
西布里太太
Mrs. Sibley.

487
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,750
早上好  安
Good morning, Anne.

488
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,710
这些不是我的
They ain't mine.

489
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,670
从礼拜天起我已经用不同方式说过十遍了
I've said it 10 ways from sunday!

490
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,110
那它们怎么会在你身上
Then how did they come to be on your person?

491
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:48,140
我不知道  一定是猪头人放在我身上了
I don't know. The pigman must have put them on me.

492
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,610
或是峭壁里那个可怕的怪物
Or that blasted specter from the crags.

493
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,650
猪头人
The pigman?

494
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,850
他那晚在林子里看到咱们了
He saw us that night in the woods.

495
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,540
所以他们才这么对我
That's why they're doing this to me.

496
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,520
你不明白吗  他们知道我看到了什么
Don't you see? They know I seen something.

497
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,540
你还记得些什么
What else do you remember?

498
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,140
-树林里的事吗  -不是
- From the woods? - No.

499
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,860
是另一个晚上
From the other night.

500
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,480
在...妓院
At -- at the rod

501
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,160
那个窑子吗
The whorehouse?

502
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,330
没有  我什么都不记得
Nothing. I-I-I don't remember anything.

503
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:34,620
我告诉你了
I told you...

504
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,310
上尉  借一步说话
Captain, a word.

505
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,230
霍尔治安官很快会回来找艾萨克
Magistrate Hale will be here soon for Isaac.

506
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,790
他准备强制投票来吊死他
He's prepared to force a vote and hang him.

507
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,540
你必须阻止他
You will stop him.

508
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,020
怎么阻止
How?

509
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,630
不择手段
Any way you must.

510
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,790
我得去处理塞勒姆的事务了
Well, the business of Salem awaits no man.

511
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,690
我知道你要干什么  这让我深恶痛绝
I know what you're doing, and I hate you for it.

512
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,320
你这话简直是大不敬
Unacceptable language.

513
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,380
这种冲动的情绪实在是太可怕了
Utterly and completely horrid sentiment.

514
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,200
我朋友才刚死
My friend is dead.

515
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,660
你就急着去杀另一个
And you rush out to kill another.

516
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,240
亲爱的  你必须明白
Darling, you must understand --

517
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,700
就算是玛丽·西布里
Even Mary Sibley,

518
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,730
一个我从未有过相同意见的人
with whom I share not a single common opinion,

519
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,540
都觉得你的行为很低劣
finds your actions vile!

520
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,610
你觉得你有什么资格
And just how much of my conversation

521
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,030
能够和我谈这个
did you feel yourself entitled to?

522
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:41,970
至少我知道这样迫害艾萨克简直是荒谬至极
Enough to know that this persecution of Isaac is folly!

523
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,980
你要再下毒手吗  父亲
Will you kill another, father?

524
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,570
这就是你急着去处理的"事物"吗
Is that the "Business" you're so eager to attend to?

525
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,990
我所做的每一件事
Everything I do, 

526
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,360
都是为了这个家
I do for this family...

527
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,390
不光为它的安宁
For its well-being

528
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,350
也是为了整个小镇
and for the greater good of this town.

529
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:08,700
怎么
What?

530
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,630
没有"你怎么敢"或是"注意尊长"吗
No "How dare you?" or "Mind your elders"?

531
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:16,250
这一次  我的女儿  我支持你
For once, my daughter, I agree with you.

532
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,430
真的吗
You do?

533
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,090
但如果我是你
But if I were you, 

534
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,660
我会抛开对西布里夫人的厌恶
I'd find an avenue around your distaste for Mrs. Sibley

535
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,440
以去学习她的手段和方法
in order to absorb her manners and ways.

536
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,830
她卑鄙无耻  我不可能成为她
She's despicable. I could never be like her.

537
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:38,560
她是一个拥有自己声音的女人
She is a woman who has found her way to a voice.

538
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,640
看到她怎么运用了吗
Look how she uses it.

539
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,940
你也可以随意使用你的
You could use yours any way you like,

540
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,910
但你首先要找到它
but you have to find it first,

541
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,460
除非你想花余生的时间
unless you want to spend the rest of your life

542
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,850
只对着你父亲大吼大叫
shouting at your father...

543
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,650
或者对你的丈夫
Or...your husband.

544
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,280
西布里夫人要干什么
What did Mrs. Sibley require?

545
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,250
如今你相信艾萨克是无辜的还是有罪
Are you convinced of Isaac's innocence or guilt?

546
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,270
我两种都不确定
I am not convinced of either.

547
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,300
那就别插手
Then stay the hell out of my way.

548
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,600
我们该带他去接受审判了
We shall take the boy to trial.

549
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,520
那就等于将他送上了绞刑架
That path leads to the gallows.

550
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,840
这不是任何人可掌控的
It's in no one man's hands.

551
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,930
真的  那是谁掌控的
Really? Whose hands is it in?

552
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,590
当然是上帝了
God's, of course.

553
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,970
不
No.

554
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,630
需要我提醒你吗  孩子
Need I remind you, son,

555
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,090
你所阻挠之人在昨日
that you are impeding the very same man

556
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,190
才刚救了你一命
who only yesterday was your savior?

557
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,850
是啊  不过那是昨天了
Yeah. That was yesterday.

558
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:37,740
今天你要带艾萨克走
You want Isaac today...

559
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,940
就必须通过我这关
you got to go through me.

560
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:47,940
伟大的约翰·奥登  消失了十年后
The great John Alden disappears for a decade

561
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,180
居然还胆敢回来
and then dares to come back 

562
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,370
并且插手我们小镇的事务
and dictate how to run our town?

563
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,230
逮捕他
Take him.

564
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,790
为这个艾萨克这么做不值得
He is not worth this Isaac.

565
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,530
这和艾萨克无关
This has nothing to do with Isaac.

566
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,490
我知道
I know. 

567
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,000
也就是说和约翰·奥登有关了
Which means it has to do with John Alden.

568
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,670
治安官将明白谁才是真正的领袖
The magistrate will learn who leads us,

569
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,360
而且他必须接受
and he will accept it.

570
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,530
不然呢
Or?

571
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,480
帮帮他
Help him.

572
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,790
霍尔治安官  你的女儿
Magistrate Hale, your daughter!

573
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,570
住手  把他关回牢里去
Stop! Get him back in the cell!

574
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,290
住手  住手
Stop! Stop!

575
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,830
把他弄回牢房去
Get him back in the cell!

576
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,070
怎么了  发生了什么
What? What's happened?

577
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,790
她有没有服食任何花园里
Has she eat something strange

578
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,370
-或树林中的奇怪东西  -没有
-from the garden or the wood? -No.

579
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,840
她有没有被虫子或动物咬伤
Was she bit by an insect or a critter?

580
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,730
没有  快帮帮她
No, no! Please!...

581
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,170
发生了什么
What's happened?

582
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,070
她不能呼吸了
She -- she can't breathe!

583
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,230
看在上帝的份上  做点什么
For god's sakes, man, do something!

584
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,360
我对此无能为力
She is beyond my arts.

585
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,210
住手
Stop it! 

586
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:41,990
求求你  住手吧
Make it stop!

587
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,260
治安官  下午好啊
Magistrate, good afternoon.

588
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,820
求求你  我会放了艾萨克
I beg of you. Isaac can go free, 

589
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,470
全听你的  求求你停手吧
whatever you want. Just make it stop.

590
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,510
-不许再对他逼供  -不会了
- You will not question him. - No.

591
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,140
别再插手我的事
You will get out of my way.

592
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,470
也不许再质疑我的权威
You will let me lead without further interference.

593
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,840
我将决定谁生谁死
I will choose who lives and who dies.

594
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,200
全听你的  救救她吧
Yes, yes. Help her.

595
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,540
你要知道  治安官
You see, magistrate,

596
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,030
在这个镇上我已经失去了值得牵挂的一切
I've lost everything in this town that I ever cared for.

597
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,870
而你
You, however,

598
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,560
你却有许多害怕失去的事物
You have everything left to lose --

599
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,940
这些情感正是你致命的弱点
a sentiment that makes you vulnerable.

600
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,550
求你了
Please.

601
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,520
放过我女儿
My daughter.

602
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,670
放过我女儿吧
My daughter.

603
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,070
她情况好多了
She's improved.

604
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,710
以前我一直不明白
I never understood it before --

605
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,480
为什么父母忍心把我送走
how my parents could send me away.

606
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,960
有什么会比与家人分离更残忍
What could be worse than being apart?

607
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,560
肯定不是死亡
Certainly not death.

608
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,140
如今我明白了
Now I know

609
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,300
父母会为了孩子的性命做出任何事情
a parent will do anything for the life of their child.

610
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,680
你做了什么
What did you do?

611
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,800
我是怎么了
What happened?

612
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,090
没事了  亲爱的
It's all right, darling.

613
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,450
一切都会好的
Everything's going to be all right.

614
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,520
说实话
A confession --

615
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,870
有时我不禁会想  或许偶尔来一场殴斗
I've thought, on occasion, my character might've been improved

616
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,450
会对我的性格有所帮助
by the infrequent tussle.

617
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,100
没错
Oh, yeah.

618
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,520
你挨过的那些揍还真是让你获益良多
Beating's done you a world of good.

619
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,100
你为什么帮我
Why did you help me?

620
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,470
就算是上帝也需要一场公平的斗争
Even God demands a fair fight.

621
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,480
先生们
Gentlemen.

622
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,650
行政委员和我一致认为  这件案子
The selectmen and I feel, in this particular case,

623
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:58,240
不需要进行审判与投票
that a trial and a vote will be unnecessary.

624
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,160
显然  那小伙子只是喝醉了
Clearly, the lad was drunk.

625
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,980
我们同意释放他  并撤销一切指控
We are willing to let him go and drop charges.

626
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,500
当然了  除非牧师不这么认为
Unless, of course, the reverend feels otherwise.

627
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:11,660
就是一场醉酒闹事罢了
A drunken romp is all --

628
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,410
年轻人的特权
A young man's prerogative.

629
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,590
不如你去告诉他这个好消息吧
Why don't you tell him?

630
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,130
塞勒姆的善良人民
The good folks of Salem

631
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:51,160
认为你只是喝醉了  而不是一个巫师
have declared you a drunk and not a witch.

632
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,650
你被释放了
You're sprung.

633
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,220
我自由了
I'm free?

634
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,250
没错  赶紧离开这鬼地方吧
Yeah. Get the hell out of here.

635
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,790
从没有人为我说过话
Pretty sure no one's ever stood for me before.

636
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,950
让我不知道该说什么好
Makes it hard to know what to say.

637
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,170
你救了我一命
You saved my life.

638
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:35,190
好消息
Excellent news.

639
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,860
艾萨克被释放了
Isaac has been spared.

640
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,910
怎么会
What? How?

641
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,500
因为没有足够的证据将他定罪
There simply wasn't the required evidence to convict.

642
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,100
我说过我一定会详细调查
I told you I was thorough

643
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,890
所以只要你是无辜的
And that the innocent...

644
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,830
就根本无需担心
have no cause for alarm.

645
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,040
这还不足以消除你的忧虑吗
Does that not give you peace?

646
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,550
这只是今天
That is today,

647
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,120
但未来的日子呢
but what of the days that follow?

648
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:02,590
无论发生什么  我们会一起面对
We will take them as they come.

649
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,720
我们
We will?

650
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,970
我说过  我不会让你受到任何伤害
I told you -- no harm will come to you.

651
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,730
你没法保证
You can't be sure.

652
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:08,850
我可以
I can.

653
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,040
你是否曾想过
Do you ever wonder?

654
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:18,720
什么
What?

655
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:23,950
或许我们可以离开这里
If we could leave this place?

656
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:28,580
忘了塞勒姆和这些巫师们
If we could forget Salem and its witches?

657
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,530
去过不同的生活
If we could have a different life?

658
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,820
我相信我做的一切都是正义的
I believe I'm doing good.

659
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:39,840
我知道
I know.

660
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,130
你的父亲一定会为你无比骄傲
And your father would be so very proud.

661
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:47,380
艾萨克被释放了吗
Isaac has been freed?

662
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:49,560
是的
Yes.

663
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:52,200
那就好
Good.

664
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:59,930
你真该看看那些民兵的样子
You should see the militia.

665
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:07,720
我很感激
I'm grateful.

666
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,070
你对艾萨克的帮助
For Isaac.

667
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:16,650
不用客气
Okay, then.

668
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:19,880
约翰
John...

669
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,640
今天我们只是幸运
We were fortunate today,

670
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,750
但好运不会一直伴随着我们
but we might not be so lucky in days to come.

671
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:29,000
如果你坚持留下
If you insist on staying...

672
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:35,100
你必须明白  我将无法保护你
...you must understand I cannot protect you.

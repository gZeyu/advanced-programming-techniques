00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,950
Previously on "Salem"

15
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,890
Isaac?

16
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,360
Isaac the fornicator.

17
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,660
Coming home to Salem to get out of the war

18
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,060
is like jumping in the ocean to get out of the rain.

19
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,700
You can't leave Salem just yet.

20
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,930
Something you've got to see.

21
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,180
Someone broke our circle.

22
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,610
Who saw us?

23
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,980
I do not know.

24
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,260
I waited for you.

25
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,730
Years and years.

26
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:23,800
Come with me.

27
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,290
I can't. It's impossible.

28
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,290
The grand rite has begun,

29
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,550
and the earth cries out for innocent blood.

30
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,770
I know well my duties.

31
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,180
The only thing that keeps me alive

32
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,440
is the look on your face

33
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,280
when John Alden finds out what you really are.

34
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,550
Father, you know Bridget.

35
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,570
How could you think her guilty of this?

36
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,260
It isn't a matter of what I think.

37
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,740
What a mess you've made of things.

38
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,620
I don't want you here.

39
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,790
I almost believe you.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,500
You're so beautiful.

41
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,580
"Fear no man's war,

42
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,180
for only a war from hell could destroy Salem."

43
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,260
The devil was never going to 

44
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,030
let a promised land be built here without a battle.

45
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,860
Do you know what killed nearly every woman buried here?

46
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,140
Love.

47
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,090
And witches armed with deadly malice...

48
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,960
Most died in childbirth. So love is to a woman...

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,720
...are the most malignant and insidious weapons in that battle...

50
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,250
...what war is to a man.

51
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,630
- ...that war  - The most deadly thing, they'll do.

52
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,820
for the body and the soul of a nation.

53
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,560
Only a fool runs quickly to war...

54
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,190
Imagine a foe you can't see...

55
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,510
- or love. - armed with weapons unknown...

56
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,290
I can teach you...

57
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,910
...and the ability to appear as anyone.

58
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,030
...about life and death and many things in between.

59
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,970
Stop it! Just stop it! Stop.

60
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,940
Judge not, lest ye be judged.

61
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,590
*Pound me the witch drums*

62
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,560
*Witch drums*

63
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,140
*Pound me the witch drums*

64
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,330
*Pound me the witch drums*

65
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,550
*The witch drums*

66
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,150
*Better pray for hell*

67
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,080
*Not hallelujah*

68
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,190
Burn in hell!

69
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,720
Sin!

70
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,240
Be assured, Mrs. Bridget --

71
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,220
ones that are weepin'

72
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,080
far outnumber the ones that might spit or curse.

73
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,210
Burn in hell! Burn!

74
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,850
You would do well to pay that boy extra

75
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,320
to take them bodies a more circuitous route.

76
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,920
Spectacle is fuel for our fire.

77
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,210
And doubt is indulged by the rich and spoiled only.

78
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,540
Mind that you was born neither.

79
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,680
"Give me to die with thee that I may rise to a new life,

80
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,890
"for I wish to be as dead and buried to sin,

81
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,130
to selfishness..."

82
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,770
By all means, Reverend...

83
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,440
Do not offer prayer or comfort or words of encouragement.

84
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,340
No, stand as a bewildered statue

85
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,710
amongst the people of Salem

86
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,320
and offer them absolutely nothing.

87
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,890
What would you have me do?

88
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,660
What I brought you here to do.

89
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,380
Guide and support us in our great hour of need.

90
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,740
Warm our hearts with your words of wisdom.

91
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,960
Assure us it is God's will we do in ferreting out the devil.

92
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,920
Or at the very, very least...

93
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,210
Pray.

94
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,480
Tragic day.

95
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,670
Tragic but necessary.

96
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,680
Tragically necessary.

97
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,880
Surely, the grieving of the masses gives you pause.

98
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,150
Most spit and curse

99
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,510
while summoning the burning flames of hell.

100
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,210
There are also 

101
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,740
those who weep for her and find her hanging unfounded.

102
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,070
Not enough to divert our intentions.

103
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,010
A panic's success relies on its escalation.

104
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,410
The grand rite has begun.

105
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,420
We look to our next victim.

106
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,110
And that I disagree,

107
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,680
that I strenuously and most vehemently oppose

108
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,000
means nothing to you?

109
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,160
We were seen at our sabbat.

110
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,570
And you throw caution to the wind.

111
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,050
And have you identified who saw us?

112
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,380
Perhaps your disagreements and vehement opposition

113
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,490
might hold more weight if you could be relied on

114
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,520
to complete a simple task.

115
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,090
Good day, Hale.

116
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,200
What must I do to be saved?

117
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,820
It is impossible to ask a more weighty question.

118
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,600
Lest we perish eternally.

119
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,690
How's it feel?

120
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,710
How does what feel?

121
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,120
Killing two innocents in as many days.

122
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,850
- The evidence against Miss Bishop. - The orphanage! 

123
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,630
Help! They're looting the orphanage!

124
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,550
Get out!

125
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,000
It's not yours!

126
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,770
Get...

127
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,520
Next one's to your head.

128
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,140
Are you okay?

129
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,850
It's awful. It's too awful.

130
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,120
W-what's happened?

131
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,880
Thieves have come to ransack the orphanage

132
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,590
now that the town sees fit to hang its guardian.

133
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,550
Easy, son.

134
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,680
This is what comes of your witch panic.

135
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,470
Are you all right?

136
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,960
This is your fault! And his.

137
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,720
Forgive her. She's distraught.

138
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,790
I'm right!

139
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,230
See me home.

140
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,960
Captain, if you wouldn't mind, hmm?

141
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,700
Yes. Of course.

142
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,970
Where have they taken her?

143
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,350
Foul spot where they rest the unwanted.

144
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,470
Is it very terrible?

145
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,120
Yes.

146
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,530
Thank you...

147
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,730
for your heroism and your candor.

148
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,180
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

149
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,730
A cup of tea?

150
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,080
-A touch of port? -No time.

151
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,110
Who saw us in the woods?

152
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,140
It was...he who is marked.

153
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,690
He of the "F" that furrows his brow.

154
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,870
-Issac? -The fornicator.

155
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,180
The idiot.

156
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,400
One more thing.

157
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,080
Isaac was not alone.

158
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,640
Who else was with him?

159
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,650
I don't know.

160
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,100
I could not make out the face.

161
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,530
You don't know.

162
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,580
What good are you?

163
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,300
A seer who can't see.

164
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,870
It's not an exact art.

165
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,310
Evidently not.

166
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,730
Hello?

167
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,870
Hello?

168
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,640
What the hell was that place?

169
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,560
The shack belongs to Petrus,

170
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,120
an expert on creatures both feral and otherwise.

171
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,070
Yeah, well, they looked dead...until they didn't.

172
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,820
No, dead animal

173
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,620
could threaten a storied soldier such as yourself, captain.

174
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,550
It could, if powered by forces we don't understand.

175
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,320
-Such as? -Witchcraft.

176
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,190
-Nonsense. -Is it?

177
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,710
You know him well, this Petrus?

178
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,740
You'll find no man more ordinary than Petrus.

179
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,880
To say that he's mundane is to overstate his passion.

180
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,170
And what ordinary task brought you deep into the forest

181
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,810
to seek his mundane counsel?

182
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,070
Easy, son...

183
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,650
Or I might suspect your presence here

184
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,390
as more than a coincidence,

185
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,110
That, perhaps, for reasons of your own

186
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,160
about which I'm sure you'd rather I not inquire,

187
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,280
you might have followed me here.

188
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,660
And what a shame...

189
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,150
to have suspicion overtake the grace I owe

190
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,080
for the kindness you showed my daughter.

191
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,550
Consider it repaid.

192
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,090
Right.

193
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,770
George, really.

194
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,660
You are worse than a child.

195
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,130
He serves at my behest, not yours.

196
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,760
He won't come out for you.

197
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,850
There, there, little man.

198
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,470
Oh, pay the beast no mind.

199
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,770
Rest now, and I'll see to your feeding later.

200
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,070
Isaac's brung the master's potions.

201
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,050
Tell him to wait.

202
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,830
Ohh, George.

203
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,640
Your nightdress thoroughly drenched in sick.

204
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,470
Stew in that for the day, my sweet.

205
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,520
For Mr. Sibley.

206
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,430
Oh, and not a moment too soon.

207
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,210
Just now, he suffered a fit of sorts.

208
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,650
If you don't mind me saying so, ma'am,

209
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,200
It's a burden you've took on...

210
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,190
A burden and load, carried out without cry or complaint.

211
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,000
My burdens can't compare to that of salem itself.

212
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,720
How do you find the spirits on the square?

213
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,620
Low, ma'am. Awful low.

214
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,070
Perhaps there is solace to be found

215
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,270
in remembrance of times when we've both shouldered worse.

216
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,820
Who could have imagined that a single night

217
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,700
could have consequence for so many?

218
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,390
Not all scars can be seen.

219
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,380
But they exist nonetheless.

220
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,150
Next morning, she was gone.

221
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,180
Run away and disappeared.

222
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,710
Oh, your sweet abby.

223
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,170
I'll admit to wondering on occasion

224
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,750
What it might be like to one day see her again

225
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,500
Or know of her or hear her fate.

226
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,740
Would it be better or so much worse?

227
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,140
I can assure you, Isaac...

228
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,570
If you were to see her again,

229
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,070
you would find those feelings buried too deeply

230
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,400
for hope of resurrection.

231
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,160
Good afternoon, Isaac.

232
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,400
G'day, ma'am.

233
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,110
What is that?

234
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,700
What is that? What are you... what are you doing?

235
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,070
Please. Please.

236
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,810
What did you see in the woods?

237
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,220
We knew you weren't alone.

238
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,590
We know!

239
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,240
We know! We know!

240
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,970
Who was there?! Who was there?!

241
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,610
I was alone!

242
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,200
I was alone!

243
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,240
Get it all.

244
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,260
Want no trace of our efforts.

245
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,990
The fault must lie with him alone.

246
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,690
And put these in his pockets.

247
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,800
If he's to be found a witch,

248
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,100
The good reverend will require proof...

249
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,070
...evidence to seal his fate, hmm?

250
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,270
What is it?

251
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,290
Is this sympathy that I'm sensing?

252
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,170
One outcast to the other?

253
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,130
Is that what you feel, you decrepit deformity?

254
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,530
Mary!

255
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,650
So now even you would question me?

256
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,590
Do as you're told!

257
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,320
Does your great Mary know what it is to watch witches burn?

258
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,820
Nothing of the old ways

259
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,750
while she's whipping us toward the new.

260
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,060
A spell of vitae cupido,

261
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,920
And then we send him to the one place in town

262
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,490
That will certainly deny him entrance.

263
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,460
That should get their attention.

264
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,740
You're crying.

265
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,740
I'm not.

266
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,690
You are.

267
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,190
What's wrong?

268
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,550
If they can hang a woman like miss Bishop,

269
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,770
What does that mean for someone like me?

270
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,800
Nothing is going to happen to you.

271
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,270
How can you be so sure?

272
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,160
Just yesterday, it was me that they put before the Lewis girl.

273
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,510
Would you have come forward had I been accused?

274
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,270
I follow every protocol.

275
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,830
I adhere to every letter of what my father taught me.

276
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,080
No one is convicted without incontrovertible evidence.

277
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,410
So you're certain miss Bishop was a witch?

278
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,660
I am certain...

279
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,390
of the evidence.

280
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,450
Why do you do it?

281
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,770
Why?

282
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,340
Is it that you believe that you're doing good?

283
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,890
Or is it that you wish to please your father?

284
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,190
It's Isaac! He's mad!

285
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,510
I can't be seen here.

286
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,780
Let me touch you!

287
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,630
Get up!

288
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,000
Isaac, no!

289
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,750
Isaac, what are you doing?

290
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,000
What do you see?!

291
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,140
Isaac!

292
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,120
Oh there you are! 

293
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,590
Isaac the fornicator! Isaac the fornicator!

294
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,020
Hide your wives! Hide all your sheep!

295
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,260
Isaac the fornicator will get them when they sleep!

296
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,210
Isaac the fornicator!

297
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,360
Hide your wives! Hide your wives!

298
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,710
Hide all your sheep!

299
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,250
Isaac the fornicator! Hide your wives!

300
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,810
- Isaac!  - Hide your sheep. Isaac the fornicator.

301
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,110
Stop! Isaac!

302
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,920
Jonathan, it's no good. It's no good!

303
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,600
What is no good?

304
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,970
They saw us. They saw us.

305
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,690
They saw us in the woods.

306
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,490
They saw us.

307
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,780
They saw us in the woods. They saw us.

308
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,540
Shut up.

309
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,490
Take him to the jail.

310
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,100
They saw us in the woods.

311
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,310
They saw us.

312
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:37,890
Magistrate.

313
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,440
Mrs. Sibley.

314
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,130
What have you done?

315
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,280
The idiot saw us in the woods.

316
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,510
Isaac.

317
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,920
So, you did this without consent?

318
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,750
He wasn't alone.

319
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,970
We'll find out who was with him, and he will burn.

320
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,730
No, you will do nothing further.

321
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,740
- But... - Nothing!

322
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,810
Go home, magistrate.

323
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,320
You reek of the woods.

324
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,990
Find me Rose.

325
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,780
A drunken romp, that's all --

326
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,150
A young man's prerogative.

327
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,190
And yet no smell of spirits on him.

328
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,640
Oh, well, burn him, then. Why wait?

329
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,140
If he was spelled, he's blameless in his actions.

330
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,490
Yet you still hold him. Why?

331
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,380
Found on his person.

332
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,100
Likely stolen to cast a spell on its owner.

333
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,130
One minute, he's speller.

334
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,120
The next, he's bewitched.

335
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,030
Make up your mind, reverend.

336
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,210
Is he a witch or a victim of the craft?

337
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,770
Chief ingredient of a witch's brew.

338
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,690
Isaac took me into those woods.

339
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,190
He risked his life to show me the witches.

340
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,270
Why, if he was one?

341
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,960
I've, uh, administrated a tonic

342
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,530
that'll settle him down and, uh, end the fits.

343
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,900
What is your surgeon's opinion of the boy's condition?

344
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,610
I can't say for sure as to cause or source,

345
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,670
but going by his babble, 

346
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,710
that boy is good and touched.

347
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,370
Every benefit of the doubt,

348
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,190
every avenue explored.

349
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,400
The boy is one of our own.

350
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,130
Outcast and shunned as he may be,

351
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,540
he still resides in the bosom of Salem.

352
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,220
I'll, uh --

353
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,020
I'll speak with him personally.

354
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,380
Not tonight, you won't.

355
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,110
And why not?

356
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,940
Lamb gave Isaac a tonic to help him sleep.

357
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,400
Probably best, magistrate, to return in the morning.

358
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,170
Yes, magistrate.

359
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,150
You can have your personal talk with him then.

360
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,290
Rose, absent the magistrate,

361
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,810
what chance have I of harnessing the body's allegiance?

362
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,100
The others are split between old and new.

363
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,250
Difficult to predict the outcome of such a divide.

364
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:22,770
You're old

365
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,180
and yet somehow not governed by this fear.

366
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,880
It is not age that divides us, but ambition.

367
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,640
Well, he's not without ambition.

368
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,370
It chafes him to bend to a woman,

369
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,990
but he does so that our greater purpose may live.

370
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,640
It was to be me that led us.

371
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,660
It was and it is.

372
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,080
Questioned and challenged at every turn,

373
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,610
each and every decision soliciting doubt and scrutiny.

374
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,270
Much as we may wish it,

375
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:52,600
primacy does not live in the abyss.

376
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,580
It cannot have all been in vain.

377
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,310
Sibley.

378
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,390
Your baby.

379
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:13,160
It cannot have all been in vain.

380
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:19,550
This life, my...

381
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,810
Choices.

382
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,850
Was there a choice?

383
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,930
Or was choice taken from me?

384
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:30,450
It's too late now to think of such things.

385
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,640
Is it?

386
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,720
It mustn't have been easy seeing him again.

387
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,710
It is yours to decide, my girl,

388
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,260
what is in vain and what is not.

389
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,680
And you will stand behind my decision?

390
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,280
Up to a point.

391
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,090
The magister's roots are old.

392
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,660
He has seen much and suffered greatly.

393
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,880
Do not underestimate him.

394
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,320
Mrs. Sibley.

395
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,200
Captain Alden.

396
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,040
Isaac is not a witch.

397
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,250
You do nothing, he'll be hung for one.

398
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,820
We have to stop this.

399
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,610
There's nothing left in you.

400
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,610
No feelings, no heart.

401
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,160
You're not the girl I once knew.

402
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,350
Have they questioned him?

403
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,200
No.

404
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,780
That's because he was given a sleeping tonic.

405
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,980
So he's said nothing.

406
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,380
Nothing.

407
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:02,990
But Cotton is eager,

408
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,640
and the magistrate was hard to turn away.

409
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,070
Hale? Was there?

410
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,940
He came straight to question him.

411
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,440
You have my complete allegiance.

412
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,370
"Our opportunities to do good are our talents."

413
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,860
My father said that.

414
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,950
The great Increase Mather.

415
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,470
To stay impartial, to weigh without bias --

416
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,920
is this the good I am meant to do?

417
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:48,520
I don't want your life in my hands.

418
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,800
Half of Salem takes you for a fool.

419
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,300
The rest dismiss you as a pervert.

420
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,390
Am I mad to think I saw something in you?

421
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,770
Something of a man?

422
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,910
And just the sort Salem needs to fight the devil.

423
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,370
Isaac, Isaac. Isaac, Isaac.

424
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,830
Oh, sweet Isaac.

425
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:22,680
Abby?

426
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,200
Abby?

427
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,920
Isaac.

428
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,090
How did you --

429
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:38,140
Shh. My sweet.

430
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:40,650
Tell me --

431
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,840
who was with you in the woods?

432
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,150
Who was what?

433
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,920
The other night. 

434
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,970
Who was with you?

435
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:01,070
Who was with you, my sweet Isaac?

436
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,060
Who was with you, my love?

437
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,190
No one can hear us.

438
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:16,040
If you love me, you'll tell me.

439
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,380
I can't.

440
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,640
Tell me, and we'll be together again,

441
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,800
just like we were.

442
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,680
I can't.

443
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,220
You can.

444
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,290
I can't.

445
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,850
You can't what?

446
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,690
You can. It's okay.

447
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,080
Who was with you, my love?

448
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,160
It was John Alden.

449
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,770
Good morning, magistrate.

450
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,210
Good morning, Mrs. Sibley.

451
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,370
What an unforeseen delight.

452
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,500
Will you join me in some coffee?

453
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,050
W-we've been experimenting with a new brazilian brew.

454
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,320
May we speak?

455
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,520
The ladies are at prayer.

456
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,630
He was alone -- Isaac.

457
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,310
You questioned him? How?

458
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,600
He was alone in the woods.

459
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,150
And that ends this persecution.

460
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:30,990
And you're absolutely certain

461
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,490
that Isaac was telling the truth?

462
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,100
The circumstances were such that a lie would not --

463
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,990
could not -- cross his lips.

464
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,890
Well, then, that leaves nothing

465
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,100
but to task the selectmen to a vote

466
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,830
and hang the boy for witchcraft.

467
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,590
No.

468
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,370
Salem will be no poorer for one less nitwit.

469
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,900
No.

470
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,050
We will never truly know what he saw,

471
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,640
and what he saw could get us all killed.

472
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,390
I can control Isaac.

473
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,160
And what of the grand rite?

474
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,530
You wanted another victim, and now you have one.

475
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,760
Tick-tock, mrs. Sibley. 

476
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,360
The next moon fast approaches.

477
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,930
I will not let this happen.

478
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,420
You're powerless to stop it.

479
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,530
The council will rule overwhelmingly against it.

480
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,970
You will not do this!

481
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,560
It can only be sentiment that's stopping you.

482
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,680
Such raw emotion.

483
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,250
It makes you vulnerable.

484
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,510
Don't let it cloud your purpose.

485
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,930
He has to go.

486
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,750
Mrs. Sibley.

487
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,750
Good morning, Anne.

488
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,710
They ain't mine.

489
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,670
I've said it 10 ways from sunday!

490
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,110
Then how did they come to be on your person?

491
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:48,140
I don't know. The pigman must have put them on me.

492
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,610
Or that blasted specter from the crags.

493
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,650
The pigman?

494
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,850
He saw us that night in the woods.

495
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,540
That's why they're doing this to me.

496
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,520
Don't you see? They know I seen something.

497
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,540
What else do you remember?

498
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,140
- From the woods? - No.

499
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,860
From the other night.

500
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,480
At -- at the rod

501
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,160
The whorehouse?

502
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,330
Nothing. I-I-I don't remember anything.

503
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:34,620
I told you...

504
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,310
Captain, a word.

505
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,230
Magistrate Hale will be here soon for Isaac.

506
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,790
He's prepared to force a vote and hang him.

507
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,540
You will stop him.

508
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,020
How?

509
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,630
Any way you must.

510
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,790
Well, the business of Salem awaits no man.

511
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,690
I know what you're doing, and I hate you for it.

512
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,320
Unacceptable language.

513
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,380
Utterly and completely horrid sentiment.

514
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,200
My friend is dead.

515
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,660
And you rush out to kill another.

516
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,240
Darling, you must understand --

517
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,700
Even Mary Sibley,

518
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,730
with whom I share not a single common opinion,

519
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,540
finds your actions vile!

520
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,610
And just how much of my conversation

521
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,030
did you feel yourself entitled to?

522
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:41,970
Enough to know that this persecution of Isaac is folly!

523
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,980
Will you kill another, father?

524
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,570
Is that the "Business" you're so eager to attend to?

525
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,990
Everything I do, 

526
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,360
I do for this family...

527
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,390
For its well-being

528
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,350
and for the greater good of this town.

529
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:08,700
What?

530
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,630
No "How dare you?" or "Mind your elders"?

531
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:16,250
For once, my daughter, I agree with you.

532
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,430
You do?

533
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,090
But if I were you, 

534
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,660
I'd find an avenue around your distaste for Mrs. Sibley

535
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,440
in order to absorb her manners and ways.

536
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,830
She's despicable. I could never be like her.

537
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:38,560
She is a woman who has found her way to a voice.

538
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,640
Look how she uses it.

539
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,940
You could use yours any way you like,

540
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,910
but you have to find it first,

541
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,460
unless you want to spend the rest of your life

542
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,850
shouting at your father...

543
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,650
Or...your husband.

544
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,280
What did Mrs. Sibley require?

545
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,250
Are you convinced of Isaac's innocence or guilt?

546
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,270
I am not convinced of either.

547
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,300
Then stay the hell out of my way.

548
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,600
We shall take the boy to trial.

549
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,520
That path leads to the gallows.

550
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,840
It's in no one man's hands.

551
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,930
Really? Whose hands is it in?

552
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,590
God's, of course.

553
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,970
No.

554
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,630
Need I remind you, son,

555
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,090
that you are impeding the very same man

556
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,190
who only yesterday was your savior?

557
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,850
Yeah. That was yesterday.

558
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:37,740
You want Isaac today...

559
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,940
you got to go through me.

560
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:47,940
The great John Alden disappears for a decade

561
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,180
and then dares to come back 

562
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,370
and dictate how to run our town?

563
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,230
Take him.

564
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,790
He is not worth this Isaac.

565
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,530
This has nothing to do with Isaac.

566
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,490
I know. 

567
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,000
Which means it has to do with John Alden.

568
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,670
The magistrate will learn who leads us,

569
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,360
and he will accept it.

570
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,530
Or?

571
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,480
Help him.

572
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,790
Magistrate Hale, your daughter!

573
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,570
Stop! Get him back in the cell!

574
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,290
Stop! Stop!

575
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,830
Get him back in the cell!

576
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,070
What? What's happened?

577
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,790
Has she eat something strange

578
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,370
-from the garden or the wood? -No.

579
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,840
Was she bit by an insect or a critter?

580
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,730
No, no! Please!...

581
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,170
What's happened?

582
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,070
She -- she can't breathe!

583
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,230
For god's sakes, man, do something!

584
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,360
She is beyond my arts.

585
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,210
Stop it! 

586
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:41,990
Make it stop!

587
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,260
Magistrate, good afternoon.

588
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,820
I beg of you. Isaac can go free, 

589
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,470
whatever you want. Just make it stop.

590
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,510
- You will not question him. - No.

591
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,140
You will get out of my way.

592
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,470
You will let me lead without further interference.

593
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,840
I will choose who lives and who dies.

594
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,200
Yes, yes. Help her.

595
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,540
You see, magistrate,

596
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,030
I've lost everything in this town that I ever cared for.

597
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,870
You, however,

598
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,560
You have everything left to lose --

599
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,940
a sentiment that makes you vulnerable.

600
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,550
Please.

601
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,520
My daughter.

602
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,670
My daughter.

603
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,070
She's improved.

604
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,710
I never understood it before --

605
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,480
how my parents could send me away.

606
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,960
What could be worse than being apart?

607
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,560
Certainly not death.

608
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,140
Now I know

609
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,300
a parent will do anything for the life of their child.

610
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,680
What did you do?

611
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,800
What happened?

612
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,090
It's all right, darling.

613
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,450
Everything's going to be all right.

614
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,520
A confession --

615
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,870
I've thought, on occasion, my character might've been improved

616
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,450
by the infrequent tussle.

617
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,100
Oh, yeah.

618
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,520
Beating's done you a world of good.

619
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,100
Why did you help me?

620
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,470
Even God demands a fair fight.

621
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,480
Gentlemen.

622
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,650
The selectmen and I feel, in this particular case,

623
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:58,240
that a trial and a vote will be unnecessary.

624
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,160
Clearly, the lad was drunk.

625
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,980
We are willing to let him go and drop charges.

626
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,500
Unless, of course, the reverend feels otherwise.

627
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:11,660
A drunken romp is all --

628
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,410
A young man's prerogative.

629
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,590
Why don't you tell him?

630
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,130
The good folks of Salem

631
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:51,160
have declared you a drunk and not a witch.

632
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,650
You're sprung.

633
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,220
I'm free?

634
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,250
Yeah. Get the hell out of here.

635
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,790
Pretty sure no one's ever stood for me before.

636
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,950
Makes it hard to know what to say.

637
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,170
You saved my life.

638
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:35,190
Excellent news.

639
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,860
Isaac has been spared.

640
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,910
What? How?

641
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,500
There simply wasn't the required evidence to convict.

642
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,100
I told you I was thorough

643
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,890
And that the innocent...

644
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,830
have no cause for alarm.

645
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,040
Does that not give you peace?

646
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,550
That is today,

647
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,120
but what of the days that follow?

648
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:02,590
We will take them as they come.

649
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,720
We will?

650
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,970
I told you -- no harm will come to you.

651
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,730
You can't be sure.

652
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:08,850
I can.

653
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,040
Do you ever wonder?

654
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:18,720
What?

655
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:23,950
If we could leave this place?

656
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:28,580
If we could forget Salem and its witches?

657
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,530
If we could have a different life?

658
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,820
I believe I'm doing good.

659
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:39,840
I know.

660
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,130
And your father would be so very proud.

661
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:47,380
Isaac has been freed?

662
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:49,560
Yes.

663
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:52,200
Good.

664
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:59,930
You should see the militia.

665
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:07,720
I'm grateful.

666
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,070
For Isaac.

667
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:16,650
Okay, then.

668
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:19,880
John...

669
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,640
We were fortunate today,

670
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,750
but we might not be so lucky in days to come.

671
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:29,000
If you insist on staying...

672
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:35,100
...you must understand I cannot protect you.

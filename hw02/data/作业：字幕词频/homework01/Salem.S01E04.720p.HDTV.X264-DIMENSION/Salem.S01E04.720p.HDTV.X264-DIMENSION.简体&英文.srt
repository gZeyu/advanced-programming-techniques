00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,710
《塞勒姆》前情提要
Previously on "Salem"

15
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,870
感谢你多年来对我们的英勇守护
We all welcome Captain Alden home

16
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,150
欢迎回家  奥登上尉
from his long, long service.

17
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,160
你回来的目的只有一个
You come back for one thing and one thing only.

18
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,430
如今她可是玛丽·西布里
She's Mary Sibley now.

19
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,080
我一直在等着你
I waited for you.

20
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,310
年复一年  你却杳无音讯
Years and years without a word.

21
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,400
我被俘虏了
I was captured.

22
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,940
或许我们可以忘了塞勒姆和这些巫师们
If we could forget Salem and its witches.

23
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,370
去过不同的生活
If we could have a different life.

24
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,480
她不能呼吸了
She can't breathe!

25
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,570
求求你  住手吧
Make it stop.

26
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,610
求你放过我女儿
Please. My daughter.

27
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,550
我们称此为魔鬼侵袭...
We call it a spectral attack --

28
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,070
是巫师所为
The work of witches.

29
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,500
为她祈祷吧
Pray for her.

30
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,980
圣子在命令你...[拉丁文]
Imperat tibi Deus Filius...

31
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:57,320
圣灵在命令你...[拉丁文]
Imperat tibi Deus Spiritus Sanctus...

32
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,310
造物之主耶稣...[拉丁文]
Imperat tibi majestas Christi...

33
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,490
住手
You must stop this.

34
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,400
基督命令你...[拉丁文]
aeternum Dei Verbum caro factum...

35
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,760
圣十字架命令你...[拉丁文]
Imperat sacramentum crucis...

36
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,720
要是他们知道了  你会被绞死的
They will hang you if they learn of this.

37
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,170
巫师们已经夺走了你的人生
The witches have already taken your life.

38
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,200
我不怕那些清教徒会怎么对我
I no longer fear the puritans claiming mine.

39
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,950
你体内那污秽的灵魂必须被驱逐
The wretched spirit that inhabits you must be excised.

40
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,760
不然你知道会有什么下场吗
Or else what becomes of you?

41
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,770
发疯
Hmm? Madness?

42
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,890
死亡
Death?

43
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,690
你相信我吗  梅西
Do you trust me, Mercy?

44
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,010
是的  父亲
Yes, father.

45
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,790
相信我不会伤害你  对吗
That I would do nothing to hurt you?

46
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,120
当然
Well, of course.

47
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,560
父亲  父亲
Father. Father.

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,110
我要清除你体内每一片不洁的灵魂...
I cast you out, every unclean spirit...

49
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,760
每一点魔鬼的力量...
every satanic power...

50
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,650
不要  我求你
Please! I beseech you!

51
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,690
每一次
Every onslaught

52
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,300
邪恶敌人的猛攻...
of the infernal adversary...

53
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,170
以我主基督之手  以我主基督之名
In the name and in the power of our Lord Jesus.

54
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,810
你才是真正疯了
It's you that's been driven to madness!

55
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,720
是巫术
Malleus maleficarum.

56
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,050
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

57
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,020
*鼓鸣震天*
*Witch drums*

58
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,600
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

59
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,800
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

60
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,010
*鼓鸣震天*
*The witch drums*

61
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,610
*宁入地狱*
*Better pray for hell*

62
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:43,540
*不留人间*
*Not hallelujah*

63
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,120
{\an8} 《塞勒姆》  第一季第四集

64
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:34,990
早上好
Good morning.

65
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,950
刚来的那艘船上有我的一个包裹
I, uh, am here to collect a parcel incoming on that vessel.

66
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,650
流感爆发了
Influenza outbreak.

67
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,980
死了五个人
Five dead.

68
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,890
那艘船被隔离了
Frigate's under quarantine.

69
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,900
隔离
Quarantine?

70
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,600
谁下的令
By whose order?

71
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,790
乔治·西布里
George Sibley.

72
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,690
是他妻子玛丽·西布里代为下令的
By way of his wife, Mary Sibley.

73
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,160
你们男人会渴望
Does a man desire

74
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,340
知道自己什么时候会归天吗
to know when he is on the precipice of his own death?

75
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,940
乔治  你说...
What say you, George?

76
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,540
你那个铁匠朋友
Would your friend, the blacksmith,

77
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,840
会想知道还有多久
want to know that scant hours from now,

78
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,230
梅西·路易丝就会控告他巫师罪吗
Mercy Lewis will accuse him of witchcraft?

79
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,740
然后他的审判和处决就将接踵而来
From which his trial and execution will swiftly follow?

80
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,910
还是他更想
Or would he favor

81
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,000
毫不知情地度过这所剩无多的时间
his waning moments be spent in ignorance?

82
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,970
别为他难过  乔治
Oh, don't pity him, George.

83
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,880
正是你这些无辜朋友的血
It is the blood of innocents like your friend

84
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,980
才让我们的大祭典成为可能
that make our grand rite possible.

85
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,660
每一次控告和审判
Each accusation made,

86
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,250
都不是针对我们  而是由我们掌控的
each trial convened not for us, but by us.

87
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,590
没人会想到我们的计划
No one the wiser to our plan

88
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,540
也没人胆敢阻止我们的脚步
and nobody brave enough to stand in our way.

89
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,300
你想念他们  对吧
You miss them, don't you?

90
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,020
我小时候
When I was young,

91
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,060
一直认为他们都是坏人
I thought them horribly sensible people.

92
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,240
但现在...
Now...

93
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,780
塞勒姆缺的正是他们
Salem could use more like them.

94
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,020
抱歉打扰了  上尉
I'm intruding, captain.

95
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,450
不  不
No, no.

96
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,660
很高兴你还活着
I'm glad you're amongst the living...

97
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,270
恕我直言
So to speak.

98
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,670
我听说你病的不轻
Word was you had taken quite ill.

99
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,690
确实如此
Indeed.

100
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,200
不知为何  我突然就发作了
A fit that came on suddenly and without reason,

101
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,150
睡也睡不安稳
followed by a restless sleep

102
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,210
那疾病似乎感染了我的梦境
in which the sickness infected even my dreams.

103
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,620
你的梦境
Your dreams?

104
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,220
我梦到一只没有眼白的玩偶
I dreamt of a doll with eyes full and black.

105
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,860
我半夜醒来  浑身高热
And when I awoke, feverish in the night's middle,

106
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,560
我发誓那只玩偶也在那盯着我
I could have sworn the doll was there, staring back at me.

107
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,470
高热会使你产生幻觉
Fever dreams can be quite vivid.

108
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,490
但我发誓
Except I could have sworn

109
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,430
我看到我父亲走入了黑暗之中
that I saw my father enter in darkness

110
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,090
拿走了那只玩偶
and remove the doll.

111
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,690
但只要我一提起  他就笑着跟我说...
But when I asked, he laughed and assured me that...

112
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,650
你是在做梦
You were dreaming.

113
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,790
你也觉得不可信对吗  奥登上尉
Do you doubt my father's veracity, Captain Alden?

114
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,750
不
No.

115
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,620
但这似乎你是这么想的
But it seems like you do.

116
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,060
我...
I...

117
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,540
毫无疑问他是个好人
I have no doubt that he's a good man.

118
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,050
但最近...
But lately...

119
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,280
什么
What?

120
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,040
早知道你跟他在一起
Had I but known you were in such safe hands,

121
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,410
你母亲就不用那么担心了
I would have spared your mother her worry.

122
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,420
治安官
Magistrate.

123
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,580
走吧  安
Come along, Anne.

124
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,820
不要打扰奥登上尉了
Let us allow captain Alden his privacy.

125
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,780
我没听错吧
Have I heard you correctly?

126
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,070
你是说安·霍尔是受害者  她被...
Are you suggesting that Anne Hale is the victim of...

127
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,230
下咒了
A spell.

128
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,570
我也被下咒了吗
Am I, too, the victim of a spell?

129
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,670
还是约翰·奥登终于相信有巫师存在了
Or has John Alden finally declared his belief in witches?

130
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,090
我亲眼所见太多证据  无法否认了
I've seen too much to deny any longer,

131
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,210
所以很明显我下一步...要抓一个巫师
making my next step obvious...catching one.

132
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,400
你也知道  抓捕巫师不是件容易的事
As you know, apprehending a witch is no easy feat.

133
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,510
只要知道他们是谁就不难
Unless you know who they are.

134
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,610
你找到给安下咒的巫师了吗
Have you uncovered the conjurer who spelled Anne?

135
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,330
是谁
Who is it?

136
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,860
告诉我
Tell me.

137
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,350
一个与受害者很亲近的人
Someone in proximity to his victim.

138
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,270
对
Yes.

139
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,610
他自己的女儿也说出了自己的怀疑
Whose own daughter voices her suspicions.

140
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,240
霍尔治安官吗
Magistrate Hale?

141
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,320
他不是大家所想的那样
He's not who he seems.

142
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,950
我们之中谁是
Who amongst us is?

143
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,030
你吗
You?

144
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,410
还是我
Or I?

145
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,290
我们当中谁没有
Who among us is unburdened by shame

146
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,170
不为人知的耻辱或者秘密
or secrets that we hide from the world?

147
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,900
我是麦哲牧师
I'm Reverend Mather.

148
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,420
你有问题吗
Is there a problem?

149
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,760
没有
Well, no.

150
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,750
这位女士刚跟我谈生意呢
The lady and I were just discussing some business.

151
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,500
-生意  -对
- Business? - Yes.

152
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,110
比如我要花多少钱才能...
As in how much it might cost me to get down to some...

153
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,090
这里是个受人尊敬的地方
This is a reputable establishment!

154
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,810
不许你在这里纵欲淫荡
It offers no place for your lechery.

155
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,920
-牧师  -牧师
- Reverend. - Reverend.

156
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,970
柯顿
Cotton!

157
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,060
不好意思
Pardon me.

158
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,440
如有冒犯  我在此道歉
I apologize if I've caused any offense.

159
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,250
日安
Good day.

160
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,410
你认识那人吗
Do you know that man?

161
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,930
从未见过
Never seen him before.

162
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,770
玫瑰花环
Ring around the rosies

163
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,470
花束千万
Pocketful of posies

164
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,260
灰烬飘落
Ashes, ashes

165
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,630
人死归天
We all fall down

166
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
不错
Ah, Yeah.

167
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,400
她来了
She has arrived.

168
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,360
梅西
Mercy.

169
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,230
亲爱的  真是上帝保佑
My dear, this is a blessing.

170
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,180
确实
Truly.

171
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,690
她终于有机会再次呼吸秋天的新鲜空气了
And she is again well enough to breathe the fall air.

172
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,080
曾经越是理所当然之事
Our deepest gratitude is often saved

173
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,390
才越需要我们无尽的感激
for what we once took for granted.

174
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,030
梅西
Mercy?

175
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,330
-怎么了  -不
- What is it? - No.

176
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,410
孩子  不要  不要
No, my child. No. No.

177
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,500
巫师
The witch!!

178
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,870
巫师是谁  梅西
Who's the witch, Mercy?

179
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,920
告诉我们  谁是巫师
Tell us! Who's the witch?!

180
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,790
他是巫师吗  梅西
Is he the witch, Mercy?

181
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,050
是他吗
Is he?

182
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,060
梅西
Mercy?

183
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,420
梅西
Mercy!

184
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,800
快来帮忙
Help!

185
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,010
快来人帮忙
Will someone help us?!

186
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,320
怎么回事
What's happened?

187
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,090
我们失去控制了
We've lost control.

188
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,790
她不再是我们的人了
She is no longer ours.

189
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,090
大家躁动不安
The hive is restless.

190
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,440
有人甚至开始怀疑你的计划是否利于我们
Some are beginning to doubt your grand vision for our kind.

191
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,340
是谁  告诉我名字
Who? Give me their names.

192
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,980
这不是重点  孩子
You're missing the point, child.

193
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,210
那他也许该告诉我重点
Then perhaps he should make one.

194
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,100
审判是以指控为前提的
Trials are preceded by accusations.

195
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,490
而指控是否成功则取决于你对那女孩的控制
And accusations are predicated upon your control of the girl.

196
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,200
狩猎月很快就要到了
The hunter's moon fast approaches.

197
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,440
而那个铁匠
Yet the blacksmith

198
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,290
还在尽情兜售自己的铁器
still blithely peddles his wares,

199
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,060
他应该为我们的事业牺牲
his blood lost to our cause.

200
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,620
岂有此理
How dare you.

201
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,370
玛丽未加入之前
Before Mary,

202
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,850
不是众人怕我们  而是我们担惊受怕
we were not feared, but fearful,

203
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,680
我们不是猎人  而是猎物
not hunters, but prey.

204
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,480
可她的力量和计划得到你的一点赞扬了吗
And yet does her strength and vision garner your praise?

205
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,450
没有
No.

206
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,050
只有你的怀疑
Only your doubt.

207
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,840
那个女孩只是因为身体状况而日趋虚弱
The girl has been rendered frail by her circumstance.

208
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,800
仅此而已
Nothing more.

209
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,680
我对她的控制没有问题
My mastery is not of issue.

210
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,110
这是你的保证吗
This is an assurance?

211
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,020
她只是需要休息一段时间
She needs but a moment of rest.

212
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,630
之后  她就会恢复力量
After which, she will again be strong enough

213
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,930
去指认他人
to point the finger.

214
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,470
还有个问题没有解决...
Yet another issue remains...

215
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,020
约翰·奥登
That of John Alden.

216
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,440
他怎么了
What of him?

217
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,820
他明显在怀疑我
His suspicion of me is palpable.

218
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,820
如果她无法解除威胁
If she cannot abate his threat,

219
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:14,210
那我会亲自动手  这并无不妥吧
then I will be forced to do so myself -- as I see fit.

220
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,620
如果你想得到约翰·奥登的信任
Should you desire John Alden's trust,

221
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,910
我建议你想办法去自己争取
I would suggest you find a way to earn it.

222
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,800
至于  玛丽
And, Mary...

223
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,950
你的的目标指引着我们
Your vision guides us.

224
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,720
我会向其他人报告
I will report to the others

225
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,900
你的计划将继续进行
that your plan shall resume anon.

226
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,390
我们需要尽快找到答案
We need answers quickly.

227
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,590
我们会找到的
And we will get them.

228
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,530
怎么找
How?

229
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,930
找到答案的最快方法
The quickest way one finds answers...

230
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,260
就是指责
blame.

231
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,810
你是想要抹杀我对你
Is it your intent to rob me

232
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,170
仅存的信心了吗  牧师
of my remaining faith in you, reverend?

233
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,010
西布里夫人  我没注意到您来了
Mrs. Sibley. I didn't hear you arrive.

234
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,540
你的职责  简单明了
Your charge, simple and clear,

235
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,230
就是要保护路易丝不再被恶魔附身
is to protect the Lewis girl from further possession.

236
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,970
然而  在集市里发生的那一幕
And yet...was the episode in the marketplace

237
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,200
不正表明这又重演了吗
not evidence of exactly that?

238
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,630
没有证据表明这是巫师所为
We have no proof it was the work of witches.

239
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,860
这么说你已经去看过她了
So you've paid her a visit, then?

240
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,670
你知道是什么在折磨她了吗
You've determined what ails her?

241
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,090
牧师说她正在休息
The pastor says she's resting

242
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,670
最好不被打扰
and best not be disturbed.

243
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,730
我能问你个问题吗  牧师
May I ask you a question, reverend?

244
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,680
你的父亲搜寻魔鬼之时  他请求许可了吗
When your father seeks out demons, does he ask permission?

245
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,600
他会礼貌敲门
Does he knock on doors

246
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,380
并答应等到方便的时候再来拜访吗
and offer to come back at a more convenient time?

247
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,030
还是他秉持着上帝的正义
Or does he, armed with the Lord's righteousness,

248
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,980
命令魔鬼给他回应
demand the demon answer to him?

249
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,230
父亲和我截然不同
My father and I are different men.

250
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,910
我们有不同的工作方式
We work in different ways.

251
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,820
当我传召猎人追捕巫师
When I summoned a hunter of witches

252
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,850
从而保护塞勒姆的人民时  我要找的人并不是你
to protect the people of Salem, it was not you I requested.

253
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,630
但来到这里的人却是你
Yet it was you who arrived on our shores.

254
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,050
别让我为自己的第二选择后悔
Do not make me regret settling for my second choice.

255
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,010
奥登上尉
Captain Alden.

256
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,220
真巧
How fortuitous.

257
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,490
我正打算把这个放在你的门阶上呢
I was just about to set this on your doorstep.

258
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,500
我就不卖关子了
I'll spare you the mystery.

259
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,680
明晚会为你举办一个招待会
It's a reception tomorrow evening in your honor.

260
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,080
招待会
A reception?

261
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,610
不  没有必要
No. That's not necessary.

262
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,100
已经定了  你现在是行政委员了
But it is. You're a selectman now.

263
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,360
出于私心  这也是修复我们关系的机会
And, on a more personal note, a chance to make amends

264
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,690
自打你回来  我表现得似乎不甚友好
for my less-than-hospitable behavior since your return.

265
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,340
你能确定出席吗
Can we trust you'll be in attendance?

266
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,090
不好意思  治安官
Excuse me, Magistrate.

267
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,530
霍克中尉
Lieutenant Hooke.

268
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,270
约翰·奥登
John Alden.

269
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,980
你就这么问候
Now, is this any way to greet the man

270
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,610
把你从野蛮人手里救出来的人吗
who saved you from those savages?

271
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,940
你来这里做什么
What the hell are you doing here?

272
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,500
做生意  上尉
Business, Captain.

273
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,900
港口有艘船  上面载有我的货物
There is a vessel in port on which I have cargo.

274
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,330
在检疫结束之前
And until the quarantine is lifted,

275
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,600
我是被困在这个巫师小镇了
I am marooned here in your little witch town.

276
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,760
我们说好的  再简单不过了
We had a deal, and it was a simple one...

277
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,580
我不想再见到你
that I was never to set eyes on you again.

278
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,430
没错  你不必担心
Yes. Well, you needn't worry.

279
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,550
我们都不再是打仗时的样子了
We're not the same men we were in the war.

280
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,590
不过
But...

281
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,710
你确实能行个方便让我早点离开
There is something you could do to hasten my departure.

282
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,710
什么事
What is that?

283
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:24,540
战时你提到的那个女孩  玛丽·沃科特
The girl you spoke of in battle... Mary Wolcott.

284
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,800
现在她是玛丽·西布里了  是吧
Although she's Mary Sibley now, isn't she?

285
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,030
如果将我引荐给她  一定能...
An introduction with her would certain...

286
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,490
你离玛丽远点
You stay away from Mary.

287
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,090
否则如何  约翰
Or what, John?

288
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,550
你会怎么做
What will you do?

289
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,500
做我上次就该做的事
What I should have done last time.

290
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,610
小心点  上尉
Now, careful, Captain.

291
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,910
一个人撂下狠话之前
Before a man makes threats,

292
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,240
应该先掂量所面临的风险
he should take stock of what he risks...

293
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,010
除非你不介意我告诉塞勒姆的人们
unless you do not mind me telling the good people of Salem

294
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,750
约翰·奥登到底是个什么样的人
just who John Alden really is...

295
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,910
他并非所标榜的铮铮男儿  更不是战斗英雄
neither the man nor the war hero he purports to be.

296
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,870
我要你尽快把生意了结了
I want you to finish your business with all due haste,

297
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:04,310
之后不管你坐车骑马或者乘船  我要你离开
and then by coach or by steed or by ship, I want you gone.

298
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,300
我向你保证
You have my word.

299
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,570
西布里先生的喂食
Mr. Sibley's feeding will have to wait

300
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,750
得等我从招待会上回来了
until I return from the reception.

301
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,530
不好意思
Excuse me.

302
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,780
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley.

303
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,860
你是哪位
And you are?

304
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,750
我是霍克  威廉·霍克
I'm Hooke... William Hooke.

305
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,400
原谅我的鲁莽   我只是在想
Forgive my boldness, but I wondered

306
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,580
或许可以和您谈谈滞留在港口的船只
if I might speak to you of your ship detained in port.

307
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,210
你多半也听说了  它得接受检疫
As you've doubtless heard, it's under quarantine.

308
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,250
不必麻烦了
Well, 'tis no bother.

309
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,330
我只想登船取回我的货物
I merely mean to board the vessel and retrieve my cargo.

310
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,520
冒着被感染甚至更严重的风险吗
And risk infection? Or worse?

311
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,590
那想必是很宝贵的货物了  霍克先生
Well, this must be very valuable cargo, Mr. Hooke.

312
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,680
抱歉
Sorry.

313
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,740
任何人不得登船
No one's permitted on board.

314
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:36,760
或许西布里先生
Well, perhaps Mr. Sibley

315
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,780
会更明理一些呢
will be more open to reason.

316
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,470
我能向你保证  霍克先生
I can assure you, Mr. Hooke,

317
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,970
我丈夫与我对所有事务的看法都是一致的
my husband and I are of one mind on all matters.

318
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,720
晚安
Good evening.

319
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,950
梅西  如果你能听见  我恳求你
Mercy, if you can hear me, I beseech you,

320
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,370
告诉我附身于你
speak to me the name

321
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,490
意欲报复的恶灵到底是谁
of the vengeful spirit that possesses you.

322
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,180
她经历的苦难还不够吗
Hasn't she suffered enough?

323
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,440
因此我才要想办法结束她的苦难
Which is why I seek to end her suffering...

324
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,130
将她从恶魔手中解救出来
by freeing her from the demon inside.

325
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,160
麦哲牧师
Reverend Mather?

326
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,910
龙牙草
Agrimony?

327
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,200
药剂师的主意
The...apothecary's suggestion.

328
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,420
没有药用价值的草药
A herb with no medicinal value.

329
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,480
-常用于驱魔术 -没错
- Used historically in exorcisms. - Mmm.

330
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,140
她醒了
She wakes.

331
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,130
梅西
Mercy?

332
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,080
能听到我说话吗
Can you hear me?

333
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,010
是的  牧师
Yes, reverend.

334
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,340
她看起来好多了
She looks well.

335
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,760
眼神清澈
Eyes clear.

336
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,790
体温也很正常
Skin temperate to the touch.

337
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,820
感谢上帝
Bless God.

338
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,420
天哪
My God.

339
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,010
这是怎么一回事
What is this?

340
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,480
理发师给她做了一次放血疗法
The Barber bled her humors.

341
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,540
她的伤口还没好
She hasn't sufficient time to heal.

342
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,580
安
Anne.

343
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,390
见到你真是意外之喜
What a lovely surprise.

344
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,360
我还以为今晚只有行政委员会出席呢
I anticipated only members of the board.

345
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,900
我说服了父亲让我来的
Oh, I convinced my father to let me attend.

346
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,390
如今在塞勒姆没有绞刑架和愤怒人群的集会
One can't pass up the rare gathering in Salem

347
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,100
可是越来越少了  我怎么会错过呢
that doesn't involve a noose and an angry mob.

348
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,330
-很漂亮吧  不是吗  -当然
- Beautiful, isn't it? - Mm.

349
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,720
是我父亲送的
A gift from my father.

350
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,760
我能看看吗
May I?

351
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,410
精美至极
Exquisite.

352
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,940
我先失陪一阵
If you'll excuse me...

353
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,180
我刚刚还在担心
And here I feared the guest of honor

354
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,900
咱们今晚宴会的主角不会到场呢
wasn't going to make an appearance at his own party.

355
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,300
我掷了个硬币
Well, I flipped a coin.

356
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,370
-正面朝上  我就待家里  -如果是背面呢
- Heads, I stay home. - And tails?

357
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,890
我会再扔一次  祈祷这一次是正面
I flip again and pray for heads.

358
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,030
可惜仍不走运
No such luck.

359
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,100
我想你会发现  或许你与这些委员会同伴们
Well, I think you'll find that you have more common ground

360
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,800
有比你想象中更多的共同之处
with your fellow board members than you would have expected.

361
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,000
难道他们也认为塞勒姆已经陷入疯狂了吗
Oh. They think salem's gone mad, too?

362
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,540
请随意  好吗
Enjoy yourself, huh?

363
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,910
奥登上尉
Captain Alden.

364
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,940
真高兴看到你还活着
How nice to see you amongst the living --

365
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,790
打个比方
so to speak.

366
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,870
缬草根
Valerian root?

367
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,400
你已经不择手段到使用猎人的那些粗劣工具了吗
You've resorted to the coarse tools of the hunters.

368
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,050
是的  很遗憾
Yes. Well, sadly,

369
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,390
如今我无法再置我至亲的安全而不顾
I can no longer take the safety of my loved ones for granted.

370
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,660
很明显  塞勒姆里有些人
Apparently, there are those in Salem

371
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,240
会品行低劣到对孩子下手
who are not above threatening the lives of children.

372
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,730
她可不是孩子  治安官
She's no child, magistrate.

373
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,260
至少
Certainly not,

374
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,920
从她对约翰·奥登的爱慕之意便可看出
judging by the way she lusts for John Alden.

375
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,980
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley.

376
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,520
我一有结果便立刻来通知您了
I came straightaway with news.

377
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,310
梅西·路易丝已经摆脱了她的控制者
Mercy Lewis is free of her possessor.

378
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,660
你确定
You're certain?

379
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:10,730
我的检查很详尽
My exam was thorough.

380
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,550
在她体内我再找不到一丝恶魔残留的证据
I could glean no remaining evidence of the demon inside.

381
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,310
那真是万幸啊
How serendipitous.

382
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,990
或许并不只是好运这么简单
Perhaps beyond good fortune.

383
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,440
这表示巫师的力量正在消退
This is evidence of the witches' waning strength

384
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,940
他们的恐惧正在加深
or waxing fear --

385
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,580
正说明我们的反抗行动起了作用
A testament to the potency of our resistance.

386
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,830
恕我无知  牧师
Forgive me, uh, Reverend,

387
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,100
对于这些事情我知之甚少
As I am but a layman in these matters,

388
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,800
但她又是如何逃出撒旦魔爪的呢
but how did she free herself from satan's grasp?

389
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,110
我发现了龙芽草的痕迹
I detected traces of agrimony,

390
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,290
还有那女孩腹部的一条伤口
as well as an incision in the girl's abdomen,

391
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,370
因此我推测一定是有人对她施行了驱魔术
leading to my supposition that an exorcism had been performed.

392
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:45,950
驱魔术
An exorcism?

393
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,080
在塞勒姆里有人进行着天主教的仪式
A catholic ritual performed in Salem,

394
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,430
你居然还胆敢声称这是好消息
and you have the audacity to present this as good news?

395
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,990
你知道在塞勒姆
Do you know what salem abhors

396
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,970
比巫师更令人憎恶的是什么吗  牧师
even more than a witch, Reverend?

397
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,080
那就是天主教徒
A catholic.

398
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,750
而如今在你的监视之下
Yet under your most watchful eye,

399
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,690
两种恶行却大行其道
you've now allowed both to flourish.

400
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,710
为什么会这样  牧师
When could this have happened, Reverend --

401
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,700
你是被酒精还是妓女给蒙蔽了理智
When you were distracted by drink or by whores?

402
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,170
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley --

403
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,250
用异教徒取代恶魔根本算不上胜利
Replacing demons with heathens is no victory.

404
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,880
看起来就算你成功解决了问题  牧师
Seems even when you succeed, reverend,

405
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,490
你仍能找到法子失败
you find a way to fail.

406
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,610
如今战争一触即发
We live in a time of war,

407
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,270
敌人就隐藏在我们身边
our enemies hidden among us.

408
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,390
此时此刻  我们正需要
And so there could be no better time than this

409
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,090
一位新的盟友加入
to welcome a new ally in our fight

410
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,280
来共同对抗威胁小镇的黑暗势力
against the dark forces that threaten our town.

411
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:42,330
在战争英雄面前  巫师不足为惧
Witches will be no match for a war hero.

412
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,660
欢迎我们行政委员会的最新成员
The newest member of our board of selectmen --

413
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,070
约翰·奥登上尉
Captain John Alden.

414
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,010
如果巫师并不是普通人呢
What if the witches were not the common folk?

415
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,640
不是以设陷阱为生的猎人  也不是助产的妇女
Not those who trapped our food nor birthed our babies?

416
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:07,000
如果巫师是那些得到我们信任的领导者呢
What if the witches were those we've entrusted to lead?

417
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,250
或许  是我们最尊贵的委员会成员之一
A member, perhaps, of our most esteemed board?

418
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,000
至少  我希望不是
Well, I hope not, 

419
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,700
因为如今  我也是你们的一员了
'cause I'm one of you now.

420
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,200
我相信  如果我们携手
And, together, I trust

421
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,270
定能终结侵蚀这个小镇的祸害
we will end the scourge that blights this town.

422
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,320
麦哲牧师
Reverend Mather.

423
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,250
我很抱歉  格里安娜
I'm sorry, Gloriana --

424
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,250
安布里小姐
Miss Embry --

425
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,020
但今天真是非常忙碌的一天
But it has been a very trying day,

426
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,200
而且我还未开始准备明天的布道
and I have not yet begun to prepare tomorrow's sermon.

427
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,550
我只是想谢谢你
I simply wish to thank you --

428
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,980
昨天在大庭广众之下
For showing me the depth of your care

429
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,930
让我看到了你的深切关心
yesterday in the public house.

430
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,590
也谢谢您  安布里小姐
And so you have, Miss Embry.

431
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,440
但我向您保证
Though I assure you that separating you

432
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,580
我赶走那缠着您的人渣仅仅出于道义
from that unsavory character was a mere act of charity.

433
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,950
道义
Charity?

434
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,010
以及怜悯
So, too, pity.

435
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,440
怜悯和道义
Pity and charity?

436
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,470
恐怕正是
I'm afraid.

437
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,930
与感觉无关吗
And it had nothing to do with feeling?

438
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:13,870
与我对上帝的
Not beyond the feeling 

439
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,250
所有苦难子民的感情无异
I possess for any of God's needy creatures...

440
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,770
就像对饥饿的孩子
A hungry child...

441
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,880
或是受伤的动物一样
A wounded animal.

442
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:20,870
对妓女也一样
A whore?

443
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,800
格里安...
Glori...

444
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:26,200
安布里小姐  你知道我憎恨那样的字眼
Miss Embry, you know I detest such words.

445
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,090
但在上帝面前
But in the house of the lord,

446
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,630
我们不能有所欺骗
There can be no deceit.

447
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,410
这不正是你一直在传播的吗
Isn't that what you preach?

448
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,640
妓女就是妓女
That a whore is a whore?

449
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,680
但我却不会用"怜悯"
Just as one would never say "Pity"

450
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,150
来掩饰"热情"
when they meant "Passion"...

451
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,970
用"道义"来粉饰"妒忌"
"Charity" When they meant "Envy."

452
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,740
妒忌
Envy?

453
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,440
就是当你看到其他男人亲吻我
At the thought of another man's mouth on mine,

454
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,970
躯体紧紧地贴着我
His body pressed against mine...

455
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,580
下体进入我体内时的那感觉
His loins enveloped in mine.

456
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,890
上帝啊  请原谅她的不敬
Lord, forgive her impiety.

457
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,650
这是你在我体内进出时
Is that the same lord that you invoke from my bed

458
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,630
在我床上呼唤的那位上帝吗
as you thrust in and out of me?

459
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:04,130
是我的唇舌在你胸口和股间游走时
The same lord that you thank

460
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,420
你感谢的那位上帝吗
as my tongue traces down your chest or up your thigh?

461
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,590
是我向他祈祷
That same lord to which I pray

462
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:13,150
你回来的许诺不再落空的那位上帝吗
that your promise to return will never be an empty one?

463
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,850
格里安娜  你不能待在这里
Gloriana, you mustn't be here.

464
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:15,830
否则如何
Or what?

465
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,290
在上帝的处所  你能怎么样
What will you do here... in the house of the lord?

466
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,040
柯顿  柯顿
Cot.. Cot...

467
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,170
不  别这样
No. Please.

468
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,840
西布里先生
Mr. Sibley.

469
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,830
我叫霍克  威廉·霍克
My name is Hooke... William Hooke.

470
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,260
您泊在港口的船上有我的货物
And I have cargo on your frigate detained in port.

471
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,370
可您夫人却拒绝解除隔离
Yet your wife refuses to lift the quarantine.

472
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,530
虽然  西布里夫人的美貌惊为天人
Now, whilst Mrs. Sibley's beauty is beyond dispute,

473
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:06,040
但哪能让女人来掌管男人的事业呢
What woman truly grasps the necessities of a man's vocation?

474
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,010
她们...
They...

475
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,380
先生
S-sir...

476
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,790
您已经病得又聋又哑了吗
Has your illness rendered you deaf and dumb?

477
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,870
我...
I...

478
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,840
{\an8}女巫

479
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,790
我对自己有点失望  上尉
I'm a bit upset with myself, captain.

480
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,470
何出此言
Why?

481
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,610
我邀请你来我家其实别有动机
I invited you to my home under false pretense.

482
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,320
我想赢得你的信任
In hoping to gain your trust,

483
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,790
很明显  这么做却起了相反的作用
I have clearly done the very opposite.

484
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,260
您到底想说什么  治安官
What's your point, magistrate?

485
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,750
也许直接告诉您真相
Perhaps it would have been wiser for me

486
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,370
以及我的真实身份  会更明智
to simply tell you the truth about who and what I am.

487
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,280
那是什么
And what's that?

488
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,630
一个忧心忡忡的父亲
A concerned father.

489
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:20,510
三天前  我女儿被下了咒
Three days ago, my daughter was spelled...

490
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,920
至少我相信是这样
or so I believe.

491
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,900
可她问起时...
And yet when she asked, you...

492
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,580
我说谎了  是的
I lied... yes.

493
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,670
我怎么能告诉她
How could I let her know that there are those out there

494
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,360
外面有人想伤害她
who wish to do her harm?

495
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,980
你也看到他们是怎么对路易丝的
You see what they've done to the Lewis girl,

496
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,780
她已经疯了
Her mind no longer her own.

497
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,810
如果我的安就是他们的下一个目标怎么办
What if my Anne is their next target?

498
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,190
你我有着共同的敌人
You and I have a common enemy...

499
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:44,310
那些会伤害安和我们所有人的女巫
The witches who would do my Anne and all of us harm.

500
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,750
那她们到底是谁
And who are they?

501
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,490
这仍是个谜团
This remains a mystery.

502
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,810
我必须承认
I must admit, uh...

503
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,920
我低估你了
I underestimated you.

504
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,130
谢谢
Well, thank you.

505
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,360
你比我想象得还更人渣
You are full of far more shit than I thought possible.

506
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,490
也许你没对安下咒
Maybe you did not spell Anne.

507
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,870
也许你的解释很诚恳
Maybe your explanations have been genuine.

508
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,180
但我不信
But I don't think so.

509
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,250
我觉得你不是好人
I think you're dirty.

510
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,490
一旦我找到证据  整个塞勒姆也会这么想的
And once I find proof, all of Salem will, too.

511
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,850
他对你提了要求  却完全没有躁动的迹象
He requested you, yet shows no signs of agitation.

512
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,310
会变的
That will change.

513
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,580
擅闯民居
Breaking into my home?

514
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,550
你知道在塞勒姆  小偷会有什么下场吗
Do you know what happens to thieves in Salem?

515
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:27,790
不知道
No.

516
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,280
但我知道女巫会有什么下场
But I know what happens to witches.

517
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:35,660
{\an8}女巫

518
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,050
这是什么
What's this?

519
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,730
也许这问题最好由西布里先生来回答
Perhaps a question best asked of Mr. Sibley.

520
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,210
我丈夫遭受的病痛
My husband's affliction

521
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,840
已经剥夺了他的理智和感觉
Has robbed him of both reason and sense.

522
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,680
而这恰是要管理塞勒姆
And yet are either actually required

523
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,450
最需要的两样东西
to point the finger in Salem?

524
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,430
我可不怕威胁  霍克先生
I care not for threats, Mr. Hooke.

525
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,300
我也没打算威胁你
And I care not to resort to them.

526
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,900
也许  我们可以避免
So, perhaps, we could avoid bringing this note

527
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,560
将这字条提交给行政委员会
to the attention of the board of selectmen.

528
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,360
所以要么同意你登我的船
Grant you access to my ship,

529
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,770
要么面对你最无耻的指控是吗
or face your most scurrilous accusations?

530
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,820
好
Fine.

531
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:24,010
半夜时分轮船的守卫会回家
At midnight, the ship's sentry will be sent home,

532
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,080
你可以去拿回你的货
and you can retrieve your cargo.

533
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,980
现在给我滚
Now out with you.

534
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,450
我的灵感出错了吗
Does my sense betray me?

535
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,380
他能破坏你的计划  我们的计划
He could undo you! All of us!

536
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,040
梅西也可以
And so could Mercy.

537
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,110
灵兽从她身上脱离了
The familiar has been cut from her.

538
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,510
怎么会
How?

539
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,030
通过驱魔术
An exorcism --

540
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,960
毫无疑问是她的傻瓜父亲干的
performed by her dolt of a father, no doubt.

541
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,200
我们必须用新的代替
So we must replace it.

542
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,540
如今她怎么会再次接受呢
And yet why would she accept it a second time?

543
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,660
她不会
She wouldn't,

544
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,590
除非我们能触动
unless there is some part of the girl

545
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,200
那个女孩的某种情感
to which we can appeal.

546
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,510
哪种情感
And what part is that?

547
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,850
就是你曾经触动过我的那个部分
The same part you once touched in me --

548
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:12,370
她内心深处对更好的生活的小小憧憬
the deep, small piece of her that longs for a better life.

549
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,800
那你得快点行动
You must move quickly, then.

550
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,330
我会一个人对付霍克先生
I, alone, will take charge of Mr. Hooke.

551
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,660
但是缇图芭
But, Tituba...

552
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,180
如今事态严峻
These are perilous times.

553
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,400
千万不能让任何人抓着我们的把柄
No blood must lead back to our door.

554
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,430
明白吗
Do you understand?

555
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,580
完全了解
Perfectly.

556
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,160
要是我早知道你是约翰·奥登的朋友
Had I known you were a friend of John Alden's,

557
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,530
我会另找其他送货员
I would have found another courier.

558
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,430
我向你担保我们不是朋友
I can assure you, we are not friends.

559
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:47,860
你要是知道那人的真面目
If you knew the truth of the man,

560
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,920
你这么谴责我之前就会三思了
You would rethink such an accusation.

561
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,640
什么真面目
And what truth is that?

562
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,960
无论如何
In any case, 

563
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,800
阻碍已除
the impediment has been removed.

564
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,500
半夜包裹就是你的了
The package shall be yours by midnight.

565
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,200
你没有向她透露我的名字吧
You did not speak my name to her?

566
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,240
我遵嘱行事
I did as instructed.

567
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:18,430
不过我还是禁不住在想  那个包裹
But, still, I can't help but wonder -- this parcel --

568
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:22,220
你已得到丰厚报酬  其他不必多想
You have been paid well not to wonder, 

569
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,110
霍克先生
Mr. Hooke.

570
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,230
梅西
Mercy.

571
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,210
离我远点
Leave me.

572
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,780
我不会离开的
I won't leave you.

573
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,360
我不能
I can't.

574
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,360
你需要我
You need me.

575
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,220
骗子
You're a liar.

576
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,830
我不需要你
I don't need you.

577
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,370
我附身于你的时候
When you resist me,

578
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,660
你指出一个仅你可见的魔鬼的时候
When you point at a demon that only you can see,

579
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,130
他们做了什么
What do they do?

580
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,670
他们剪去你的头发
They shave your locks.

581
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,820
为你可怜的灵魂哭泣
They weep for your wretched soul.

582
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,010
走开  快走开
Go away! Go!

583
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,100
没有我  你只是个
Without me, you are but a girl,

584
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,350
软弱又平凡的女孩
weak and ordinary.

585
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:17,120
但是让我附身于你
But with me inside you, you are...

586
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,600
你就会无所不能
omnipotent.

587
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,810
别哭了
Hush, now.

588
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,460
别给他们理由可怜你
Give them no cause to pity you.

589
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,340
让他们只能敬畏你
Give them only reason to fear you.

590
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,910
不  不要
No! No!

591
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,320
张嘴  孩子
Open, girl.

592
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,560
张嘴吧
Open your mouth.

593
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,410
这就对了
Yes.

594
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,500
就像那样
Just like that.

595
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:03,180
它选择了你成为它地球上的使者
He has chosen you to be his vessel on earth.

596
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,740
能为它服务
There is no greater honor 

597
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,650
是至高荣耀
than to be in his service.

598
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,680
怎么了  怎么了
What? What?

599
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,460
怎么回事  怎么回事
What? What? What?

600
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,890
她是我的
She is mine.

601
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,520
缇图芭
Tituba?

602
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,800
玛丽出事了
Mary is in trouble.

603
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,610
我只是个仆人  上尉
I am but a servant, captain,

604
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,980
没有权利如此冒犯
unentitled to such an intrusion.

605
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,580
到底是什么事
What is it?

606
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,000
恐怕您和我的女主人
I fear you and my mistress

607
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,180
有一个共同的敌人
share a common adversary --

608
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,000
霍克先生
Mr. Hooke.

609
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,310
你怎么知道他
How did you know that he --

610
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:54,140
我看见您在镇中心外的大杂院里和他争执
I saw you quarreling in the warren off the square.

611
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,160
他要求进入我女主人的船
He demands access to my mistress' ship.

612
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,270
为什么
Why?

613
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:01,230
是像他说的那样只为找个没有价值的包裹
To retrieve some worthless parcel, as he claims?

614
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:04,880
还是他包藏祸心
Or does he harbor darker intent?

615
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,810
他计划打劫她
He plans to rob her.

616
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,390
我的女主人也如此担心
So my mistress fears.

617
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:11,400
西布里夫人为什么准许他登船呢
Why did Mrs. Sibley allow him to board that vessel?

618
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,750
她别无选择
He left her no choice.

619
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,610
他以散播关于我女主人
He threatened to spread false rumor of an affair --

620
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,830
和你有染的虚假消息来要挟  上尉
with you, captain.

621
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,750
她本想与他理论  但是
She sought to reason with him, but --

622
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,040
他并不是个讲理的人
He is not a man that responds to reason.

623
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,820
西布里夫人要是知道我找你一定会责骂我
Mrs. Sibley would lash me if she knew I had come,

624
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,170
但是我担心霍克先生会毁了她
but I fear Mr. Hooke will be her ruin.

625
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,700
除非
Unless --

626
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,500
说吧  姑娘
Speak, girl.

627
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:37,610
除非有人能阻止他
Unless there be a man who desires to stop him.

628
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,600
{\an8}乔治·西布里

629
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,000
{\an8}包裹4769

630
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,140
你喜欢他  是吗
You have feelings for him, don't you?

631
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,640
他是谁
"Him"?

632
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,160
一定要我说出他的名字吗
Must I say his name?

633
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:59,450
这对今晚所有在场的人来说不是显而易见吗
Was it not obvious to all who were present this evening?

634
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,490
这不是一个女人应有的特权吗
Is it not a woman's prerogative

635
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,600
选择自己喜欢的男人
to choose which man she fancies?

636
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,850
是没错
It is.

637
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:08,520
就像这也是父亲的特权
Just as it is a father's prerogative

638
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,470
去保护他女儿的心
to protect his daughter's heart

639
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,410
不被那些可能会伤害她的人接近
from those he feels will do it harm.

640
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:17,340
譬如约翰·奥登
John Alden, for instance.

641
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,150
你为什么要这么说
Why do you say this?

642
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,130
就因为他不像塞勒姆那些毛躁的
Because he doesn't curry your favor,

643
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,190
年轻人一样对你阿谀奉承吗
like every other twitchy young man in Salem?

644
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,220
不  这不是原因
No. That is not it.

645
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,810
他永远都是属于玛丽·西布里
How could he ever be yours truly

646
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,510
又怎能成为你的挚爱
when he always was and always will be Mary Sibley's?

647
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,240
他们的历史不是个秘密
Their history is no secret.

648
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,840
但也仅此而已  是个历史
But it is just that -- history.

649
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,600
她是个已婚的女人了
She is a married woman now.

650
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,860
你真的以为玛丽·西布里会站在一旁
And do you suppose Mary Sibley will idly stand by

651
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,920
看着你占据她认为属于自己
while you claim that which she rightfully considers

652
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,140
的东西吗
to be her own?

653
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,950
你怕她  父亲
You fear her, father. 

654
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,540
我不怕
I do not.

655
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,490
你只是个孩子  你不明白
You are but a child. You don't understand.

656
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,460
一个孩子
A child?

657
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,420
不久前  你还同意我是个女人
A moment ago, you agreed I was a woman.

658
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,210
这没什么可争论的
It's not for debate.

659
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,670
-到底谁说了算  -我说了算
- By whose command? - By mine!

660
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:00,850
你的父亲
Your father!

661
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,380
你的所有者和主人
Your lord and master!

662
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,790
我禁止你与奥登上尉今后再有任何来往
I forbid you to have further contact with captain Alden!

663
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:05,760
不然呢
Or what?

664
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,020
我会受到怎样的惩罚
What punishment awaits me?

665
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,510
你会夺走我的生命吗  就像你对敌人一般
Will you crush the life from me, as you do your enemies?

666
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,060
或者仅仅是我的灵魂
Or just my spirit,

667
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,060
像你对所爱之人做的一样
as you do those you love?

668
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,890
闭嘴
Quiet! 

669
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,040
不准再说了
Not one word more!

670
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,220
把那放下
Put it down.

671
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,150
不
No.

672
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,560
这个箱子属于我
This parcel belongs to me.

673
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,070
这权利连玛丽·西布里也无法夺走
A claim that even Mary Sibley cannot dispute.

674
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,680
我不是代表她来的
I'm not here on her behalf.

675
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,230
现在  把它放下
Now put it down.

676
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:57,680
问问你自己  上尉
Ask yourself, captain...

677
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,580
这真的值得吗
Is it really worth it?

678
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,840
什么
What?

679
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,820
解决老恩怨的代价
The cost of settling old scores.

680
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,900
如果被治安官发现你所做的事情
What would be the charge

681
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,970
你觉得会被判什么罪
if the magistrate knew what you did?

682
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,340
谋杀
Murder?

683
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,040
叛国
Treason?

684
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:12,510
二者皆有
Both?

685
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,780
你知道那天发生了什么
You know what happened that day.

686
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,080
是的
Yes.

687
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,380
我看着你泼洒无辜的鲜血
I watched you spill innocent blood.

688
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,900
没有一丝后悔与怜悯
Without regret or remorse.

689
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,550
多少人像畜牲一般被屠杀
Men slaughtered like animals.

690
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,770
所有人  都死了
All of them -- dead.

691
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,570
不是所有人
Not all of them.

692
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,560
我们有过交易  霍克先生
We had a deal, Mr. Hooke --

693
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,580
那天你跪在地上求饶
The day you fell to your knees and begged for your life

694
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,150
说如果我放你一条生路
that should I let you live,

695
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,900
你将不会再出现在我面前
we would never cross paths again.

696
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,990
你没有遵守约定
You didn't hold up your end.

697
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,690
好好想清楚  上尉
Now, think this through, captain.

698
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,950
我当然有
Oh, I have --

699
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,250
很详细地想过
thoroughly.

700
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:57,940
那天我唯一后悔的就是没有赶尽杀绝
And the only life I lament that day was the one I spared.

701
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,320
你该遵守约定的  霍克先生
A man should keep his promises, Mr. Hooke.

702
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,860
所以  你打算在这里割了我的喉
So you're...just going to slit my throat here,

703
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,930
像那些印第安野蛮人一样
like some yellow horse?

704
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,960
不
No.

705
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,310
不
No.

706
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,590
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley.

707
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,800
看来今晚大家似乎都为失眠而困扰
Sleeplessness seems to be epidemic this evening.

708
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,080
你还记得
Do you remember 

709
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,690
我们上一次
the last time we spoke,

710
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,760
在墓地阴影中的谈话吗
in the shadow of the graveyard?

711
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,530
当然记得
Of course.

712
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,160
我们做出的约定
The promises we made?

713
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,740
你会在一年内回来

而你将屏息等待

715
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,800
那些都是谎言吗
Were they lies?

716
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:53,930
不是
No.

717
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,300
这些是愿望

718

不谙世事的人许下的愿望

719

现在呢

720

我们明白了

很晚了  上尉

是很晚了
It is.

725
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,070
我就寝时间早过了
Long past my bedtime.

726
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,740
祝你好梦  玛丽
I wish you sweet dreams, Mary.

727

或许这已经是一场美梦了
Perhaps they've already begun.

728
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:10,410
我知道你是什么东西
I know what you are.

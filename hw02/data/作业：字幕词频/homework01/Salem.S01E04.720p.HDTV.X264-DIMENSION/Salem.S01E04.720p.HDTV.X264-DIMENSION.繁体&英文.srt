00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,710
《塞勒姆》前情提要
Previously on "Salem"

15
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,870
感謝你多年來對我們的英勇守護
We all welcome Captain Alden home

16
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,150
歡迎回家  奧登上尉
from his long, long service.

17
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,160
你回來的目的只有一個
You come back for one thing and one thing only.

18
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,430
如今她可是瑪麗·西布里
She's Mary Sibley now.

19
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,080
我一直在等著你
I waited for you.

20
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,310
年復一年  你卻杳無音訊
Years and years without a word.

21
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,400
我被俘虜了
I was captured.

22
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,940
或許我們可以忘了塞勒姆和這些巫師們
If we could forget Salem and its witches.

23
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,370
去過不同的生活
If we could have a different life.

24
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,480
她不能呼吸了
She can't breathe!

25
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,570
求求你  住手吧
Make it stop.

26
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,610
求你放過我女兒
Please. My daughter.

27
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,550
我們稱此為魔鬼侵襲...
We call it a spectral attack --

28
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,070
是巫師所為
The work of witches.

29
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,500
為她祈禱吧
Pray for her.

30
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,980
圣子在命令你...[拉丁文]
Imperat tibi Deus Filius...

31
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:57,320
圣靈在命令你...[拉丁文]
Imperat tibi Deus Spiritus Sanctus...

32
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,310
造物之主耶穌...[拉丁文]
Imperat tibi majestas Christi...

33
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,490
住手
You must stop this.

34
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,400
基督命令你...[拉丁文]
aeternum Dei Verbum caro factum...

35
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,760
圣十字架命令你...[拉丁文]
Imperat sacramentum crucis...

36
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,720
要是他們知道了  你會被絞死的
They will hang you if they learn of this.

37
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,170
巫師們已經奪走了你的人生
The witches have already taken your life.

38
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,200
我不怕那些清教徒會怎么對我
I no longer fear the puritans claiming mine.

39
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,950
你體內那污穢的靈魂必須被驅逐
The wretched spirit that inhabits you must be excised.

40
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,760
不然你知道會有什么下場嗎
Or else what becomes of you?

41
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,770
發瘋
Hmm? Madness?

42
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,890
死亡
Death?

43
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,690
你相信我嗎  梅西
Do you trust me, Mercy?

44
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,010
是的  父親
Yes, father.

45
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,790
相信我不會傷害你  對嗎
That I would do nothing to hurt you?

46
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,120
當然
Well, of course.

47
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,560
父親  父親
Father. Father.

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,110
我要清除你體內每一片不潔的靈魂...
I cast you out, every unclean spirit...

49
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,760
每一點魔鬼的力量...
every satanic power...

50
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,650
不要  我求你
Please! I beseech you!

51
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,690
每一次
Every onslaught

52
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,300
邪惡敵人的猛攻...
of the infernal adversary...

53
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,170
以我主基督之手  以我主基督之名
In the name and in the power of our Lord Jesus.

54
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,810
你才是真正瘋了
It's you that's been driven to madness!

55
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,720
是巫術
Malleus maleficarum.

56
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,050
*擂我戰鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

57
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,020
*鼓鳴震天*
*Witch drums*

58
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,600
*擂我戰鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

59
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,800
*擂我戰鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

60
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,010
*鼓鳴震天*
*The witch drums*

61
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,610
*寧入地獄*
*Better pray for hell*

62
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:43,540
*不留人間*
*Not hallelujah*

63

{\an8} 《塞勒姆》  第一季第四集

64
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:34,990
早上好
Good morning.

65
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,950
剛來的那艘船上有我的一個包裹
I, uh, am here to collect a parcel incoming on that vessel.

66
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,650
流感爆發了
Influenza outbreak.

67
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,980
死了五個人
Five dead.

68
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,890
那艘船被隔離了
Frigate's under quarantine.

69
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,900
隔離
Quarantine?

70
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,600
誰下的令
By whose order?

71
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,790
喬治·西布里
George Sibley.

72
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,690
是他妻子瑪麗·西布里代為下令的
By way of his wife, Mary Sibley.

73
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,160
你們男人會渴望
Does a man desire

74
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,340
知道自己什么時候會歸天嗎
to know when he is on the precipice of his own death?

75
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,940
喬治  你說...
What say you, George?

76
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,540
你那個鐵匠朋友
Would your friend, the blacksmith,

77
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,840
會想知道還有多久
want to know that scant hours from now,

78
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,230
梅西·路易絲就會控告他巫師罪嗎
Mercy Lewis will accuse him of witchcraft?

79
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,740
然后他的審判和處決就將接踵而來
From which his trial and execution will swiftly follow?

80
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,910
還是他更想
Or would he favor

81
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,000
毫不知情地度過這所剩無多的時間
his waning moments be spent in ignorance?

82
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,970
別為他難過  喬治
Oh, don't pity him, George.

83
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,880
正是你這些無辜朋友的血
It is the blood of innocents like your friend

84
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,980
才讓我們的大祭典成為可能
that make our grand rite possible.

85
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,660
每一次控告和審判
Each accusation made,

86
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,250
都不是針對我們  而是由我們掌控的
each trial convened not for us, but by us.

87
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,590
沒人會想到我們的計劃
No one the wiser to our plan

88
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,540
也沒人膽敢阻止我們的腳步
and nobody brave enough to stand in our way.

89
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,300
你想念他們  對吧
You miss them, don't you?

90
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,020
我小時候
When I was young,

91
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,060
一直認為他們都是壞人
I thought them horribly sensible people.

92
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,240
但現在...
Now...

93
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,780
塞勒姆缺的正是他們
Salem could use more like them.

94
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,020
抱歉打擾了  上尉
I'm intruding, captain.

95
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,450
不  不
No, no.

96
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,660
很高興你還活著
I'm glad you're amongst the living...

97
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,270
恕我直言
So to speak.

98
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,670
我聽說你病的不輕
Word was you had taken quite ill.

99
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,690
確實如此
Indeed.

100
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,200
不知為何  我突然就發作了
A fit that came on suddenly and without reason,

101
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,150
睡也睡不安穩
followed by a restless sleep

102
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,210
那疾病似乎感染了我的夢境
in which the sickness infected even my dreams.

103
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,620
你的夢境
Your dreams?

104
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,220
我夢到一只沒有眼白的玩偶
I dreamt of a doll with eyes full and black.

105
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,860
我半夜醒來  渾身高熱
And when I awoke, feverish in the night's middle,

106
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,560
我發誓那只玩偶也在那盯著我
I could have sworn the doll was there, staring back at me.

107
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,470
高熱會使你產生幻覺
Fever dreams can be quite vivid.

108
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,490
但我發誓
Except I could have sworn

109
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,430
我看到我父親走入了黑暗之中
that I saw my father enter in darkness

110
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,090
拿走了那只玩偶
and remove the doll.

111
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,690
但只要我一提起  他就笑著跟我說...
But when I asked, he laughed and assured me that...

112
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,650
你是在做夢
You were dreaming.

113
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,790
你也覺得不可信對嗎  奧登上尉
Do you doubt my father's veracity, Captain Alden?

114
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,750
不
No.

115
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,620
但這似乎你是這么想的
But it seems like you do.

116
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,060
我...
I...

117
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,540
毫無疑問他是個好人
I have no doubt that he's a good man.

118
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,050
但最近...
But lately...

119
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,280
什么
What?

120
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,040
早知道你跟他在一起
Had I but known you were in such safe hands,

121
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,410
你母親就不用那么擔心了
I would have spared your mother her worry.

122
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,420
治安官
Magistrate.

123
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,580
走吧  安
Come along, Anne.

124
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,820
不要打擾奧登上尉了
Let us allow captain Alden his privacy.

125
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,780
我沒聽錯吧
Have I heard you correctly?

126
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,070
你是說安·霍爾是受害者  她被...
Are you suggesting that Anne Hale is the victim of...

127
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,230
下咒了
A spell.

128
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,570
我也被下咒了嗎
Am I, too, the victim of a spell?

129
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,670
還是約翰·奧登終于相信有巫師存在了
Or has John Alden finally declared his belief in witches?

130
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,090
我親眼所見太多證據  無法否認了
I've seen too much to deny any longer,

131
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,210
所以很明顯我下一步...要抓一個巫師
making my next step obvious...catching one.

132
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,400
你也知道  抓捕巫師不是件容易的事
As you know, apprehending a witch is no easy feat.

133
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,510
只要知道他們是誰就不難
Unless you know who they are.

134
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,610
你找到給安下咒的巫師了嗎
Have you uncovered the conjurer who spelled Anne?

135
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,330
是誰
Who is it?

136
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,860
告訴我
Tell me.

137
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,350
一個與受害者很親近的人
Someone in proximity to his victim.

138
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,270
對
Yes.

139
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,610
他自己的女兒也說出了自己的懷疑
Whose own daughter voices her suspicions.

140
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,240
霍爾治安官嗎
Magistrate Hale?

141
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,320
他不是大家所想的那樣
He's not who he seems.

142
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,950
我們之中誰是
Who amongst us is?

143
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,030
你嗎
You?

144
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,410
還是我
Or I?

145
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,290
我們當中誰沒有
Who among us is unburdened by shame

146
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,170
不為人知的恥辱或者秘密
or secrets that we hide from the world?

147
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,900
我是麥哲牧師
I'm Reverend Mather.

148
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,420
你有問題嗎
Is there a problem?

149
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,760
沒有
Well, no.

150
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,750
這位女士剛跟我談生意呢
The lady and I were just discussing some business.

151
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,500
-生意  -對
- Business? - Yes.

152
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,110
比如我要花多少錢才能...
As in how much it might cost me to get down to some...

153
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,090
這里是個受人尊敬的地方
This is a reputable establishment!

154
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,810
不許你在這里縱欲淫蕩
It offers no place for your lechery.

155
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,920
-牧師  -牧師
- Reverend. - Reverend.

156
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,970
柯頓
Cotton!

157
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,060
不好意思
Pardon me.

158
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,440
如有冒犯  我在此道歉
I apologize if I've caused any offense.

159
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,250
日安
Good day.

160
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,410
你認識那人嗎
Do you know that man?

161
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,930
從未見過
Never seen him before.

162
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,770
玫瑰花環
Ring around the rosies

163
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,470
花束千萬
Pocketful of posies

164
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,260
灰燼飄落
Ashes, ashes

165
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,630
人死歸天
We all fall down

166
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
不錯
Ah, Yeah.

167
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,400
她來了
She has arrived.

168
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,360
梅西
Mercy.

169
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,230
親愛的  真是上帝保佑
My dear, this is a blessing.

170
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,180
確實
Truly.

171
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,690
她終于有機會再次呼吸秋天的新鮮空氣了
And she is again well enough to breathe the fall air.

172
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,080
曾經越是理所當然之事
Our deepest gratitude is often saved

173
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,390
才越需要我們無盡的感激
for what we once took for granted.

174
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,030
梅西
Mercy?

175
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,330
-怎么了  -不
- What is it? - No.

176
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,410
孩子  不要  不要
No, my child. No. No.

177
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,500
巫師
The witch!!

178
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,870
巫師是誰  梅西
Who's the witch, Mercy?

179
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,920
告訴我們  誰是巫師
Tell us! Who's the witch?!

180
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,790
他是巫師嗎  梅西
Is he the witch, Mercy?

181
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,050
是他嗎
Is he?

182
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,060
梅西
Mercy?

183
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,420
梅西
Mercy!

184
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,800
快來幫忙
Help!

185
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,010
快來人幫忙
Will someone help us?!

186
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,320
怎么回事
What's happened?

187
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,090
我們失去控制了
We've lost control.

188
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,790
她不再是我們的人了
She is no longer ours.

189
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,090
大家躁動不安
The hive is restless.

190
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,440
有人甚至開始懷疑你的計劃是否利于我們
Some are beginning to doubt your grand vision for our kind.

191
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,340
是誰  告訴我名字
Who? Give me their names.

192
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,980
這不是重點  孩子
You're missing the point, child.

193
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,210
那他也許該告訴我重點
Then perhaps he should make one.

194
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,100
審判是以指控為前提的
Trials are preceded by accusations.

195
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,490
而指控是否成功則取決于你對那女孩的控制
And accusations are predicated upon your control of the girl.

196
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,200
狩獵月很快就要到了
The hunter's moon fast approaches.

197
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,440
而那個鐵匠
Yet the blacksmith

198
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,290
還在盡情兜售自己的鐵器
still blithely peddles his wares,

199
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,060
他應該為我們的事業犧牲
his blood lost to our cause.

200
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,620
豈有此理
How dare you.

201
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,370
瑪麗未加入之前
Before Mary,

202
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,850
不是眾人怕我們  而是我們擔驚受怕
we were not feared, but fearful,

203
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,680
我們不是獵人  而是獵物
not hunters, but prey.

204
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,480
可她的力量和計劃得到你的一點贊揚了嗎
And yet does her strength and vision garner your praise?

205
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,450
沒有
No.

206
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,050
只有你的懷疑
Only your doubt.

207
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,840
那個女孩只是因為身體狀況而日趨虛弱
The girl has been rendered frail by her circumstance.

208
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,800
僅此而已
Nothing more.

209
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,680
我對她的控制沒有問題
My mastery is not of issue.

210
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,110
這是你的保證嗎
This is an assurance?

211
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,020
她只是需要休息一段時間
She needs but a moment of rest.

212
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,630
之后  她就會恢復力量
After which, she will again be strong enough

213
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,930
去指認他人
to point the finger.

214
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,470
還有個問題沒有解決...
Yet another issue remains...

215
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,020
約翰·奧登
That of John Alden.

216
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,440
他怎么了
What of him?

217
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,820
他明顯在懷疑我
His suspicion of me is palpable.

218
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,820
如果她無法解除威脅
If she cannot abate his threat,

219
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:14,210
那我會親自動手  這并無不妥吧
then I will be forced to do so myself -- as I see fit.

220
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,620
如果你想得到約翰·奧登的信任
Should you desire John Alden's trust,

221
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,910
我建議你想辦法去自己爭取
I would suggest you find a way to earn it.

222
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,800
至于  瑪麗
And, Mary...

223
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,950
你的的目標指引著我們
Your vision guides us.

224
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,720
我會向其他人報告
I will report to the others

225
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,900
你的計劃將繼續進行
that your plan shall resume anon.

226
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,390
我們需要盡快找到答案
We need answers quickly.

227
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,590
我們會找到的
And we will get them.

228
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,530
怎么找
How?

229
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,930
找到答案的最快方法
The quickest way one finds answers...

230
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,260
就是指責
blame.

231
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,810
你是想要抹殺我對你
Is it your intent to rob me

232
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,170
僅存的信心了嗎  牧師
of my remaining faith in you, reverend?

233
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,010
西布里夫人  我沒注意到您來了
Mrs. Sibley. I didn't hear you arrive.

234
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,540
你的職責  簡單明了
Your charge, simple and clear,

235
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,230
就是要保護路易絲不再被惡魔附身
is to protect the Lewis girl from further possession.

236
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,970
然而  在集市里發生的那一幕
And yet...was the episode in the marketplace

237
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,200
不正表明這又重演了嗎
not evidence of exactly that?

238
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,630
沒有證據表明這是巫師所為
We have no proof it was the work of witches.

239
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,860
這么說你已經去看過她了
So you've paid her a visit, then?

240
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,670
你知道是什么在折磨她了嗎
You've determined what ails her?

241
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,090
牧師說她正在休息
The pastor says she's resting

242
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,670
最好不被打擾
and best not be disturbed.

243
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,730
我能問你個問題嗎  牧師
May I ask you a question, reverend?

244
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,680
你的父親搜尋魔鬼之時  他請求許可了嗎
When your father seeks out demons, does he ask permission?

245
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,600
他會禮貌敲門
Does he knock on doors

246
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,380
并答應等到方便的時候再來拜訪嗎
and offer to come back at a more convenient time?

247
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,030
還是他秉持著上帝的正義
Or does he, armed with the Lord's righteousness,

248
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,980
命令魔鬼給他回應
demand the demon answer to him?

249
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,230
父親和我截然不同
My father and I are different men.

250
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,910
我們有不同的工作方式
We work in different ways.

251
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,820
當我傳召獵人追捕巫師
When I summoned a hunter of witches

252
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,850
從而保護塞勒姆的人民時  我要找的人并不是你
to protect the people of Salem, it was not you I requested.

253
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,630
但來到這里的人卻是你
Yet it was you who arrived on our shores.

254
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,050
別讓我為自己的第二選擇后悔
Do not make me regret settling for my second choice.

255
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,010
奧登上尉
Captain Alden.

256
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,220
真巧
How fortuitous.

257
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,490
我正打算把這個放在你的門階上呢
I was just about to set this on your doorstep.

258
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,500
我就不賣關子了
I'll spare you the mystery.

259
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,680
明晚會為你舉辦一個招待會
It's a reception tomorrow evening in your honor.

260
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,080
招待會
A reception?

261
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,610
不  沒有必要
No. That's not necessary.

262
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,100
已經定了  你現在是行政委員了
But it is. You're a selectman now.

263
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,360
出于私心  這也是修復我們關系的機會
And, on a more personal note, a chance to make amends

264
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,690
自打你回來  我表現得似乎不甚友好
for my less-than-hospitable behavior since your return.

265
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,340
你能確定出席嗎
Can we trust you'll be in attendance?

266
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,090
不好意思  治安官
Excuse me, Magistrate.

267
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,530
霍克中尉
Lieutenant Hooke.

268
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,270
約翰·奧登
John Alden.

269
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,980
你就這么問候
Now, is this any way to greet the man

270
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,610
把你從野蠻人手里救出來的人嗎
who saved you from those savages?

271
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,940
你來這里做什么
What the hell are you doing here?

272
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,500
做生意  上尉
Business, Captain.

273
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,900
港口有艘船  上面載有我的貨物
There is a vessel in port on which I have cargo.

274
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,330
在檢疫結束之前
And until the quarantine is lifted,

275
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,600
我是被困在這個巫師小鎮了
I am marooned here in your little witch town.

276
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,760
我們說好的  再簡單不過了
We had a deal, and it was a simple one...

277
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,580
我不想再見到你
that I was never to set eyes on you again.

278
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,430
沒錯  你不必擔心
Yes. Well, you needn't worry.

279
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,550
我們都不再是打仗時的樣子了
We're not the same men we were in the war.

280
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,590
不過
But...

281
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,710
你確實能行個方便讓我早點離開
There is something you could do to hasten my departure.

282
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,710
什么事
What is that?

283
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:24,540
戰時你提到的那個女孩  瑪麗·沃科特
The girl you spoke of in battle... Mary Wolcott.

284
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,800
現在她是瑪麗·西布里了  是吧
Although she's Mary Sibley now, isn't she?

285
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,030
如果將我引薦給她  一定能...
An introduction with her would certain...

286
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,490
你離瑪麗遠點
You stay away from Mary.

287
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,090
否則如何  約翰
Or what, John?

288
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,550
你會怎么做
What will you do?

289
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,500
做我上次就該做的事
What I should have done last time.

290
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,610
小心點  上尉
Now, careful, Captain.

291
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,910
一個人撂下狠話之前
Before a man makes threats,

292
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,240
應該先掂量所面臨的風險
he should take stock of what he risks...

293
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,010
除非你不介意我告訴塞勒姆的人們
unless you do not mind me telling the good people of Salem

294
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,750
約翰·奧登到底是個什么樣的人
just who John Alden really is...

295
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,910
他并非所標榜的錚錚男兒  更不是戰斗英雄
neither the man nor the war hero he purports to be.

296
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,870
我要你盡快把生意了結了
I want you to finish your business with all due haste,

297
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:04,310
之后不管你坐車騎馬或者乘船  我要你離開
and then by coach or by steed or by ship, I want you gone.

298
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,300
我向你保證
You have my word.

299
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,570
西布里先生的喂食
Mr. Sibley's feeding will have to wait

300
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,750
得等我從招待會上回來了
until I return from the reception.

301
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,530
不好意思
Excuse me.

302
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,780
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley.

303
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,860
你是哪位
And you are?

304
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,750
我是霍克  威廉·霍克
I'm Hooke... William Hooke.

305
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,400
原諒我的魯莽   我只是在想
Forgive my boldness, but I wondered

306
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,580
或許可以和您談談滯留在港口的船只
if I might speak to you of your ship detained in port.

307
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,210
你多半也聽說了  它得接受檢疫
As you've doubtless heard, it's under quarantine.

308
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,250
不必麻煩了
Well, 'tis no bother.

309
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,330
我只想登船取回我的貨物
I merely mean to board the vessel and retrieve my cargo.

310
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,520
冒著被感染甚至更嚴重的風險嗎
And risk infection? Or worse?

311
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,590
那想必是很寶貴的貨物了  霍克先生
Well, this must be very valuable cargo, Mr. Hooke.

312
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,680
抱歉
Sorry.

313
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,740
任何人不得登船
No one's permitted on board.

314
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:36,760
或許西布里先生
Well, perhaps Mr. Sibley

315
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,780
會更明理一些呢
will be more open to reason.

316
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,470
我能向你保證  霍克先生
I can assure you, Mr. Hooke,

317
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,970
我丈夫與我對所有事務的看法都是一致的
my husband and I are of one mind on all matters.

318
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,720
晚安
Good evening.

319
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,950
梅西  如果你能聽見  我懇求你
Mercy, if you can hear me, I beseech you,

320
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,370
告訴我附身于你
speak to me the name

321
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,490
意欲報復的惡靈到底是誰
of the vengeful spirit that possesses you.

322
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,180
她經歷的苦難還不夠嗎
Hasn't she suffered enough?

323
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,440
因此我才要想辦法結束她的苦難
Which is why I seek to end her suffering...

324
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,130
將她從惡魔手中解救出來
by freeing her from the demon inside.

325
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,160
麥哲牧師
Reverend Mather?

326
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,910
龍牙草
Agrimony?

327
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,200
藥劑師的主意
The...apothecary's suggestion.

328
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,420
沒有藥用價值的草藥
A herb with no medicinal value.

329
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,480
-常用于驅魔術 -沒錯
- Used historically in exorcisms. - Mmm.

330
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,140
她醒了
She wakes.

331
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,130
梅西
Mercy?

332
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,080
能聽到我說話嗎
Can you hear me?

333
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,010
是的  牧師
Yes, reverend.

334
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,340
她看起來好多了
She looks well.

335
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,760
眼神清澈
Eyes clear.

336
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,790
體溫也很正常
Skin temperate to the touch.

337
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,820
感謝上帝
Bless God.

338
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,420
天哪
My God.

339
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,010
這是怎么一回事
What is this?

340
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,480
理發師給她做了一次放血療法
The Barber bled her humors.

341
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,540
她的傷口還沒好
She hasn't sufficient time to heal.

342
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,580
安
Anne.

343
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,390
見到你真是意外之喜
What a lovely surprise.

344
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,360
我還以為今晚只有行政委員會出席呢
I anticipated only members of the board.

345
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,900
我說服了父親讓我來的
Oh, I convinced my father to let me attend.

346
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,390
如今在塞勒姆沒有絞刑架和憤怒人群的集會
One can't pass up the rare gathering in Salem

347
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,100
可是越來越少了  我怎么會錯過呢
that doesn't involve a noose and an angry mob.

348
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,330
-很漂亮吧  不是嗎  -當然
- Beautiful, isn't it? - Mm.

349
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,720
是我父親送的
A gift from my father.

350
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,760
我能看看嗎
May I?

351
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,410
精美至極
Exquisite.

352
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,940
我先失陪一陣
If you'll excuse me...

353
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,180
我剛剛還在擔心
And here I feared the guest of honor

354
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,900
咱們今晚宴會的主角不會到場呢
wasn't going to make an appearance at his own party.

355
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,300
我擲了個硬幣
Well, I flipped a coin.

356
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,370
-正面朝上  我就待家里  -如果是背面呢
- Heads, I stay home. - And tails?

357
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,890
我會再扔一次  祈禱這一次是正面
I flip again and pray for heads.

358
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,030
可惜仍不走運
No such luck.

359
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,100
我想你會發現  或許你與這些委員會同伴們
Well, I think you'll find that you have more common ground

360
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,800
有比你想象中更多的共同之處
with your fellow board members than you would have expected.

361
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,000
難道他們也認為塞勒姆已經陷入瘋狂了嗎
Oh. They think salem's gone mad, too?

362
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,540
請隨意  好嗎
Enjoy yourself, huh?

363
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,910
奧登上尉
Captain Alden.

364
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,940
真高興看到你還活著
How nice to see you amongst the living --

365
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,790
打個比方
so to speak.

366
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,870
纈草根
Valerian root?

367
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,400
你已經不擇手段到使用獵人的那些粗劣工具了嗎
You've resorted to the coarse tools of the hunters.

368
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,050
是的  很遺憾
Yes. Well, sadly,

369
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,390
如今我無法再置我至親的安全而不顧
I can no longer take the safety of my loved ones for granted.

370
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,660
很明顯  塞勒姆里有些人
Apparently, there are those in Salem

371
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,240
會品行低劣到對孩子下手
who are not above threatening the lives of children.

372
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,730
她可不是孩子  治安官
She's no child, magistrate.

373
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,260
至少
Certainly not,

374
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,920
從她對約翰·奧登的愛慕之意便可看出
judging by the way she lusts for John Alden.

375
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,980
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley.

376
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,520
我一有結果便立刻來通知您了
I came straightaway with news.

377
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,310
梅西·路易絲已經擺脫了她的控制者
Mercy Lewis is free of her possessor.

378
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,660
你確定
You're certain?

379
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:10,730
我的檢查很詳盡
My exam was thorough.

380
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,550
在她體內我再找不到一絲惡魔殘留的證據
I could glean no remaining evidence of the demon inside.

381
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,310
那真是萬幸啊
How serendipitous.

382
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,990
或許并不只是好運這么簡單
Perhaps beyond good fortune.

383
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,440
這表示巫師的力量正在消退
This is evidence of the witches' waning strength

384
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,940
他們的恐懼正在加深
or waxing fear --

385
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,580
正說明我們的反抗行動起了作用
A testament to the potency of our resistance.

386
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,830
恕我無知  牧師
Forgive me, uh, Reverend,

387
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,100
對于這些事情我知之甚少
As I am but a layman in these matters,

388
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,800
但她又是如何逃出撒旦魔爪的呢
but how did she free herself from satan's grasp?

389
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,110
我發現了龍芽草的痕跡
I detected traces of agrimony,

390
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,290
還有那女孩腹部的一條傷口
as well as an incision in the girl's abdomen,

391
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,370
因此我推測一定是有人對她施行了驅魔術
leading to my supposition that an exorcism had been performed.

392
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:45,950
驅魔術
An exorcism?

393
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,080
在塞勒姆里有人進行著天主教的儀式
A catholic ritual performed in Salem,

394
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,430
你居然還膽敢聲稱這是好消息
and you have the audacity to present this as good news?

395
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,990
你知道在塞勒姆
Do you know what salem abhors

396
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,970
比巫師更令人憎惡的是什么嗎  牧師
even more than a witch, Reverend?

397
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,080
那就是天主教徒
A catholic.

398
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,750
而如今在你的監視之下
Yet under your most watchful eye,

399
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,690
兩種惡行卻大行其道
you've now allowed both to flourish.

400
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,710
為什么會這樣  牧師
When could this have happened, Reverend --

401
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,700
你是被酒精還是妓女給蒙蔽了理智
When you were distracted by drink or by whores?

402
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,170
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley --

403
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,250
用異教徒取代惡魔根本算不上勝利
Replacing demons with heathens is no victory.

404
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,880
看起來就算你成功解決了問題  牧師
Seems even when you succeed, reverend,

405
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,490
你仍能找到法子失敗
you find a way to fail.

406
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,610
如今戰爭一觸即發
We live in a time of war,

407
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,270
敵人就隱藏在我們身邊
our enemies hidden among us.

408
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,390
此時此刻  我們正需要
And so there could be no better time than this

409
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,090
一位新的盟友加入
to welcome a new ally in our fight

410
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,280
來共同對抗威脅小鎮的黑暗勢力
against the dark forces that threaten our town.

411
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:42,330
在戰爭英雄面前  巫師不足為懼
Witches will be no match for a war hero.

412
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,660
歡迎我們行政委員會的最新成員
The newest member of our board of selectmen --

413
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,070
約翰·奧登上尉
Captain John Alden.

414
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,010
如果巫師并不是普通人呢
What if the witches were not the common folk?

415
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,640
不是以設陷阱為生的獵人  也不是助產的婦女
Not those who trapped our food nor birthed our babies?

416
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:07,000
如果巫師是那些得到我們信任的領導者呢
What if the witches were those we've entrusted to lead?

417
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,250
或許  是我們最尊貴的委員會成員之一
A member, perhaps, of our most esteemed board?

418
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,000
至少  我希望不是
Well, I hope not, 

419
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,700
因為如今  我也是你們的一員了
'cause I'm one of you now.

420
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,200
我相信  如果我們攜手
And, together, I trust

421
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,270
定能終結侵蝕這個小鎮的禍害
we will end the scourge that blights this town.

422
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,320
麥哲牧師
Reverend Mather.

423
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,250
我很抱歉  格里安娜
I'm sorry, Gloriana --

424
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,250
安布里小姐
Miss Embry --

425
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,020
但今天真是非常忙碌的一天
But it has been a very trying day,

426
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,200
而且我還未開始準備明天的布道
and I have not yet begun to prepare tomorrow's sermon.

427
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,550
我只是想謝謝你
I simply wish to thank you --

428
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,980
昨天在大庭廣眾之下
For showing me the depth of your care

429
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,930
讓我看到了你的深切關心
yesterday in the public house.

430
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,590
也謝謝您  安布里小姐
And so you have, Miss Embry.

431
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,440
但我向您保證
Though I assure you that separating you

432
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,580
我趕走那纏著您的人渣僅僅出于道義
from that unsavory character was a mere act of charity.

433
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,950
道義
Charity?

434
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,010
以及憐憫
So, too, pity.

435
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,440
憐憫和道義
Pity and charity?

436
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,470
恐怕正是
I'm afraid.

437
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,930
與感覺無關嗎
And it had nothing to do with feeling?

438
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:13,870
與我對上帝的
Not beyond the feeling 

439
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,250
所有苦難子民的感情無異
I possess for any of God's needy creatures...

440
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,770
就像對饑餓的孩子
A hungry child...

441
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,880
或是受傷的動物一樣
A wounded animal.

442
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:20,870
對妓女也一樣
A whore?

443
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,800
格里安...
Glori...

444
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:26,200
安布里小姐  你知道我憎恨那樣的字眼
Miss Embry, you know I detest such words.

445
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,090
但在上帝面前
But in the house of the lord,

446
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,630
我們不能有所欺騙
There can be no deceit.

447
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,410
這不正是你一直在傳播的嗎
Isn't that what you preach?

448
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,640
妓女就是妓女
That a whore is a whore?

449
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,680
但我卻不會用"憐憫"
Just as one would never say "Pity"

450
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,150
來掩飾"熱情"
when they meant "Passion"...

451
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,970
用"道義"來粉飾"妒忌"
"Charity" When they meant "Envy."

452
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,740
妒忌
Envy?

453
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,440
就是當你看到其他男人親吻我
At the thought of another man's mouth on mine,

454
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,970
軀體緊緊地貼著我
His body pressed against mine...

455
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,580
下體進入我體內時的那感覺
His loins enveloped in mine.

456
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,890
上帝啊  請原諒她的不敬
Lord, forgive her impiety.

457
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,650
這是你在我體內進出時
Is that the same lord that you invoke from my bed

458
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,630
在我床上呼喚的那位上帝嗎
as you thrust in and out of me?

459
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:04,130
是我的唇舌在你胸口和股間游走時
The same lord that you thank

460
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,420
你感謝的那位上帝嗎
as my tongue traces down your chest or up your thigh?

461
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,590
是我向他祈禱
That same lord to which I pray

462
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:13,150
你回來的許諾不再落空的那位上帝嗎
that your promise to return will never be an empty one?

463
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,850
格里安娜  你不能待在這里
Gloriana, you mustn't be here.

464
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:15,830
否則如何
Or what?

465
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,290
在上帝的處所  你能怎么樣
What will you do here... in the house of the lord?

466
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,040
柯頓  柯頓
Cot.. Cot...

467
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,170
不  別這樣
No. Please.

468
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,840
西布里先生
Mr. Sibley.

469
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,830
我叫霍克  威廉·霍克
My name is Hooke... William Hooke.

470
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,260
您泊在港口的船上有我的貨物
And I have cargo on your frigate detained in port.

471
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,370
可您夫人卻拒絕解除隔離
Yet your wife refuses to lift the quarantine.

472
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,530
雖然  西布里夫人的美貌驚為天人
Now, whilst Mrs. Sibley's beauty is beyond dispute,

473
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:06,040
但哪能讓女人來掌管男人的事業呢
What woman truly grasps the necessities of a man's vocation?

474
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,010
她們...
They...

475
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,380
先生
S-sir...

476
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,790
您已經病得又聾又啞了嗎
Has your illness rendered you deaf and dumb?

477
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,870
我...
I...

478
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,840
{\an8}女巫

479
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,790
我對自己有點失望  上尉
I'm a bit upset with myself, captain.

480
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,470
何出此言
Why?

481
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,610
我邀請你來我家其實別有動機
I invited you to my home under false pretense.

482
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,320
我想贏得你的信任
In hoping to gain your trust,

483
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,790
很明顯  這么做卻起了相反的作用
I have clearly done the very opposite.

484
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,260
您到底想說什么  治安官
What's your point, magistrate?

485
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,750
也許直接告訴您真相
Perhaps it would have been wiser for me

486
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,370
以及我的真實身份  會更明智
to simply tell you the truth about who and what I am.

487
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,280
那是什么
And what's that?

488
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,630
一個憂心忡忡的父親
A concerned father.

489
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:20,510
三天前  我女兒被下了咒
Three days ago, my daughter was spelled...

490
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,920
至少我相信是這樣
or so I believe.

491
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,900
可她問起時...
And yet when she asked, you...

492
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,580
我說謊了  是的
I lied... yes.

493
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,670
我怎么能告訴她
How could I let her know that there are those out there

494
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,360
外面有人想傷害她
who wish to do her harm?

495
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,980
你也看到他們是怎么對路易絲的
You see what they've done to the Lewis girl,

496
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,780
她已經瘋了
Her mind no longer her own.

497
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,810
如果我的安就是他們的下一個目標怎么辦
What if my Anne is their next target?

498
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,190
你我有著共同的敵人
You and I have a common enemy...

499
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:44,310
那些會傷害安和我們所有人的女巫
The witches who would do my Anne and all of us harm.

500
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,750
那她們到底是誰
And who are they?

501
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,490
這仍是個謎團
This remains a mystery.

502
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,810
我必須承認
I must admit, uh...

503
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,920
我低估你了
I underestimated you.

504
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,130
謝謝
Well, thank you.

505
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,360
你比我想象得還更人渣
You are full of far more shit than I thought possible.

506
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,490
也許你沒對安下咒
Maybe you did not spell Anne.

507
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,870
也許你的解釋很誠懇
Maybe your explanations have been genuine.

508
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,180
但我不信
But I don't think so.

509
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,250
我覺得你不是好人
I think you're dirty.

510
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,490
一旦我找到證據  整個塞勒姆也會這么想的
And once I find proof, all of Salem will, too.

511
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,850
他對你提了要求  卻完全沒有躁動的跡象
He requested you, yet shows no signs of agitation.

512
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,310
會變的
That will change.

513
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,580
擅闖民居
Breaking into my home?

514
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,550
你知道在塞勒姆  小偷會有什么下場嗎
Do you know what happens to thieves in Salem?

515
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:27,790
不知道
No.

516
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,280
但我知道女巫會有什么下場
But I know what happens to witches.

517
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:35,660
{\an8}女巫

518
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,050
這是什么
What's this?

519
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,730
也許這問題最好由西布里先生來回答
Perhaps a question best asked of Mr. Sibley.

520
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,210
我丈夫遭受的病痛
My husband's affliction

521
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,840
已經剝奪了他的理智和感覺
Has robbed him of both reason and sense.

522
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,680
而這恰是要管理塞勒姆
And yet are either actually required

523
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,450
最需要的兩樣東西
to point the finger in Salem?

524
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,430
我可不怕威脅  霍克先生
I care not for threats, Mr. Hooke.

525
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,300
我也沒打算威脅你
And I care not to resort to them.

526
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,900
也許  我們可以避免
So, perhaps, we could avoid bringing this note

527
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,560
將這字條提交給行政委員會
to the attention of the board of selectmen.

528
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,360
所以要么同意你登我的船
Grant you access to my ship,

529
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,770
要么面對你最無恥的指控是嗎
or face your most scurrilous accusations?

530
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,820
好
Fine.

531
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:24,010
半夜時分輪船的守衛會回家
At midnight, the ship's sentry will be sent home,

532
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,080
你可以去拿回你的貨
and you can retrieve your cargo.

533
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,980
現在給我滾
Now out with you.

534
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,450
我的靈感出錯了嗎
Does my sense betray me?

535
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,380
他能破壞你的計劃  我們的計劃
He could undo you! All of us!

536
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,040
梅西也可以
And so could Mercy.

537
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,110
靈獸從她身上脫離了
The familiar has been cut from her.

538
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,510
怎么會
How?

539
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,030
通過驅魔術
An exorcism --

540
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,960
毫無疑問是她的傻瓜父親干的
performed by her dolt of a father, no doubt.

541
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,200
我們必須用新的代替
So we must replace it.

542
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,540
如今她怎么會再次接受呢
And yet why would she accept it a second time?

543
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,660
她不會
She wouldn't,

544
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,590
除非我們能觸動
unless there is some part of the girl

545
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,200
那個女孩的某種情感
to which we can appeal.

546
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,510
哪種情感
And what part is that?

547
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,850
就是你曾經觸動過我的那個部分
The same part you once touched in me --

548
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:12,370
她內心深處對更好的生活的小小憧憬
the deep, small piece of her that longs for a better life.

549
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,800
那你得快點行動
You must move quickly, then.

550
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,330
我會一個人對付霍克先生
I, alone, will take charge of Mr. Hooke.

551
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,660
但是緹圖芭
But, Tituba...

552
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,180
如今事態嚴峻
These are perilous times.

553
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,400
千萬不能讓任何人抓著我們的把柄
No blood must lead back to our door.

554
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,430
明白嗎
Do you understand?

555
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,580
完全了解
Perfectly.

556
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,160
要是我早知道你是約翰·奧登的朋友
Had I known you were a friend of John Alden's,

557
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,530
我會另找其他送貨員
I would have found another courier.

558
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,430
我向你擔保我們不是朋友
I can assure you, we are not friends.

559
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:47,860
你要是知道那人的真面目
If you knew the truth of the man,

560
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,920
你這么譴責我之前就會三思了
You would rethink such an accusation.

561
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,640
什么真面目
And what truth is that?

562
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,960
無論如何
In any case, 

563
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,800
阻礙已除
the impediment has been removed.

564
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,500
半夜包裹就是你的了
The package shall be yours by midnight.

565
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,200
你沒有向她透露我的名字吧
You did not speak my name to her?

566
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,240
我遵囑行事
I did as instructed.

567
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:18,430
不過我還是禁不住在想  那個包裹
But, still, I can't help but wonder -- this parcel --

568
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:22,220
你已得到豐厚報酬  其他不必多想
You have been paid well not to wonder, 

569
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,110
霍克先生
Mr. Hooke.

570
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,230
梅西
Mercy.

571
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,210
離我遠點
Leave me.

572
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,780
我不會離開的
I won't leave you.

573
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,360
我不能
I can't.

574
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,360
你需要我
You need me.

575
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,220
騙子
You're a liar.

576
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,830
我不需要你
I don't need you.

577
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,370
我附身于你的時候
When you resist me,

578
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,660
你指出一個僅你可見的魔鬼的時候
When you point at a demon that only you can see,

579
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,130
他們做了什么
What do they do?

580
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,670
他們剪去你的頭發
They shave your locks.

581
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,820
為你可憐的靈魂哭泣
They weep for your wretched soul.

582
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,010
走開  快走開
Go away! Go!

583
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,100
沒有我  你只是個
Without me, you are but a girl,

584
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,350
軟弱又平凡的女孩
weak and ordinary.

585
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:17,120
但是讓我附身于你
But with me inside you, you are...

586
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,600
你就會無所不能
omnipotent.

587
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,810
別哭了
Hush, now.

588
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,460
別給他們理由可憐你
Give them no cause to pity you.

589
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,340
讓他們只能敬畏你
Give them only reason to fear you.

590
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,910
不  不要
No! No!

591
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,320
張嘴  孩子
Open, girl.

592
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,560
張嘴吧
Open your mouth.

593
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,410
這就對了
Yes.

594
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,500
就像那樣
Just like that.

595
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:03,180
它選擇了你成為它地球上的使者
He has chosen you to be his vessel on earth.

596
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,740
能為它服務
There is no greater honor 

597
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,650
是至高榮耀
than to be in his service.

598
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,680
怎么了  怎么了
What? What?

599
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,460
怎么回事  怎么回事
What? What? What?

600
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,890
她是我的
She is mine.

601
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,520
緹圖芭
Tituba?

602
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,800
瑪麗出事了
Mary is in trouble.

603
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,610
我只是個仆人  上尉
I am but a servant, captain,

604
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,980
沒有權利如此冒犯
unentitled to such an intrusion.

605
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,580
到底是什么事
What is it?

606
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,000
恐怕您和我的女主人
I fear you and my mistress

607
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,180
有一個共同的敵人
share a common adversary --

608
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,000
霍克先生
Mr. Hooke.

609
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,310
你怎么知道他
How did you know that he --

610
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:54,140
我看見您在鎮中心外的大雜院里和他爭執
I saw you quarreling in the warren off the square.

611
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,160
他要求進入我女主人的船
He demands access to my mistress' ship.

612
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,270
為什么
Why?

613
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:01,230
是像他說的那樣只為找個沒有價值的包裹
To retrieve some worthless parcel, as he claims?

614
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:04,880
還是他包藏禍心
Or does he harbor darker intent?

615
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,810
他計劃打劫她
He plans to rob her.

616
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,390
我的女主人也如此擔心
So my mistress fears.

617
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:11,400
西布里夫人為什么準許他登船呢
Why did Mrs. Sibley allow him to board that vessel?

618
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,750
她別無選擇
He left her no choice.

619
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,610
他以散播關于我女主人
He threatened to spread false rumor of an affair --

620
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,830
和你有染的虛假消息來要挾  上尉
with you, captain.

621
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,750
她本想與他理論  但是
She sought to reason with him, but --

622
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,040
他并不是個講理的人
He is not a man that responds to reason.

623
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,820
西布里夫人要是知道我找你一定會責罵我
Mrs. Sibley would lash me if she knew I had come,

624
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,170
但是我擔心霍克先生會毀了她
but I fear Mr. Hooke will be her ruin.

625
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,700
除非
Unless --

626
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,500
說吧  姑娘
Speak, girl.

627
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:37,610
除非有人能阻止他
Unless there be a man who desires to stop him.

628
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,600
{\an8}喬治·西布里

629
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,000
{\an8}包裹4769

630
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,140
你喜歡他  是嗎
You have feelings for him, don't you?

631
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,640
他是誰
"Him"?

632
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,160
一定要我說出他的名字嗎
Must I say his name?

633
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:59,450
這對今晚所有在場的人來說不是顯而易見嗎
Was it not obvious to all who were present this evening?

634
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,490
這不是一個女人應有的特權嗎
Is it not a woman's prerogative

635
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,600
選擇自己喜歡的男人
to choose which man she fancies?

636
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,850
是沒錯
It is.

637
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:08,520
就像這也是父親的特權
Just as it is a father's prerogative

638
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,470
去保護他女兒的心
to protect his daughter's heart

639
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,410
不被那些可能會傷害她的人接近
from those he feels will do it harm.

640
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:17,340
譬如約翰·奧登
John Alden, for instance.

641
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,150
你為什么要這么說
Why do you say this?

642
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,130
就因為他不像塞勒姆那些毛躁的
Because he doesn't curry your favor,

643
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,190
年輕人一樣對你阿諛奉承嗎
like every other twitchy young man in Salem?

644
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,220
不  這不是原因
No. That is not it.

645
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,810
他永遠都是屬于瑪麗·西布里
How could he ever be yours truly

646
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,510
又怎能成為你的摯愛
when he always was and always will be Mary Sibley's?

647
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,240
他們的歷史不是個秘密
Their history is no secret.

648
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,840
但也僅此而已  是個歷史
But it is just that -- history.

649
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,600
她是個已婚的女人了
She is a married woman now.

650
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,860
你真的以為瑪麗·西布里會站在一旁
And do you suppose Mary Sibley will idly stand by

651
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,920
看著你占據她認為屬于自己
while you claim that which she rightfully considers

652
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,140
的東西嗎
to be her own?

653
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,950
你怕她  父親
You fear her, father. 

654
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,540
我不怕
I do not.

655
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,490
你只是個孩子  你不明白
You are but a child. You don't understand.

656
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,460
一個孩子
A child?

657
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,420
不久前  你還同意我是個女人
A moment ago, you agreed I was a woman.

658
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,210
這沒什么可爭論的
It's not for debate.

659
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,670
-到底誰說了算  -我說了算
- By whose command? - By mine!

660
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:00,850
你的父親
Your father!

661
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,380
你的所有者和主人
Your lord and master!

662
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,790
我禁止你與奧登上尉今后再有任何來往
I forbid you to have further contact with captain Alden!

663
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:05,760
不然呢
Or what?

664
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,020
我會受到怎樣的懲罰
What punishment awaits me?

665
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,510
你會奪走我的生命嗎  就像你對敵人一般
Will you crush the life from me, as you do your enemies?

666
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,060
或者僅僅是我的靈魂
Or just my spirit,

667
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,060
像你對所愛之人做的一樣
as you do those you love?

668
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,890
閉嘴
Quiet! 

669
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,040
不準再說了
Not one word more!

670
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,220
把那放下
Put it down.

671
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,150
不
No.

672
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,560
這個箱子屬于我
This parcel belongs to me.

673
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,070
這權利連瑪麗·西布里也無法奪走
A claim that even Mary Sibley cannot dispute.

674
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,680
我不是代表她來的
I'm not here on her behalf.

675
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,230
現在  把它放下
Now put it down.

676
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:57,680
問問你自己  上尉
Ask yourself, captain...

677
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,580
這真的值得嗎
Is it really worth it?

678
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,840
什么
What?

679
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,820
解決老恩怨的代價
The cost of settling old scores.

680
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,900
如果被治安官發現你所做的事情
What would be the charge

681
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,970
你覺得會被判什么罪
if the magistrate knew what you did?

682
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,340
謀殺
Murder?

683
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,040
叛國
Treason?

684
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:12,510
二者皆有
Both?

685
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,780
你知道那天發生了什么
You know what happened that day.

686
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,080
是的
Yes.

687
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,380
我看著你潑灑無辜的鮮血
I watched you spill innocent blood.

688
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,900
沒有一絲后悔與憐憫
Without regret or remorse.

689
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,550
多少人像畜牲一般被屠殺
Men slaughtered like animals.

690
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,770
所有人  都死了
All of them -- dead.

691
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,570
不是所有人
Not all of them.

692
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,560
我們有過交易  霍克先生
We had a deal, Mr. Hooke --

693
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,580
那天你跪在地上求饒
The day you fell to your knees and begged for your life

694
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,150
說如果我放你一條生路
that should I let you live,

695
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,900
你將不會再出現在我面前
we would never cross paths again.

696
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,990
你沒有遵守約定
You didn't hold up your end.

697
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,690
好好想清楚  上尉
Now, think this through, captain.

698
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,950
我當然有
Oh, I have --

699
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,250
很詳細地想過
thoroughly.

700
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:57,940
那天我唯一后悔的就是沒有趕盡殺絕
And the only life I lament that day was the one I spared.

701
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,320
你該遵守約定的  霍克先生
A man should keep his promises, Mr. Hooke.

702
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,860
所以  你打算在這里割了我的喉
So you're...just going to slit my throat here,

703
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,930
像那些印第安野蠻人一樣
like some yellow horse?

704
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,960
不
No.

705
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,310
不
No.

706
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,590
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley.

707
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,800
看來今晚大家似乎都為失眠而困擾
Sleeplessness seems to be epidemic this evening.

708
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,080
你還記得
Do you remember 

709
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,690
我們上一次
the last time we spoke,

710
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,760
在墓地陰影中的談話嗎
in the shadow of the graveyard?

711
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,530
當然記得
Of course.

712
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,160
我們做出的約定
The promises we made?

713
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,740
你會在一年內回來
You would return within a year.

714
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,390
而你將屏息等待
And you would breathlessly wait.

715
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,800
那些都是謊言嗎
Were they lies?

716
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:53,930
不是
No.

717
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,300
這些是愿望
They were wishes.

718
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,470
不諳世事的人許下的愿望
Made by those that knew nothing of the world.

719
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,070
現在呢
And now?

720
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,580
我們明白了
We know.

721
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:13,430
我們的心之所向往往卻與生存所需
What we desire and what we must do to survive

722
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,030
背道而馳
are often at odds.

723
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,630
很晚了  上尉
It's, uh, late, captain.

724
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,750
是很晚了
It is.

725
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,070
我就寢時間早過了
Long past my bedtime.

726
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,740
祝你好夢  瑪麗
I wish you sweet dreams, Mary.

727
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,340
或許這已經是一場美夢了
Perhaps they've already begun.

728
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:10,410
我知道你是什么東西
I know what you are.

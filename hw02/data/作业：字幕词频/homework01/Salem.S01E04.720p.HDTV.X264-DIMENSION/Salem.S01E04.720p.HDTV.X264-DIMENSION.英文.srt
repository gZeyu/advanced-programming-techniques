00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,710
Previously on "Salem"

15
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,870
We all welcome Captain Alden home

16
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,150
from his long, long service.

17
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,160
You come back for one thing and one thing only.

18
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,430
She's Mary Sibley now.

19
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,080
I waited for you.

20
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,310
Years and years without a word.

21
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,400
I was captured.

22
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,940
If we could forget Salem and its witches.

23
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,370
If we could have a different life.

24
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,480
She can't breathe!

25
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,570
Make it stop.

26
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,610
Please. My daughter.

27
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,550
We call it a spectral attack --

28
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,070
The work of witches.

29
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,500
Pray for her.

30
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,980
Imperat tibi Deus Filius...

31
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:57,320
Imperat tibi Deus Spiritus Sanctus...

32
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,310
Imperat tibi majestas Christi...

33
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,490
You must stop this.

34
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,400
aeternum Dei Verbum caro factum...

35
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,760
Imperat sacramentum crucis...

36
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,720
They will hang you if they learn of this.

37
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,170
The witches have already taken your life.

38
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,200
I no longer fear the puritans claiming mine.

39
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,950
The wretched spirit that inhabits you must be excised.

40
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,760
Or else what becomes of you?

41
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,770
Hmm? Madness?

42
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,890
Death?

43
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,690
Do you trust me, Mercy?

44
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,010
Yes, father.

45
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,790
That I would do nothing to hurt you?

46
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,120
Well, of course.

47
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,560
Father. Father.

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,110
I cast you out, every unclean spirit...

49
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,760
every satanic power...

50
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,650
Please! I beseech you!

51
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,690
Every onslaught

52
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,300
of the infernal adversary...

53
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,170
In the name and in the power of our Lord Jesus.

54
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,810
It's you that's been driven to madness!

55
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,720
Malleus maleficarum.

56
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,050
*Pound me the witch drums*

57
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,020
*Witch drums*

58
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,600
*Pound me the witch drums*

59
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,800
*Pound me the witch drums*

60
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,010
*The witch drums*

61
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,610
*Better pray for hell*

62
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:43,540
*Not hallelujah*

64
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:34,990
Good morning.

65
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,950
I, uh, am here to collect a parcel incoming on that vessel.

66
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,650
Influenza outbreak.

67
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,980
Five dead.

68
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,890
Frigate's under quarantine.

69
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,900
Quarantine?

70
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,600
By whose order?

71
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,790
George Sibley.

72
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,690
By way of his wife, Mary Sibley.

73
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,160
Does a man desire

74
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,340
to know when he is on the precipice of his own death?

75
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,940
What say you, George?

76
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,540
Would your friend, the blacksmith,

77
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,840
want to know that scant hours from now,

78
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,230
Mercy Lewis will accuse him of witchcraft?

79
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,740
From which his trial and execution will swiftly follow?

80
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,910
Or would he favor

81
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,000
his waning moments be spent in ignorance?

82
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,970
Oh, don't pity him, George.

83
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,880
It is the blood of innocents like your friend

84
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,980
that make our grand rite possible.

85
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,660
Each accusation made,

86
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,250
each trial convened not for us, but by us.

87
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,590
No one the wiser to our plan

88
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,540
and nobody brave enough to stand in our way.

89
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,300
You miss them, don't you?

90
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,020
When I was young,

91
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,060
I thought them horribly sensible people.

92
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,240
Now...

93
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,780
Salem could use more like them.

94
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,020
I'm intruding, captain.

95
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,450
No, no.

96
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,660
I'm glad you're amongst the living...

97
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,270
So to speak.

98
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,670
Word was you had taken quite ill.

99
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,690
Indeed.

100
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,200
A fit that came on suddenly and without reason,

101
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,150
followed by a restless sleep

102
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,210
in which the sickness infected even my dreams.

103
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,620
Your dreams?

104
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,220
I dreamt of a doll with eyes full and black.

105
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,860
And when I awoke, feverish in the night's middle,

106
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,560
I could have sworn the doll was there, staring back at me.

107
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,470
Fever dreams can be quite vivid.

108
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,490
Except I could have sworn

109
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,430
that I saw my father enter in darkness

110
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,090
and remove the doll.

111
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,690
But when I asked, he laughed and assured me that...

112
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,650
You were dreaming.

113
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,790
Do you doubt my father's veracity, Captain Alden?

114
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,750
No.

115
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,620
But it seems like you do.

116
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,060
I...

117
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,540
I have no doubt that he's a good man.

118
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,050
But lately...

119
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,280
What?

120
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,040
Had I but known you were in such safe hands,

121
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,410
I would have spared your mother her worry.

122
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,420
Magistrate.

123
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,580
Come along, Anne.

124
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,820
Let us allow captain Alden his privacy.

125
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,780
Have I heard you correctly?

126
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,070
Are you suggesting that Anne Hale is the victim of...

127
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,230
A spell.

128
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,570
Am I, too, the victim of a spell?

129
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,670
Or has John Alden finally declared his belief in witches?

130
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,090
I've seen too much to deny any longer,

131
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,210
making my next step obvious...catching one.

132
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,400
As you know, apprehending a witch is no easy feat.

133
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,510
Unless you know who they are.

134
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,610
Have you uncovered the conjurer who spelled Anne?

135
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,330
Who is it?

136
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,860
Tell me.

137
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,350
Someone in proximity to his victim.

138
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,270
Yes.

139
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,610
Whose own daughter voices her suspicions.

140
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,240
Magistrate Hale?

141
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,320
He's not who he seems.

142
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,950
Who amongst us is?

143
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,030
You?

144
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,410
Or I?

145
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,290
Who among us is unburdened by shame

146
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,170
or secrets that we hide from the world?

147
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,900
I'm Reverend Mather.

148
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,420
Is there a problem?

149
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,760
Well, no.

150
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,750
The lady and I were just discussing some business.

151
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,500
- Business? - Yes.

152
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,110
As in how much it might cost me to get down to some...

153
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,090
This is a reputable establishment!

154
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,810
It offers no place for your lechery.

155
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,920
- Reverend. - Reverend.

156
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,970
Cotton!

157
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,060
Pardon me.

158
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,440
I apologize if I've caused any offense.

159
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,250
Good day.

160
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,410
Do you know that man?

161
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,930
Never seen him before.

162
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,770
Ring around the rosies

163
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,470
Pocketful of posies

164
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,260
Ashes, ashes

165
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,630
We all fall down

166
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Ah, Yeah.

167
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,400
She has arrived.

168
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,360
Mercy.

169
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,230
My dear, this is a blessing.

170
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,180
Truly.

171
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,690
And she is again well enough to breathe the fall air.

172
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,080
Our deepest gratitude is often saved

173
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,390
for what we once took for granted.

174
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,030
Mercy?

175
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,330
- What is it? - No.

176
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,410
No, my child. No. No.

177
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,500
The witch!!

178
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,870
Who's the witch, Mercy?

179
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,920
Tell us! Who's the witch?!

180
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,790
Is he the witch, Mercy?

181
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,050
Is he?

182
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,060
Mercy?

183
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,420
Mercy!

184
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,800
Help!

185
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,010
Will someone help us?!

186
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,320
What's happened?

187
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,090
We've lost control.

188
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,790
She is no longer ours.

189
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,090
The hive is restless.

190
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,440
Some are beginning to doubt your grand vision for our kind.

191
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,340
Who? Give me their names.

192
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,980
You're missing the point, child.

193
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,210
Then perhaps he should make one.

194
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,100
Trials are preceded by accusations.

195
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,490
And accusations are predicated upon your control of the girl.

196
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,200
The hunter's moon fast approaches.

197
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,440
Yet the blacksmith

198
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,290
still blithely peddles his wares,

199
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,060
his blood lost to our cause.

200
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,620
How dare you.

201
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,370
Before Mary,

202
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,850
we were not feared, but fearful,

203
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,680
not hunters, but prey.

204
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,480
And yet does her strength and vision garner your praise?

205
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,450
No.

206
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,050
Only your doubt.

207
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,840
The girl has been rendered frail by her circumstance.

208
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,800
Nothing more.

209
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,680
My mastery is not of issue.

210
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,110
This is an assurance?

211
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,020
She needs but a moment of rest.

212
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,630
After which, she will again be strong enough

213
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,930
to point the finger.

214
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,470
Yet another issue remains...

215
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,020
That of John Alden.

216
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,440
What of him?

217
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,820
His suspicion of me is palpable.

218
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,820
If she cannot abate his threat,

219
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:14,210
then I will be forced to do so myself -- as I see fit.

220
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,620
Should you desire John Alden's trust,

221
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,910
I would suggest you find a way to earn it.

222
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,800
And, Mary...

223
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,950
Your vision guides us.

224
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,720
I will report to the others

225
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,900
that your plan shall resume anon.

226
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,390
We need answers quickly.

227
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,590
And we will get them.

228
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,530
How?

229
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,930
The quickest way one finds answers...

230
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,260
blame.

231
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,810
Is it your intent to rob me

232
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,170
of my remaining faith in you, reverend?

233
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,010
Mrs. Sibley. I didn't hear you arrive.

234
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,540
Your charge, simple and clear,

235
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,230
is to protect the Lewis girl from further possession.

236
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,970
And yet...was the episode in the marketplace

237
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,200
not evidence of exactly that?

238
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,630
We have no proof it was the work of witches.

239
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,860
So you've paid her a visit, then?

240
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,670
You've determined what ails her?

241
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,090
The pastor says she's resting

242
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,670
and best not be disturbed.

243
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,730
May I ask you a question, reverend?

244
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,680
When your father seeks out demons, does he ask permission?

245
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,600
Does he knock on doors

246
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,380
and offer to come back at a more convenient time?

247
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,030
Or does he, armed with the Lord's righteousness,

248
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,980
demand the demon answer to him?

249
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,230
My father and I are different men.

250
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,910
We work in different ways.

251
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,820
When I summoned a hunter of witches

252
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,850
to protect the people of Salem, it was not you I requested.

253
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,630
Yet it was you who arrived on our shores.

254
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,050
Do not make me regret settling for my second choice.

255
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,010
Captain Alden.

256
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,220
How fortuitous.

257
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,490
I was just about to set this on your doorstep.

258
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,500
I'll spare you the mystery.

259
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,680
It's a reception tomorrow evening in your honor.

260
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,080
A reception?

261
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,610
No. That's not necessary.

262
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,100
But it is. You're a selectman now.

263
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,360
And, on a more personal note, a chance to make amends

264
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,690
for my less-than-hospitable behavior since your return.

265
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,340
Can we trust you'll be in attendance?

266
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,090
Excuse me, Magistrate.

267
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,530
Lieutenant Hooke.

268
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,270
John Alden.

269
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,980
Now, is this any way to greet the man

270
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,610
who saved you from those savages?

271
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,940
What the hell are you doing here?

272
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,500
Business, Captain.

273
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,900
There is a vessel in port on which I have cargo.

274
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,330
And until the quarantine is lifted,

275
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,600
I am marooned here in your little witch town.

276
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,760
We had a deal, and it was a simple one...

277
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,580
that I was never to set eyes on you again.

278
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,430
Yes. Well, you needn't worry.

279
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,550
We're not the same men we were in the war.

280
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,590
But...

281
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,710
There is something you could do to hasten my departure.

282
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,710
What is that?

283
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:24,540
The girl you spoke of in battle... Mary Wolcott.

284
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,800
Although she's Mary Sibley now, isn't she?

285
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,030
An introduction with her would certain...

286
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,490
You stay away from Mary.

287
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,090
Or what, John?

288
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,550
What will you do?

289
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,500
What I should have done last time.

290
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,610
Now, careful, Captain.

291
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,910
Before a man makes threats,

292
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,240
he should take stock of what he risks...

293
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,010
unless you do not mind me telling the good people of Salem

294
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,750
just who John Alden really is...

295
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,910
neither the man nor the war hero he purports to be.

296
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,870
I want you to finish your business with all due haste,

297
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:04,310
and then by coach or by steed or by ship, I want you gone.

298
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,300
You have my word.

299
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,570
Mr. Sibley's feeding will have to wait

300
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,750
until I return from the reception.

301
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,530
Excuse me.

302
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,780
Mrs. Sibley.

303
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,860
And you are?

304
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,750
I'm Hooke... William Hooke.

305
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,400
Forgive my boldness, but I wondered

306
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,580
if I might speak to you of your ship detained in port.

307
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,210
As you've doubtless heard, it's under quarantine.

308
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,250
Well, 'tis no bother.

309
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,330
I merely mean to board the vessel and retrieve my cargo.

310
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,520
And risk infection? Or worse?

311
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,590
Well, this must be very valuable cargo, Mr. Hooke.

312
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,680
Sorry.

313
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,740
No one's permitted on board.

314
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:36,760
Well, perhaps Mr. Sibley

315
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,780
will be more open to reason.

316
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,470
I can assure you, Mr. Hooke,

317
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,970
my husband and I are of one mind on all matters.

318
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,720
Good evening.

319
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,950
Mercy, if you can hear me, I beseech you,

320
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,370
speak to me the name

321
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,490
of the vengeful spirit that possesses you.

322
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,180
Hasn't she suffered enough?

323
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,440
Which is why I seek to end her suffering...

324
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,130
by freeing her from the demon inside.

325
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,160
Reverend Mather?

326
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,910
Agrimony?

327
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,200
The...apothecary's suggestion.

328
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,420
A herb with no medicinal value.

329
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,480
- Used historically in exorcisms. - Mmm.

330
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,140
She wakes.

331
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,130
Mercy?

332
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,080
Can you hear me?

333
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,010
Yes, reverend.

334
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,340
She looks well.

335
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,760
Eyes clear.

336
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,790
Skin temperate to the touch.

337
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,820
Bless God.

338
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,420
My God.

339
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,010
What is this?

340
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,480
The Barber bled her humors.

341
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,540
She hasn't sufficient time to heal.

342
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,580
Anne.

343
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,390
What a lovely surprise.

344
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,360
I anticipated only members of the board.

345
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,900
Oh, I convinced my father to let me attend.

346
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,390
One can't pass up the rare gathering in Salem

347
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,100
that doesn't involve a noose and an angry mob.

348
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,330
- Beautiful, isn't it? - Mm.

349
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,720
A gift from my father.

350
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,760
May I?

351
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,410
Exquisite.

352
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,940
If you'll excuse me...

353
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,180
And here I feared the guest of honor

354
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,900
wasn't going to make an appearance at his own party.

355
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,300
Well, I flipped a coin.

356
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,370
- Heads, I stay home. - And tails?

357
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,890
I flip again and pray for heads.

358
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,030
No such luck.

359
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,100
Well, I think you'll find that you have more common ground

360
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,800
with your fellow board members than you would have expected.

361
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh. They think salem's gone mad, too?

362
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,540
Enjoy yourself, huh?

363
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,910
Captain Alden.

364
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,940
How nice to see you amongst the living --

365
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,790
so to speak.

366
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,870
Valerian root?

367
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,400
You've resorted to the coarse tools of the hunters.

368
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,050
Yes. Well, sadly,

369
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,390
I can no longer take the safety of my loved ones for granted.

370
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,660
Apparently, there are those in Salem

371
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,240
who are not above threatening the lives of children.

372
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,730
She's no child, magistrate.

373
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,260
Certainly not,

374
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,920
judging by the way she lusts for John Alden.

375
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,980
Mrs. Sibley.

376
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,520
I came straightaway with news.

377
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,310
Mercy Lewis is free of her possessor.

378
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,660
You're certain?

379
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:10,730
My exam was thorough.

380
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,550
I could glean no remaining evidence of the demon inside.

381
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,310
How serendipitous.

382
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,990
Perhaps beyond good fortune.

383
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,440
This is evidence of the witches' waning strength

384
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,940
or waxing fear --

385
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,580
A testament to the potency of our resistance.

386
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,830
Forgive me, uh, Reverend,

387
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,100
As I am but a layman in these matters,

388
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,800
but how did she free herself from satan's grasp?

389
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,110
I detected traces of agrimony,

390
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,290
as well as an incision in the girl's abdomen,

391
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,370
leading to my supposition that an exorcism had been performed.

392
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:45,950
An exorcism?

393
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,080
A catholic ritual performed in Salem,

394
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,430
and you have the audacity to present this as good news?

395
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,990
Do you know what salem abhors

396
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,970
even more than a witch, Reverend?

397
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,080
A catholic.

398
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,750
Yet under your most watchful eye,

399
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,690
you've now allowed both to flourish.

400
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,710
When could this have happened, Reverend --

401
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,700
When you were distracted by drink or by whores?

402
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,170
Mrs. Sibley --

403
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,250
Replacing demons with heathens is no victory.

404
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,880
Seems even when you succeed, reverend,

405
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,490
you find a way to fail.

406
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,610
We live in a time of war,

407
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,270
our enemies hidden among us.

408
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,390
And so there could be no better time than this

409
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,090
to welcome a new ally in our fight

410
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,280
against the dark forces that threaten our town.

411
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:42,330
Witches will be no match for a war hero.

412
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,660
The newest member of our board of selectmen --

413
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,070
Captain John Alden.

414
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,010
What if the witches were not the common folk?

415
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,640
Not those who trapped our food nor birthed our babies?

416
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:07,000
What if the witches were those we've entrusted to lead?

417
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,250
A member, perhaps, of our most esteemed board?

418
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,000
Well, I hope not, 

419
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,700
'cause I'm one of you now.

420
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,200
And, together, I trust

421
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,270
we will end the scourge that blights this town.

422
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,320
Reverend Mather.

423
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,250
I'm sorry, Gloriana --

424
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,250
Miss Embry --

425
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,020
But it has been a very trying day,

426
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,200
and I have not yet begun to prepare tomorrow's sermon.

427
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,550
I simply wish to thank you --

428
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,980
For showing me the depth of your care

429
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,930
yesterday in the public house.

430
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,590
And so you have, Miss Embry.

431
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,440
Though I assure you that separating you

432
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,580
from that unsavory character was a mere act of charity.

433
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,950
Charity?

434
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,010
So, too, pity.

435
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,440
Pity and charity?

436
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,470
I'm afraid.

437
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,930
And it had nothing to do with feeling?

438
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:13,870
Not beyond the feeling 

439
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,250
I possess for any of God's needy creatures...

440
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,770
A hungry child...

441
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,880
A wounded animal.

442
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:20,870
A whore?

443
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,800
Glori...

444
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:26,200
Miss Embry, you know I detest such words.

445
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,090
But in the house of the lord,

446
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,630
There can be no deceit.

447
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,410
Isn't that what you preach?

448
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,640
That a whore is a whore?

449
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,680
Just as one would never say "Pity"

450
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,150
when they meant "Passion"...

451
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,970
"Charity" When they meant "Envy."

452
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,740
Envy?

453
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,440
At the thought of another man's mouth on mine,

454
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,970
His body pressed against mine...

455
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,580
His loins enveloped in mine.

456
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,890
Lord, forgive her impiety.

457
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,650
Is that the same lord that you invoke from my bed

458
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,630
as you thrust in and out of me?

459
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:04,130
The same lord that you thank

460
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,420
as my tongue traces down your chest or up your thigh?

461
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,590
That same lord to which I pray

462
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:13,150
that your promise to return will never be an empty one?

463
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,850
Gloriana, you mustn't be here.

464
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:15,830
Or what?

465
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,290
What will you do here... in the house of the lord?

466
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,040
Cot.. Cot...

467
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,170
No. Please.

468
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,840
Mr. Sibley.

469
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,830
My name is Hooke... William Hooke.

470
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,260
And I have cargo on your frigate detained in port.

471
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,370
Yet your wife refuses to lift the quarantine.

472
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,530
Now, whilst Mrs. Sibley's beauty is beyond dispute,

473
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:06,040
What woman truly grasps the necessities of a man's vocation?

474
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,010
They...

475
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,380
S-sir...

476
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,790
Has your illness rendered you deaf and dumb?

477
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,870
I...

479
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,790
I'm a bit upset with myself, captain.

480
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,470
Why?

481
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,610
I invited you to my home under false pretense.

482
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,320
In hoping to gain your trust,

483
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,790
I have clearly done the very opposite.

484
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,260
What's your point, magistrate?

485
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,750
Perhaps it would have been wiser for me

486
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,370
to simply tell you the truth about who and what I am.

487
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,280
And what's that?

488
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,630
A concerned father.

489
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:20,510
Three days ago, my daughter was spelled...

490
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,920
or so I believe.

491
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,900
And yet when she asked, you...

492
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,580
I lied... yes.

493
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,670
How could I let her know that there are those out there

494
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,360
who wish to do her harm?

495
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,980
You see what they've done to the Lewis girl,

496
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,780
Her mind no longer her own.

497
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,810
What if my Anne is their next target?

498
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,190
You and I have a common enemy...

499
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:44,310
The witches who would do my Anne and all of us harm.

500
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,750
And who are they?

501
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,490
This remains a mystery.

502
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,810
I must admit, uh...

503
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,920
I underestimated you.

504
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,130
Well, thank you.

505
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,360
You are full of far more shit than I thought possible.

506
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,490
Maybe you did not spell Anne.

507
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,870
Maybe your explanations have been genuine.

508
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,180
But I don't think so.

509
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,250
I think you're dirty.

510
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,490
And once I find proof, all of Salem will, too.

511
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,850
He requested you, yet shows no signs of agitation.

512
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,310
That will change.

513
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,580
Breaking into my home?

514
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,550
Do you know what happens to thieves in Salem?

515
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:27,790
No.

516
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,280
But I know what happens to witches.

518
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,050
What's this?

519
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,730
Perhaps a question best asked of Mr. Sibley.

520
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,210
My husband's affliction

521
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,840
Has robbed him of both reason and sense.

522
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,680
And yet are either actually required

523
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,450
to point the finger in Salem?

524
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,430
I care not for threats, Mr. Hooke.

525
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,300
And I care not to resort to them.

526
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,900
So, perhaps, we could avoid bringing this note

527
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,560
to the attention of the board of selectmen.

528
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,360
Grant you access to my ship,

529
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,770
or face your most scurrilous accusations?

530
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,820
Fine.

531
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:24,010
At midnight, the ship's sentry will be sent home,

532
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,080
and you can retrieve your cargo.

533
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,980
Now out with you.

534
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,450
Does my sense betray me?

535
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,380
He could undo you! All of us!

536
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,040
And so could Mercy.

537
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,110
The familiar has been cut from her.

538
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,510
How?

539
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,030
An exorcism --

540
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,960
performed by her dolt of a father, no doubt.

541
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,200
So we must replace it.

542
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,540
And yet why would she accept it a second time?

543
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,660
She wouldn't,

544
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,590
unless there is some part of the girl

545
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,200
to which we can appeal.

546
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,510
And what part is that?

547
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,850
The same part you once touched in me --

548
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:12,370
the deep, small piece of her that longs for a better life.

549
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,800
You must move quickly, then.

550
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,330
I, alone, will take charge of Mr. Hooke.

551
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,660
But, Tituba...

552
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,180
These are perilous times.

553
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,400
No blood must lead back to our door.

554
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,430
Do you understand?

555
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,580
Perfectly.

556
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,160
Had I known you were a friend of John Alden's,

557
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,530
I would have found another courier.

558
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,430
I can assure you, we are not friends.

559
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:47,860
If you knew the truth of the man,

560
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,920
You would rethink such an accusation.

561
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,640
And what truth is that?

562
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,960
In any case, 

563
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,800
the impediment has been removed.

564
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,500
The package shall be yours by midnight.

565
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,200
You did not speak my name to her?

566
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,240
I did as instructed.

567
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:18,430
But, still, I can't help but wonder -- this parcel --

568
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:22,220
You have been paid well not to wonder, 

569
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,110
Mr. Hooke.

570
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,230
Mercy.

571
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,210
Leave me.

572
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,780
I won't leave you.

573
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,360
I can't.

574
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,360
You need me.

575
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,220
You're a liar.

576
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,830
I don't need you.

577
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,370
When you resist me,

578
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,660
When you point at a demon that only you can see,

579
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,130
What do they do?

580
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,670
They shave your locks.

581
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,820
They weep for your wretched soul.

582
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,010
Go away! Go!

583
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,100
Without me, you are but a girl,

584
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,350
weak and ordinary.

585
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:17,120
But with me inside you, you are...

586
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,600
omnipotent.

587
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,810
Hush, now.

588
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,460
Give them no cause to pity you.

589
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,340
Give them only reason to fear you.

590
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,910
No! No!

591
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,320
Open, girl.

592
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,560
Open your mouth.

593
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,410
Yes.

594
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,500
Just like that.

595
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:03,180
He has chosen you to be his vessel on earth.

596
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,740
There is no greater honor 

597
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,650
than to be in his service.

598
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,680
What? What?

599
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,460
What? What? What?

600
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,890
She is mine.

601
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,520
Tituba?

602
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,800
Mary is in trouble.

603
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,610
I am but a servant, captain,

604
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,980
unentitled to such an intrusion.

605
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,580
What is it?

606
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,000
I fear you and my mistress

607
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,180
share a common adversary --

608
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,000
Mr. Hooke.

609
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,310
How did you know that he --

610
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:54,140
I saw you quarreling in the warren off the square.

611
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,160
He demands access to my mistress' ship.

612
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,270
Why?

613
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:01,230
To retrieve some worthless parcel, as he claims?

614
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:04,880
Or does he harbor darker intent?

615
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,810
He plans to rob her.

616
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,390
So my mistress fears.

617
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:11,400
Why did Mrs. Sibley allow him to board that vessel?

618
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,750
He left her no choice.

619
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,610
He threatened to spread false rumor of an affair --

620
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,830
with you, captain.

621
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,750
She sought to reason with him, but --

622
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,040
He is not a man that responds to reason.

623
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,820
Mrs. Sibley would lash me if she knew I had come,

624
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,170
but I fear Mr. Hooke will be her ruin.

625
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,700
Unless --

626
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,500
Speak, girl.

627
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:37,610
Unless there be a man who desires to stop him.

630
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,140
You have feelings for him, don't you?

631
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,640
"Him"?

632
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,160
Must I say his name?

633
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:59,450
Was it not obvious to all who were present this evening?

634
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,490
Is it not a woman's prerogative

635
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,600
to choose which man she fancies?

636
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,850
It is.

637
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:08,520
Just as it is a father's prerogative

638
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,470
to protect his daughter's heart

639
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,410
from those he feels will do it harm.

640
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:17,340
John Alden, for instance.

641
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,150
Why do you say this?

642
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,130
Because he doesn't curry your favor,

643
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,190
like every other twitchy young man in Salem?

644
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,220
No. That is not it.

645
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,810
How could he ever be yours truly

646
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,510
when he always was and always will be Mary Sibley's?

647
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,240
Their history is no secret.

648
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,840
But it is just that -- history.

649
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,600
She is a married woman now.

650
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,860
And do you suppose Mary Sibley will idly stand by

651
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,920
while you claim that which she rightfully considers

652
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,140
to be her own?

653
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,950
You fear her, father. 

654
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,540
I do not.

655
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,490
You are but a child. You don't understand.

656
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,460
A child?

657
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,420
A moment ago, you agreed I was a woman.

658
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,210
It's not for debate.

659
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,670
- By whose command? - By mine!

660
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:00,850
Your father!

661
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,380
Your lord and master!

662
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,790
I forbid you to have further contact with captain Alden!

663
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:05,760
Or what?

664
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,020
What punishment awaits me?

665
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,510
Will you crush the life from me, as you do your enemies?

666
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,060
Or just my spirit,

667
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,060
as you do those you love?

668
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,890
Quiet! 

669
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,040
Not one word more!

670
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,220
Put it down.

671
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,150
No.

672
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,560
This parcel belongs to me.

673
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,070
A claim that even Mary Sibley cannot dispute.

674
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,680
I'm not here on her behalf.

675
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,230
Now put it down.

676
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:57,680
Ask yourself, captain...

677
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,580
Is it really worth it?

678
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,840
What?

679
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,820
The cost of settling old scores.

680
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,900
What would be the charge

681
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,970
if the magistrate knew what you did?

682
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,340
Murder?

683
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,040
Treason?

684
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:12,510
Both?

685
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,780
You know what happened that day.

686
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,080
Yes.

687
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,380
I watched you spill innocent blood.

688
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,900
Without regret or remorse.

689
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,550
Men slaughtered like animals.

690
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,770
All of them -- dead.

691
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,570
Not all of them.

692
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,560
We had a deal, Mr. Hooke --

693
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,580
The day you fell to your knees and begged for your life

694
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,150
that should I let you live,

695
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,900
we would never cross paths again.

696
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,990
You didn't hold up your end.

697
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,690
Now, think this through, captain.

698
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,950
Oh, I have --

699
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,250
thoroughly.

700
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:57,940
And the only life I lament that day was the one I spared.

701
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,320
A man should keep his promises, Mr. Hooke.

702
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,860
So you're...just going to slit my throat here,

703
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,930
like some yellow horse?

704
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,960
No.

705
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,310
No.

706
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,590
Mrs. Sibley.

707
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,800
Sleeplessness seems to be epidemic this evening.

708
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,080
Do you remember 

709
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,690
the last time we spoke,

710
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,760
in the shadow of the graveyard?

711
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,530
Of course.

712
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,160
The promises we made?

713
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,740
You would return within a year.

714
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,390
And you would breathlessly wait.

715
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,800
Were they lies?

716
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:53,930
No.

717
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,300
They were wishes.

718
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,470
Made by those that knew nothing of the world.

719
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,070
And now?

720
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,580
We know.

721
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:13,430
What we desire and what we must do to survive

722
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,030
are often at odds.

723
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,630
It's, uh, late, captain.

724
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,750
It is.

725
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,070
Long past my bedtime.

726
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,740
I wish you sweet dreams, Mary.

727
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,340
Perhaps they've already begun.

728
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:10,410
I know what you are.

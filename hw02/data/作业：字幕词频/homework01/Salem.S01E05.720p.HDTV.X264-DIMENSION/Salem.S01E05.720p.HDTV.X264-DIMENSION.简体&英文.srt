00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,770
《塞勒姆》前情提要
Previously on "Salem"...

15
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,790
-你是否曾想过  -什么
- Do you ever wonder? - What?

16
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,430
或许我们可以离开这里
If we could leave this place?

17
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,520
格里安娜  你不能待在这里
Gloriana, you mustn't be here.

18
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,520
在上帝的处所
What will you do here --

19
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,090
你能怎么样
in the house of the lord?

20
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,010
你来这里做什么  霍克
What the hell are you doing here, Hooke?

21
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,100
小心点  上尉  除非你不介意
Now, careful, captain... unless you do not mind me

22
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,290
我告诉塞勒姆的人们
telling the good people of salem

23
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,940
约翰·奥登到底是个什么样的人
just who john alden really is.

24
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,850
半夜包裹就是你的了
The package shall be yours by midnight.

25
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,230
灵兽从她身上脱离了
The familiar has been cut from her.

26
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,180
怎么会
How?

27
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,660
通过驱魔术
An exorcism...

28
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,420
毫无疑问是她的傻瓜父亲干的
performed by her dolt of a father, no doubt.

29
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,620
我们必须用新的代替
So we must replace it.

30
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,640
天哪
My god.

31
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,440
那个女孩只是因为身体状况而日趋虚弱
The girl has been rendered frail by her circumstance.

32
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,330
她只是需要休息一段时间
She needs but a moment of rest.

33
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,960
之后  她就会恢复力量
After which, she will again be strong enough

34
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,130
去指认他人
to point the finger.

35
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,680
张嘴吧
Open your mouth.

36
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,270
我知道你是什么东西
I know what you are.

37
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,250
让他们进房间里去干  好吗
Get 'em into a room, will ya?

38
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,200
我马上就回来
I'll be back in two shakes.

39
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,100
你要去哪
You're leaving?

40
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,950
你聋了啊  女儿
Are you deaf, girl?

41
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,130
给他们找个房间
Get 'em into a room!

42
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,450
好的  妈咪
Yes, mum.

43
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,390
知道我们为什么召唤你过来吗

44
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,930
我不知道
I do not.

45
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,500
是为了约翰·奥登
Yo'a'nes John Alden.

46
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,350
约翰·奥登
John Alden.

47
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,870
他怎么了
Yes?

48
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:54,230
{\pos(200,209.454)}他干扰了我们的大祭典  玛丽·西布里

49
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,150
{\pos(190.77,233.181)}你得去帮我们解决

50
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,510

Yes. Yes.

51
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,040
{\pos(193.846,210.272)}昨晚奥登为了保住秘密杀了一个叫霍克的男人

52
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,620
{\pos(192,212.727)}那肯定是他不愿让玛丽·西布里知道的秘密

53
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,290
{\pos(190.769,212.727)}你必须查出真相并利用它把奥登逐出塞勒姆

54
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,420
但你不是说知道秘密的人已经死了吗
Yet, you say the man who holds the secret is dead.

55
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,230
{\an8}我们中有人精通巫师的黑魔法

56
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,910
{\an8}凭她一己之力就能让死者说话

57
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,560
确定我们可以相信她吗
Are we certain we can trust her?

58
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,260
{\pos(188.308,233.999)}我们别无选择

59
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,900
我不确定这个仆人是否忠心
I'm not so sure the servant is loyal.

60
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,640
我曾经觉得你的倔强是个优点
I used to think your stubbornness a virtue.

61
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,090
你现在不觉得了吗
And you don't any longer?

62
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,960
现在外面风声鹤唳  你为何还要只身前往呢
Why go alone when there is influence in numbers?

63
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,670
那姑娘知道真相了
The girl has shown her color.

64
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,850
但还不至于威胁到我们
We are well beyond the point of intimidation.

65
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,440
也许我们已经有被铲除的危险了呢
Then perhaps we are at the point of elimination.

66
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,760
或许吧  但只是暂时的
Perhaps, but for the time being,

67
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,500
她活着远比死了有价值
She is worth much more to us alive than dead.

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,040
遵命
Certainly.

有吗
Did I?

不用再装了
The time for coyness has passed.

It is clear you know exactly who and what I am.

唯一的问题是
The only question that remains

85
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,410
你会怎么做
is what you will do with that information.

86
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,200
那取决于你  西布里夫人
That depends on you, Mrs. Sibley.

87
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,710
你想怎样  小姑娘
What do you want, girl?

88
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,180
我想要你停止
I want it to stop...

89
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,490
那些痛苦与折磨
the torture, the torment, the suffering.

90
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,050
否则我就会说出去
Or I will tell them.

91
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,580
我会告诉大家你的真实身份
I will tell them all who and what you are.

92
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,000
你根本对我一无所知
You know nothing of me...

93
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,070
你不知道我做了什么  放弃了什么
or what I've done or given up

94
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,650
经历了什么才变成今天的样子
or endured to be who I am.

95
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,580
你受刑是因为你反抗
You are tortured because you resist.

96
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,150
屈服于我  你就会体验到其中的乐趣
Give in to me, and you will know only pleasure.

97
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,910
你折磨我
You torture me.

98
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,410
你把那条蛇放进了我身体里
You put the snake inside of me.

99
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,670
你就是那个咬我肩膀的女巫
You are the hag that bites my shoulder.

100
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,410
说话小心点  否则你的愚蠢
Careful, or your foolishness

101
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,390
会让你的价值相形见绌
will come to overshadow your usefulness.

102
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,600
你之所以还活着
You live still...

103
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,530
是因为我允许你活着
because I allow it.

104
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,500
你还能呼吸是因为我想让你呼吸
You breathe only because I wish it.

105
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,790
你会杀我吗
You would kill me?

106
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,700
如果你乱说的话
If you speak.

107
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,560
保持沉默  你就能活下去
Stay silent, and you shall live.

108
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,010
我深不可测  内心丰盈
My heart is deep and full.

109
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,820
我很想再给你一次机会让你证明自己的价值
It yearns to give you further chance to prove your worth.

110
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,870
让我失望  就是让你自己失望
Fail me, and you fail yourself.

111
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,360
抛尸山壑等待你的最终决定
The crag awaits your decision.

112
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,590
该死
Damn it.

113
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,670
你找我吗
You sent for me?

114
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,380
对
Yes.

115
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,310
如果你想再次羞辱我
If your purpose is further humiliation

116
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,710
或想继续探寻心灵
or probings of the heart,

117
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,870
我已经受够了
I, for one, have had my fill.

118
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,740
我想给你个建议
My purpose is a proposition.

119
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,470
其实是想跟你做笔买卖
A business arrangement of sorts.

120
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,830
你说
I'm listening.

121
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,060
你告诉我
In which you would tell me

122
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,280
你一周最多能赚多少钱
the sum of your most fruitful week's bounty,

123
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:43,170
我永久性地给你双倍的钱
and I shall provide double in perpetuity...

124
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,030
你来陪我
for your company...

125
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,680
把你宝贵的时间给我
and your precious time...

126
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,650
只给我一个人
in exclusivity.

127
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,870
你想彻底把我买下来
So you wish to buy me outright.

128
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,400
我是家里的独子
I'm an only child.

129
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,320
我不喜欢与人分享
I never learned to share.

130
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,150
你这是向我道歉吗
Which is as close as a man like you comes to an apology.

131
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,050
你看到我跟其他人在一起
Was it really so very painful for you

132
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,280
真的很痛苦吗
to see me with another?

133
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,590
真的
Yes.

134
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,230
你愿意成为我的人吗
Will you be mine?

135
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,690
柯顿
Cotton.

136
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,780
奥登上尉
Captain Alden!

137
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,250
你怎么来了
What brings you here?

138
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,900
因为这个
This.

139
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,930
你确定吗  多蒂
Are you sure, Dottie?

140
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,820
你确定她不会伤害我们
Are you sure she won't hurt us?

141
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,460
她肯定不会伤害我们的...
'Course she won't hurt us...

142
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,830
除非你是个巫师
...unless you be a witch.

143
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,940
你好  梅西
Hello, Mercy.

144
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,650
我们可以进去吗
May we come in?

145
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,270
他们会到你屋里找你吗  梅西
They come to you in your room, Mercy?

146
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,980
他们...
Them...

147
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,980
巫师
witches?

148
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,340
有时吧
Sometimes...

149
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,040
有时候会在其他地方
And other times in other places.

150
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,860
他们现在在这里吗
Are they here with us now?

151
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,140
现在你能看到他们吗
Can you see them as we speak?

152
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,990
不  他们现在不在
No, I don't see them now.

153
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,580
他们会伤害你吗
Do they hurt you?

154
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,950
有时候会
Sometimes.

155
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,910
那是种什么感觉
What's it like?

156
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,880
什么什么感觉
What's it like?

157
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,960
伸手指认别人
To point your finger

158
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,660
让别人胆战心惊
and make them shake and tremble with fear.

159
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,000
指认别人  看着他们逃跑
To point your finger and watch them run.

160
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,160
不  不是那样的
No, it's not like that...

161
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,950
根本不是
at all.

162
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,410
我发誓
I swear.

163
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,820
塞勒姆没有哪个女人能有那种权力
No woman in Salem has ever had that kind of power.

164
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,750
连玛丽·西布里都没有
Not even Mary Sibley.

165
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,640
你们是说我...
You think I have sway...

166
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,780
在塞勒姆民众之中有支配力量
...amongst all the people of Salem?

167
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,020
你手指所向便关乎生死
Your little finger points to life a-and death itself.

168
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,880
告诉我们  巫师是什么样子
Tell us... what do the witches look like?

169
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,990
还有件事  西布里夫人
One more thing, Mrs. Sibley...

170
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,310
码头有大量包裹
There was an overflow of parcels left on the britania,

171
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,050
都应该交给一个叫威廉·霍克的人
all of which are to be delivered to a William Hooke.

172
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,320
我们四处都找遍了
Now, we've looked high and low.

173
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,860
但是没人知道他的行踪
No one could seem to locate the fellow.

174
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,450
知道了  我会处理的
I see. I'll take care of it.

175
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,470
谢谢您  夫人
Thank you, madam.

176
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,040
他们不会找到霍克先生的  永远不会
They will not find Mr. Hooke... not now, not ever.

177
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,610
我不会过问他的情况
I won't ask what happened to him.

178
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,600
你也不该过问
Nor should you.

179
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,680
那就保守秘密  免得有人起疑心
Then contain it before curiosity grows.

180
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,390
西布里夫人  下午好
Uh, Mrs. Sibley, uh, good afternoon.

181
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,610
能麻烦她跟我走一趟吗
Might I borrow your girl?

182
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,760
我家夫人吃了有问题的贻贝  病得厉害
The missus has taken ill with a batch of wayward mussels

183
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,790
想要她特制的药剂来一缓病痛
and now begs relief with one of her exceptional tonics.

184
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,090
请向霍尔夫人致以我最迫切的问候
Please send Mrs. Hale my most urgent regrets.

185
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,720
您有心了
Most kind.

186
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,910
理查兹先生  请把这位霍克先生
Oh, Mr. Richards, uh, fetch for me a list of items

187
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,770
要收取的货物清单给我一份
this Mr. Hooke was here to receive,

188
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,100
记载了货物来源地的那一份
one that also perhaps includes their site of origin.

189
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,020
这就去办  夫人
Right away, madam.

190
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,610
你的谎话太拙劣了
Your lie is clumsy.

191
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,020
没人生病
No one is ill.

192
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,370
小姐跟我一样清楚这一点
My mistress can see that as clearly as I.

193
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,050
是的 说到谎言和花招
Yes, well, when it comes to lies and subterfuge,

194
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,660
我得佩服你的本事
I defer to your expert endowments.

195
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,410
说出你的目标  不然我就走了
State your purpose or be gone with you.

196
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,700
我的目标是把约翰·奥登逐出塞勒姆
My purpose is to rid this town of John Alden

197
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,170
一劳永逸
once and for all,

198
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,190
除非你对这个目标不感兴趣
unless that is a purpose for which you lack interest.

199
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,360
这是同一个姑娘
That was the same girl...

200
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,730
在兰姆
from Lamb's,

201
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,200
被你打过一拳的那个
the one you threw a punch over.

202
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,130
是吗
Was it?

203
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,710
我不知道她们还出门待客呢
Wasn't aware they made outcalls.

204
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,150
把那些画面再跟我描述一次
Tell me again of the visions.

205
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,720
泛黄的面孔
Yellowed faces...

206
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,980
身体布满了皮疹和水疱
bodies overcome by rash and blister...

207
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,090
许多人死去
death in great numbers.

208
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,860
是把这个物件拿出来的时候看见的吗
And this came to you as the artifact was brought to life?

209
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,650
是的
Yep.

210
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,910
你说这东西是从哪儿来的
Where did you say it came from?

211
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,930
镇子里所有东西的来源  船只
Where everything in this town comes from... a ship.

212
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,760
"伟大的仪式"
Ritum Magni.

213
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,900
大祭典
The grand rite?

214
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,840
我们所了解的只来自传说  流言  神话
Most of what we know is lore... rumor, legend.

215
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,830
这里提到了这个物件 "恶灵" 
It says this object, this "Malum,"

216
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,820
在历史上
has thought to be present

217
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,690
每次大祭典中都会出现
at every grand rite throughout history.

218
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,470
我看过的资料显示
Everything I have read has said that the grand rite

219
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,950
大祭典的尝试从未成功过
has only ever been attempted, never completed.

220
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,760
或许瘟疫只是祭典的一部分
Maybe plague's only part of it.

221
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,670
这是邪恶之物
This object is evil.

222
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,170
它为恶魔回归祝圣
It consecrates the earth for the devil's return.

223
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,660
它是被寄送过来的  本该有人接收
It was here for delivery. Someone was expecting it.

224
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,990
一个巫师
A witch.

225
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,130
我们必须立刻通知行政委员们
We must inform the selectmen immediately.

226
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,870
不行
No.

227
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,680
为什么不
No?

228
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,290
我们有巫师想要的东西
We have something the witches want.

229
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,590
没什么比这个更能吸引他们的注意
What better way to get their attention?

230
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,710
没什么比这个更能让你送命
What better way to get yourself killed?

231
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,540
我们都身处险境
We are all in danger,

232
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,070
但我宁可死去
but I would rather die

233
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,140
也不要落入塞勒姆的异徒手中
before Salem's finest control my fate.

234
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,280
你跟我一起吗
Are you with me?

235
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,710
不在那边  你这可恨的怪胎
Not over there, you infernal mutant!

236
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,900
在这边
Over here!

237
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,320
就是他
That's him.

238
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,510
治安官把你带走的真正目的是什么
And the magistrate's true purpose in taking you from me?

239
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,400
眼见为实
My eyes betrayed my sense

240
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,680
霍尔夫人确实病得打翻了便壶
when I came upon Mrs. Hale bent over her chamber pot.

241
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,130
如果你坚持要圆这个谎
If you insist upon this lie,

242
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,620
我就不得不问一句了
it forces me to ask

243
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,990
你现在如此匆忙离开又是要去哪儿
where you're off to now with such great urgency.

244
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,760
药店
The apotek.

245
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,220
我手头的珀希鼠李树皮不多了
I run low on the bark of cascara sagrada.

246
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,340
当然了
By all means.

247
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,210
这就像教皇伟大的长袍
It's like the great flowing robe of the pope.

248
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,320
或者是国王镶满珠宝的王冠
Or the jeweled-up crown of a king.

249
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,920
这个要讨厌得多  我敢保证
Well, it's quite disagreeable on -- I assure you.

250
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,720
想想看
Just think of it...

251
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,700
被英俊的麦哲牧师
being led through the market

252
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
指引着穿过集市
by the handsome reverend Mather.

253
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,310
他是什么样的  梅西
What's he like, Mercy, hmm?

254
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,730
他会谈到上帝和魔鬼吗
Does he speak of God and demons?

255
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,580
我们聊过很多次
We've spoke many times.

256
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,550
他对我的遭遇很感兴趣
He's shown great interest in my affliction.

257
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,860
是你伸出了手指
It's you who points the finger...

258
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,090
整个塞勒姆屏息以待
while all of Salem holds their breath and waits.

259
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,590
也不完全是那样  我...
Well, it's not exactly like that. I...

260
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,150
如果我有你的本事  我知道自己该控诉谁
If I had your say-so, I know who I'd accuse.

261
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,110
谁
Who?

262
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,220
谁
Who?

263
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,220
她父亲
It's her father.

264
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,140
她会指控自己的父亲
She'd accuse her own father.

265
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,310
为什么
Why?

266
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,230
他成天逼她在大街上卖唱
Makes her sing in the streets all day long

267
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,430
而自己则在兰姆的酒馆里买醉
while he nurses the bottle at Lamb's --

268
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,980
卖唱  乞讨
Sing and beg.

269
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,320
然后他将她赚来的钱全数拿去买酒
Then he takes what coin she's made for spirits

270
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,400
稍有不如意还对她拳脚相加
and beats her senseless for her troubles.

271
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,970
这是真的吗
Is this true?

272
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,570
下个月我就满十五岁了
I'm to be 15 next month,

273
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,010
他说到时候就要将我卖去妓院
and he swears to sell me to the Rod.

274
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,750
你父亲要将你卖去妓院
Your father means to sell you to the whorehouse?

275
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,660
我要逃离这里
I'll run away.

276
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,460
就算他卖了我  我...  我要逃走
Even if he sells me, I'm -- I'll run.

277
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,490
我不会允许这种事发生
No one is running away.

278
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,280
决不允许
No one.

279
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,480
{\pos(194.462,139.091)}梅西

280
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,710
罪人还是救世主
Sinner or savior!

281
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,430
我们该如何辨别
How are we to know?!

282
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,630
看看那些被诅咒者所受的折磨
Look but to the torment of the damned,

283
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,680
好好想想天使与恶魔之间的区别
and think well of the difference betwixt angels and devils,

284
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:18,510
你就知道何为罪恶及其根源
and you will know what sin is and where sin resides!

285
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,970
你就别再继续煽动大家的情绪了行吗
How 'bout you not rile the crowd further than they are?

286
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,580
25美分一张
It's two bits a sheet.

287
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,960
我这还多着呢  除非你想把它们都买了
I'm still full up here, unless you'd like to buy me out.

288
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,160
不如直接揍你一顿更省事
Be loads more fun to beat you stupid.

289
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,620
霍尔小姐
Miss Hale.

290
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,840
奥登上尉
Captain Alden.

291
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,040
真是美好的一天
It's a fine day.

292
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,520
是吗
Is it?

293
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,370
或许不是吧
Perhaps not.

294
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,460
正是  或许吧
Oh, indeed. Perhaps not.

295
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,770
或许塞勒姆将不会再有美好的明天
Perhaps there will be no more fine days in Salem.

296
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,160
或许美好时光已经离我们远去
Perhaps the days of fine days are tragically behind us.

297
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,610
我有什么地方得罪你了吗  霍尔小姐
Have I offended you, Miss Hale?

298
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,060
让一个女人为你心存爱慕
Do you consider it offensive

299
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,400
而你的心却另有所属
raising hope in a heart most normally well-guarded

300
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,150
你觉得这是一种罪过吗
while your own beats in the breast of another?

301
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,300
你觉得这种行为应受谴责吗  奥登上尉
Do you, Captain Alden, find that reprehensible

302
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,440
-亦或只是无心之失  -这个  我
- or simply unkind? - Well, I...

303
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,070
还是你根本从未在意过这个问题
Or, most likely, you think not of it at all

304
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,790
或是我或是任何人  因为这就是男人的天性
or me or others, as is the wont and practice of most men.

305
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,230
西布里夫人
Ah, Mrs. Sibley.

306
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,740
安
Anne.

307
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,180
来得正是时候
Perfect.

308
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,390
你是否庆幸自己已不再年少无知
Are you ever grateful to be no longer young?

309
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,110
是的
Yes.

310
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,430
不过她的年少轻狂倒让我想起了另一个人
Though her youthful moxie does bring to mind another.

311
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,070
我从未如此年少轻狂
I was never that young.

312
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,200
曾经  我们都是的
We were both...once.

313
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,180
你怎么会来集市
What brings you to market?

314
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:52,980
缇图芭
Tituba.

315
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,510
我们约好在草药师那见面
We were to meet at the herbalist.

316
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,550
这死亡之地倒挺适合你们俩的
A fine pair you two make in this place of death.

317
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,420
给她吧
Give it to her.

318
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,450
我需要时间
It will take time.

319
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,580
一旦你完成了立刻告诉我结果
And you will report to me as soon as you're finished.

320
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,770
不敢在此久留吗
Afraid to stay?

321
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,580
我还有更有意义的事情要做
My time is better spent elsewhere.

322
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,640
这样最好
For the best.

323
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,990
一个人只要沾染了黑暗之术
Once a man dabbles in the dark arts,

324
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,580
就很难再次回到光明
it's difficult for him to return to the light.

325
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,280
给我弄只兔子来
Fetch me a rabbit.

326
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,770
是的
Y-yes.

327
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,520
给我上去
Get on there!

328
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,300
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley.

329
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,840
布朗宁太太
Mrs. Browning.

330
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,230
别不好意思
Oh. No need to turn away.

331
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,540
他确实是个迷人的小伙
He is an arresting figure.

332
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,130
若不是我老眼昏花  我也会忍不住盯着他瞧呢
Only my old lady's eyes that keep me from staring myself.

333
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,600
别开玩笑了
Don't be ridiculous.

334
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,410
你还是不愿采纳我的专业意见吗
You still insist on ignoring my expertise.

335
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,120
没错
Yep.

336
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,470
我们可以用更专业
There are less pedestrian,

337
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,090
更和平的方式
less painful methods,

338
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,010
来达到我们的目的
with which we could accomplish our goals.

339
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,580
今晚一定要成功
It must happen tonight.

340
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,570
我们只有这一次机会
There will be no second chances.

341
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,810
普通人的法子对我来说就足够了
The ways of the common are always good enough for me.

342
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,690
如果还能重创敌人  那就更好不过
And if it causes pain, so much the better.

343
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,640
看得出  她还在闷闷不乐
Still in a brown study, I see.

344
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,290
整天都没说过一句话
Hasn't spoken a word all day.

345
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,230
她会好起来的
Mm. Well, she'll recover.

346
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,580
什么好起来
From what?

347
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,900
-你跟她说什么了  -没什么
- What did you say to her? - Nothing.

348
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,930
只是想平复她内心不可避免的伤痛
Merely trying to spare her heart the inevitable woe.

349
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,050
不用担心  亲爱的
Worry not, my husband.

350
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,050
只要她成为柯顿·麦哲夫人
This will all be distant memory

351
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,240
这些就都只是遥远的记忆了
Once she's become Mrs. Cotton Mather.

352
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,080
我在想
I wonder.

353
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:02,940
想什么
Wonder what?

354
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:08,500
如果他当初没走  如果你当初可以嫁给他
If he'd never left, if you'd been allowed to marry,

355
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,790
如今与他成家立室
and found yourself now in that house of his

356
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,490
听着小孩们无休止的哭闹
with three squalling brats,

357
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:17,740
为了养家糊口无日无夜地工作
working ceaselessly to spread your meager wages...

358
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,570
奥登上尉对你还会有这么大吸引力吗
Would Captain Alden still hold such desperate appeal?

359
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,610
还是你只是沉浸在一见钟情的浪漫中
Or is it that you're trapped in first bliss,

360
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,460
刻骨铭心  无法自拔
romance from which there's no escape,

361
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,840
每当想起可能拥有的那一切
your heart ever hurting

362
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,670
便心痛得无以复加
from the imaginings of what could have been?

363
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:44,180
别在大庭广众下盯着他看  那会令你愈发软弱
Do not stare at him in public. It weakens you.

364
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,470
你从来就没想过吧  
It never even occurs to you, does it?

365
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,230
我也许早就不需要你的至理名言了
I might have outgrown your sage advice.

366
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,380
尽管她无法开口
Though she cannot speak...

367
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,380
但她将指引我们找到巫师
...she will show us the witch!

368
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,760
她将指引我们找到巫师
She will show us the witch!

369
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,810
[咒语]
Balbin, gab, gabor, agaba!

370
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,230
复活吧  我召唤你
Arise, I call thee!

371
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:26,230
[咒语]
Colpriziana, offina alta nestra,

372
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,530
[咒语]
Fuaro menut.

373
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,080
威廉·霍克  你是我要寻找的死灵
William Hooke, thou art the dead I seek.

374
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,150
威廉·霍克  回应我的召唤
William Hooke, answer my calling.

375
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,090
她将指引我们找到巫师
She will show us the witch!

376
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,190
尽管她无法开口
Though she cannot speak...

377
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,070
她将指引我们找到巫师
...she will show us the witch!

378
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,380
她将指引我们找到巫师
She will show us the witch!

379
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,810
她将指引我们找到巫师
She will show us the witch!

380
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,960
她将指引我们找到巫师
She will show us the witch!

381
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,840
她将指引我们找到巫师
She will show us the witch!

382
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,200
阻止她  牧师  她在让你出丑
Stop her, reverend. She makes mockery of you.

383
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,060
快阻止她
Stop her!

384
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,770
威廉·霍克  你是我要寻找的死灵
William Hooke, thou art the dead I seek.

385
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,960
威廉·霍克  回应我的召唤
William hooke, answer my calling.

386
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,970
[咒语]  用力  呼吸
Fortis roa, strength and breath,

387
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,750
用力  呼吸  用力  呼吸
Strength and breath, strength and breath.

388
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,170
威廉·霍克  你是我要寻找的死灵
William Hooke, thou art the dead I seek.

389
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,500
威廉·霍克  回应我的召唤
William Hooke, answer my calling.

390
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,520
用力  呼吸  用力  呼吸  用力  呼吸
Strength and breath, strength and breath, strength and breath.

391
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,990
是你
You.

392
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,880
是我
Yes.

393
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:42,000
我还以为我们的买卖已经做完了
I thought our business concluded.

394
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,100
告诉我约翰·奥登的秘密
Tell me John Alden's secret.

395
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,230
到地狱来问我吧  婊子
Meet me in hell, you bitch.

396
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,620
有的地方可比地狱还糟
Oh, there are worse places than hell.

397
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,210
快说
Speak!

398
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,230
巫师
Witch!

399
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,410
天啊  艾米莉
Oh, no, Emily.

400
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,440
是你父亲
It's your father.

401
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,140
怎么回事
What's happened now?

402
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,710
问你的主子去吧  我可不知道
Query your mistress. I haven't the faintest idea.

403
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,250
你的任务怎么样了
What of your mission?

404
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,650
早该料到你在这里
Of course I find you here,

405
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,380
不去监狱里调查刚被指认出来的巫师
Not at the jail investigating this new witch,

406
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,840
不去查看梅西·路易丝
Not with Mercy Lewis,

407
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,230
倒是跑这儿来玩你那些天杀的玩具了
But here, alone, playing with your blasted toys.

408
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,050
看来我只能让您不快了  西布里夫人
It seems I am determined to displease you, Mrs. Sibley.

409
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,980
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley.

410
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,500
别这样
Please.

411
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,570
-抱歉  -请坐
- I'm sorry - Please.

412
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,540
告诉我  何事让您如此烦心
Tell me... what troubles you.

413
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,370
那女孩已经迷失在权力之中
That girl has gone mad with power.

414
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:08,820
她受到同龄人的煽动  被不堪的争论所影响
Encouraged by her peers, influenced by petty dispute.

415
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:14,260
行政委员们担心她已经不再可靠了
The selectmen fear that she's no longer reliable.

416
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,440
胡说
Nonsense.

417
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,650
他们不确定是否还能信任她
They are uncertain that she can be further trusted.

418
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,540
这由不得他们决定
It is not theirs to decide.

419
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,030
我会对那女孩进行评估
I will assess the girl

420
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,940
决定她是否仍能胜任她的职责
and form my own opinion of her role.

421
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,160
你会这么做吗  牧师
You would do that, reverend?

422
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,090
当然
Of course.

423
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,940
这许多的责任快将我压垮了
I am torn and harried by my many responsibilities.

424
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,730
都是我的错
It's my fault completely.

425
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,590
我没考虑到这会给你带来的负担
I hadn't considered the toll this has taken on you.

426
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:44,190
在这种危急时刻  行政委员间的任何嫌隙
Oh, and a rift amongst the selectmen at this fragile moment

427
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:47,930
都可能成为我  或是塞勒姆  无法承担的重负
might be more burden than I... or salem...could bear.

428
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,340
别担心  西布里夫人
Worry not, Mrs. Sibley.

429
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,840
您召唤我前来主理这些巫师审讯
You fetched me here to run these witch trials,

430
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,860
我一定会尽我所能的
and run them I must.

431
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,670
谢谢你  牧师
Thank you, reverend.

432
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,380
知道至少还有一个人
What a relief to find

433
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,930
能分担我的痛苦  真是太令人欣慰了
at least one who can relieve my hardships.

434
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,050
那是什么
What is that?

435
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:25,750
是一样我正在研究的物件
It's an artifact that I'm researching.

436
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,980
和巫师有关吗
Does it have to do with witches?

437
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,900
和大祭典有关
It's associated with the grand rite,

438
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:41,480
数个世纪以来属于巫师的一种死亡仪式
a ritual of death attributed to witches over the centuries.

439
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:46,150
为什么这件物品让你如此在意
And why does this object in particular concern you?

440
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,450
和巫师相关的所有事我都关心  夫人
Everything regarding witches concerns me, madam.

441
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,530
我们得做万全准备
We cannot be too prepared.

442
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,220
看来您父亲无暇前来对塞勒姆来说真是幸事
What luck for Salem that your father was unavailable.

443
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,740
小镇的未来就仰仗你了  牧师
We will owe our future to you, reverend.

444
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,170
对此我十分确信
Of that I am sure.

445
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,740
那个秘密没用
The secret is useless.

446
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,330
约翰·奥登可不会为了区区赌债而离开小镇
John Alden will not leave town for a gambling debt.

447
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,940
她这么和你说的
That's what she told you?

448
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,480
她骗了我
She lied?

449
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,740
我会逼她说出真相的
I'll beat it out of her.

450
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,970
不需要
No.

451
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,830
难道缇图芭不渴望大祭典吗
Does Tituba not yearn for the grand rite?

452
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,970
事实上  还会有比她更渴望大祭典的人吗
Is there another, in fact, that craves it more?

453
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,660
所以她会使用真正的秘密
So she'll use the real secret.

454
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,220
以她自己的方式  但是为了同样的目的
In her own way, but for the same purpose --

455
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,880
来控制玛丽
to control Mary.

456
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,600
另外还有个问题
We have another problem.

457
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,950
本该由威廉·霍克递送的物件
The object William Hooke was tasked to deliver

458
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,140
现已落入旁人之手
has fallen into other hands.

459
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,110
威廉·霍克运送的到底是什么
And what exactly was William Hooke tasked to deliver?

460
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,580
恶灵
The Malum.

461
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,780
恶灵
The Malum?

462
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,020
我们必须做好准备  应对每一种可能
We must be prepared for every eventuality,

463
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,850
即使没有了玛丽·西布里
even one that does not include Mary Sibley.

464
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,800
这就是恶灵的作用
That is the malum's purpose.

465
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,560
它在谁手里
Who has it?

466
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,620
约翰·奥登
John Alden.

467
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,950
我在集市里找你来着
I looked for you at market.

468
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,320
药店的存货不够了
The apotek ran low.

469
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,120
我只得自己去采药
I was forced to pick the bark myself.

470
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,700
再有一句谎话  这就会是你的临终遗言
The next lie to cross your lips will be your last.

471
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:30,040
你竟然威胁我  你唯一真正的盟友
You would threaten me, your one true ally?

472
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,890
就是说其他人都已背叛我了
So the others have turned on me.

473
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:34,780
没错
Yes.

474
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,960
-谁  -每个人
- Who?  - Each and every one.

475
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,860
萝丝
Rose?

476
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,410
每个人
Everyone.

477
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,730
他们私下见面
They meet in secret,

478
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,530
谈论你的弱点
speak of your weakness,

479
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:54,020
谋划着要把约翰·奥登赶出塞勒姆
plot to rid Salem of John Alden.

480
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,140
怕他会让我迷失自我
Fearful he has taken me from myself.

481
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:56,930
没错
Yes.

482
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,440
一派胡言
Nonsense.

483
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,880
一切尽在我掌控之中
I am most completely myself!

484
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,850
你没有
You are not!

485
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,180
你陷入了爱河
You are in love.

486
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,890
让我告诉你关于他的事  这个你爱的男人
Let me tell you about him -- this man that you love.

487
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,980
他是个杀人犯
He is a murderer.

488
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,470
-他不是  -他是
- He is not. - Yes.

489
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,080
他刚刚才又杀了一人  来保守自己的秘密
And he has killed yet another to keep his secret.

490
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,090
如果我告诉治安官  民兵们就会前来
If I tell the magistrate, the militia will come,

491
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,370
逮捕他  并且绞死他
they will take him, and they will hang him.

492
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,660
你说谎
Lies.

493
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,340
如果你希望约翰·奥登活着
If you wish for John Alden to live,

494
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,320
你就必须完成大祭典
you will complete the grand rite.

495
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,290
下轮满月之前必须再有八人死亡
The next moon will see eight more dead.

496
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,400
你说谎
Lies.

497
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,960
死人从不说谎
The dead don't lie.

498
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,980
父亲  你好
Hello, father.

499
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,440
我被关起来了
I'm locked up.

500
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,490
没错
Yes, you are.

501
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,320
为什么
What for?

502
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,740
你是个巫师
You're a witch.

503
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:14,540
酒鬼  出老千  骗子这些可能没错
A drunk, a card sharp, a two-timer, maybe.

504
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,590
可巫师吗
But a witch?

505
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,320
我可不认同
I think not.

506
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,360
我是来道别的
I come to say goodbye.

507
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,870
谢谢你"无微不至"的照顾
and thanks for nothing.

508
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,170
不用多久  我就会被释放
I'll be out of here in no time,

509
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:39,060
然后跟之前说好的一样  我会把你卖了
and then you will be sold, just like we planned.

510
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,230
或者你会被绞死
Or you'll hang...

511
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,540
或被烧死
Or burn.

512
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:51,140
我们走着瞧  父亲
We'll see, father.

513
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,270
走着瞧
We'll see.

514
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,010
霍普金斯小姐
Miss Hopkins?

515
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,430
霍尔小姐
Miss -- miss Hale.

516
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,900
这点小心意用来帮你度过
A small collection to help ease your circumstances

517
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,390
这段难过的时期
in this most trying time.

518
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:12,970
谢谢你
Thank you.

519
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,490
他会得到公正的审判的
He'll get a fair trial.

520
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,410
我父亲会确保这一点
My father will see to that,

521
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,870
不然我会确保他这么做
or I'll see to my father.

522
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,050
你真是善良  霍尔小姐
You're most kind, Miss Hale.

523
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,920
这不是出于善良
Ah, it's not kindness.

524
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,850
他们吊死了我的朋友
They hung my friend.

525
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:40,820
我看着她乱踢  尖叫
I watched her kick and...scream

526
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,060
然后
and...

527
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,850
尿了裤子
soil herself.

528
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,550
我不想再袖手旁观了
I will not do that again.

529
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,230
保持坚强
Stay strong.

530
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,860
是说实话的时候了
Time for truth.

531
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,670
我之前对你撒谎了
I lied to you earlier.

532
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,730
我也年轻过
I was young once --

533
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,850
年轻到相信善良美德
young enough that I believed in goodness.

534
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,270
我相信是因为我在你身上看到了它们
I believed in it because I saw it in you.

535
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:06,300
这就是你  即使不刻意
You can't help it. Y-you can't stop it.

536
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,570
你身上仍充满着这种品质
You can't be any other way.

537
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,170
我想这就是为什么我那时爱上了你
And I think that's why I loved you.

538
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,370
想想我有多震撼
Imagine my surprise...

539
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:21,770
当我听到你是杀人犯的时候
being told you're a murderer.

540
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,520
你不了解我
You don't know me.

541
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,660
什么
What?

542
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,210
你不了解我
You don't know me!

543
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:37,250
-我杀了二十个人  -不
- I killed 20 men. - No.

544
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,900
没错  二十个人
Yes. 20 men.

545
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,590
而他们唯一的罪就是来救我
And their only crime was that they had come to save me.

546
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,500
不  我不相信
No, I won't believe it.

547
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,900
信不信都是真的
Believe it because it's true!

548
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,830
幸运之人至死不憾
Lucky men go to their graves with no regrets.

549
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,650
而我不曾一日无悔
Barely a day passes when I don't have one.

550
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,950
有时  我们不得不做出选择
Sometimes in life, we make choices.

551
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,580
而这些艰难的选择
And sometimes, these -- these difficult choices --

552
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,020
会促使我们做出一些事  可怕的事
they lead us to do things, terrible things,

553
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,010
即便有违我们本意
and we don't wish to.

554
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,800
我们尽力避免
We'd do anything not to.

555
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,980
但选择孕育选择
But choice informs choice.

556
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,950
有时候  你的行为
Your actions, though your own,

557
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:31,200
并不代表着
They -- they don't resemble

558
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,380
你任何的期许或是愿望
anything you'd have wanted or wished for.

559
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,350
告诉我你也是这样的
Tell me that it was like that,

560
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:41,570
告诉我那是个艰难的选择
Tell me that it was a difficult choice,

561
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,450
你无能为力  求你了  求你了
a terrible thing, please, please,

562
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,980
这样我才能继续相信善良美德
So that I might still believe in goodness.

563
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,910
我屠杀了二十个人
I murdered 20 men.

564
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:05,590
我不会为自己找任何借口
And I make no excuses for myself.

565
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,670
你会逮捕我吗
Will you have me arrested?

566
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,130
我是唯一知情的人

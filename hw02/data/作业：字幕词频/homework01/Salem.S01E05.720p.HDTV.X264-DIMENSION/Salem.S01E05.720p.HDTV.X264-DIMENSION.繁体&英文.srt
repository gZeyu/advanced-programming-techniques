第一季  第五集

14
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,770
《塞勒姆》前情提要
Previously on "Salem"...

15
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,790
-你是否曾想過  -什么
- Do you ever wonder? - What?

16
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,430
或許我們可以離開這里
If we could leave this place?

17
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,520
格里安娜  你不能待在這里
Gloriana, you mustn't be here.

18
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,520
在上帝的處所
What will you do here --

19
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,090
你能怎么樣
in the house of the lord?

20
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,010
你來這里做什么  霍克
What the hell are you doing here, Hooke?

21
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,100
小心點  上尉  除非你不介意
Now, careful, captain... unless you do not mind me

22
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,290
我告訴塞勒姆的人們
telling the good people of salem

23
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,940
約翰·奧登到底是個什么樣的人
just who john alden really is.

24
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,850
半夜包裹就是你的了
The package shall be yours by midnight.

25
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,230
靈獸從她身上脫離了
The familiar has been cut from her.

26
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,180
怎么會
How?

27
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,660
通過驅魔術
An exorcism...

28
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,420
毫無疑問是她的傻瓜父親干的
performed by her dolt of a father, no doubt.

29
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,620
我們必須用新的代替
So we must replace it.

30
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,640
天哪
My god.

31
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,440
那個女孩只是因為身體狀況而日趨虛弱
The girl has been rendered frail by her circumstance.

32
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,330
她只是需要休息一段時間
She needs but a moment of rest.

33
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,960
之后  她就會恢復力量
After which, she will again be strong enough

34
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,130
去指認他人
to point the finger.

35
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,680
張嘴吧
Open your mouth.

36
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,270
我知道你是什么東西
I know what you are.

37
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,250
讓他們進房間里去干  好嗎
Get 'em into a room, will ya?

38
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,200
我馬上就回來
I'll be back in two shakes.

39
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,100
你要去哪
You're leaving?

40
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,950
你聾了啊  女兒
Are you deaf, girl?

41
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,130
給他們找個房間
Get 'em into a room!

42
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,450
好的  媽咪
Yes, mum.

43
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,390
知道我們為什么召喚你過來嗎

44
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,930
我不知道
I do not.

45
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,500
是為了約翰·奧登
Yo'a'nes John Alden.

46
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,350
約翰·奧登
John Alden.

47
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,870
他怎么了
Yes?

48
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:54,230
{\pos(200,209.454)}他干擾了我們的大祭典  瑪麗·西布里

49
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,150
{\pos(190.77,233.181)}你得去幫我們解決

50
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,510
遵命
Yes. Yes.

51
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,040
{\pos(193.846,210.272)}昨晚奧登為了保住秘密殺了一個叫霍克的男人

52
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,620
{\pos(192,212.727)}那肯定是他不愿讓瑪麗·西布里知道的秘密

53
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,290
{\pos(190.769,212.727)}你必須查出真相并利用它把奧登逐出塞勒姆

54
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,420
但你不是說知道秘密的人已經死了嗎
Yet, you say the man who holds the secret is dead.

55
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,230
{\an8}我們中有人精通巫師的黑魔法

56
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,910
{\an8}憑她一己之力就能讓死者說話

57
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,560
確定我們可以相信她嗎
Are we certain we can trust her?

58
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,260
{\pos(188.308,233.999)}我們別無選擇

59
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,900
我不確定這個仆人是否忠心
I'm not so sure the servant is loyal.

60
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,640
我曾經覺得你的倔強是個優點
I used to think your stubbornness a virtue.

61
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,090
你現在不覺得了嗎
And you don't any longer?

62
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,960
現在外面風聲鶴唳  你為何還要只身前往呢
Why go alone when there is influence in numbers?

63
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,670
那姑娘知道真相了
The girl has shown her color.

64
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,850
但還不至于威脅到我們
We are well beyond the point of intimidation.

65
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,440
也許我們已經有被鏟除的危險了呢
Then perhaps we are at the point of elimination.

66
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,760
或許吧  但只是暫時的
Perhaps, but for the time being,

67
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,500
她活著遠比死了有價值
She is worth much more to us alive than dead.

68

*擂我戰鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

69

Look who's here, Mercy. Mrs.Sibley.

76
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,600
-坐起來  -你先出去吧
-Sit up straight, girl. - Leave us.

77
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,990
你先出去  牧師
Leave us, reverend.

78
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,010
好的
Yes.

79
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,040
遵命
Certainly.

80
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,330
你昨晚來找過我
You came to visit me last night.

81
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,860
有嗎
Did I?

82
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,510
不用再裝了
The time for coyness has passed.

83
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,920
很明顯  你很清楚我的身份
It is clear you know exactly who and what I am.

84
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,060
唯一的問題是
The only question that remains

85
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,410
你會怎么做
is what you will do with that information.

86
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,200
那取決于你  西布里夫人
That depends on you, Mrs. Sibley.

87
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,710
你想怎樣  小姑娘
What do you want, girl?

88
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,180
我想要你停止
I want it to stop...

89
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,490
那些痛苦與折磨
the torture, the torment, the suffering.

90
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,050
否則我就會說出去
Or I will tell them.

91
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,580
我會告訴大家你的真實身份
I will tell them all who and what you are.

92
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,000
你根本對我一無所知
You know nothing of me...

93
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,070
你不知道我做了什么  放棄了什么
or what I've done or given up

94
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,650
經歷了什么才變成今天的樣子
or endured to be who I am.

95
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,580
你受刑是因為你反抗
You are tortured because you resist.

96
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,150
屈服于我  你就會體驗到其中的樂趣
Give in to me, and you will know only pleasure.

97
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,910
你折磨我
You torture me.

98
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,410
你把那條蛇放進了我身體里
You put the snake inside of me.

99
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,670
你就是那個咬我肩膀的女巫
You are the hag that bites my shoulder.

100
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,410
說話小心點  否則你的愚蠢
Careful, or your foolishness

101
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,390
會讓你的價值相形見絀
will come to overshadow your usefulness.

102
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,600
你之所以還活著
You live still...

103
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,530
是因為我允許你活著
because I allow it.

104
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,500
你還能呼吸是因為我想讓你呼吸
You breathe only because I wish it.

105
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,790
你會殺我嗎
You would kill me?

106
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,700
如果你亂說的話
If you speak.

107
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,560
保持沉默  你就能活下去
Stay silent, and you shall live.

108
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,010
我深不可測  內心豐盈
My heart is deep and full.

109
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,820
我很想再給你一次機會讓你證明自己的價值
It yearns to give you further chance to prove your worth.

110
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,870
讓我失望  就是讓你自己失望
Fail me, and you fail yourself.

111
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,360
拋尸山壑等待你的最終決定
The crag awaits your decision.

112
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,590
該死
Damn it.

113
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,670
你找我嗎
You sent for me?

114
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,380
對
Yes.

115
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,310
如果你想再次羞辱我
If your purpose is further humiliation

116
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,710
或想繼續探尋心靈
or probings of the heart,

117
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,870
我已經受夠了
I, for one, have had my fill.

118
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,740
我想給你個建議
My purpose is a proposition.

119
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,470
其實是想跟你做筆買賣
A business arrangement of sorts.

120
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,830
你說
I'm listening.

121
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,060
你告訴我
In which you would tell me

122
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,280
你一周最多能賺多少錢
the sum of your most fruitful week's bounty,

123
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:43,170
我永久性地給你雙倍的錢
and I shall provide double in perpetuity...

124
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,030
你來陪我
for your company...

125
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,680
把你寶貴的時間給我
and your precious time...

126
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,650
只給我一個人
in exclusivity.

127
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,870
你想徹底把我買下來
So you wish to buy me outright.

128
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,400
我是家里的獨子
I'm an only child.

129
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,320
我不喜歡與人分享
I never learned to share.

130
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,150
你這是向我道歉嗎
Which is as close as a man like you comes to an apology.

131
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,050
你看到我跟其他人在一起
Was it really so very painful for you

132
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,280
真的很痛苦嗎
to see me with another?

133
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,590
真的
Yes.

134
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,230
你愿意成為我的人嗎
Will you be mine?

135
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,690
柯頓
Cotton.

136
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,780
奧登上尉
Captain Alden!

137
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,250
你怎么來了
What brings you here?

138
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,900
因為這個
This.

139
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,930
你確定嗎  多蒂
Are you sure, Dottie?

140
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,820
你確定她不會傷害我們
Are you sure she won't hurt us?

141
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,460
她肯定不會傷害我們的...
'Course she won't hurt us...

142
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,830
除非你是個巫師
...unless you be a witch.

143
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,940
你好  梅西
Hello, Mercy.

144
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,650
我們可以進去嗎
May we come in?

145
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,270
他們會到你屋里找你嗎  梅西
They come to you in your room, Mercy?

146
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,980
他們...
Them...

147
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,980
巫師
witches?

148
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,340
有時吧
Sometimes...

149
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,040
有時候會在其他地方
And other times in other places.

150
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,860
他們現在在這里嗎
Are they here with us now?

151
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,140
現在你能看到他們嗎
Can you see them as we speak?

152
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,990
不  他們現在不在
No, I don't see them now.

153
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,580
他們會傷害你嗎
Do they hurt you?

154
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,950
有時候會
Sometimes.

155
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,910
那是種什么感覺
What's it like?

156
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,880
什么什么感覺
What's it like?

157
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,960
伸手指認別人
To point your finger

158
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,660
讓別人膽戰心驚
and make them shake and tremble with fear.

159
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,000
指認別人  看著他們逃跑
To point your finger and watch them run.

160
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,160
不  不是那樣的
No, it's not like that...

161
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,950
根本不是
at all.

162
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,410
我發誓
I swear.

163
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,820
塞勒姆沒有哪個女人能有那種權力
No woman in Salem has ever had that kind of power.

164
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,750
連瑪麗·西布里都沒有
Not even Mary Sibley.

165
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,640
你們是說我...
You think I have sway...

166
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,780
在塞勒姆民眾之中有支配力量
...amongst all the people of Salem?

167
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,020
你手指所向便關乎生死
Your little finger points to life a-and death itself.

168
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,880
告訴我們  巫師是什么樣子
Tell us... what do the witches look like?

169
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,990
還有件事  西布里夫人
One more thing, Mrs. Sibley...

170
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,310
碼頭有大量包裹
There was an overflow of parcels left on the britania,

171
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,050
都應該交給一個叫威廉·霍克的人
all of which are to be delivered to a William Hooke.

172
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,320
我們四處都找遍了
Now, we've looked high and low.

173
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,860
但是沒人知道他的行蹤
No one could seem to locate the fellow.

174
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,450
知道了  我會處理的
I see. I'll take care of it.

175
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,470
謝謝您  夫人
Thank you, madam.

176
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,040
他們不會找到霍克先生的  永遠不會
They will not find Mr. Hooke... not now, not ever.

177
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,610
我不會過問他的情況
I won't ask what happened to him.

178
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,600
你也不該過問
Nor should you.

179
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,680
那就保守秘密  免得有人起疑心
Then contain it before curiosity grows.

180
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,390
西布里夫人  下午好
Uh, Mrs. Sibley, uh, good afternoon.

181
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,610
能麻煩她跟我走一趟嗎
Might I borrow your girl?

182
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,760
我家夫人吃了有問題的貽貝  病得厲害
The missus has taken ill with a batch of wayward mussels

183
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,790
想要她特制的藥劑來一緩病痛
and now begs relief with one of her exceptional tonics.

184
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,090
請向霍爾夫人致以我最迫切的問候
Please send Mrs. Hale my most urgent regrets.

185
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,720
您有心了
Most kind.

186
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,910
理查茲先生  請把這位霍克先生
Oh, Mr. Richards, uh, fetch for me a list of items

187
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,770
要收取的貨物清單給我一份
this Mr. Hooke was here to receive,

188
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,100
記載了貨物來源地的那一份
one that also perhaps includes their site of origin.

189
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,020
這就去辦  夫人
Right away, madam.

190
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,610
你的謊話太拙劣了
Your lie is clumsy.

191
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,020
沒人生病
No one is ill.

192
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,370
小姐跟我一樣清楚這一點
My mistress can see that as clearly as I.

193
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,050
是的 說到謊言和花招
Yes, well, when it comes to lies and subterfuge,

194
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,660
我得佩服你的本事
I defer to your expert endowments.

195
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,410
說出你的目標  不然我就走了
State your purpose or be gone with you.

196
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,700
我的目標是把約翰·奧登逐出塞勒姆
My purpose is to rid this town of John Alden

197
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,170
一勞永逸
once and for all,

198
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,190
除非你對這個目標不感興趣
unless that is a purpose for which you lack interest.

199
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,360
這是同一個姑娘
That was the same girl...

200
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,730
在蘭姆
from Lamb's,

201
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,200
被你打過一拳的那個
the one you threw a punch over.

202
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,130
是嗎
Was it?

203
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,710
我不知道她們還出門待客呢
Wasn't aware they made outcalls.

204
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,150
把那些畫面再跟我描述一次
Tell me again of the visions.

205
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,720
泛黃的面孔
Yellowed faces...

206
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,980
身體布滿了皮疹和水皰
bodies overcome by rash and blister...

207
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,090
許多人死去
death in great numbers.

208
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,860
是把這個物件拿出來的時候看見的嗎
And this came to you as the artifact was brought to life?

209
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,650
是的
Yep.

210
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,910
你說這東西是從哪兒來的
Where did you say it came from?

211
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,930
鎮子里所有東西的來源  船只
Where everything in this town comes from... a ship.

212
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,760
"偉大的儀式"
Ritum Magni.

213
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,900
大祭典
The grand rite?

214
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,840
我們所了解的只來自傳說  流言  神話
Most of what we know is lore... rumor, legend.

215
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,830
這里提到了這個物件 "惡靈" 
It says this object, this "Malum,"

216
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,820
在歷史上
has thought to be present

217
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,690
每次大祭典中都會出現
at every grand rite throughout history.

218
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,470
我看過的資料顯示
Everything I have read has said that the grand rite

219
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,950
大祭典的嘗試從未成功過
has only ever been attempted, never completed.

220
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,760
或許瘟疫只是祭典的一部分
Maybe plague's only part of it.

221
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,670
這是邪惡之物
This object is evil.

222
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,170
它為惡魔回歸祝圣
It consecrates the earth for the devil's return.

223
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,660
它是被寄送過來的  本該有人接收
It was here for delivery. Someone was expecting it.

224
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,990
一個巫師
A witch.

225
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,130
我們必須立刻通知行政委員們
We must inform the selectmen immediately.

226
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,870
不行
No.

227
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,680
為什么不
No?

228
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,290
我們有巫師想要的東西
We have something the witches want.

229
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,590
沒什么比這個更能吸引他們的注意
What better way to get their attention?

230
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,710
沒什么比這個更能讓你送命
What better way to get yourself killed?

231
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,540
我們都身處險境
We are all in danger,

232
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,070
但我寧可死去
but I would rather die

233
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,140
也不要落入塞勒姆的異徒手中
before Salem's finest control my fate.

234
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,280
你跟我一起嗎
Are you with me?

235
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,710
不在那邊  你這可恨的怪胎
Not over there, you infernal mutant!

236
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,900
在這邊
Over here!

237
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,320
就是他
That's him.

238
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,510
治安官把你帶走的真正目的是什么
And the magistrate's true purpose in taking you from me?

239
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,400
眼見為實
My eyes betrayed my sense

240
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,680
霍爾夫人確實病得打翻了便壺
when I came upon Mrs. Hale bent over her chamber pot.

241
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,130
如果你堅持要圓這個謊
If you insist upon this lie,

242
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,620
我就不得不問一句了
it forces me to ask

243
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,990
你現在如此匆忙離開又是要去哪兒
where you're off to now with such great urgency.

244
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,760
藥店
The apotek.

245
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,220
我手頭的珀希鼠李樹皮不多了
I run low on the bark of cascara sagrada.

246
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,340
當然了
By all means.

247
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,210
這就像教皇偉大的長袍
It's like the great flowing robe of the pope.

248
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,320
或者是國王鑲滿珠寶的王冠
Or the jeweled-up crown of a king.

249
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,920
這個要討厭得多  我敢保證
Well, it's quite disagreeable on -- I assure you.

250
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,720
想想看
Just think of it...

251
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,700
被英俊的麥哲牧師
being led through the market

252
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
指引著穿過集市
by the handsome reverend Mather.

253
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,310
他是什么樣的  梅西
What's he like, Mercy, hmm?

254
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,730
他會談到上帝和魔鬼嗎
Does he speak of God and demons?

255
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,580
我們聊過很多次
We've spoke many times.

256
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,550
他對我的遭遇很感興趣
He's shown great interest in my affliction.

257
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,860
是你伸出了手指
It's you who points the finger...

258
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,090
整個塞勒姆屏息以待
while all of Salem holds their breath and waits.

259
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,590
也不完全是那樣  我...
Well, it's not exactly like that. I...

260
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,150
如果我有你的本事  我知道自己該控訴誰
If I had your say-so, I know who I'd accuse.

261
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,110
誰
Who?

262
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,220
誰
Who?

263
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,220
她父親
It's her father.

264
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,140
她會指控自己的父親
She'd accuse her own father.

265
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,310
為什么
Why?

266
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,230
他成天逼她在大街上賣唱
Makes her sing in the streets all day long

267
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,430
而自己則在蘭姆的酒館里買醉
while he nurses the bottle at Lamb's --

268
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,980
賣唱  乞討
Sing and beg.

269
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,320
然后他將她賺來的錢全數拿去買酒
Then he takes what coin she's made for spirits

270
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,400
稍有不如意還對她拳腳相加
and beats her senseless for her troubles.

271
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,970
這是真的嗎
Is this true?

272
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,570
下個月我就滿十五歲了
I'm to be 15 next month,

273
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,010
他說到時候就要將我賣去妓院
and he swears to sell me to the Rod.

274
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,750
你父親要將你賣去妓院
Your father means to sell you to the whorehouse?

275
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,660
我要逃離這里
I'll run away.

276
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,460
就算他賣了我  我...  我要逃走
Even if he sells me, I'm -- I'll run.

277
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,490
我不會允許這種事發生
No one is running away.

278
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,280
決不允許
No one.

279
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,480
{\pos(194.462,139.091)}梅西

280
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,710
罪人還是救世主
Sinner or savior!

281
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,430
我們該如何辨別
How are we to know?!

282
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,630
看看那些被詛咒者所受的折磨
Look but to the torment of the damned,

283
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,680
好好想想天使與惡魔之間的區別
and think well of the difference betwixt angels and devils,

284
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:18,510
你就知道何為罪惡及其根源
and you will know what sin is and where sin resides!

285
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,970
你就別再繼續煽動大家的情緒了行嗎
How 'bout you not rile the crowd further than they are?

286
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,580
25美分一張
It's two bits a sheet.

287
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,960
我這還多著呢  除非你想把它們都買了
I'm still full up here, unless you'd like to buy me out.

288
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,160
不如直接揍你一頓更省事
Be loads more fun to beat you stupid.

289
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,620
霍爾小姐
Miss Hale.

290
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,840
奧登上尉
Captain Alden.

291
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,040
真是美好的一天
It's a fine day.

292
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,520
是嗎
Is it?

293
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,370
或許不是吧
Perhaps not.

294
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,460
正是  或許吧
Oh, indeed. Perhaps not.

295
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,770
或許塞勒姆將不會再有美好的明天
Perhaps there will be no more fine days in Salem.

296
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,160
或許美好時光已經離我們遠去
Perhaps the days of fine days are tragically behind us.

297
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,610
我有什么地方得罪你了嗎  霍爾小姐
Have I offended you, Miss Hale?

298
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,060
讓一個女人為你心存愛慕
Do you consider it offensive

299
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,400
而你的心卻另有所屬
raising hope in a heart most normally well-guarded

300
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,150
你覺得這是一種罪過嗎
while your own beats in the breast of another?

301
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,300
你覺得這種行為應受譴責嗎  奧登上尉
Do you, Captain Alden, find that reprehensible

302
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,440
-亦或只是無心之失  -這個  我
- or simply unkind? - Well, I...

303
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,070
還是你根本從未在意過這個問題
Or, most likely, you think not of it at all

304
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,790
或是我或是任何人  因為這就是男人的天性
or me or others, as is the wont and practice of most men.

305
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,230
西布里夫人
Ah, Mrs. Sibley.

306
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,740
安
Anne.

307
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,180
來得正是時候
Perfect.

308
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,390
你是否慶幸自己已不再年少無知
Are you ever grateful to be no longer young?

309
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,110
是的
Yes.

310
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,430
不過她的年少輕狂倒讓我想起了另一個人
Though her youthful moxie does bring to mind another.

311
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,070
我從未如此年少輕狂
I was never that young.

312
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,200
曾經  我們都是的
We were both...once.

313
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,180
你怎么會來集市
What brings you to market?

314
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:52,980
緹圖芭
Tituba.

315
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,510
我們約好在草藥師那見面
We were to meet at the herbalist.

316
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,550
這死亡之地倒挺適合你們倆的
A fine pair you two make in this place of death.

317
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,420
給她吧
Give it to her.

318
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,450
我需要時間
It will take time.

319
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,580
一旦你完成了立刻告訴我結果
And you will report to me as soon as you're finished.

320
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,770
不敢在此久留嗎
Afraid to stay?

321
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,580
我還有更有意義的事情要做
My time is better spent elsewhere.

322
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,640
這樣最好
For the best.

323
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,990
一個人只要沾染了黑暗之術
Once a man dabbles in the dark arts,

324
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,580
就很難再次回到光明
it's difficult for him to return to the light.

325
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,280
給我弄只兔子來
Fetch me a rabbit.

326
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,770
是的
Y-yes.

327
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,520
給我上去
Get on there!

328
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,300
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley.

329
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,840
布朗寧太太
Mrs. Browning.

330
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,230
別不好意思
Oh. No need to turn away.

331
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,540
他確實是個迷人的小伙
He is an arresting figure.

332
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,130
若不是我老眼昏花  我也會忍不住盯著他瞧呢
Only my old lady's eyes that keep me from staring myself.

333
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,600
別開玩笑了
Don't be ridiculous.

334
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,410
你還是不愿采納我的專業意見嗎
You still insist on ignoring my expertise.

335
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,120
沒錯
Yep.

336
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,470
我們可以用更專業
There are less pedestrian,

337
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,090
更和平的方式
less painful methods,

338
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,010
來達到我們的目的
with which we could accomplish our goals.

339
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,580
今晚一定要成功
It must happen tonight.

340
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,570
我們只有這一次機會
There will be no second chances.

341
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,810
普通人的法子對我來說就足夠了
The ways of the common are always good enough for me.

342
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,690
如果還能重創敵人  那就更好不過
And if it causes pain, so much the better.

343
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,640
看得出  她還在悶悶不樂
Still in a brown study, I see.

344
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,290
整天都沒說過一句話
Hasn't spoken a word all day.

345
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,230
她會好起來的
Mm. Well, she'll recover.

346
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,580
什么好起來
From what?

347
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,900
-你跟她說什么了  -沒什么
- What did you say to her? - Nothing.

348
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,930
只是想平復她內心不可避免的傷痛
Merely trying to spare her heart the inevitable woe.

349
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,050
不用擔心  親愛的
Worry not, my husband.

350
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,050
只要她成為柯頓·麥哲夫人
This will all be distant memory

351
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,240
這些就都只是遙遠的記憶了
Once she's become Mrs. Cotton Mather.

352
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,080
我在想
I wonder.

353
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:02,940
想什么
Wonder what?

354
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:08,500
如果他當初沒走  如果你當初可以嫁給他
If he'd never left, if you'd been allowed to marry,

355
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,790
如今與他成家立室
and found yourself now in that house of his

356
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,490
聽著小孩們無休止的哭鬧
with three squalling brats,

357
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:17,740
為了養家糊口無日無夜地工作
working ceaselessly to spread your meager wages...

358
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,570
奧登上尉對你還會有這么大吸引力嗎
Would Captain Alden still hold such desperate appeal?

359
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,610
還是你只是沉浸在一見鐘情的浪漫中
Or is it that you're trapped in first bliss,

360
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,460
刻骨銘心  無法自拔
romance from which there's no escape,

361
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,840
每當想起可能擁有的那一切
your heart ever hurting

362
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,670
便心痛得無以復加
from the imaginings of what could have been?

363
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:44,180
別在大庭廣眾下盯著他看  那會令你愈發軟弱
Do not stare at him in public. It weakens you.

364
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,470
你從來就沒想過吧  
It never even occurs to you, does it?

365
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,230
我也許早就不需要你的至理名言了
I might have outgrown your sage advice.

366
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,380
盡管她無法開口
Though she cannot speak...

367
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,380
但她將指引我們找到巫師
...she will show us the witch!

368
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,760
她將指引我們找到巫師
She will show us the witch!

369
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,810
[咒語]
Balbin, gab, gabor, agaba!

370
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,230
復活吧  我召喚你
Arise, I call thee!

371
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:26,230
[咒語]
Colpriziana, offina alta nestra,

372
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,530
[咒語]
Fuaro menut.

373
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,080
威廉·霍克  你是我要尋找的死靈
William Hooke, thou art the dead I seek.

374
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,150
威廉·霍克  回應我的召喚
William Hooke, answer my calling.

375
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,090
她將指引我們找到巫師
She will show us the witch!

376
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,190
盡管她無法開口
Though she cannot speak...

377
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,070
她將指引我們找到巫師
...she will show us the witch!

378
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,380
她將指引我們找到巫師
She will show us the witch!

379
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,810
她將指引我們找到巫師
She will show us the witch!

380
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,960
她將指引我們找到巫師
She will show us the witch!

381
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,840
她將指引我們找到巫師
She will show us the witch!

382
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,200
阻止她  牧師  她在讓你出丑
Stop her, reverend. She makes mockery of you.

383
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,060
快阻止她
Stop her!

384
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,770
威廉·霍克  你是我要尋找的死靈
William Hooke, thou art the dead I seek.

385
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,960
威廉·霍克  回應我的召喚
William hooke, answer my calling.

386
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,970
[咒語]  用力  呼吸
Fortis roa, strength and breath,

387
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,750
用力  呼吸  用力  呼吸
Strength and breath, strength and breath.

388
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,170
威廉·霍克  你是我要尋找的死靈
William Hooke, thou art the dead I seek.

389
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,500
威廉·霍克  回應我的召喚
William Hooke, answer my calling.

390
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,520
用力  呼吸  用力  呼吸  用力  呼吸
Strength and breath, strength and breath, strength and breath.

391
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,990
是你
You.

392
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,880
是我
Yes.

393
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:42,000
我還以為我們的買賣已經做完了
I thought our business concluded.

394
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,100
告訴我約翰·奧登的秘密
Tell me John Alden's secret.

395
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,230
到地獄來問我吧  婊子
Meet me in hell, you bitch.

396
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,620
有的地方可比地獄還糟
Oh, there are worse places than hell.

397
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,210
快說
Speak!

398
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,230
巫師
Witch!

399
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,410
天啊  艾米莉
Oh, no, Emily.

400
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,440
是你父親
It's your father.

401
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,140
怎么回事
What's happened now?

402
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,710
問你的主子去吧  我可不知道
Query your mistress. I haven't the faintest idea.

403
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,250
你的任務怎么樣了
What of your mission?

404
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,650
早該料到你在這里
Of course I find you here,

405
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,380
不去監獄里調查剛被指認出來的巫師
Not at the jail investigating this new witch,

406
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,840
不去查看梅西·路易絲
Not with Mercy Lewis,

407
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,230
倒是跑這兒來玩你那些天殺的玩具了
But here, alone, playing with your blasted toys.

408
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,050
看來我只能讓您不快了  西布里夫人
It seems I am determined to displease you, Mrs. Sibley.

409
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,980
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley.

410
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,500
別這樣
Please.

411
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,570
-抱歉  -請坐
- I'm sorry - Please.

412
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,540
告訴我  何事讓您如此煩心
Tell me... what troubles you.

413
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,370
那女孩已經迷失在權力之中
That girl has gone mad with power.

414
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:08,820
她受到同齡人的煽動  被不堪的爭論所影響
Encouraged by her peers, influenced by petty dispute.

415
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:14,260
行政委員們擔心她已經不再可靠了
The selectmen fear that she's no longer reliable.

416
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,440
胡說
Nonsense.

417
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,650
他們不確定是否還能信任她
They are uncertain that she can be further trusted.

418
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,540
這由不得他們決定
It is not theirs to decide.

419
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,030
我會對那女孩進行評估
I will assess the girl

420
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,940
決定她是否仍能勝任她的職責
and form my own opinion of her role.

421
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,160
你會這么做嗎  牧師
You would do that, reverend?

422
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,090
當然
Of course.

423
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,940
這許多的責任快將我壓垮了
I am torn and harried by my many responsibilities.

424
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,730
都是我的錯
It's my fault completely.

425
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,590
我沒考慮到這會給你帶來的負擔
I hadn't considered the toll this has taken on you.

426
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:44,190
在這種危急時刻  行政委員間的任何嫌隙
Oh, and a rift amongst the selectmen at this fragile moment

427
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:47,930
都可能成為我  或是塞勒姆  無法承擔的重負
might be more burden than I... or salem...could bear.

428
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,340
別擔心  西布里夫人
Worry not, Mrs. Sibley.

429
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,840
您召喚我前來主理這些巫師審訊
You fetched me here to run these witch trials,

430
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,860
我一定會盡我所能的
and run them I must.

431
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,670
謝謝你  牧師
Thank you, reverend.

432
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,380
知道至少還有一個人
What a relief to find

433
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,930
能分擔我的痛苦  真是太令人欣慰了
at least one who can relieve my hardships.

434
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,050
那是什么
What is that?

435
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:25,750
是一樣我正在研究的物件
It's an artifact that I'm researching.

436
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,980
和巫師有關嗎
Does it have to do with witches?

437
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,900
和大祭典有關
It's associated with the grand rite,

438
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:41,480
數個世紀以來屬于巫師的一種死亡儀式
a ritual of death attributed to witches over the centuries.

439
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:46,150
為什么這件物品讓你如此在意
And why does this object in particular concern you?

440
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,450
和巫師相關的所有事我都關心  夫人
Everything regarding witches concerns me, madam.

441
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,530
我們得做萬全準備
We cannot be too prepared.

442
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,220
看來您父親無暇前來對塞勒姆來說真是幸事
What luck for Salem that your father was unavailable.

443
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,740
小鎮的未來就仰仗你了  牧師
We will owe our future to you, reverend.

444
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,170
對此我十分確信
Of that I am sure.

445
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,740
那個秘密沒用
The secret is useless.

446
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,330
約翰·奧登可不會為了區區賭債而離開小鎮
John Alden will not leave town for a gambling debt.

447
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,940
她這么和你說的
That's what she told you?

448
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,480
她騙了我
She lied?

449
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,740
我會逼她說出真相的
I'll beat it out of her.

450
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,970
不需要
No.

451
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,830
難道緹圖芭不渴望大祭典嗎
Does Tituba not yearn for the grand rite?

452
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,970
事實上  還會有比她更渴望大祭典的人嗎
Is there another, in fact, that craves it more?

453
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,660
所以她會使用真正的秘密
So she'll use the real secret.

454
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,220
以她自己的方式  但是為了同樣的目的
In her own way, but for the same purpose --

455
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,880
來控制瑪麗
to control Mary.

456
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,600
另外還有個問題
We have another problem.

457
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,950
本該由威廉·霍克遞送的物件
The object William Hooke was tasked to deliver

458
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,140
現已落入旁人之手
has fallen into other hands.

459
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,110
威廉·霍克運送的到底是什么
And what exactly was William Hooke tasked to deliver?

460
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,580
惡靈
The Malum.

461
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,780
惡靈
The Malum?

462
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,020
我們必須做好準備  應對每一種可能
We must be prepared for every eventuality,

463
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,850
即使沒有了瑪麗·西布里
even one that does not include Mary Sibley.

464
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,800
這就是惡靈的作用
That is the malum's purpose.

465
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,560
它在誰手里
Who has it?

466
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,620
約翰·奧登
John Alden.

467
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,950
我在集市里找你來著
I looked for you at market.

468
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,320
藥店的存貨不夠了
The apotek ran low.

469
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,120
我只得自己去采藥
I was forced to pick the bark myself.

470
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,700
再有一句謊話  這就會是你的臨終遺言
The next lie to cross your lips will be your last.

471
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:30,040
你竟然威脅我  你唯一真正的盟友
You would threaten me, your one true ally?

472
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,890
就是說其他人都已背叛我了
So the others have turned on me.

473
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:34,780
沒錯
Yes.

474
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,960
-誰  -每個人
- Who?  - Each and every one.

475
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,860
蘿絲
Rose?

476
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,410
每個人
Everyone.

477
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,730
他們私下見面
They meet in secret,

478
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,530
談論你的弱點
speak of your weakness,

479
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:54,020
謀劃著要把約翰·奧登趕出塞勒姆
plot to rid Salem of John Alden.

480
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,140
怕他會讓我迷失自我
Fearful he has taken me from myself.

481
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:56,930
沒錯
Yes.

482
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,440
一派胡言
Nonsense.

483
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,880
一切盡在我掌控之中
I am most completely myself!

484
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,850
你沒有
You are not!

485
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,180
你陷入了愛河
You are in love.

486
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,890
讓我告訴你關于他的事  這個你愛的男人
Let me tell you about him -- this man that you love.

487
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,980
他是個殺人犯
He is a murderer.

488
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,470
-他不是  -他是
- He is not. - Yes.

489
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,080
他剛剛才又殺了一人  來保守自己的秘密
And he has killed yet another to keep his secret.

490
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,090
如果我告訴治安官  民兵們就會前來
If I tell the magistrate, the militia will come,

491
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,370
逮捕他  并且絞死他
they will take him, and they will hang him.

492
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,660
你說謊
Lies.

493
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,340
如果你希望約翰·奧登活著
If you wish for John Alden to live,

494
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,320
你就必須完成大祭典
you will complete the grand rite.

495
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,290
下輪滿月之前必須再有八人死亡
The next moon will see eight more dead.

496
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,400
你說謊
Lies.

497
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,960
死人從不說謊
The dead don't lie.

498
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,980
父親  你好
Hello, father.

499
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,440
我被關起來了
I'm locked up.

500
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,490
沒錯
Yes, you are.

501
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,320
為什么
What for?

502
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,740
你是個巫師
You're a witch.

503
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:14,540
酒鬼  出老千  騙子這些可能沒錯
A drunk, a card sharp, a two-timer, maybe.

504
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,590
可巫師嗎
But a witch?

505
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,320
我可不認同
I think not.

506
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,360
我是來道別的
I come to say goodbye.

507
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,870
謝謝你"無微不至"的照顧
and thanks for nothing.

508
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,170
不用多久  我就會被釋放
I'll be out of here in no time,

509
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:39,060
然后跟之前說好的一樣  我會把你賣了
and then you will be sold, just like we planned.

510
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,230
或者你會被絞死
Or you'll hang...

511
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,540
或被燒死
Or burn.

512
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:51,140
我們走著瞧  父親
We'll see, father.

513
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,270
走著瞧
We'll see.

514
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,010
霍普金斯小姐
Miss Hopkins?

515
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,430
霍爾小姐
Miss -- miss Hale.

516
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,900
這點小心意用來幫你度過
A small collection to help ease your circumstances

517
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,390
這段難過的時期
in this most trying time.

518
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:12,970
謝謝你
Thank you.

519
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,490
他會得到公正的審判的
He'll get a fair trial.

520
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,410
我父親會確保這一點
My father will see to that,

521
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,870
不然我會確保他這么做
or I'll see to my father.

522
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,050
你真是善良  霍爾小姐
You're most kind, Miss Hale.

523
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,920
這不是出于善良
Ah, it's not kindness.

524
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,850
他們吊死了我的朋友
They hung my friend.

525
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:40,820
我看著她亂踢  尖叫
I watched her kick and...scream

526
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,060
然后
and...

527
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,850
尿了褲子
soil herself.

528
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,550
我不想再袖手旁觀了
I will not do that again.

529
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,230
保持堅強
Stay strong.

530
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,860
是說實話的時候了
Time for truth.

531
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,670
我之前對你撒謊了
I lied to you earlier.

532
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,730
我也年輕過
I was young once --

533
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,850
年輕到相信善良美德
young enough that I believed in goodness.

534
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,270
我相信是因為我在你身上看到了它們
I believed in it because I saw it in you.

535
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:06,300
這就是你  即使不刻意
You can't help it. Y-you can't stop it.

536
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,570
你身上仍充滿著這種品質
You can't be any other way.

537
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,170
我想這就是為什么我那時愛上了你
And I think that's why I loved you.

538
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,370
想想我有多震撼
Imagine my surprise...

539
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:21,770
當我聽到你是殺人犯的時候
being told you're a murderer.

540
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,520
你不了解我
You don't know me.

541
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,660
什么
What?

542
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,210
你不了解我
You don't know me!

543
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:37,250
-我殺了二十個人  -不
- I killed 20 men. - No.

544
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,900
沒錯  二十個人
Yes. 20 men.

545
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,590
而他們唯一的罪就是來救我
And their only crime was that they had come to save me.

546
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,500
不  我不相信
No, I won't believe it.

547
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,900
信不信都是真的
Believe it because it's true!

548
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,830
幸運之人至死不憾
Lucky men go to their graves with no regrets.

549
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,650
而我不曾一日無悔
Barely a day passes when I don't have one.

550
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,950
有時  我們不得不做出選擇
Sometimes in life, we make choices.

551
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,580
而這些艱難的選擇
And sometimes, these -- these difficult choices --

552
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,020
會促使我們做出一些事  可怕的事
they lead us to do things, terrible things,

553
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,010
即便有違我們本意
and we don't wish to.

554
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,800
我們盡力避免
We'd do anything not to.

555
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,980
但選擇孕育選擇
But choice informs choice.

556
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,950
有時候  你的行為
Your actions, though your own,

557
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:31,200
并不代表著
They -- they don't resemble

558
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,380
你任何的期許或是愿望
anything you'd have wanted or wished for.

559
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,350
告訴我你也是這樣的
Tell me that it was like that,

560
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:41,570
告訴我那是個艱難的選擇
Tell me that it was a difficult choice,

561
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,450
你無能為力  求你了  求你了
a terrible thing, please, please,

562
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,980
這樣我才能繼續相信善良美德
So that I might still believe in goodness.

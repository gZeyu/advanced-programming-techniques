14
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,770
Previously on "Salem"...

15
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,790
- Do you ever wonder? - What?

16
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,430
If we could leave this place?

17
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,520
Gloriana, you mustn't be here.

18
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,520
What will you do here --

19
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,090
in the house of the lord?

20
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,010
What the hell are you doing here, Hooke?

21
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,100
Now, careful, captain... unless you do not mind me

22
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,290
telling the good people of salem

23
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,940
just who john alden really is.

24
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,850
The package shall be yours by midnight.

25
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,230
The familiar has been cut from her.

26
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,180
How?

27
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,660
An exorcism...

28
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,420
performed by her dolt of a father, no doubt.

29
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,620
So we must replace it.

30
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,640
My god.

31
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,440
The girl has been rendered frail by her circumstance.

32
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,330
She needs but a moment of rest.

33
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,960
After which, she will again be strong enough

34
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,130
to point the finger.

35
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,680
Open your mouth.

36
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,270
I know what you are.

37
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,250
Get 'em into a room, will ya?

38
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,200
I'll be back in two shakes.

39
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,100
You're leaving?

40
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,950
Are you deaf, girl?

41
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,130
Get 'em into a room!

42
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,450
Yes, mum.

44
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,930
I do not.

45
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,500
Yo'a'nes John Alden.

46
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,350
John Alden.

47
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,870
Yes?

50
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,510
Yes. Yes.

54
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,420
Yet, you say the man who holds the secret is dead.

57
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,560
Are we certain we can trust her?

59
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,900
I'm not so sure the servant is loyal.

60
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,640
I used to think your stubbornness a virtue.

61
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,090
And you don't any longer?

62
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,960
Why go alone when there is influence in numbers?

63
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,670
The girl has shown her color.

64
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,850
We are well beyond the point of intimidation.

65
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,440
Then perhaps we are at the point of elimination.

66
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,760
Perhaps, but for the time being,

67
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,500
She is worth much more to us alive than dead.

68
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,080
*Pound me the witch drums*

69
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,120
*Witch drums*

70
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,660
*Pound me the witch drums*

71
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,890
*Pound me the witch drums*

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,130
*The witch drums*

73
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,670
*Better pray for hell*

74
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:33,750
*Not hallelujah*

75
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,170
Look who's here, Mercy. Mrs.Sibley.

76
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,600
-Sit up straight, girl. - Leave us.

77
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,990
Leave us, reverend.

78
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,010
Yes.

79
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,040
Certainly.

80
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,330
You came to visit me last night.

81
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,860
Did I?

82
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,510
The time for coyness has passed.

83
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,920
It is clear you know exactly who and what I am.

84
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,060
The only question that remains

85
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,410
is what you will do with that information.

86
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,200
That depends on you, Mrs. Sibley.

87
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,710
What do you want, girl?

88
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,180
I want it to stop...

89
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,490
the torture, the torment, the suffering.

90
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,050
Or I will tell them.

91
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,580
I will tell them all who and what you are.

92
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,000
You know nothing of me...

93
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,070
or what I've done or given up

94
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,650
or endured to be who I am.

95
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,580
You are tortured because you resist.

96
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,150
Give in to me, and you will know only pleasure.

97
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,910
You torture me.

98
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,410
You put the snake inside of me.

99
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,670
You are the hag that bites my shoulder.

100
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,410
Careful, or your foolishness

101
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,390
will come to overshadow your usefulness.

102
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,600
You live still...

103
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,530
because I allow it.

104
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,500
You breathe only because I wish it.

105
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,790
You would kill me?

106
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,700
If you speak.

107
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,560
Stay silent, and you shall live.

108
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,010
My heart is deep and full.

109
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,820
It yearns to give you further chance to prove your worth.

110
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,870
Fail me, and you fail yourself.

111
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,360
The crag awaits your decision.

112
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,590
Damn it.

113
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,670
You sent for me?

114
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,380
Yes.

115
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,310
If your purpose is further humiliation

116
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,710
or probings of the heart,

117
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,870
I, for one, have had my fill.

118
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,740
My purpose is a proposition.

119
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,470
A business arrangement of sorts.

120
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,830
I'm listening.

121
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,060
In which you would tell me

122
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,280
the sum of your most fruitful week's bounty,

123
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:43,170
and I shall provide double in perpetuity...

124
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,030
for your company...

125
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,680
and your precious time...

126
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,650
in exclusivity.

127
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,870
So you wish to buy me outright.

128
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,400
I'm an only child.

129
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,320
I never learned to share.

130
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,150
Which is as close as a man like you comes to an apology.

131
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,050
Was it really so very painful for you

132
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,280
to see me with another?

133
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,590
Yes.

134
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,230
Will you be mine?

135
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,690
Cotton.

136
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,780
Captain Alden!

137
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,250
What brings you here?

138
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,900
This.

139
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,930
Are you sure, Dottie?

140
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,820
Are you sure she won't hurt us?

141
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,460
'Course she won't hurt us...

142
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,830
...unless you be a witch.

143
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,940
Hello, Mercy.

144
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,650
May we come in?

145
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,270
They come to you in your room, Mercy?

146
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,980
Them...

147
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,980
witches?

148
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,340
Sometimes...

149
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,040
And other times in other places.

150
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,860
Are they here with us now?

151
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,140
Can you see them as we speak?

152
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,990
No, I don't see them now.

153
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,580
Do they hurt you?

154
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,950
Sometimes.

155
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,910
What's it like?

156
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,880
What's it like?

157
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,960
To point your finger

158
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,660
and make them shake and tremble with fear.

159
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,000
To point your finger and watch them run.

160
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,160
No, it's not like that...

161
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,950
at all.

162
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,410
I swear.

163
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,820
No woman in Salem has ever had that kind of power.

164
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,750
Not even Mary Sibley.

165
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,640
You think I have sway...

166
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,780
...amongst all the people of Salem?

167
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,020
Your little finger points to life a-and death itself.

168
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,880
Tell us... what do the witches look like?

169
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,990
One more thing, Mrs. Sibley...

170
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,310
There was an overflow of parcels left on the britania,

171
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,050
all of which are to be delivered to a William Hooke.

172
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,320
Now, we've looked high and low.

173
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,860
No one could seem to locate the fellow.

174
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,450
I see. I'll take care of it.

175
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,470
Thank you, madam.

176
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,040
They will not find Mr. Hooke... not now, not ever.

177
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,610
I won't ask what happened to him.

178
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,600
Nor should you.

179
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,680
Then contain it before curiosity grows.

180
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,390
Uh, Mrs. Sibley, uh, good afternoon.

181
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,610
Might I borrow your girl?

182
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,760
The missus has taken ill with a batch of wayward mussels

183
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,790
and now begs relief with one of her exceptional tonics.

184
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,090
Please send Mrs. Hale my most urgent regrets.

185
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,720
Most kind.

186
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,910
Oh, Mr. Richards, uh, fetch for me a list of items

187
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,770
this Mr. Hooke was here to receive,

188
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,100
one that also perhaps includes their site of origin.

189
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,020
Right away, madam.

190
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,610
Your lie is clumsy.

191
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,020
No one is ill.

192
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,370
My mistress can see that as clearly as I.

193
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,050
Yes, well, when it comes to lies and subterfuge,

194
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,660
I defer to your expert endowments.

195
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,410
State your purpose or be gone with you.

196
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,700
My purpose is to rid this town of John Alden

197
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,170
once and for all,

198
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,190
unless that is a purpose for which you lack interest.

199
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,360
That was the same girl...

200
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,730
from Lamb's,

201
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,200
the one you threw a punch over.

202
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,130
Was it?

203
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,710
Wasn't aware they made outcalls.

204
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,150
Tell me again of the visions.

205
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,720
Yellowed faces...

206
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,980
bodies overcome by rash and blister...

207
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,090
death in great numbers.

208
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,860
And this came to you as the artifact was brought to life?

209
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,650
Yep.

210
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,910
Where did you say it came from?

211
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,930
Where everything in this town comes from... a ship.

212
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,760
Ritum Magni.

213
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,900
The grand rite?

214
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,840
Most of what we know is lore... rumor, legend.

215
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,830
It says this object, this "Malum,"

216
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,820
has thought to be present

217
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,690
at every grand rite throughout history.

218
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,470
Everything I have read has said that the grand rite

219
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,950
has only ever been attempted, never completed.

220
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,760
Maybe plague's only part of it.

221
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,670
This object is evil.

222
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,170
It consecrates the earth for the devil's return.

223
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,660
It was here for delivery. Someone was expecting it.

224
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,990
A witch.

225
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,130
We must inform the selectmen immediately.

226
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,870
No.

227
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,680
No?

228
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,290
We have something the witches want.

229
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,590
What better way to get their attention?

230
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,710
What better way to get yourself killed?

231
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,540
We are all in danger,

232
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,070
but I would rather die

233
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,140
before Salem's finest control my fate.

234
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,280
Are you with me?

235
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,710
Not over there, you infernal mutant!

236
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,900
Over here!

237
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,320
That's him.

238
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,510
And the magistrate's true purpose in taking you from me?

239
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,400
My eyes betrayed my sense

240
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,680
when I came upon Mrs. Hale bent over her chamber pot.

241
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,130
If you insist upon this lie,

242
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,620
it forces me to ask

243
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,990
where you're off to now with such great urgency.

244
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,760
The apotek.

245
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,220
I run low on the bark of cascara sagrada.

246
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,340
By all means.

247
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,210
It's like the great flowing robe of the pope.

248
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,320
Or the jeweled-up crown of a king.

249
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,920
Well, it's quite disagreeable on -- I assure you.

250
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,720
Just think of it...

251
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,700
being led through the market

252
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
by the handsome reverend Mather.

253
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,310
What's he like, Mercy, hmm?

254
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,730
Does he speak of God and demons?

255
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,580
We've spoke many times.

256
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,550
He's shown great interest in my affliction.

257
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,860
It's you who points the finger...

258
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,090
while all of Salem holds their breath and waits.

259
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,590
Well, it's not exactly like that. I...

260
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,150
If I had your say-so, I know who I'd accuse.

261
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,110
Who?

262
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,220
Who?

263
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,220
It's her father.

264
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,140
She'd accuse her own father.

265
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,310
Why?

266
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,230
Makes her sing in the streets all day long

267
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,430
while he nurses the bottle at Lamb's --

268
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,980
Sing and beg.

269
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,320
Then he takes what coin she's made for spirits

270
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,400
and beats her senseless for her troubles.

271
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,970
Is this true?

272
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,570
I'm to be 15 next month,

273
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,010
and he swears to sell me to the Rod.

274
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,750
Your father means to sell you to the whorehouse?

275
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,660
I'll run away.

276
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,460
Even if he sells me, I'm -- I'll run.

277
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,490
No one is running away.

278
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,280
No one.

280
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,710
Sinner or savior!

281
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,430
How are we to know?!

282
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,630
Look but to the torment of the damned,

283
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,680
and think well of the difference betwixt angels and devils,

284
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:18,510
and you will know what sin is and where sin resides!

285
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,970
How 'bout you not rile the crowd further than they are?

286
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,580
It's two bits a sheet.

287
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,960
I'm still full up here, unless you'd like to buy me out.

288
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,160
Be loads more fun to beat you stupid.

289
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,620
Miss Hale.

290
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,840
Captain Alden.

291
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,040
It's a fine day.

292
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,520
Is it?

293
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,370
Perhaps not.

294
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,460
Oh, indeed. Perhaps not.

295
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,770
Perhaps there will be no more fine days in Salem.

296
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,160
Perhaps the days of fine days are tragically behind us.

297
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,610
Have I offended you, Miss Hale?

298
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,060
Do you consider it offensive

299
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,400
raising hope in a heart most normally well-guarded

300
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,150
while your own beats in the breast of another?

301
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,300
Do you, Captain Alden, find that reprehensible

302
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,440
- or simply unkind? - Well, I...

303
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,070
Or, most likely, you think not of it at all

304
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,790
or me or others, as is the wont and practice of most men.

305
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,230
Ah, Mrs. Sibley.

306
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,740
Anne.

307
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,180
Perfect.

308
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,390
Are you ever grateful to be no longer young?

309
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,110
Yes.

310
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,430
Though her youthful moxie does bring to mind another.

311
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,070
I was never that young.

312
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,200
We were both...once.

313
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,180
What brings you to market?

314
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:52,980
Tituba.

315
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,510
We were to meet at the herbalist.

316
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,550
A fine pair you two make in this place of death.

317
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,420
Give it to her.

318
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,450
It will take time.

319
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,580
And you will report to me as soon as you're finished.

320
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,770
Afraid to stay?

321
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,580
My time is better spent elsewhere.

322
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,640
For the best.

323
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,990
Once a man dabbles in the dark arts,

324
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,580
it's difficult for him to return to the light.

325
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,280
Fetch me a rabbit.

326
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,770
Y-yes.

327
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,520
Get on there!

328
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,300
Mrs. Sibley.

329
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,840
Mrs. Browning.

330
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,230
Oh. No need to turn away.

331
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,540
He is an arresting figure.

332
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,130
Only my old lady's eyes that keep me from staring myself.

333
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,600
Don't be ridiculous.

334
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,410
You still insist on ignoring my expertise.

335
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,120
Yep.

336
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,470
There are less pedestrian,

337
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,090
less painful methods,

338
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,010
with which we could accomplish our goals.

339
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,580
It must happen tonight.

340
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,570
There will be no second chances.

341
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,810
The ways of the common are always good enough for me.

342
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,690
And if it causes pain, so much the better.

343
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,640
Still in a brown study, I see.

344
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,290
Hasn't spoken a word all day.

345
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,230
Mm. Well, she'll recover.

346
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,580
From what?

347
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,900
- What did you say to her? - Nothing.

348
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,930
Merely trying to spare her heart the inevitable woe.

349
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,050
Worry not, my husband.

350
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,050
This will all be distant memory

351
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,240
Once she's become Mrs. Cotton Mather.

352
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,080
I wonder.

353
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:02,940
Wonder what?

354
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:08,500
If he'd never left, if you'd been allowed to marry,

355
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,790
and found yourself now in that house of his

356
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,490
with three squalling brats,

357
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:17,740
working ceaselessly to spread your meager wages...

358
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,570
Would Captain Alden still hold such desperate appeal?

359
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,610
Or is it that you're trapped in first bliss,

360
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,460
romance from which there's no escape,

361
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,840
your heart ever hurting

362
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,670
from the imaginings of what could have been?

363
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:44,180
Do not stare at him in public. It weakens you.

364
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,470
It never even occurs to you, does it?

365
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,230
I might have outgrown your sage advice.

366
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,380
Though she cannot speak...

367
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,380
...she will show us the witch!

368
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,760
She will show us the witch!

369
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,810
Balbin, gab, gabor, agaba!

370
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,230
Arise, I call thee!

371
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:26,230
Colpriziana, offina alta nestra,

372
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,530
Fuaro menut.

373
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,080
William Hooke, thou art the dead I seek.

374
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,150
William Hooke, answer my calling.

375
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,090
She will show us the witch!

376
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,190
Though she cannot speak...

377
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,070
...she will show us the witch!

378
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,380
She will show us the witch!

379
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,810
She will show us the witch!

380
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,960
She will show us the witch!

381
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,840
She will show us the witch!

382
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,200
Stop her, reverend. She makes mockery of you.

383
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,060
Stop her!

384
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,770
William Hooke, thou art the dead I seek.

385
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,960
William hooke, answer my calling.

386
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,970
Fortis roa, strength and breath,

387
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,750
Strength and breath, strength and breath.

388
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,170
William Hooke, thou art the dead I seek.

389
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,500
William Hooke, answer my calling.

390
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,520
Strength and breath, strength and breath, strength and breath.

391
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,990
You.

392
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,880
Yes.

393
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:42,000
I thought our business concluded.

394
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,100
Tell me John Alden's secret.

395
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,230
Meet me in hell, you bitch.

396
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,620
Oh, there are worse places than hell.

397
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,210
Speak!

398
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,230
Witch!

399
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,410
Oh, no, Emily.

400
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,440
It's your father.

401
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,140
What's happened now?

402
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,710
Query your mistress. I haven't the faintest idea.

403
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,250
What of your mission?

404
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,650
Of course I find you here,

405
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,380
Not at the jail investigating this new witch,

406
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,840
Not with Mercy Lewis,

407
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,230
But here, alone, playing with your blasted toys.

408
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,050
It seems I am determined to displease you, Mrs. Sibley.

409
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,980
Mrs. Sibley.

410
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,500
Please.

411
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,570
- I'm sorry - Please.

412
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,540
Tell me... what troubles you.

413
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,370
That girl has gone mad with power.

414
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:08,820
Encouraged by her peers, influenced by petty dispute.

415
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:14,260
The selectmen fear that she's no longer reliable.

416
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,440
Nonsense.

417
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,650
They are uncertain that she can be further trusted.

418
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,540
It is not theirs to decide.

419
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,030
I will assess the girl

420
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,940
and form my own opinion of her role.

421
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,160
You would do that, reverend?

422
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,090
Of course.

423
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,940
I am torn and harried by my many responsibilities.

424
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,730
It's my fault completely.

425
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,590
I hadn't considered the toll this has taken on you.

426
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:44,190
Oh, and a rift amongst the selectmen at this fragile moment

427
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:47,930
might be more burden than I... or salem...could bear.

428
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,340
Worry not, Mrs. Sibley.

429
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,840
You fetched me here to run these witch trials,

430
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,860
and run them I must.

431
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,670
Thank you, reverend.

432
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,380
What a relief to find

433
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,930
at least one who can relieve my hardships.

434
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,050
What is that?

435
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:25,750
It's an artifact that I'm researching.

436
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,980
Does it have to do with witches?

437
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,900
It's associated with the grand rite,

438
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:41,480
a ritual of death attributed to witches over the centuries.

439
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:46,150
And why does this object in particular concern you?

440
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,450
Everything regarding witches concerns me, madam.

441
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,530
We cannot be too prepared.

442
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,220
What luck for Salem that your father was unavailable.

443
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,740
We will owe our future to you, reverend.

444
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,170
Of that I am sure.

445
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,740
The secret is useless.

446
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,330
John Alden will not leave town for a gambling debt.

447
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,940
That's what she told you?

448
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,480
She lied?

449
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,740
I'll beat it out of her.

450
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,970
No.

451
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,830
Does Tituba not yearn for the grand rite?

452
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,970
Is there another, in fact, that craves it more?

453
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,660
So she'll use the real secret.

454
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,220
In her own way, but for the same purpose --

455
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,880
to control Mary.

456
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,600
We have another problem.

457
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,950
The object William Hooke was tasked to deliver

458
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,140
has fallen into other hands.

459
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,110
And what exactly was William Hooke tasked to deliver?

460
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,580
The Malum.

461
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,780
The Malum?

462
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,020
We must be prepared for every eventuality,

463
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,850
even one that does not include Mary Sibley.

464
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,800
That is the malum's purpose.

465
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,560
Who has it?

466
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,620
John Alden.

467
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,950
I looked for you at market.

468
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,320
The apotek ran low.

469
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,120
I was forced to pick the bark myself.

470
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,700
The next lie to cross your lips will be your last.

471
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:30,040
You would threaten me, your one true ally?

472
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,890
So the others have turned on me.

473
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:34,780
Yes.

474
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,960
- Who?  - Each and every one.

475
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,860
Rose?

476
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,410
Everyone.

477
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,730
They meet in secret,

478
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,530
speak of your weakness,

479
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:54,020
plot to rid Salem of John Alden.

480
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,140
Fearful he has taken me from myself.

481
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:56,930
Yes.

482
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,440
Nonsense.

483
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,880
I am most completely myself!

484
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,850
You are not!

485
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,180
You are in love.

486
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,890
Let me tell you about him -- this man that you love.

487
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,980
He is a murderer.

488
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,470
- He is not. - Yes.

489
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,080
And he has killed yet another to keep his secret.

490
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,090
If I tell the magistrate, the militia will come,

491
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,370
they will take him, and they will hang him.

492
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,660
Lies.

493
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,340
If you wish for John Alden to live,

494
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,320
you will complete the grand rite.

495
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,290
The next moon will see eight more dead.

496
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,400
Lies.

497
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,960
The dead don't lie.

498
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,980
Hello, father.

499
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,440
I'm locked up.

500
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,490
Yes, you are.

501
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,320
What for?

502
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,740
You're a witch.

503
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:14,540
A drunk, a card sharp, a two-timer, maybe.

504
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,590
But a witch?

505
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,320
I think not.

506
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,360
I come to say goodbye.

507
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,870
and thanks for nothing.

508
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,170
I'll be out of here in no time,

509
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:39,060
and then you will be sold, just like we planned.

510
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,230
Or you'll hang...

511
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,540
Or burn.

512
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:51,140
We'll see, father.

513
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,270
We'll see.

514
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,010
Miss Hopkins?

515
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,430
Miss -- miss Hale.

516
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,900
A small collection to help ease your circumstances

517
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,390
in this most trying time.

518
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:12,970
Thank you.

519
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,490
He'll get a fair trial.

520
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,410
My father will see to that,

521
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,870
or I'll see to my father.

522
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,050
You're most kind, Miss Hale.

523
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,920
Ah, it's not kindness.

524
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,850
They hung my friend.

525
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:40,820
I watched her kick and...scream

526
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,060
and...

527
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,850
soil herself.

528
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,550
I will not do that again.

529
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,230
Stay strong.

530
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,860
Time for truth.

531
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,670
I lied to you earlier.

532
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,730
I was young once --

533
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,850
young enough that I believed in goodness.

534
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,270
I believed in it because I saw it in you.

535
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:06,300
You can't help it. Y-you can't stop it.

536
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,570
You can't be any other way.

537
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,170
And I think that's why I loved you.

538
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,370
Imagine my surprise...

539
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:21,770
being told you're a murderer.

540
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,520
You don't know me.

541
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,660
What?

542
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,210
You don't know me!

543
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:37,250
- I killed 20 men. - No.

544
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,900
Yes. 20 men.

545
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,590
And their only crime was that they had come to save me.

546
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,500
No, I won't believe it.

547
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,900
Believe it because it's true!

548
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,830
Lucky men go to their graves with no regrets.

549
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,650
Barely a day passes when I don't have one.

550
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,950
Sometimes in life, we make choices.

551
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,580
And sometimes, these -- these difficult choices --

552
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,020
they lead us to do things, terrible things,

553
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,010
and we don't wish to.

554
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,800
We'd do anything not to.

555
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,980
But choice informs choice.

556
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,950
Your actions, though your own,

557
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:31,200
They -- they don't resemble

558
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,380
anything you'd have wanted or wished for.

559
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,350
Tell me that it was like that,

560
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:41,570
Tell me that it was a difficult choice,

561
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,450
a terrible thing, please, please,

562
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,980
So that I might still believe in goodness.

563
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,910
I murdered 20 men.

564
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:05,590
And I make no excuses for myself.

565
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,670
Will you have me arrested?

566
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,130
I am the only one that knows.

567
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,190
Prince of darkness, master of all,

568
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,540
father of evil, hear our call.

569
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,850
Prince of darkness, master of all,

570
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,830
father of evil, hear our call. Prince...

571
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,340
...father of evil, hear our call.

572
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,970
Prince of darkness...

573
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,250
...father of evil, hear our call.

574
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,470
Prince of darkness, master of all,

575
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,820
father of evil, hear our call.

576
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:12,460
Prince of darkness, master of all...

577
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,780
Prince of darkness, master of all,

578
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:17,130
father of evil, hear our call.

579
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:24,220
...father of evil, hear our call!

580
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,850
Prince of darkness, master of all,

581
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:29,310
father of evil, hear our call.

582
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,990
Prince of darkness, master of all,

583
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:34,670
father of evil, hear our call!

584
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:37,230
Prince of darkness, master of all,

585
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,690
father of evil...

586
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:08,680
We had a deal.

587
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,550
Our deal no longer pleases me.

588
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,550
Then I ask again --

589
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:17,840
what do you want?

590
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,910
I want to be just like you.

14
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,530
Previously on "Salem"...

15
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,540
Tell me again of the visions.

16
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,250
Has thought to be present

17
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,510
at every grand rite throughout history.

18
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,950
You would threaten me, your one true ally?

19
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,790
So the others have turned on me.

20
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,780
Yes.

21
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,610
Rose?

22
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,160
Everyone.

23
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:24,880
I wonder.

24
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,040
Wonder what?

25
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,950
If he'd never left,

26
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,760
would Captain Alden still hold such desperate appeal?

27
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,450
Tell me John Alden's secret.

28
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,350
We had a deal.

29
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,150
Our deal no longer pleases me.

30
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,120
What do you want?

31
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,020
I want to be just like you.

32
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,210
The malum has fallen into other hands.

33
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,270
This object is evil.

34
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,940
It consecrates the earth for the devil's return.

35
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,400
You filthy pricks.

36
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,730
You coward!

37
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,960
What are we waiting for?

38
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,990
Saturn...

39
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,650
...planetary ruler of witches.

40
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,590
Have you been drinking?

41
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,590
Most certainly.

42
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,070
It's not every night I catch a witch

43
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,160
with a... a "Boob's trap" was it?

44
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,010
Lured here by that infernal box of yours,

45
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:22,960
the malum.

46
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,740
Once every 17 years, Saturn stations direct...

47
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,320
...exalted in its own house for a few brief moments.

48
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,680
This will happen today at nightfall.

49
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,690
And we care because?

50
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,600
A witch suspended beneath saturn

51
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,150
as it stations direct, exalted in its own house,

52
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,250
cannot lie.

53
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,230
Reputable sources say it is why

54
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,980
Odysseus himself dallied so long on Circe's Island.

55
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,280
Naughty lads.

56
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,540
We must haul her out into the woods...

57
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,890
You need to be punished.

58
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,080
...bend her beneath saturn as it stations direct...

59
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,660
And interrogate the witch.

60
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,050
I've calculated the precise spot,

61
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,930
but first we must secure her for travel.

62
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,110
Why does my house smell

63
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,440
like a pack of wild dogs pissed all over it?

64
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,290
What is this?

65
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,590
Canis urinam...dog piss.

66
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,520
Plus some medicinal plants.

67
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,820
Hellebore, nightshade, bloodroot...

68
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,030
In combination, the result is a powerful paralytic.

69
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,190
Hold this.

70
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,900
Hypodermic.

71
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,540
Ingenious, eh?

72
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,230
We live in remarkable times, captain.

73
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,630
New discoveries, new inventions every day.

74
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:48,010
New weapons... to fight an old enemy.

75
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,740
Come on down, boys. The darkness is waiting for you.

76
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,620
We need to inject this mixture into her veins.

77
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,160
Get ready.

78
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,360
Come closer.

79
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,670
The darkness wants to taste you.

80
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,790
Hold her still!

81
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,160
John!

82
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,550
Son!

83
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,030
Why are you doing this to me?

84
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,580
- Mother? - It hurts so!

85
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,790
She's in hell, captain.

86
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,390
She's the devil's favorite whore.

87
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,000
She loves it there.

88
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,940
No, captain, don't! It has to be precise!

89
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,390
That will do.

90
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,230
*Pound me the witch drums*

91
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,380
*Witch drums*

92
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,940
*Pound me the witch drums*

93
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,140
*Pound me the witch drums*

94
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,310
*The witch drums*

95
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,860
*Better pray for hell*

96
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:20,840
*Not hallelujah*

97
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,960
Afraid she'll steal the silver?

98
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,380
She is a dirty little creature.

99
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,670
So was I when you first brought me here.

100
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,390
When are you going to kill her?

101
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,510
Clean her up. Give her something to wear.

102
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,350
And burn all her things.

103
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,170
She won't be needing them anymore.

104
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,490
Truth be told,

105
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,470
I long for a good look at her brain.

106
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,360
Her brain? I can barely look at her face.

107
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,390
I believe that our abilities

108
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,550
are regulated by our brains.

109
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,450
I wonder if the devil has changed her somehow materially.

110
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,320
Perhaps some region of her brain is abnormally enlarged.

111
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,360
Or perhaps some region of yours.

112
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,780
Hurry, or we'll be dead before tomorrow.

113
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,260
Observe, child,

114
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,900
the quintessence of devoted marriage,

115
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,290
how carefully I attend to my dear husband's toilet...

116
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,360
...and how fearlessly

117
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,720
he exposes his throat to my blade.

118
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,020
Come along, Miss Mercy.

119
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,830
Leave her.

120
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,850
Take him with you, Tituba.

121
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,330
One's too few, and three's too many.

122
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,820
Your eyes...

123
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,820
So filled with want.

124
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,350
The hard part's not getting what you want, child.

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,350
The hard part's knowing what you want.

126
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,100
But I do.

127
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,700
I do know what I want.

128
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,420
Mm, of course... to be just like me.

129
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,040
Someday.

130
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,650
I hope I may be.

131
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,490
Well, it's better to travel hopefully than to arrive.

132
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,810
A story?

133
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,910
Why, yes, please.

134
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,590
I haven't heard one in such a long time.

135
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,910
Not since my mother died.

136
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,220
No.

137
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,400
Puritan fathers don't care much for stories.

138
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,360
We women keep them alive.

139
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,830
Yes.

140
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,750
This one has all my favorites.

141
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,990
You may borrow it, if you like.

142
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,190
No.

143
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,530
Father says girls have no need to learn to read.

144
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,110
He would read the only book worth reading

145
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,290
and read it to me.

146
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:42,650
And then, one day,

147
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,800
he would find the right man to take over the job.

148
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,150
God's will.

149
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,540
Not my god.

150
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,820
Mine likes us to read for ourselves.

151
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,050
Perhaps I shall teach you to read someday.

152
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,990
In the meantime, I'll tell you one...

153
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,300
...from memory...

154
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,170
about...the queen of the night

155
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,670
and how she became queen.

156
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,810
Not all queens start as princesses.

157
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,290
Some begin in ashes.

158
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,770
Indeed.

159
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,490
Okay.

160
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,540
Once upon a time, there lived a maiden,

161
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,870
hair as black as night...

162
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,040
...skin as white as snow.

163
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,650
And the maiden, she loved a handsome prince.

164
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,630
And the prince loved her.

165
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,920
Come.

166
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,840
Okay.

167
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,090
But there was an evil king,

168
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,340
and he sent the prince to his death.

169
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,160
And the poor maiden,

170
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,240
her heart turned gray as ash.

171
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,050
One night, in her despair,

172
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,840
a fairy came to her

173
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,450
and promised her that all the world would be hers

174
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,670
if she would but give up the last of her love

175
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,180
for her dead prince.

176
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:26,340
And though she wept to lose the only part of him

177
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,570
that still lived deep inside her...

178
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,960
she did as she was told...

179
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,350
in the hopes that all her dreams might still come true.

180
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,180
And so it came to pass

181
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,470
that the ash maiden was brought to the king's castle.

182
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,180
There, she met a servant who hurried her inside.

183
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,530
And through the scullery door,

184
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,430
she watched the lords and ladies of the land

185
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,100
enjoy a sumptuous feast

186
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,540
with the evil king and his queen.

187
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,440
And at this feast,

188
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,070
a dark prince slew the old queen

189
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,390
with an invisible wave of his hand...

190
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,880
...clearing the way

191
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,240
for the ash maiden herself to become queen.

192
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,820
And did she?

193
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,480
Did she what?

194
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,540
Become queen?

195
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:43,790
Yes.

196
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,760
But you know the worst part about becoming queen?

197
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,710
What?

198
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,270
It often requires marrying a king.

199
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,040
And so the ash maiden married the evil king and became queen,

200
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,970
her wedding night a consummation of joy and pleasure.

201
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,430
But none of it hers.

202
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,130
That night, she felt one monster on top of her

203
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,760
and another inside.

204
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,760
And she glimpsed what her soul was becoming

205
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,070
and learned her first lesson as queen...

206
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,380
be careful what you wish for.

207
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,880
She served as the queen to the evil king

208
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,690
for two years that felt like 2,000.

209
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,370
But when she could take no more,

210
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,750
she begged the fairy to turn her back into the ash maiden.

211
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,420
But the fairy refused

212
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,980
and showed her all the kingdom that lay before her

213
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,210
and said all this might still be hers.

214
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:12,160
You know why the Mathers and the Sibleys

215
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,390
and the Aldens and the other founding families

216
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,340
really picked this spot to be their new Jerusalem?

217
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:24,480
This town will become one of the richest on earth.

218
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,130
And who controls Salem controls the new world.

219
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,560
The ash maiden understood there was no turning back.

220
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,070
She would embrace her role as queen

221
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,660
and all the power that came with it.

222
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,440
That night, for the first time, she would use that power.

223
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,180
And that night,

224
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,800
the whole world began to turn upside-down.

225
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,440
Stop your silly games, girl.

226
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,100
Come here.

227
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,990
For it was not by a kiss

228
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,860
she might make a frog into a prince,

229
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:03,400
but by a kiss she might make a king into a toad.

230
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,860
Or even...

231
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,470
I must bind you.

232
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,040
Ah, but even bound...

233
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,770
You are far too much man for me.

234
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,460
I need some help to handle you.

235
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,150
Do you like games, George?

236
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,360
Yeah. Yeah.

237
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,990
- You like games? - Yes.

238
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,210
And so the queen came to rule

239
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,610
the king and all his kingdom,

240
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,960
and thus became the queen of the night.

241
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,540
And so she lived happily ever after.

242
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,350
But how... how are we here?

243
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,840
We're...in the woods.

244
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,340
We were in your room. You locked the door.

245
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,070
There are many doors to many places...

246
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,550
for a witch.

247
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,820
I never said you were that.

248
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,880
I-I'd never point my finger at you.

249
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,890
I swear.

250
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,210
I wouldn't. I-I won't.

251
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:26,940
No.

252
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,010
You most certainly won't.

253
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,880
Well done, my little hunter.

254
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:59,290
Enough of these, and I, too, will grow wings and fly south.

255
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,460
You only meet two kinds of creatures in the woods...

256
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,290
the hunters and the hunted.

257
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,670
Thank the moon we are what we are.

258
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,140
At least for today.

259
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,970
The call of a great gray owl,

260
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,310
Saturn's mascot.

261
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,960
It's nearly time.

262
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,440
A bit faster.

263
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,180
It's nearly in position.

264
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,300
We must be directly beneath Saturn.

265
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,130
Then what?

266
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,710
Then we get the one chance,

267
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:05,070
a moment to ask our questions and receive the answers.

268
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,210
Then we must kill her before the paralytic wears off.

269
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,500
Or she kills us.

270
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,290
That would be the most likely outcome.

271
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,540
I presume your flintlock will do the trick.

272
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,880
Unless it doesn't.

273
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,970
A gun puts all your faith in the weapon,

274
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,030
not the hand.

275
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,620
It either fires, or it don't.

276
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,840
8 out of 10 times, it works.

277
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,680
But I don't think we can afford that gamble.

278
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,010
Then how about a sword?

279
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,800
You surprise me, Mather.

280
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,220
I fenced a little at school.

281
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,750
Any good?

282
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,650
The most fearsome in all the divinity class.

283
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,300
Well...

284
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,890
This just may do.

285
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,380
I shall get it.

286
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,520
What is it?

287
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,150
The samhain is missing.

288
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:13,940
What?

289
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,930
Why would father be meeting with Mrs. Sibley's servants?

290
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,290
The good lord knows.

291
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,260
More "Busy-ness," I'm sure.

292
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,330
I swear I don't know what this world comes to.

293
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,010
Everyone is all to obsessed with their "Busy-ness."

294
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,540
It's the future, mother.

295
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,120
Bringing goods from far away, taking them on still further,

296
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,040
It opens new worlds.

297
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,090
And it's "Business," Mother, not "Busy-ness."

298
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,780
It's all "Busy-ness" To me.

299
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,160
Now tell him.

300
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,350
Say it .. this is what you want.

301
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,330
Yes! Yes! Yes!

302
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,670
All the world shall be yours.

303
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,710
We're nearly in position...

304
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,160
Just past the crag.

305
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,040
This is it.

306
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,590
We do it here.

307
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,460
Here?

308
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,100
I guess I should be grateful you brought me

309
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,120
To the second most unpleasant place I've ever seen.

310
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,320
Great place to interrogate a prisoner, Mather.

311
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,150
It's not I who pick.

312
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,070
The old bastard saturn himself, 

313
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,330
he's right overhead.

314
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,980
We must raise her here and now.

315
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:58,530
Suspend her from that tree directly beneath the sky

316
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,570
And let the planet loosen her tongue.

317
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,540
How is our Miss Rose holding up?

318
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,110
Hasn't blinked an eye.

319
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,010
Good. 

320
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,080
That's good.

321
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,150
Hurry. Just a minute to go.

322
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,630
The paralytic is wearing off!

323
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,710
Okay. All right.

324
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,220
We're losing the moment!

325
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,970
Pull!

326
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,620
There. That should hold it.

327
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,700
Just a half moment more, and then she must speak!

328
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,570
Thank you, sir. May I have some more?

329
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,020
- God.  - Again. Do it again.

330
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,090
The darkness is going to eat you little men.

331
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,190
For the love of christ.

332
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,080
Bring 'round your two whores.

333
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,040
Oh, we will have a party.

334
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:41,130
Gloriana and Mary Sibley.

335
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:45,260
You ran away from big, bad George Sibley,

336
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,620
Afraid of what he might do.

337
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,260
Poor Mary had nowhere to run.

338
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,120
She faced down the puritans 

339
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,850
with the only thing that she had...

340
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:59,690
That bottomless pit between her thighs.

341
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,130
And where were you, Captain Alden?!

342
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,350
Alden, wait!

343
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,260
Wait!

344
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,990
Yes!

345
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,810
Speak, damn you! Saturn compels you to the truth!

346
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,890
What would you know?

347
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,720
Everything.

348
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,190
South, my friends.

349
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,190
Someday soon, we will fly south.

350
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,110
No puritans there and no snow.

351
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,970
Like a flea in a blanket we will be...warm.

352
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:54,640
You will go someplace far warmer than that

353
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,690
If you don't remember who's in charge, cunning man.

354
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,070
Almost as quiet in her movements

355
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,880
As the mistress herself.

356
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,540
I taught Mary Sibley everything she knows.

357
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,300
And how often it is that apprentice surpasses master.

358
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,380
Silence!

359
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:14,600
The Samhain is missing.

360
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,050
She's not in salem.

361
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,540
She must be in these woods... your woods.

362
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:26,020
We have not seen her.

363
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:34,680
We did see a witch in the woods tonight,

364
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,850
But not Miss Rose.

365
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,930
Your mistress, the one you taught everything,

366
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,170
Including, apparently, 

367
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,570
how to make her own doors.

368
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,550
Take care, cunning little man.

369
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,970
It's a dangerous world.

370
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,590
Remember whose side you're on.

371
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,710
What is the grand rite?

372
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,290
Death.

373
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,470
For who?

374
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:18,160
For you and all like you.

375
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,260
Why?

376
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,110
For all you've done

377
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:26,070
And to stop all you will do.

378
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:27,740
How?

379
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:31,450
Cruor innocentia.

380
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:35,550
Sacrifices consecrate

381
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:38,310
the land to our lord.

382
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,100
Cruor innocentia.

383
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,890
"Innocent blood."

384
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,980
Sacrifices.

385
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,040
Then you have not yet begun.

386
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,830
We have begun.

387
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:52,630
Innocent blood flows.

388
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,540
There have been no unexplained deaths,

389
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,110
no missing children.

390
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,690
You can have committed no sacrifices.

391
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:03,090
It's not a sacrifice unless it hurts.

392
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,770
Are you hurting, Mather?

393
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,250
What is she saying?

394
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,470
What do you mean?

395
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,760
What do you mean?

396
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,120
Cotton, we have to kill her.

397
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,060
No. You tell me what you mean!

398
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,370
You think you can dangle me like a puppet?

399
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:42,710
You're the puppets, all of you... puppets!

400
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,750
Neopheyn!

401
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,340
Barbas!

402
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,190
Aligon!

403
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,800
Anaboth!

404
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,360
Madicon!

405
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,590
Furcas!

406
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,710
Her spell has raised the dead!

407
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,750
So, I have found you.

408
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,930
I owe you so much.

409
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,930
I remember all you taught me...

410
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,860
how to think like a puritan,

411
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,170
to see through their greedy eyes...

412
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:15,900
these woods were really mighty ships

413
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,580
and houses in the making...

414
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,010
and how, one day, 

415
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,990
we would use their unquenchable desire to seize control.

416
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,410
All goes exactly as planned.

417
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,960
And yet, you brought the malum to salem

418
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,600
without my knowledge.

419
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,220
Why, Rose?

420
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,370
John Alden.

421
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,890
He is just a man.

422
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,720
I am no mere girl to fall to pieces for a man.

423
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,770
True malice,

424
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,270
like that which powers the grand rite,

425
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:51,500
ferments best in a loveless heart.

426
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,420
I have looked into your heart, 

427
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,430
and it is anything but loveless.

428
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,820
You still love John Alden.

429
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,360
I couldn't take the chance.

430
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:04,530
There is no part of all this,

431
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:08,350
from your broken heart to the grand rite itself,

432
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,290
that I have not planned.

433
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:15,360
I put the very thought in George Sibley's head

434
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,710
that he ought to to send John Alden away.

435
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,470
It was you.

436
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,320
Not a step have I not foreseen,

437
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,900
Right down to your bringing the girl here to the woods

438
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,030
to kill her.

439
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,850
And you.

440
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,350
How came you to be here?

441
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:38,010
Ah, I allowed myself to be captured

442
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:40,440
and interrogated by them.

443
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,540
Oh, really?

444
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,370
Why?

445
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:49,310
To find out, once and for all,

446
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:53,580
what is in John Alden's heart.

447
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,790
You should be flattered.

448
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,340
All you've become...

449
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,370
The poor fool,

450
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:05,000
he still loves you and always will.

451
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,900
But I need your heart.

452
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,650
I need it broken.

453
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:14,310
And nothing breaks the heart like death.

454
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,590
I merely saved Salem the cost

455
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,380
and your Isaac the trouble

456
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,810
of transporting their bodies to the crag.

457
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,170
Have you met our newest sister?

458
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,840
What?

459
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,570
I thought you said

460
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,380
Saturn would compel her to speak the truth.

461
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:38,330
It did.

462
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,550
What truth?

463
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,010
I heard only riddles.

464
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,200
Sometimes, the truth is a riddle.

465
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,300
And the answer?

466
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,400
I don't know.

467
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,560
I must think and then think again.

468
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,390
In the meantime,that...

469
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,330
creature is still out here.

470
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:59,020
I spent most nights for many a year alone in the woods

471
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,640
Knowing there was someone ready to slit my throat

472
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,400
in every shadow, behind every tree,

473
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,670
but you still got to sleep.

474
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,270
Besides, she won't show her face again in Salem.

475
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,480
She knows she wouldn't even rate a trial.

476
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:18,360
Straight to the noose, straight to hell.

477
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,500
I admire your sangfroid.

478
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,890
French for "Cold blood."

479
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,450
It's a compliment.

480
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,030
Thanks.

481
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,900
I admire your...

482
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,520
Hey, don't hurry me. I'll think of something.

483
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,240
Well, you came into these woods a bookworm.

484
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,610
You're walking out a hunter.

485
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,420
A hunter without a catch.

486
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,060
Ah, yeah, but that's good...

487
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:53,870
A hungry hunter.

488
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,150
That's the most dangerous kind.

489
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,180
Captain Alden.

490
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,980
Reverend Mather.

491
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,650
Evening, Mrs. Sibley. 

492
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,290
You're out late.

493
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:24,260
I'm often sleepless.

494
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,570
And I find the...night air calms me.

495
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,050
And you two?

496
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,660
We were just...tracking

497
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,900
the retrograde movement of saturn.

498
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,230
Taken up astrology, captain?

499
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:45,860
You know what they say.

500
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,980
The fault's not in us but the stars.

501
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,210
I think you may have that the wrong way around.

502
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,120
Good night to you both.

503
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,250
I would ask what really happened to you tonight.

504
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,550
But?

505
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,280
You'd never tell me.

506
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,640
I know you.

507
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,310
Walk you home?

508
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,950
Met the dark man, did you?

509
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,770
One of us now, are you?

510
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,640
There are plenty of tools in the shed out back...

511
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:41,480
Pickaxe, auger, drawknife...

512
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:45,640
and you are somewhere on that list, missy,

513
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,580
somewhere between a hammer and a saw.

514
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:57,450
The lady of the house is mine,

515
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,390
my lady.

516
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:03,100
Now, you best not forget that.

517
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,240
I see I got here in time

518
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,030
before you could drown the poor girl.

519
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,200
Or dunk her as a witch.

520
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,210
Tituba.

521
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:18,780
Is that any way to talk about your new little sister?

522
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,480
You couldn't do it, could you?

523
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,000
You looked into those big eyes, 

524
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,880
and you lost your resolve.

525
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,040
I looked into those eyes,

526
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,810
and I saw myself staring back.

527
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,860
And then I knew.

528
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,250
There was another way.

529
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,520
She cannot point at me and say "Witch"

530
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,400
When she's one herself.

531
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,210
I'll finish here.

532
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,410
You know, Mercy,

533
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,760
this once lived in the sea, 

534
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,730
as did we.

535
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:23,550
Men think of themselves as rock,

536
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,220
hard as stone.

537
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,320
So they are.

538
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:33,240
Hard, brittle, 

539
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,260
easily broken.

540
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:40,380
Women know that we are mostly water.

541
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,560
Sea around us...

542
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,700
Sea inside us.

543
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,710
When I hurt, 

544
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,310
I remember that.

545
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,830
I remember what water is, 

546
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,180
what it does.

547
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,340
It flows.

548
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,020
It changes.

549
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:07,000
It endures far longer than the rock.

550
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,030
Oh, I know you went through hell this night,

551
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,460
as I once did.

552
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:20,720
Mercy...

553
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,350
You will never face hell again...

554
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,440
Alone.

555
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,240
Father?

556
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,450
Come, child.

557
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,850
It's time we talked about your father.

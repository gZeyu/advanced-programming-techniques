第一季  第七集

14
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,990
《塞勒姆》前情提要
Previously on "Salem"...

15
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:04,790
"伟大的仪式"
Ritum magni.

16
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,070
大祭典
The grand rite?

17
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,340
这里提到了这个物件 "恶灵" 
It says this object, this "Malum,"

18
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,260
在历史上
is thought to be present

19
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,280
每次大祭典中都会出现
at every grand rite throughout history.

20
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,750
这是邪恶之物
This object is evil.

21
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,460
它将使大地生灵涂炭  以迎恶魔回归
It consecrates the earth for the devil's return.

22
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,820
这是一个包裹  那一定有收件人
It was here for delivery. Someone was expecting it.

23
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,590
就是说其他人都已背叛我了
So the others have turned on me.

24
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,620
没错
Yes.

25
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,010
每个人
Each and every one.

26
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:23,800
萝丝
Rose?

27
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,970
每个人
Everyone.

28
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,760
如果你希望约翰·奥登活着
If you wish for John Alden to live,

29
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,950
你就必须完成大祭典
you will complete the grand rite.

30
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,500
什么是大祭典
What is the grand rite?

31
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,970
你们以为可以把我像垂线木偶一样任意摆布吗
You think you can dangle me like a puppet?

32
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,060
你们才是木偶  你们所有人  木偶
You're the puppets, all of you -- puppets!

33
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:43,590
我记得你说过
I thought you said

34
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,720
土星会迫使她说出真相
Saturn would compel her to speak the truth.

35
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,580
没错
It did.

36
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,970
有时候  真相就是一个谜语
Sometimes the truth is a riddle.

37
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:49,600
那谜底呢
And the answer?

38
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,160
我得好好思索一番
I must think and then think again.

39
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,550
父亲
Father?

40
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,780
来吧  孩子
Come, child.

41
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,970
是时候来谈谈你父亲的事了
It's time we talked about your father.

42
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,230
你未经我同意把恶灵带到了塞勒姆
You brought the malum to Salem behind my back.

43
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,280
他们将无一幸免
Not one of them will survive.

44
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,940
照这样下去  我们也是一样
Nor the rest of us, at this rate.

45
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,660
我们已被困十天
10 days becalmed.

46
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,140
水和食物快消耗光了
Nearly out of food and water.

47
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,340
除非借助东风
We've no hope 

48
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,940
否则我们毫无希望
unless we catch the wind.

49
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,600
我们要借助的不是东风  船长
It is not the wind that we must catch, captain.

50
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,220
是巫师
It is a witch.

51
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,110
看着我  小姑娘
Girl, look at me.

52
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,670
我们已经调查过所有你认为是巫师的
We have searched every passenger and crew member

53
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,520
乘客和船员
for your supposed witches.

54
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,670
毫无发现
None were found.

55
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,390
船上有个巫师
There is a witch on this ship.

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,300
你能懂我意思吗  船长
You understand me, captain?

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,400
为了阻止我  他将杀光所有船上的人员
The witch will kill everyone aboard in order to stop me.

58
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,410
我们会找出这个巫师的
We will find the witch.

59
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,650
别出错
Make no mistake.

60
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,310
否则下一个就是你
It could just as well be your head.

61
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,170
萝丝未经我同意把恶灵带到了这儿
Rose brought the malum here behind my back

62
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,800
想要背着我完成大祭典
to complete the grand rite without me.

63
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,650
是谁的提议让清教徒的矛头
Whose idea was it to turn the puritans' hatred

64
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,060
对准他们自己
against themselves?

65
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,940
利用他们来完成
To use them to achieve

66
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,430
诸世纪以来的第一场大祭典
the first grand rite in centuries?

67
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,400
是谁让大祭典得以实现
Who made that possible?

68
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,510
是我
Me.

69
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,690
而你和那个贱人却不相信我
Yet you and that foul bitch mistrusted me.

70
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,080
你罪加一等  因为你低估了我
And much worse for you, you underestimated me.

71
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,480
但杀了死亡之神
But killing the Samhain,

72
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,570
你知道这样做有多严重吗
do you have any idea what you've done?

73
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,230
问题不是
The question

74
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,220
我有没有意识到它的严重性
is not whether I understand what I have done,

75
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,400
而是你有没有意识到你现在该干什么
but whether you understand what you must now do.

76
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,140
我明白了
I do.

77
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,620
你拥有了古老的权利
You have claimed the ancient right.

78
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,170
我奉你为新任的死亡之神
I recognize you as the new Samhain.

79
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,970
我愿意臣服于你的力量  为你浴血奋战
I will honor and obey your power, earned in blood,

80
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,810
我会传话给其他人的
and share the word with the rest of the hive.

81
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,940
狩猎满月即将来临
Full hunter's moon is soon upon us.

82
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,640
届时我们还需要八名死者
We need eight more dead by then.

83
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,900
我有个计划...
And I have a plan...

84
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,020
只需一着  就能让我们离目标咫尺之遥
to put us within reach of our goal with one single move.

85
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,860
一次获得三个祭品
Three sacrificed all at once.

86
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,640
但你给我听清楚了
But mark me well --

87
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,840
如果任何人敢违背我的意愿  我唯你是问
If anyone goes behind my back, I hold you responsible.

88
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,070
你会付出代价的
You will pay for it,

89
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,730
不然就是你的妻子和女儿
or your wife and sweet daughter will.

90
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,130
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

91
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,390
*鼓鸣震天*
*Witch drums*

92
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,790
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

93
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,130
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

94
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,310
*鼓鸣震天*
*The witch drums*

95
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,840
*宁入地狱*
*Better pray for hell*

96
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,900
*不留人间*
*Not hallelujah*

97
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,190
间谍
A spy?

98
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,150
什么意思
What do you mean?

99
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,290
他在为法国人卖命吗
Is he working for the French?

100
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,040
不
No!

101
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,810
当然不是
Of course not.

102
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,870
我不应该告诉你的
I should have said nothing.

103
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,970
但你的疑心迟早会致我们于死地
But your infernal snooping only endangers us all.

104
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,070
你父亲是个秘密间谍
Your father is a confidential agent.

105
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,130
他只是偶尔会为一个
He makes very occasional reports

106
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,630
外国势力机构提供一些情报
to agents representing another foreign power.

107
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,590
是谁  他为什么要这样做
Then who? And why?

108
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,530
是谁重要吗
What does it matter to whom your father speaks?

109
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,570
都是政治而已  亲爱的
It's just politics, dear.

110
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,950
没什么大不了的
Of no import.

111
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,190
没什么大不了
No import?

112
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,360
你是说我父亲是个叛国贼这没什么大不了的吗
That my father is a traitor is of no import?!

113
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,150
不许你这么说
Never say that.

114
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,760
你父亲不是叛国贼
Your father is not a traitor.

115
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,340
他是一个有着崇高理想的人
He is a man of the highest ideals!

116
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,650
他所做的一切都是为了你
Everything your father he does, he does for you.

117
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,710
为了你好  你少插手他的事情
Keep out of his affairs for your own good.

118
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,300
你少糊弄我了  母亲
I am utterly unconvinced by your story, mother.

119
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,740
他就这么突然消失在我眼前
He seemed to vanish before my eyes.

120
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,260
我不会道歉的
I make no apologies.

121
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,440
我绝不会无视眼前所发生的一切
And I choose to walk through life with my eyes open.

122
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,170
就像你一样
Unlike you.

123
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,600
我知道你觉得我是个完全没主见的蠢女人
I know you think me a stupid woman with no curiosity,

124
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,610
但你不明白
but you don't understand.

125
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,030
问题是一旦你知道真相
The problem with knowing things

126
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,240
你就再也无法视而不见
is that you can never unknow them.

127
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,270
来了吗
Has it arrived?

128
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,030
耐心点
Patience.

129
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:31,980
这就是...
This...

130
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,120
我期待已久的船上传来的信息
...message I've been waiting for from the ship.

131
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,670
无风
Windstille.

132
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,170
"我们被困了
"We are becalmed. 

133
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,600
他调查了一番  但没有结果"
He searches, but I remain hidden."

134
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,220
如果他们没能看住他
If they fail to hold him,

135
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,610
他可能随时会来
he could arrive at any time.

136
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,620
你警告了玛丽·西布里了吗
Have you warned Mary Sibley?

137
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:56,690
没
No.

138
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,740
她对德国人的事一无所知
She knows nothing of the Germans

139
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,720
她也不知道我和他们有联系
nor of my contact with them

140
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,690
更无法预料即将到来的威胁
nor of the impending threat.

141
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,140
如果他们真有能力牵制住他
If they succeed in keeping him at bay,

142
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,230
她也就没必要知道了
then she has no need to know.

143
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,900
如果他势不可挡
And if he cannot be stopped,

144
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,720
游戏就又有得玩了  不是吗
well, then it's an entirely new game, isn't it?

145
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,550
这可能带来很多威胁  你不该告诉她吗
It threatens everything. Shouldn't you tell her?

146
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,960
情报就是力量
Knowledge is power.

147
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,480
说到力量
And with regard to power,

148
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,800
如今她的力量已经足够之多
she has more than her share at the moment,

149
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,960
你说是吗
wouldn't you agree?

150
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,260
你确定这么做是正确的吗
Are you sure you've done the right thing?

151
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,160
当你拉我入伙的时候  你确定吗
Were you sure when you brought me in?

152
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:34,730
我确定
Yes.

153
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,080
我救了你的命
I saved your life.

154
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,500
我会一直保你平安
And I will never cease saving it.

155
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,330
我知道
I know.

156
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,360
过来
Come.

157
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,070
我必须找到恶灵
I must find the Malum.

158
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,390
就在约翰·奥登手上
John Alden has it.

159
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,180
是的
Yes.

160
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,920
他也知道自己手握权柄
And he knows he has something of power,

161
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,120
巫师们不惜性命也要夺回手中
something witches would kill and die for.

162
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,410
他一定会将它藏在隐匿之处
He will have well-hidden it.

163
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,910
那你要怎么找
Well, then how will you find it?

164
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,570
我打算搜寻他的意识
I've a mind to search his mind.

165
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,170
梦游术吗  不行
Dream walking? No.

166
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,260
一定还有别的办法
There has to be another way.

167
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,330
时间不多了  缇图芭
We're running out of time, Tituba.

168
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,960
没有恶灵和它带来的一切
Without the Malum and all it contains,

169
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,650
大祭典便无法完成
our grand rite is not possible.

170
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,500
相信我
Trust me.

171
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,730
进去之后我会立刻找到恶灵
Once inside, I'll find the Malum,

172
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,560
随即离开
and then I'll get out.

173
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,730
进去
Inside?

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,670
你要进入不是房屋而是人心
It is not a house you invade but a man!

175
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,000
这个人还很特别
And not just any man.

176
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,400
你确定是为寻找恶灵  而不是只想接近他吗
Are you sure it is the Malum you seek and not just access to him?

177
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,930
不管我对约翰有何私情
Whatever my personal feelings are for John,

178
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,440
我只是为了找到恶灵
I am only seeking the Malum.

179
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,600
你可曾想过
Do you have any idea

180
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,410
闯入他的梦境之中
what crawling around inside his dreams

181
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,440
对你们俩有何影响
could do to you and to him?

182
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,790
这可能会损毁你们两人的心智
It could leave either or both of you shattered,

183
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,570
无法分辨现实与梦境
unable to tell dreams from reality.

184
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,480
你可能会迷失或者被困在梦里
You could be lost, trapped!

185
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,830
还有别的办法能找到恶灵
There are other ways to find the Malum.

186
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,950
说实话  我很害怕
I cannot lie. I am afraid.

187
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,690
很好
Good.

188
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,190
怕是好事
Be afraid.

189
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,900
照看着我
Watch over me.

190
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,340
但这是我的选择
But this is my choice.

191
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,840
不管你是否帮忙  我意已决
I will do this with or without you.

192
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,860
缇图芭  现在就送我过去
Tituba, send me. Now.

193
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:36,690
{\an8}约翰·邓恩的诗《歌》

194
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,510
流星陨落  奔走采撷
Go now. Catch a falling star.

195
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,690
首乌似女  珠胎暗结
Get with child a mandrake root.

196
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,470
时光逝去  穿梭而至
Travel back where past years are.

197
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,420
恶魔足印  因循踏遍
Through the cloven devil's hoof.

198
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,270
汝之所求  皆在其心
What you seek is in his heart.

199
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,890
天使之术  现其所思
Know his thoughts through angel's art.

200
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,880
巫焰燎燎  万事皆备
As torches ever ready be,

201
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,570
穿越白昼之门  一  二  三
through daylight's gate step one, two, three.

202
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,730
你为什么等了这么久
Why have you waited so long?

203
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,640
玩得开心吗
Enjoying yourself?

204
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,950
我还没找到
I didn't find it yet.

205
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,790
但我知道我能
But I know I can.

206
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,930
这片海有问题
This sea is unnatural.

207
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,290
我能闻到  感觉到
I smell it. I feel it.

208
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,050
我们被笼罩在黑暗的术法之中
We are under a dark enchantment.

209
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,810
我们把船搜了个遍
We have searched high and low.

210
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,720
船上没有巫师
There is no witch on this ship!

211
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,580
我说绝对有
And I say there is.

212
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,780
每个人都盘查过了
We have searched everyone.

213
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,350
查了两遍  巫师到底在哪里
Twice. So where is the witch?

214
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,880
就在这里
Right here.

215
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,980
绳结在哪里  船长
Where is the knot, captain?

216
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,080
你的绳结藏在哪里
Where have you hidden the knot?

217
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,710
那绑住了海风的绳结在哪里
Where is the knot that binds the wind?

218
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,510
去死吧[德语]
Friss scheibe und stirb!

219
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:15,080
你不会活着到达新世界的[德语]
Sie werden die neue welt nie lebend erreichen!

220
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,750
我的脖子
My neck!

221
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,280
挂在我脖子上
Around my neck!

222
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,410
再见了[德语]
Auf wiedersehen.

223
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,990
船长  起风了
Captain, the wind's up.

224
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,020
船帆已经鼓满
The sails are full.

225
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,900
现在这条船归我管
I am now master of this ship.

226
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,940
告诉舵手  向西航行
Tell the helmsman due west.

227
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,120
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes...

228
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,340
打破一枚鸡蛋
and you break an egg.

229
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,840
然后想象自己的婚礼
And you imagine your wedding,

230
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,590
你站在教堂前面
so you're standing there in front of the meeting house

231
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,630
手捧鲜花
holding a bunch of flowers.

232
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,190
喜钟为你敲响
The bells are ringing for you.

233
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,810
等你睁开双眼
And then when you open your eyes,

234
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,050
就能看见未来丈夫的脸
you see the face of the man you're to marry.

235
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,730
但我们已经知道多莉会嫁给谁了
But we already know who Dollie'll marry.

236
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,010
糟老头乔·巴克
Stinky, old Joe Barker.

237
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,210
我才不会
I will not.

238
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,630
但你已经和他行连理之礼了
But -- but you've already bundled with him.

239
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,880
还没有
Have not.

240
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,310
马上就要了
But you're going to.

241
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,020
是的
Yes.

242
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,560
就在今晚
Tonight.

243
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,400
一定还有其他人更适合我
There's got to be someone else for me.

244
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,050
如果有
Well, if there is,

245
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,460
金星之镜会展示给你
The venus glass will show him to you.

246
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,290
但你得先把茶给喝了
But first you have to drink the tea.

247
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,760
全喝光
All of it.

248
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,390
你看到了吗
Did you see that?

249
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,800
你看到什么了
What did you see?

250
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,230
你看到乔·巴克了吗
Did you see joe barker?

251
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,790
没有  我...
No, I...

252
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,940
我不确定看到了什么  但...
I don't know what I saw, but...

253
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,100
我...
I...

254
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,880
我必须得走了
But I -- but I have to go now.

255
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,640
我快赶不上连理仪式了
Um, I'll -- I'll be late for my bundling,

256
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,520
如果破坏了这桩天赐良缘
And my mother will beat me

257
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,010
母亲会打死我的
for ruining a perfectly fine match.

258
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,010
我们都该走了
We all should go, too.

259
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,880
我做到了
I did it.

260
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,900
效果就像
And it worked just --

261
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,980
就像你描述的那样
just like you said it would.

262
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,970
我先给她下药
I-I gave her the potion first,

263
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,340
然后我在脑海中想象
and then I pictured it in my mind,

264
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,210
她就看到了
and she saw it.

265
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,200
这还只是开始
And this is just the beginning.

266
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,500
下一步你要助我将塞勒姆逼入绝境
Next you will help push Salem over the edge,

267
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,630
但首先
But first...

268
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,530
你得学会如何让灵魂脱离躯体
You must learn to walk wherever you will

269
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,820
任意游走
without your body.

270
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,680
主啊我祈求一睹你真容
I begged to see your face, lord.

271
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,260
难道我面前的就是吗
Am I looking at it now?

272
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,040
人们都说发疯的第一个征兆
They say it's the first sign of folly,

273
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,560
就是自言自语
talking to oneself.

274
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,840
我没有自言自语
I wasn't talking to myself.

275
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,810
我是对主祈祷
But to god.

276
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,590
或是我父亲
Or my father.

277
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,720
如果这两者有区别的话
If there is a difference.

278
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,500
你父亲在这儿吗
Is he here?

279
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,270
更糟
Worse.

280
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,470
在这儿
Here.

281
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,880
看来我们并没有想象中那么不同
I think we're not so different.

282
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,650
如果不是已经有了这么多烦心事
That would worry me immensely

283
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,390
听到你这么说还真是让我担忧
were I not already consumed with other worries.

284
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,240
显然有些真相不能在书里找到
And apparently there are some truths not contained in books.

285
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,830
实践
Knowledge

286
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,920
才能出真知
must be tested against the anvil of experience.

287
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,970
而我一直以为的真知却在昨晚被彻底颠覆
Last night my knowledge cracked like poorly forged steel.

288
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:56,990
听到那个巫婆说的话之后
After what that witch said,

289
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,170
我开始怀疑一切
I can be sure of nothing but my doubts.

290
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,060
对所有事物
I doubt everything.

291
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,490
我的书本  工具  方法
My books, my tools, my methods.

292
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,000
甚至我自己
Even myself.

293
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,520
那你就用自己所拥有的武器来战斗
Then you fight with the weapons you have.

294
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,540
你是指
Meaning?

295
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,230
如果你满腹疑云
If all you have is doubt,

296
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,440
就让怀疑成为你的武器
then you make doubt itself the weapon.

297
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,150
你质疑一切
You question everything.

298
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,030
甚至我自己
Even myself.

299
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,070
尤其是你自己
Especially yourself.

300
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,700
我相信主把我俩聚在一起是有理由的
I do believe god brought us together for a reason.

301
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,880
为了把对方逼疯吗
To drive each other insane?

302
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,850
不
No.

303
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,940
因为弥漫在塞勒姆的阴霾需要的光明之多
'cause the shadow over Salem requires more light

304
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,600
我们单独一人都无法提供
than either of us can provide alone.

305
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,920
你比任何人都更了解
You know more than anyone about...

306
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,380
了解一切
Well, everything.

307
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,010
你对梦境知道多少
So what do you know about dreams?

308
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,800
未被发现的国度
The undiscovered country.

309
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,450
什么
What?

310
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,180
梦境
Dreams.

311
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,830
多数人无视它
Most men dismiss them.

312
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,120
但根据我的计算
But by my calculation,

313
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,450
一个活满圣经全寿命70年的人
a man who lives his full biblical span of 70 years

314
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:18,530
会花其中的20年活在另一个梦境国度
will spend as many as 20 of them in another realm,

315
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,200
在那里一切都是幻境
where nothing is as it seems.

316
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,710
你认为梦境是真的
So you believe they're real?

317
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,800
没错
They are.

318
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,210
我们自己的新大陆
Our own private America,

319
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,720
一个充满恐惧和愉悦的新世界
A new world filled with equal parts terror and delight.

320
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,350
显然人不需要进鬼屋也能见着鬼
Apparently one not need be a house to be haunted.

321
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,070
你的意思是
What do you mean?

322
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,820
你不是唯一一个拥有无数欲望
You're not the only one who knows what it feels like

323
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,040
却只能在梦中成真的人
to hold desires that come true only in dreams.

324
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,130
每天早晨  我们都面临抉择
But every morning, we have a choice.

325
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,250
忘记梦境
Forget our dreams...

326
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,340
或者活在梦想中
or live them.

327
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,790
当我还是小姑娘的时候
My mother sewed Mr. Barker and me

328
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,430
我母亲把巴克先生和我缝进这个袋里
into this bag when I was a girl.

329
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,090
我们谈天说地  度过了愉快的夜晚
Such pleasant nights we spent talking of this and that.

330
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,840
这些缝线防止你们在婚礼当晚之前
That stitch keeps you from having too much pleasure

331
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,120
过度享乐
before the wedding night.

332
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,700
腰部以下安分点
Nothing below the waist.

333
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,680
你真的去过七角阁楼吗
Is it true you've been in the house of seven gables?

334
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,180
是的  我常去那
Oh, yes. Many times.

335
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,760
我朋友梅西如今就住在那儿
My friend Mercy lives there now.

336
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,940
你靠近她难道不会害怕吗
Aren't you afraid to be close to her?

337
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,100
不会
No.

338
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,300
那你害怕靠近我吗
Are you afraid to be close to me?

339
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,940
死丫头
Wicked girl!

340
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,140
这个睡袋见证了三代婚姻
That bag's seen three generations married!

341
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,710
这事没完  小丫头
This isn't over, little missy!

342
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,360
我会去告诉你母亲的
I'll take this up with your mother!

343
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,140
它在哪儿  亲爱的
Where is it, my love?

344
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,590
告诉我它在哪儿
Show me where it is.

345
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,510
我  我不明白
I-I don't understand.

346
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,130
-不明白吗  -不明白
- No? - No.

347
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,850
如今这一切说明什么
What does this mean?

348
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,020
你在乎吗
Do you care?

349
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,580
这是真的
It is,

350
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,330
我们在一起
we are.

351
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,670
你只要知道这个就够了
That's all that matters.

352
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,660
这样足够真实了吗
Real enough for you?

353
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,340
还是这样
Or this?

354
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,120
我得知道它在哪儿
I need to know where it is.

355
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,190
什么
What?

356
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,050
{\an8}吉尔斯·科里

357
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,060
我找到恶灵了
I found the Malum.

358
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,410
就在科里的坟墓里
It's in Corey's grave.

359
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,230
奥登把它藏在了科里的坟墓里
Alden has hidden it in Corey's grave.

360
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,320
我警告过你的
I warned you.

361
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,440
进入任何人的梦境都十分危险
Dream walking in any man is dangerous,

362
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,890
更别说是你爱的人了
let alone one that you love.

363
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,060
你可能会彻底地迷失其中再也出不来了
You could lose your way and never come back.

364
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,370
别再进入那人的梦境了
Keep out of that man's head.

365
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,640
那小婊子撕烂了我曾祖母的连理睡袋
Little bitch tore my great-gran's bundling bag.

366
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,690
你那个有口臭的儿子
And your stink-breathed boy

367
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,570
在你的宝贝睡袋上戳了个洞
poked a hole in your precious bag,

368
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,530
还想在我女儿身上戳一个
tried to poke one in my girl!

369
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,600
那个睡袋上
There's no holes in that bag

370
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,240
只有她逃走时撕开的洞
but the ones she tore running out.

371
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,130
谁会相信你们巴克家说的话
And who'd believe you or any Barker?

372
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,910
看见没  亲爱的  起作用了
See, my dear? It's working.

373
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,710
谁都知道你们是一伙骗子
Everyone knows you're a pack of liars

374
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,310
靠着欺骗我们大家才发家致富
and cheats getting rich off the rest of us.

375
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,470
你要是不停止侮辱我们家族
You stop talking filth about my family

376
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,120
我就让你不能再说话
or I'll stop you talking.

377
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,530
笑什么笑  小贱人
What are you laughing at, you little minx?!

378
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,730
巴克一族就算是乌合之众
Those Barkers may be a foul lot,

379
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,900
但是他们富得流油
but they have money enough,

380
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,750
配你这样的货色已经是绰绰有余了
and it was a fine match for the likes of you,

381
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,360
都是你犯蠢毁了这门好亲事
and you had to ruin it with your silly ideas.

382
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,230
奥登上尉
Captain Alden,

383
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,920
你这么匆忙是要去哪里
where are you off to with such urgency?

384
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,170
不去哪里
Nowhere.

385
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,910
就是  去呼吸一下新鲜空气
Just...taking in the air.

386
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,050
我完全理解
Oh, I understand completely.

387
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,950
你可能早已不习惯乡镇生活
You're not a man used to town life.

388
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:36,630
你的身体渴望着那种无拘无束的狂野
Your body probably longs for the wilderness.

389
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,090
上尉
Captain?

390
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,400
抱歉  我
I'm sorry. I...

391
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,050
我不知道自己突然怎么了
I don't know what overcame me.

392
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,640
请原谅我
Please excuse me.

393
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,840
奥登上尉  无上荣幸
Captain Alden. An honor --

394
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,050
见到你很高兴
and I hope a pleasure to see you.

395
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,040
你中意哪个呢
Anyone take your fancy?

396
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,110
是  我至少需要三个
Yes. I need at least three.

397
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,730
聪明女孩
Clever girl.

398
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,240
拜你让多莉看到的东西所赐
Thanks to what you made Dollie see,

399
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,350
镇里的人已经多半认为
the town is more than halfway to seeing 

400
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,080
巴克一家是巫师了
the Barkers as witches.

401
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,570
如今只需一点火花来引燃大火
Now one spark will light the fire.

402
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,410
记得我曾告诉过你的话吗
You remember all I told you?

403
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,500
是的
Yes.

404
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,510
但那真的有用吗
But will it really work?

405
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,200
我怎样才能离开我的身体
How will I leave my body?

406
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,040
想象你的极乐世界
Follow your bliss.

407
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,220
它会引领你脱离肉体
It will lead you out of your body

408
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,040
飞出窗外
and out of the window.

409
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,700
保持专注  并且记住
Stay focused and remember,

410
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:08,260
你今晚的任务是吓坏杜克太太
your job tonight is to terrify Mrs. Trask.

411
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,540
让她看到巴克太太
Make her see Mrs. Barker.

412
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,910
必须要让她四处宣扬自己被巴克太太攻击
She must tell everyone she was attacked by Mrs. Barker.

413
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,420
我明白
I understand.

414
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,950
你现在就要送我去了吗
Are you gonna send me now?

415
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,280
闭上你的眼睛
Close your eyes.

416
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,810
想象你要去的地方
Picture where you want to go.

417
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,520
多莉
Dollie?

418
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,700
该死  如果你不管管你那该死的猫
Damn. If you don't learn to control your damn cat,

419
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,470
我就亲手把它皮剥了
I'll skin it myself.

420
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,280
这不过是一场梦
This is but a dream.

421
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,390
生命本身也许就是一场梦
Life itself might be but a dream.

422
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,460
为何不及时行乐呢
Why not enjoy it?

423
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,060
别乱动  奥登上尉
Try to remain still, Captain Alden.

424
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,510
你在这做什么
What are you doing here?

425
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,990
学习上帝造物的神奇
Learning the wonders of god's own creation.

426
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,220
约翰
John?

427
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,950
你在哪  约翰
Where are you, John?

428
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,480
玛丽
Mary!

429
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,330
玛丽
Mary!

430
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,280
玛丽  快出来
Mary, come out now!

431
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,110
玛丽
Mary!

432
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,480
玛丽
Mary!

433
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,190
玛丽  玛丽
Mary! Mary!

434
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,020
玛丽  快出来
Mary, come out now!

435
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,770
玛丽  玛丽  快出来
Mary! Mary, come out now!

436
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,810
玛丽  玛丽  快出来
Mary! Mary, come out now!

437
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,610
-玛丽  -缇图芭
- Oh, Mary. - Oh, Tituba.

438
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,700
没事了
It's okay. 

439
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,080
你回家了
You're home.

440
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,550
你为什么还要回去
Why did you go back?

441
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,850
我跟你说了别回去
I told you not to go back.

442
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,740
你还让这个第一次的自己到处走
And you left this one to walk alone on her first time.

443
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,690
任何事都可能发生
Anything could have happened.

444
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,220
我知道  我很抱歉
I know. I'm sorry.

445
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,330
我只是想再见他一面
I just wanted to see him again.

446
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,950
我失去控制了
I lost control.

447
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,380
你穿上衣服
You get your clothes on.

448
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,370
你得来帮我忙
You're coming to help me.

449
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,550
不不  你要去哪
No, no. Where are you going?

450
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,340
去给你摘个苹果
Shh. To fetch you an apple

451
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,820
你在这平复一下
while you regain your control.

452
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,500
没事了
It's okay.

453
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:30,870
交给我  孩子
Hand it to me, girl.

454
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,010
她死了
She's dead!

455
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,050
杜克女士死了
Lady Trask is dead!

456
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,410
你干了什么
What did you do?

457
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,270
玛丽叫我做的事啊
What Mary told me to do.

458
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:00,490
她让你去恐吓那女人  不是杀了她
She told you to frighten the woman, not slaughter her.

459
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,740
但是她罪有应得啊
But she deserved it.

460
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,160
我们厌倦了
We're tired.

461
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,890
厌倦了被暴打被利用
Tired of being beaten and used.

462
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,020
我们不要再被利用了
We won't be used anymore

463
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,560
任何一人
Any of us.

464
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,820
我们不会再忍气吞声
We won't take it.

465
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,940
让开道  让开道
Make way! Make way!

466
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,780
艾萨克
Isaac! 

467
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,360
艾萨克  发生了什么
Isaac, what's happened?

468
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,490
杜克夫人死了  死得很惨
Mrs. Trask has been found dead -- horribly dead.

469
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,700
他们都认为是巴克一家干的
And they all think the Barkers are responsible.

470
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,360
经过那场争执和小多莉看到的一切之后
After the fight and what little Dollie saw,

471
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,330
又发生这事  他们开始叫他们巫师了
now this, they're calling them witches.

472
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,240
奥登上尉在哪
Where is Captain Alden?

473
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,840
哪也找不到他
He is nowhere to be found.

474
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,540
大家等一等
People, wait!

475
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,560
等下  你们干什么
Wait! What are you doing?!

476
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,120
他们是被诅咒的巴克一家
Those damned Barkers!

477
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,510
他们诅咒了我们太多人
They've cursed too many of us.

478
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,320
他们干了什么
What have they done?!

479
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,260
我们过冬的粮食都腐烂了
Rotted all our winter supply of grain!

480
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,050
她杀了善良的杜克
She killed goody Trask!

481
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:58,360
证据呢  你们有任何证据吗
Proof?! Have any of you any proof?!

482
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,620
让开道  说你呢
Make way! You there!

483
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,060
整个镇子都疯了
The whole town has gone mad!

484
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,510
我们得阻止他们
We have got to stop them!

485
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,390
没有什么比乌合之众更可怕了
Nothing more dangerous than a mob.

486
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,910
最好别进行干涉
Best not to intervene.

487
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,400
你是地方法官  你代表着法律
You are magistrate. You represent the law.

488
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:11,790
没有群众支持  法律毫无意义
The law's meaningless without support of the people.

489
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,210
朋友们  邻居们
Friends! Neighbors!

490
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:21,400
塞勒姆的人们  停手吧
People of Salem, stop!

491
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,420
想想你们要做的事
Think what you do!

492
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,020
你知道巫师存在
You know there are witches!

493
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,480
你告诉我们的
You've told us so!

494
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,530
而这里就是其中的三个
And here be three of them!

495
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,240
你要怎么处置他们
What will you do with them?!

496
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,750
如果他们是巫师  我们会辨明的
If they be witches, we will find out.

497
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,470
但这不是正确的方式
But this is not the way!

498
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,340
你就这么放过他们吗
Would you just let them go?

499
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,350
不
No.

500
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,730
不  我们把他们关进监狱
No, we put them in the jail!

501
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,460
我们关他们一晚来平复心情
We hold them for the night while passions cool.

502
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,110
而当天空明亮之时
And then in the clear light of day,

503
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,420
我们将会在法律范围内审判他们
we will examine them as the law allows!

504
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,140
我们之中每个人都有辩护的权利
Every one of us has the right to defend ourselves,

505
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,150
对我们的指责进行回应
to respond to our accusers!

506
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:00,480
杜克夫人死了  像羊羔一样被残杀
Mrs. Trask is dead, slaughtered like a lamb!

507
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,340
没错
True.

508
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,290
今夜不幸已经发生
Evil has been done this night already.

509
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,250
但是不要用更多的不幸来加重它
But do not compound it by doing more.

510
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:11,580
不要心急得去做无法挽回的事情
Do not rush to do what can never be undone.

511
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,350
如果他们现在有罪
If they be guilty now,

512
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:18,460
那么明早他们依然会有罪
they will be just as guilty in the morning.

513
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,570
但要通过公平的审判
After a fair trial.

514
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:27,760
说得没错
Quite right. 

515
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,120
各位  把他们送进监狱
Men, take them to the jail.

516
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,570
巫师  杀人犯  杀人犯
Witches! Murderers! Murderers!

517
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:36,940
杀人犯
Murderers!

518
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,050
柯顿  我觉得这是我见过最英勇的行为
Cotton, I think that was the bravest thing I've ever seen.

519
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,440
就像是看一个男人把头伸进狮子嘴
Like watching a man stick his head inside of a lion's jaws.

520
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,160
我会奖励你的英勇的
I would reward you for your bravery.

521
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,670
我很愿意接受
I would gladly accept it,

522
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,640
但现在不是时候
but now is not the time.

523
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,560
我不能再否认我的感情了  它们是真实的
I cannot deny my feelings. They are real.

524
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,780
我不再满足于只是你的顾客了
But I do not want any longer to be your customer.

525
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,480
你明白吗
Do you understand?

526
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,100
我想是的
I think so.

527
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,890
我还会见到你吗
Will I ever see you again?

528
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:20,830
当然
Yes.

529
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,170
但不是现在
But you must leave me now...

530
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,290
等我整理好一切
till I sort things out.

531
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,060
在那之后  一切都会不同
When I do, everything will be different.

532
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,820
我向你保证
I promise.

533
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:23,930
等等
Wait.

534
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,560
七年了  我已经等得够久了
Seven years is a long enough time to wait.

535
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,790
停下
Stop.

536
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,450
玛丽
Mary.

537
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,780
我知道你也梦见过这一切
I know you've dreamt of this.

538
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,290
面对梦境  你只能二选一
When it comes to dreams, you only got one choice.

539
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,600
彻底忘记
You forget them...

540
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,590
还是继续活在梦境中
or you live them.

541
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,640
我已经不想再试着去遗忘了
And I'm done trying to forget them.

542
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,850
如果我们活在其中的
And what if in living our dreams

543
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,960
是一场噩梦呢
they become nightmares?

544
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,580
只要你我在一起就够了
All that matters is you and me.

545
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,590
你总是将一切都说得很容易
You always make everything sound so simple.

546
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,050
你与西布里没有子嗣
You don't have any children with Sibley.

547
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,060
你也不可能在乎他
You can't care about him.

548
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,570
由始至终
You haven't cared about 

549
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,200
你也从不在乎旁人的想法  所以就这么一次
what other people have thought before, so for once...

550
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,620
让我们为自己而活
...let's just live for us.

551
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,340
我真希望可以这么做
I wish it were possible.

552
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,740
为什么不行
And why isn't it?

553
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,620
就是不行
It just isn't.

554
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,350
请你离开
I want you to leave.

555
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,340
不
No.

556
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,060
我已经从你身上得到想要的一切了
I've gotten all I needed from you.

557
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,770
请你离开
Please leave.

558
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,740
你到底是怎么了
What happened to you?

559
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,390
有什么是你没告诉我的
What are you not telling me?

560
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,940
这一切根本说不通
Because this makes no sense.

561
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,310
既然如此
Well...

562
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,100
很高兴能为您效劳
...I'm happy to have been of service.

563
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,910
怎么了  哪里起火了
What is it?! What's burning?!

564
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,010
是巴克一家  他们都被当成巫师烧了
The Barkers! All of them burned as witches!

565
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:04,850
什么
What?!

566
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,860
谁下的命令
By whose authority?!

567
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,200
是我
Mine.

568
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:12,980
父亲
Father.

569
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,680
我想我是对你那幼稚的好奇心
I see now I've indulged your juvenile curiosity

570
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,700
放纵过头了
far, far too much.

571
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,220
看看你
Look at you.

572
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:28,110
被这些软弱的理智道德工具所束缚
Surrounding yourself with all these feeble tools of reason.

573
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,750
但父亲  他们可能是无辜的
But, father, they might have been innocent.

574
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,880
无辜
Innocent?

575
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,930
他们哪里无辜了
Innocent of what?

576
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,470
这一家人是出了名的流氓无赖
The family is well-known as wastrels and curs.

577
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,190
他们没有经过审判  检查
They had no trial, no examination.

578
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,630
他们将会在最伟大
And they shall receive their trial

579
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,550
最仁慈的法官面前接受审判
before the greatest and most merciful of judges.

580
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,340
如果他们真是无辜的
Indeed if they are deemed to be innocent,

581
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,500
我相信上帝会好好回报他们的
I trust the lord will see to their recompense.

582
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:53,910
但你
But you...

583
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:58,910
你的智商都去哪了
you -- have you turned imbecile?

584
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:03,600
你做的一切只是埋下了致命的怀疑之种
All you do is sow the deadly seeds of doubt.

585
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,300
难道你不知道
Do you not see,

586
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,590
当追捕巫师时
when hunting witches,

587
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:11,410
宁可杀死一百个无辜者
far better a hundred innocents die

588
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:15,420
也绝不能放过一个巫师
than a single solitary witch walks free?

589
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,390
知道吗
Yes!

590
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,810
现在给我坐下
Now, sit you down.

591
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,770
好好想想你的过错
Consider your mistakes.

592
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,660
坐下
Sit.

593
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,330
你要去哪
Where are you going?

594
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,770
这个时候也没人能让你烧了
There's no one left to burn at this hour.

595
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,820
注意言辞  孩子
Watch your tongue, boy.

596
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:09,840
难道你以为如今我就不敢拿鞭子抽你了吗
You think you're too old to be whipped by your father, hmm?

597
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,580
你来迟了
You're too late.

598
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,530
我还以为你会来拯救我们
I thought you were going to save us.

599
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:52,620
但或许我们根本不值得被救
But maybe we just don't deserve saving.

600
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,930
我得承认  这是幅上佳的异教徒之作
It's a pretty piece of paganism, I'll grant you.

601
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,890
但恐怕不太适合公之于众
But not fit for public viewing.

602
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:16,440
所以我将它挂在了卧室
That is why it enlightens my bedroom,

603
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,420
只有我至亲至爱之人才能得见
where only my nearest and dearest are allowed.

604
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:24,500
比如你  亲爱的英克里斯
Like you, my dear Increase.

605
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,550
你不知道见到你对我来说意味着什么
I can't tell you what it means to see you.

606
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,260
伦敦的皇家法庭如何
How was London and the King's Court?

607
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:33,180
一如既往地腐败
Corrupt, as always.

608
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,500
国王批准了我们的新宪章
The king has granted us a new charter,

609
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,480
给予我们选择之地的所有权力
full claim on this chosen land of ours,

610
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,360
他还答应春季便会给我们指派一位新的长官
and he promises a new governor in the spring,

611
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,170
一位精通战术之人
a man experienced in warfare,

612
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:50,110
来助我们驱逐并根除那些异端匪徒
to help us purge and eradicate the heathen savages

613
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:53,280
永远地斩除他们
in our midst for now and forever.

614
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,150
看来你真是不虚此行
What a tremendous victory for you.

615
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,450
对我们来说都是
For all of us.

616
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,040
确实
Indeed.

617
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,730
当我踏上归途时  心中充满了喜悦
When I set sail for home, I was full of elation.

618
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:03,870
仿佛仅凭希望便能载我回家
I could have sailed on my hopes alone.

619
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,610
我早该预料到那些邪恶力量
I should have known that the forces of evil

620
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:09,420
会前来阻挠我
would try to hinder me.

621
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,230
谁
Who? 

622
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,130
法国人派来的奸细吗
Agents of the French?

623
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,030
巫师
Witches.

624
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,800
当然了  他们竭尽全力
Of course, they did all they could.

625
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,280
静止了海风  困住了帆船
They stilled the winds and trapped the ship.

626
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,040
四处传播疾病与异议
They spread disease and dissent all around.

627
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,340
许多人死了
Many died.

628
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:28,880
但他们不会白白死去
But they did not die in vain.

629
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,890
感谢上帝你能平安归来
Praise god you made it

630
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,650
为我们这个乌云笼罩的小镇带来一丝曙光
and landed safely on our shores to lighten our benighted town,

631
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,560
就像沉沉黑夜之后重现的耀眼太阳
like the sun returning after the darkest of nights.

632
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,950
玛丽·西布里
Mary Sibley,

633
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:43,580
无论黑夜多深
However dark the night,

634
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:49,850
也遮掩不了你双眸的光芒
your eyes still shine so brightly.

635
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,070
我依然坚信  就算保守病痛侵蚀
You know, I do believe my good friend George,

636
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:57,900
我的好友乔治仍然是塞勒姆最幸运的男人
for all his suffering, is the luckiest man in Salem.

637
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:03,740
这么说起来  我很想见见我这位好友
And speaking of my friend, I should like to see him.

638
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:04,470
可以吗
May I?

639
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:06,090
他如今状况很糟
He is particularly unwell.

640
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,120
好不容易  他现在终于睡着了
Thankfully, he's resting at present.

641
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,040
不如你明天再来
You must return tomorrow.

642
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:13,160
我相信你的到来一定会让他无比开心的
I'm sure the very sight of you will cheer him immensely,

643
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:14,280
就像我一样
As it has me.

644
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:17,100
您的到来对深陷黑暗的塞勒姆人民来说
Your presence in Salem can only be a tonic

645
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,020
真是一剂救命良药
for all of us in these dark times.

646
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:30,360
不知此次您会在镇上停留多久呢
How long may we enjoy your curative presence in town?

647
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,020
这个嘛
Why...

648
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,870
直到我见证那些恶魔的妓女
...until every last devil's whore of a witch

649
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,780
塞勒姆最后一个巫师死去
in Salem is dead.

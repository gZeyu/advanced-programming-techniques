14
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,110
Previously on "Salem".

15
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,460
Fornicator!

16
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:06,890
He searches.

17
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,440
So where is the witch?

18
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,470
Right here.

19
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,870
If he cannot be stopped,

20
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,720
well, then it's an entirely new game, isn't it?

21
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,870
Everything your father does, he does for you.

22
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,620
I no longer want to be your customer.

23
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,570
True love cannot be bought or sold.

24
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,140
Let's just live.

25
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,440
You still love John Alden.

26
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,660
The grand rite ferments best in a loveless heart.

27
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,790
He serves at my behest.

28
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,370
He won't come out for you.

29
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,140
Father.

30
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,590
My dear Increase.

31
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,980
How long may we enjoy your presence in town?

32
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,130
Until every last devil's whore of a witch

33
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,380
in Salem is dead.

34
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,480
Depravity.

35
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,050
Can there be a more apt word

36
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,850
to describe the current state of your fair city?

37
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,450
Drink, perversity,

38
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,680
abominations of each and every variety

39
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,880
offered and received.

40
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,230
And even as we cater to our inner demons,

41
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,840
we have allowed actual demons to flourish!

42
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,320
Witches!

43
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,330
He was not supposed to be here.

44
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,130
So why is he?

45
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,590
He came to see what his son had accomplished.

46
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,060
And why is he staying?

47
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,540
He saw what his son had accomplished.

48
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,980
There are witches hidden amongst us,

49
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,550
and you people of Salem,

50
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,470
seduced by drink and by flesh,

51
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,730
are happily blinded to it.

52
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,250
Standing before you,

53
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,470
with the certainty of the rising sun,

54
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,740
I assure you this will change.

55
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,220
Mrs. Sibley.

56
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,190
Reverend, 

57
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,880
your words are inspiration.

58
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,950
England's loss is our gain.

59
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,190
I trust your husband's condition is improving.

60
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,860
Sadly, no.

61
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,510
Well, please tell George

62
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,750
I shall visit him again at once.

63
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,480
Perhaps my presence may be of some comfort to him.

64
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,790
Oh, how could it not?

65
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,900
I have no words.

66
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,270
Like a man who's seen the face of god.

67
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,260
Only an awed silence is the appropriate response.

68
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,380
Your father.

69
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,780
And like that, the mood is ruined.

70
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,300
No, your... your father.

71
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,110
He's...he's in the common.

72
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,210
With a crowd, no doubt, hanging on his every word.

73
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,390
With a crowd, yes, but he's not speaking.

74
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,320
Well, then you must have him confused with someone else.

75
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,060
He's walking this way.

76
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,070
And by "This way," You mean...

77
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,930
He cannot find me here.

78
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,020
And where better to begin our cleansing of Salem

79
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,900
than in its most vile den?

80
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,680
The back stairs.

81
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,630
No, no, no, no, y-you'll cross the landing.

82
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,570
Gloriana, my father does not understand me.

83
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,320
He never has.

84
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,140
- If he discovers me... - Under the bed now.

85
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,490
- What?! - Under the bed now!

86
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,070
Where's my bible?

87
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,330
I-I-I don't see it!

88
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,890
Reverend Mather.

89
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,830
You know me?

90
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,930
Is there anyone in the province who doesn't?

91
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,020
You are alone?

92
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,120
No.

93
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,320
I'm here with my lord.

94
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,900
His words, anyway.

95
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,690
They offer great comfort in these perilous times...

96
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,170
Even for a woman like me.

97
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,950
Do you not sense it?

98
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,340
The commingling of sin and sorcery?

99
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,540
Take a breath.

100
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,150
You can almost taste it...

101
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,210
Satan's toxic nectar,

102
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,470
designed to divert and disarm.

103
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,290
The proprietress of this charming establishment.

104
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,030
What'll it be today, Reverend?

105
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,160
Thin and pliant,

106
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,100
or thick and playful?

107
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,670
Mind your betters, madam.

108
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,230
I run an honest house. 

109
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,560
You'll find nothing here.

110
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,490
I have made my name finding things

111
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,460
where there is nothing to be found.

112
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,140
Orris root?

113
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,450
Strangers tramp in and out of here every day.

114
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,690
I do not know what substances they carry.

115
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,130
Casting stones.

116
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,160
Selectmen of Salem...

117
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,830
We've uncovered a witch.

118
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,430
*Pound me the witch drums*

119
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,430
*Witch drums*

120
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,980
*Pound me the witch drums*

121
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,400
*Pound me the witch drums*

122
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,530
*The witch drums*

123
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,020
*Better pray for hell*

124
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:34,170
*Not hallelujah*

125
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,980
One of ours.

126
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,690
Exactly what we feared the minute he stepped off that ship.

127
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,970
Now, well, you know what this means.

128
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,000
Just because I don't share your panic

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,990
doesn't mean I don't grasp the stakes.

130
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,360
He will press her for names,

131
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,500
and whose will be she tempted to provide?

132
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,280
She was careless,

133
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,850
leaving objects of her craft so close at hand.

134
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,330
And for that carelessness, we may all burn,

135
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,240
to say nothing of what will become of our grand rite.

136
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,020
Your hysteria offers no solutions.

137
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,330
Mab simply needs to be reminded what is expected of her.

138
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,690
Her silence.

139
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,430
You're right.

140
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,260
I shall pay her a visit at once.

141
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,850
You're worried.

142
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,000
He is formidable, the senior Mather,

143
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,080
part bully, part bloodhound.

144
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,440
Mab has been loyal to the hive throughout.

145
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,950
It is not Mab that worries me.

146
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,220
Increase promises to pay another visit.

147
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,210
How long before he realizes

148
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,320
that George is not sick, but spelled?

149
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,660
And at whose hands? 

150
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,740
Mine.

151
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,150
Then prevent this.

152
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,610
Yes.

153
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,330
Increase may visit at his pleasure,

154
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,820
for what loving wife would leave her ailing husband at home

155
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,520
when his condition demands attention at once?

156
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,480
You're drinking early today.

157
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,620
If you knew my father,

158
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,610
you'd commend me for waiting this long.

159
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,880
You know, the way you speak of him, you make him sound --

160
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,000
Inhuman?

161
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,700
- Yes. - Good.

162
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,990
Then I have painted an accurate picture.

163
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,460
Don't believe me? See for yourself.

164
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,960
Cotton, I've been in search of you all morning.

165
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,380
I supposed I should have realized

166
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,800
you would be somewhere where whiskey is served.

167
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,550
Father, this is John...

168
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,890
John Alden.

169
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,500
Your father and I were classmates at university.

170
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,460
Yes, I know.

171
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,020
An honor, Captain.

172
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,690
Truly, I can have no greater respect

173
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,670
than for a man who has risked his life in battle.

174
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,550
Sadly, not all young men possess the same mettle.

175
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,040
What brings you, Father?

176
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,610
Well, I am shocked to discover

177
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,250
the extent of the depravity and immorality in Salem.

178
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,520
The people need a reminder of the wages of their sin.

179
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,070
And so they will get one.

180
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,600
In Sunday's sermon.

181
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,840
No. No.

182
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,700
They need to hear your voice now.

183
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,530
A public recitation on the commons,

184
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,140
illustrated by the face of sin.

185
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,010
The face of sin?

186
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,490
And who is that?

187
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,760
And Cotton?

188
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,460
Your Bible.

189
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,390
The hospital in Boston awaits him.

190
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,620
It is my only hope to find a cure

191
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,550
for his worsening condition.

192
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,040
And, Isaac, 

193
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,910
your feelings towards my husband

194
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,750
for what he once did...

195
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,140
they're understandable,

196
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,660
but to help him in his hour of need

197
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,820
shows me the true measure of you...

198
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,160
for which I am forever grateful.

199
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,340
We will be in Boston by daybreak.

200
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,410
A moment with the accused?

201
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,940
Yes, Magistrate.

202
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,360
You've come here to kill me.

203
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,380
It would be within my right to do so.

204
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,420
The code of the hive is clear.

205
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,180
But, no, we have agreed to spare you.

206
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,360
I would allow nothing else.

207
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,340
Still...

208
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,390
to the issue at hand.

209
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,820
He will interrogate you.

210
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,650
And I will give him nothing.

211
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,840
I will swallow the blackened pill before I betray the cause.

212
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,370
That will be your intent, yes,

213
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,100
Until he tortures you

214
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,680
and then, hearing your cries of pain,

215
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,280
tortures you some more,

216
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,290
at which point you will beg for him

217
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,160
to allow you to offer a name,

218
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,150
even if only to release yourself from the agony.

219
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,870
When that happens...

220
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,970
and it will happen...

221
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,790
I have just the distraction for you to provide.

222
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,430
Where do you go at night, father?

223
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,070
Anne. Awake at this hour?

224
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,820
Mother says I shouldn't ask such questions,

225
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,690
that I should simply be grateful

226
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,200
for the sacrifices you make on our behalf.

227
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,260
Nonsense. Ask whatever you like.

228
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,740
Tonight I was preoccupied with business of the town.

229
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,580
And do you believe she is a witch?

230
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,950
Who?

231
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,320
The woman you sought out at the jail.

232
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,850
You followed me?

233
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,520
I simply wanted to know what those sacrifices were

234
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,520
and why they seem to be so often made in secret.

235
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,710
First you snoop about in my room,

236
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,470
unearthing my belongings, and now...

237
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,170
No.

238
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,030
No? What?

239
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,570
No, I do not believe she is a witch.

240
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,880
She is but a sad, lonely woman.

241
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:47,940
I am glad to hear

242
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,330
there is some common sense left in Salem.

243
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,800
Good night, father.

244
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,070
Good night, dear.

246
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,980
Please! I am innocent!

247
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,450
You have pled guilty to the practice of witchcraft.

248
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:25,000
But such a plea is not sufficient to spare your life.

249
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,900
I want names of others.

250
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,320
I know of no others.

251
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,240
Again.

252
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,960
No! I swear I'm innocent!

253
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,400
He's insane.

254
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,370
On a good day.

255
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,210
Only the name of a fellow witch

256
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,830
will spare your life.

257
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,590
I know of no others.

258
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,190
I will ask again, but first a caution.

259
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,130
The next time, the saltwater that filled your mouth only

260
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,580
will travel down your throat into your lungs.

261
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,700
And then the taste you struggle to discern

262
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,830
will not be of water, nor of air, but of death.

263
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,390
A name.

264
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,030
Wait!

265
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,940
And I wait only for the name of a fellow witch.

266
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,390
And I will give it to you.

267
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,450
Her! Gloriana!

268
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,080
No.

269
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,890
No. No. No!

270
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,170
This is a mistake. No, father, this is a mistake.

271
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,630
Miss Embry is no witch.

272
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,290
You are here to observe, not to interfere.

273
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,720
Listen to me, father.

274
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,980
This is what I have tried to tell you,

275
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,750
and now I see it to be true 

276
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,380
that we have been wrong.

277
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,050
Cotton.

278
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,320
That in our zeal to rid satan from our midst,

279
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,140
we are instead killing innocents.

280
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,770
Do not presume to instruct me.

281
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,640
We are doing the devil's work for him!

282
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,110
And my life's work is a mistake?

283
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,240
Respectfully... yes.

284
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,270
Stand aside.

285
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,640
Please, father, I beg you -- spare her.

286
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,520
Get out of my way.

287
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,870
Listen to me!

288
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,440
I have.

289
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,800
And I will no longer let you act the fool.

290
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,000
You are sure it is I who acts the fool?

291
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,550
Cotton.

292
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,410
Take her to the cage.

293
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,010
Cotton. Cotton!

294
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,390
No.

295
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,090
Cotton! 

296
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,930
Cotton!

297
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,800
Oh, lord. What is it, Mr. Sibley?

298
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,110
Try to breathe, Mr. Sibley. That's it.

299
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,700
Slow breath, Mr. Sibley.

300
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,280
That's right.

301
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,850
That's it, nice and easy.

302
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,340
No!

303
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,710
Father!

304
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,160
Father, you have no evidence.

305
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,720
Nonsense. I have the word of an admitted witch.

306
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,360
A woman who practices the devil's craft?

307
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,630
You trust her to finger others?

308
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,490
Tell me...

309
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,600
do all accusations stir such passions in you?

310
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,650
Or is there something unique about the whore's case?

311
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,820
I know these people. 

312
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,400
I have lived among them.

313
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,500
Miss Embry is no tool of satan.

314
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,090
And if she were to be examined for the devil's marks?

315
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,450
An examination?

316
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,870
I'm confident...

317
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,510
no, I am certain...that you would find nothing.

318
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,450
In fact, yes, I would encourage you to settle the issue

319
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,030
and conduct the exam at once.

320
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,950
Me? 

321
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,000
No.

322
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,140
No, I will leave that to you.

323
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,750
You will examine the accused.

324
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,340
Captain.

325
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,630
John!

326
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,210
That wasn't the reaction I was expecting.

327
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,710
Nor the greeting I was.

328
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,370
The other night...

329
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,270
what we said... what we did.

330
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,670
What, do you regret it?

331
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,420
No.

332
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,250
My only regret is that it can never happen again.

333
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,930
I'm a married woman, John.

334
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,440
With a very sick husband.

335
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,600
Mr. Sibley would never do me the favor of dying.

336
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,160
We both know that.

337
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,840
He was taken to hospital.

338
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,100
From where he will surely return...

339
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,850
as alive and married as ever.

340
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,860
Is that the reason?

341
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:52,700
Sibley?

342
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,090
Nothing else?

343
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,500
Not a fear?

344
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,490
Or a secret that you think I couldn't accept?

345
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,890
Because there is no one in Salem

346
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,960
unburdened by their past...

347
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,030
Not even me.

348
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,210
I'm sorry, John.

349
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,630
I hope you can understand.

350
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,230
Father, please.

351
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,230
Proceed.

352
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,990
No marks.

353
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,270
Turn her.

354
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,000
Nothing.

355
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,460
Raise her smock.

356
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,680
Still nothing.

357
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,350
The upper torso.

358
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,180
Father...

359
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,050
The upper torso.

360
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,460
Wait.

361
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,640
So, you see, as I assured you,

362
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,610
She bears no signs of a devil's agent,

363
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,250
No blemishes, no witches' teats.

364
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,970
All of which I will be sure to mention at her trial.

365
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,090
Her trial?

366
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,370
But I have proven to you she is without marks.

367
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,450
Have you forgotten? 

368
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,640
We are not judges.

369
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,820
We are simply seekers of the truth.

370
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:58,280
The power of verdict rests with the selectmen.

371
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,940
This is Salem. You know how they will vote.

372
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,780
Well, then you save your rage and your impudence for them.

373
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,570
Another woman was accused today...as you saw.

374
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:29,560
It's madness, this witch panic.

375
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,960
Yes, it is regrettable.

376
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,510
Regrettable?

377
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,120
What would you have me do?

378
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,490
You could speak out, rail against it.

379
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,110
You have any number of options beyond nothing.

380
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,600
I am one man. Perhaps you expect too much of me.

381
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,270
Perhaps you are content with too little.

382
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,690
Hold your tongue, child.

383
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,160
I just don't understand

384
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,190
Why he's so content to see people hang...

385
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,620
Almost as if he secretly likes it.

386
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,190
I don't appreciate the insinuation.

387
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,450
What insinuation is that?

388
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,720
That I was somehow in league

389
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,150
with the murdering puritans.

390
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,200
Oh, no, that was not my insinuation at all.

391
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,330
In fact, it was quite the opposite.

392
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,940
And what might that be?

393
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,880
You know, I'm... I'm suddenly very tired.

394
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,440
What are you accusing me of?

395
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,000
I think I should lie down.

396
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,880
Anne, do not walk away until you have explained yourself.

397
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,730
Anne!

398
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,690
May I ask you a question?

399
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,010
Why does he hate you?

400
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,170
Two reasons only...

401
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,370
For what I am...

402
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,350
And what I am not.

403
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,140
And you've appealed to him on the girl's behalf?

404
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:55,230
Repeatedly. He does not regard me.

405
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:59,070
Truth told, he does not regard anyone except...

406
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,740
for you, John.

407
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,950
Cotton, no.

408
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,050
You are everything he ever wished me to be.

409
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,540
You are a hero in war.

410
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:13,860
You are a man without weakness or frailty.

411
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,610
Cotton, I'm sorry.

412
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,330
Begging another puritan asshole to do the right thing?

413
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,850
Since when has it worked?

414
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,440
-And why would it work now? -You're right.

415
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:31,680
No man should be forced to humble himself before my father.

416
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,690
I have been in Salem for months.

417
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:40,030
I have made allies and enemies in scores.

418
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,170
But the closest thing that I have come to a friend...

419
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,260
...is you.

420
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,660
So I ask you...

421
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,500
I beg you...

422
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,790
to appeal to my father,

423
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,180
If there is some small part of you

424
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,890
that can call me a friend, too.

425
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,840
Mr. Sibley?

426
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,880
Mr. Sibley?!

427
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,660
Mr. Sibley?!

428
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,310
Mr. Sibley.

429
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,710
Help me, Isaac.

430
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,680
You can speak.

431
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,610
The lord's miraculous workings.

432
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,840
You're leaking blood.

433
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,860
Which is why I need your help.

434
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,810
Go to salem.

435
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:34,080
Return with supplies and one to administer them.

436
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,050
Help you?

437
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,850
Yes.

438
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,800
Do you remember the day you marked me?

439
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,920
The day you seared my flesh with the sign of the fornicator?

440
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,610
You remember that?

441
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,570
And I would imagine that not a moment has since passed

442
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,410
that you didn't wish me dead.

443
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:05,530
And now your chance, without even raising a hand.

444
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,730
Walk away, and I will surely die here.

445
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,340
Why shouldn't I?

446
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,520
Because while you desired revenge

447
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:23,400
I bore regret for what I did.

448
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:26,650
Words.

449
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,000
Then help me, and I will shower you

450
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,030
Not with words, but gold,

451
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,540
more than you've ever hoped to possess.

452
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:39,880
Gold?

453
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,360
To return with -- with medicines and Mrs. Sibley?

454
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,090
No.

455
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,720
Not her.

456
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,250
Increase.

457
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,230
Increase?

458
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,110
Tell my wife nothing.

459
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,440
Bring me Increase Mather at once.

460
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,430
Go now, boy!

461
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:00,720
Run!

462
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,580
Run!

463
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,890
Run!

464
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,670
Yes?

465
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,260
Reverend.

466
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,480
The answer is no.

467
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,540
I didn't ask a question.

468
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,060
You're here to beg for the whore's life, are you not?

469
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,580
Dispatched by my besotted son, no doubt.

470
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,970
Yes.

471
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,190
Well, let me save you the trouble, Captain Alden.

472
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:04,590
The decision has been made to take her to trial.

473
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:09,240
But rest assured I will be sure to tell cotton

474
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,850
that your pleas were most heartfelt.

475
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,500
Sir...Gloriana is no witch.

476
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,220
No.

477
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,430
But I think you will agree she has bewitched my son.

478
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,750
You know, my father held you in high regard, reverend.

479
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,140
Alden sr. was a good man.

480
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:32,460
He viewed the world with uncommon reason.

481
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,820
Yeah, well, except when it came to his own son.

482
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:42,260
He wanted me to study scripture,

483
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,260
and I chose to explore the woods.

484
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,940
He wanted me to attend university,

485
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,680
and I volunteered for war.

486
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,530
He went to his grave thinking my life's choices mistakes.

487
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,340
And yet he allowed you to make them.

488
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,510
Well, that's because he knew the difference.

489
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,100
Between?

490
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,820
Between loving his son's choices

491
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,480
and loving his son.

492
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,730
Captain Alden.

493
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,970
Isaac, what is it?

494
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,850
Not here.

495
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,320
George Sibley can speak?

496
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,970
As clearly as you or I.

497
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,440
And wounded, he doesn't request his wife,

498
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,210
- But asks for - Increase Mather.

499
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,390
I trust him no more than a thief.

500
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,310
But to disobey a man of his standing?

501
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,330
Then do nothing.

502
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,220
Captain?

503
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,390
You sought my advice, so I offer it.

504
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,020
Do nothing.

505
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,300
But to leave him any longer

506
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,190
than I have in the woods, bleeding...

507
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,030
He will die.

508
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:09,370
Yes.

509
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,360
Does he deserve anything less?

510
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,090
The man who marked your flesh...

511
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,550
drove me to war...

512
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,710
and has ruled over salem like a power-mad king?

513
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,870
And now, what, he begs for compassion?

514
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,400
Cooperation?

515
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,180
What?

516
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,570
I know you love her, captain.

517
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,070
But to leave him to die is murder.

518
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:50,890
Do...nothing.

519
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,810
No. Where are you taking me?

520
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,620
Tell me! Where are you taking me?!

521
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,470
Good people of Salem,

522
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,070
It has come to my attention

523
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,070
that the accusation leveled today

524
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,240
was a trick of the witches...

525
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,600
An infernal ploy 

526
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:28,100
to delude and distract from the truly guilty.

527
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:33,770
This woman is no sorceress.

528
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,630
And therefore she will not go to trial.

529
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,910
But what her advocates fail to grasp

530
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:52,530
is that absence of guilt does not mean innocence...

531
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,870
For this whore is no innocent -- far from it.

532
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:01,860
She is guilty of sin, sins of the flesh,

533
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,150
sins against god, sins both mortal and eternal,

534
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:09,140
And as such, she warrants no place in Salem.

535
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:10,720
No.

536
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,210
And so, by my decree,

537
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,030
she is hereby banished from our midst,

538
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:20,480
her expulsion immediate and beyond dispute.

539
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,120
And should she -- look at me --

540
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:28,710
ever return at any time,

541
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,530
for any reason,

542
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,880
you will find yourself once again beside me on the common,

543
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,540
your lifeless body dangling

544
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,550
from the wrong end of the hangman's noose.

545
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,380
Take her.

546
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,780
Cotton!

547
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,700
- Gloriana! - Cotton! Cotton!

548
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,310
Cotton! Cotton!

549
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,730
- Gloriana! -Stand back. Stay back.

550
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,840
No! Gloriana!

551
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:58,820
I'm sorry.

552
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,660
Take her as far as your steeds will travel.

553
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,870
And let it be known

554
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,140
neither sin nor sinner

555
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,550
have any place in Salem.

556
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,010
George.

557
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,520
I don't know how or by whom,

558
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,150
but the familiar has been excised from him.

559
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,550
He could be anywhere right now, talking to anyone.

560
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,840
All that we've worked for,

561
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,900
all that I've sacrificed, incinerated in an instant.

562
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,920
Calm yourself and help me.

563
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:19,720
Mutare, et notum sumbotis.

564
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,580
Forma enim esse ostendit.

565
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,830
Corpus, anima, mens.

566
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,310
Lead me to the one I seek.

567
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,200
The creature will lead me to him.

568
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,270
With luck, I will find him quickly.

569
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,370
And without it, we shall all burn.

570
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,530
You take issue with my methods.

571
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,500
I understand.

572
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,020
What you need to understand is that everything I have done

573
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,380
has been to make you worthy of the Mather name.

574
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,720
I loved her.

575
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,050
Do not say that.

576
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:28,120
My silence does not make it untrue.

577
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,040
One day,

578
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:36,700
when you are governor of this great land,

579
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,030
a man of power and a model of virtue,

580
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:46,990
respected and feared in equal measure,

581
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,600
you will trace it back to this day...

582
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:56,080
...the day I removed temptation from your path.

583
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,590
- You there. - Yes?

584
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:26,030
Bring me some black tea, very strong, if you please.

585
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,240
Are you not the young man

586
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,230
who transported Mr. Sibley to Boston yesterday?

587
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,040
Isaac, sir.

588
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,830
- Issac. - Mm.

589
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,560
Boston and back?

590
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,320
Record time.

591
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,980
You must be quite the horseman, Isaac.

592
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,810
No, I-I wouldn't say that.

593
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:52,870
Well, tell me.

594
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,880
Did the physician offer any insight

595
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,180
into the patient's condition?

596
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:02,950
Physician?

597
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:06,490
A diagnosis? Or a prognosis?

598
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,970
No, I can't...

599
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:17,190
Well, you did take Mr. Sibley to the hospital, did you not?

600
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,260
What is it you are not saying?

601
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,750
Isaac...look at me.

602
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,620
Tell me the truth about your journey.

603
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,710
The injured is due south, inland,

604
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,990
on the wooded path to Boston.

605
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:48,820
Clear the way.

606
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:35,020
Who's there? Show yourself.

607
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,870
Who are you?

608
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,480
The name is Petrus.

609
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,490
Not an hour ago, I spied you sleeping,

610
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,140
and, seeing your grave wound, I have returned with medicinals.

611
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:50,090
Stop. Not one step closer.

612
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:53,200
But, sir, an infection has already taken root.

613
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,400
Do not worry yourself. Aid is on the way.

614
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:59,560
But you are in pain, are you not?

615
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,940
I have concocted a simple physic 

616
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,810
to ease your suffering.

617
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:09,350
No creature, man or animal, 

618
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:11,590
should suffer as you do, sir.

619
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:14,910
Please.

620
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,250
What have you given me?

621
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,490
I am truly sorry, sir.

622
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,180
She made me.

623
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,520
We will take him to your shack

624
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:50,250
until the threat has passed.

625
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,380
Did you really think it would be so easy

626
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:55,530
to escape us, Mr. Sibley?

627
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,770
There, up ahead!

628
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,660
George? George?

629
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,810
You're the servant?

630
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:18,750
Yes, sir, sent by Mrs. Sibley

631
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,540
to retrieve her ailing husband.

632
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,750
This is worse than I had feared.

633
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:25,430
Which is why he needs to be taken to hospital at once.

634
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:26,140
No.

635
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,440
It is not the injury that troubles me,

636
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,690
but how he came by it.

637
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,780
He sought to free himself from the witches' grip.

638
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,190
I do not understand.

639
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,710
The man is not ill.

640
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:40,300
He has been spelled.

641
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,460
Might you know something about that?

642
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,200
Miss Hale.

643
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,310
Do you remember that afternoon in the graveyard,

644
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:56,620
when you implied my father is not who he seems?

645
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:58,480
Yes.

646
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:01,860
Invite me inside, and I'll tell you why I agree.

647
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,740
Tell me -- where is Mr. Sibley?

648
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,270
We have a problem.

649
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:25,460
That was not my question.

650
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,530
Either you know where he is, or you don't.

651
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:28,690
I do know where he is,

652
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:30,300
and that is the problem.

653
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,290
The reverend has deemed him a victim of witchcraft

654
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,260
and has decided that George is to rest under his care.

655
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:38,740
Quickly now. Make haste.

656
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:40,300
My god.

657
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,840
Petrus' physic will last but a day.

658
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:44,720
There. There.

659
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,860
And then Mr. Sibley will awake, lucid and eager.

660
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:50,400
to tell Increase everything.

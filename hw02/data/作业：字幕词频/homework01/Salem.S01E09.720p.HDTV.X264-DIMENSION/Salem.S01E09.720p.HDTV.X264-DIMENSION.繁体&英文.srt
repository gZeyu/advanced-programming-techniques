第一季  第九集

14
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,970
《塞勒姆》前情提要
Previously on Salem.

15
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,740
巫師
Witch！

16
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,750
塞勒姆沒有哪個女人能有那種權力
No woman in Salem has ever had that kind of power.

17
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,650
連瑪麗·西布里都沒有
Not even Mary Sibley.

18
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,540
屋子的女主人是我的
The lady of the house is mine.

19
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,690
我們發現了一個巫師
We've uncovered a witch.

20
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,890
不知此次您會在鎮上停留多久呢
How long may we enjoy your curative presence in town?

21
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,080
直到我見證塞勒姆最后一個巫師死去
Until every last devil's whore of a witch in Salem is dead.

22
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,890
彼得魯斯的藥效只能持續一天
Petrus' physic will last but a day,

23
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,610
然后西布里先生即將恢復神智  迫不及待地
And then Mr. Sibley will awake, lucid and eager.

24
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,780
將一切向英克里斯全盤托出
To tell Increase everything.

25
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,890
選一個
Choose one.

26
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,370
喝吧
Drink.

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,960
好好享受吧
Drink and...enjoy.

28
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,650
只有凡人才會受不了這種酒的誘惑
Only mere mortals are vulnerable to manmade spirits.

29
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,400
作為人類  你讓人嫌惡
As a man, you are an abomination,

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,600
但你不是巫師
but you are no witch.

31
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,530
現在收起你可悲的軟弱滾蛋吧
Now begone with you and your...pitiful weakness.

32
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,680
醒醒  我的好女士
Time to wake, my good madam.

33
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,130
讓他們不再說"上帝安排一切"
Let them no more say, "God must do all,"

34
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,660
以此教唆他們
and so encourage themselves

35
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,350
從此遠離上帝
to live in a careless neglect of god 

36
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,740
遠離自己內心的
and of their own souls

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,830
救贖
and salvation!

38
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,290
惡魔已經把
The devil has made 

39
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,630
這個村莊搞得烏煙瘴氣
a dreadful knot of witches in the country,

40
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,330
并在巫師的幫助下
and, by the help of witches,

41
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,270
繼續變本加厲地進行破壞
has dreadfully increased that knot.

42
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,650
孩子們  孩子們  提高警惕
Oh, children, children, be afraid

43
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,910
睡覺以前一定要祈禱
and go not prayerless to your bed

44
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,070
以免惡魔趁虛而入
lest the devil be your bedfellow.

45
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,940
*擂我戰鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

46
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,120
*鼓鳴震天*
*Witch drums*

47
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,610
*擂我戰鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

48
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,860
*擂我戰鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

49
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,150
*鼓鳴震天*
*The witch drums*

50
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,630
*寧入地獄*
*Better pray for hell*

51
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:49,620
*不留人間*
*Not hallelujah*

52
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,300
早上好  牧師
Good morning, reverend.

53
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,300
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley.

54
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,160
一起吃嗎
Join me?

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,990
您對我丈夫的
There are no words

56
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,520
再造之恩
to encompass my overwhelming gratitude

57
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,470
我的感激無以言表
at your reclamation of my husband.

58
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,070
如果不是您去到了那兒
When I think what might have transpired

59
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,590
-后果真不堪想象  -是嗎
- had you not been there... - Indeed?

60
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,020
會有什么后果你說說看
Exactly what might have transpired?

61
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,580
-什么  -我是說...
- Excuse me? - well...

62
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,240
你家女仆難道不會直接送他去醫院嗎
Would not your slave girl simply have taken him on to hospital?

63
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:52,990
當然
Yes.

64
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,350
正是  是你派了她去救他
Yes, it was you who sent her to his rescue,

65
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,290
不是嗎
was it not?

66
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,690
我一收到消息就立馬派她去了
Once I'd heard of the accident.

67
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,930
不過  我很困惑
I am perplexed, though.

68
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,730
為什么這么著急秘密地把喬治送出去
Tell me, why was George scurried off with such haste and secrecy?

69
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,180
他經常去波士頓
He goes often to Boston.

70
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,440
-去看病  -他沒病
- His illness. - He's not ill.

71
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,170
-他是被下咒了  -不
- He's spelled. - No.

72
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,700
怎么可能
That's impossible.

73
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,630
你想想...
Consider...

74
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,430
喬治是不是無緣無故
has not George suffered this mysterious malady

75
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,880
就被這怪病纏了好幾年
without explication for several years now,

76
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,180
而且  是不是沒有醫生能說出
and have not the doctors expressed utter befuddlement

77
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,700
這到底是何原因
as to its cause?

78
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,580
-是的  但...  -那么在那種情況下
- Yes, but... - Yes. In such cases,

79
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,620
答案就再簡單不過了
The answer is oft the simplest one.

80
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,270
他根本沒病
George is not ill.

81
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,950
而是受制于惡魔的邪惡爪牙
He is under the influence of the devil's darkest tool --

82
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,620
也就是巫師的咒語
a witch's spell.

83
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,670
而且似乎這個施咒者與之非常親近
And it is quite likely that this speller resides close at hearth.

84
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,530
不
No.

85
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,000
也許就住在你家
Perhaps even in the hallowed halls of your own home.

86
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,660
有話就說吧
Say it.

87
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,010
說什么
Say what?

88
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,450
你不是想控告我嗎
The accusation.

89
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,120
你憋了很久了吧
It dances on your tongue.

90
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,780
你誤會我的意思了
Well, I assure you, you are mistaken.

91
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,140
我想即刻把我丈夫接回去
Then I wish to bring my husband home immediately.

92
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,830
恕難從命  西布里夫人
I think not, Mrs. Sibley.

93
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,950
你憑什么拒絕我
You would deny me that right?

94
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,510
我必須拒絕你
I must deny you that right

95
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,660
直到我們發現咒語的根源
until we can discover the origin of the spell.

96
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,080
那我請求...  不  我要求
Then I would ask, or, rather, insist,

97
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,410
找個人照顧西布里先生
that someone attend to Mr. Sibley.

98
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,480
最好是有照顧他經驗的人
Someone who has experience with his travails.

99
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,340
那個年輕人怎么樣
What about that young man...

100
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,850
就是那個載他去波士頓的
the one who was to take him to Boston, huh?

101
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,880
-艾薩克  -恩
- Isaac? - Ah.

102
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,810
就他吧
Isaac will do.

103
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,290
他還在昏睡中嗎
He sleeps still?

104
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,190
有侍衛看守著呢
Under the care of sentries.

105
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,160
對了  瑪麗
Oh, and, Mary.

106
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,420
放心吧
Be of good heart.

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,200
酒吧老板蘭布先生說他可能隨時醒來
Mr. Lamb, the barkeep, tells me that he may wake at any moment.

108
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,180
柯頓
Cotton.

109
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,370
柯頓
Cotton.

110
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,830
我跟那些死人沒什么分別
No difference between me and those that already rest.

111
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,900
只是我的心還跳動在
Besides a still-beating heart

112
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,640
一具靈魂空洞的軀殼里
in a shell where my soul no longer resides.

113
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,610
天啊
Oh, boy.

114
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:40,870
早啊  牧師
Good morning, reverend.

115
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,710
我在想...
I wonder --

116
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,610
怎樣才能讓你起身
what would it take to get you to your feet?

117
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,170
你為什么想這么做
Why would you wish to?

118
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,670
我擔心自己可能...
I fear I may have...

119
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,160
對你太刻薄了  麥哲牧師
judged you too harshly, Reverend Mather.

120
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,150
只是現在  當童年遠去
It is only now, when leaving my childhood behind,

121
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,170
我才意識到  無論過去還是以后
that I realize we are, past and forever,

122
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,960
我們都是為人子女
our fathers' children.

123
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,940
我們不能選擇他們是誰
And we can no more control who they be

124
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,540
他們怎樣塑造我們
and how they came to form us

125
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,320
但是我們能做回自己
then we can the rise and setting of the sun.

126
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,410
你愛的那個姑娘  我很遺憾
I am sorry about your girl.

127
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,650
謝謝你
Thank you.

128
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,020
我們送你回家好嗎
May we see you home?

129
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:37,960
起來
Come on.

130
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,850
把他送回家安置好后  上尉
Once he's settled, Captain,

131
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,000
你能幫我個忙嗎
may I ask a favor of you?

132
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,740
當然
Surely.

133
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,460
"恕難從命  西布里夫人"
"I think not, Mrs. Sibley."

134
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,910
就好像他是蘇格拉底  我是跪在他跟前的學生
As if he were Socrates and I, a student at his knee.

135
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,310
讓我去殺了他吧
Let me kill him, please.

136
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,010
不行
No.

137
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,600
讓我幫你減輕這個負擔  就跟處理其他人一樣
Let me ease this burden for you, as I've done the others.

138
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,420
不論在新世界還是舊世界
Increase Mather is known throughout the world,

139
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,100
英克里斯·麥哲都聲名遠揚
new and old.

140
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,030
他消失或者死亡肯定會引起不小的轟動
His disappearance or death will not be taken lightly.

141
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,260
不能平白無故就讓他死去
His head will sit on no man's platter.

142
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,840
他自然無法與你相提并論
He's no match for you, certainly.

143
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,830
這樣想你就錯了  孩子
That is where you are wrong, child.

144
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,690
這是對我們的真實考驗
This is our truest test

145
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,010
去與勢均力敵之人戰斗
to battle equals.

146
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,100
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley.

147
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,010
牧師
Reverend.

148
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,620
梅西
Mercy.

149
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,060
您好
Hello.

150
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,430
我能否跟我女兒
I wonder if I might have a private word

151
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,650
單獨說幾句話
with my daughter.

152
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,390
恕難從命  牧師
I think not, Reverend.

153
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,950
-我...  -去幫我把艾薩克找來
- I - Fetch me Isaac.

154
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:35,820
馬上
Now.

155
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,760
我...
I am, um...

156
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,980
沒想到您對我的孩子如此仁慈寬厚
astounded at the charity you've shown my child,

157
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,870
但如果我想見她
but if I wish to see her, 

158
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,260
這不是一個父親應有的權利嗎
is that not a father's right?

159
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,740
你為什么想見她呢  牧師
Why, in particular, do you wish to see her, Reverend?

160
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,800
你是想對她用其他驅邪方法嗎
Were you perhaps considering another exorcism?

161
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,520
身邊沒有孩子
Do your days grow dull,

162
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,800
讓你打罵折磨是不是很無聊
lacking a child to beat and torture

163
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,590
漫漫長夜沒有女兒陪伴是不是很孤單
and the nights far too lonely with no daughter to visit?

164
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,700
-我絕不會...  -梅西是我的人
- I would never - Mercy is mine.

165
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,510
你再來的話我就公開指責你了
Return here again and these accusations will be made public.

166
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,300
西布里先生怎么樣了  醒了嗎
What of master Sibley? Has he woken?

167
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,750
長老們不想再等了
The elders will wait no longer.

168
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,870
他們要求今天與你見面
They require an audience with you today.

169
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,470
他醒了嗎
Has he woken?

170
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,240
隨時都可能醒
Any moment now.

171
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,650
那是意外  夫人
It were an accident, ma'am.

172
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,840
一根黑松木擋在路中間
A wayward timber in the path,

173
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,920
然后我們就都跌下馬車不省人事了
and we found ourselves at sixes and sevens.

174
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,240
沒事  艾薩克
It's okay, Isaac.

175
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,660
我知道你已經盡力了
I know you've done your best.

176
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,780
牧師現在找我
The reverend summons me now,

177
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,940
不知道為什么  但我擔心他是想等...
heaven knows why, but I fear each second he's made to wait --

178
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,350
他會讓你照顧西布里先生
He will ask you to watch over Mr. Sibley.

179
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,650
-是嗎  -在我的強烈堅持下
- He will? - At my grave insistence,

180
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,380
因為他拒絕讓我
since he refuses my desire

181
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,330
把我丈夫帶回家照料
to bring my husband home to proper care.

182
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,760
他拒絕你
He refuses you?

183
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,800
塞勒姆就像一個笨重的陀螺一樣轉失控了
Salem reels out of control like an unwieldy spin top

184
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,390
都是因為英克里斯·麥哲的隨心所欲
at the whim of Increase Mather.

185
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,950
這是減輕痛苦有助于睡眠的藥劑
A tonic... the pain and ease of sleep.

186
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,870
艾薩克  我請求你
Isaac, I beseech you,

187
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,480
這是一件極其重要而又私人的事
in this most private and important matter,

188
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,970
幫我一下吧
do my bidding where I cannot.

189
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,020
這個...
Oh, uh...

190
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,870
馬上讓他服下  并且藥不能停
Dose him immediately and keep him so.

191
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,260
不該讓喬治遭受
George should not be made to suffer

192
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,650
老麥哲毫無根據的懷疑
for Mather senior's unfounded suspicions.

193
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,630
不會的
H-he shall not.

194
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,050
艾薩克...
And Isaac...

195
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,450
此事你知我知
Between us.

196
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,560
就像塞勒姆的很多其他秘密一樣
Like so many of Salem's secrets.

197
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,310
你知我知
Between us.

198
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,250
你知道嗎  孩子
Are you aware, son?

199
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,520
你的故事真是無人不知無人不曉
Your story is known far and wide throughout the land.

200
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:34,200
私通者艾薩克
Isaac the fornicator.

201
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,710
不不不  不要因羞愧而低下頭
No, no, no. Do not bow your head in shame.

202
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,010
抬起頭來  抬起來
Head up. Get your head up.

203
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,410
抬頭  抬頭
Head up. Head up.

204
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:46,530
私通者艾薩克的故事
The story of Isaac the fornicator

205
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,170
是神圣的
is a holy one.

206
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:53,300
它被我們清教徒當做一個活生生的例子
It is used as a living precedent by we puritans

207
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:58,150
用來向孩子們說明欲望的罪惡
to illustrate to the children the evils of lust.

208
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,580
不不  你的罪惡和痛苦...
No, no. Your sin and your suffering...

209
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,550
已經被轉化為神圣而偉大的祝福了
It has been transformed into a great and a holy blessing.

210
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,660
因為  孩子...
For, my son...

211
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,980
你感受到了上帝之手
You felt the hand of God.

212
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,910
他碰觸了你
He's touched you.

213
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,870
他是在考驗你
He's working through you.

214
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,050
他選擇了你
He's chosen you.

215
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,600
不
No.

216
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,740
有幾個人能說自己是被上帝選中的啊
How many can say that they have been chosen by God?

217
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,910
選我干什么
Chosen for what?

218
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:38,610
孩子  你想過塞勒姆以外的生活嗎
Son, have you ever imagined a world beyond Salem?

219
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,340
-我  -頭抬起來  抬起來
- I... - Get your head up, your head up,

220
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,910
抬頭  抬頭
Your head up, your head up.

221
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,410
我在這里生活得很好  先生
I have a good life here, sir.

222
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,660
是啊  你在這里給西布里夫人跑腿
Yes, performing meager errands for Mrs. Sibley.

223
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,540
她待我很好  一直很好
She's been good to me. Always.

224
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,090
她對你的施舍讓你對她言聽計從
Her charity binds you to her bidding.

225
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,000
不  不不不   艾薩克
No. No, no, no, Isaac.

226
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,620
外面
Out there.

227
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,140
外面  孩子
Out there, boy!

228
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,410
外面是大千世界
There's a vast world out there,

229
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,500
機會  機會遍地都是
full of... full of opportunities,

230
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,560
如果你  如果你想在陽光下抬頭挺胸
and if you... if you would walk the straight road

231
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,450
走上康莊大道
in the sunlight with your head up,

232
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,180
我會帶你出去親眼看看
I would take you with me to see it.

233
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,030
我會的
I would.

234
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,060
你覺得怎么樣
Would you like that?

235
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,120
那我需要怎么做
What would I have to do?

236
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,820
這個...
Well...

237
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,290
你得...
You will have to --

238
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,490
你得來照顧西布里先生
Have to tend to Mr. Sibley there.

239
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,290
你得...
You'll have to...

240
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,980
保證他每天整潔如新
...make certain that he is fresh and tidy,

241
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,450
這可不是件容易的事
and that is no easy task, hmm?

242
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,510
最重要的是  他醒時你必須通知我
Most importantly, you must alert me the moment that he wakes.

243
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,880
沒錯
Yes.

244
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,620
你能做到嗎
Can you do that, hmm?

245
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,290
恕我冒昧問一句  先生
Do you mind me asking, sir,

246
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,950
這些是用來做什么的
What these are for?

247
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,130
用來保護西布里先生免受
Protection for Mr. Sibley against...

248
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,500
外界勢力危害
outer forces.

249
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,930
這是骨灰
It's cremated ash...

250
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,610
一名兩百歲女巫的骨灰
...of a 200-year-old witch.

251
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,320
對了  艾薩克
And, Isaac...

252
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,100
她是我親手燒死的
I burned her myself.

253
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:34,260
屋頂有兩處需要修補
So, the roof needs patching there and there,

254
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,280
墻面也最好能重新油漆一下
A fresh coat of paint wouldn't hurt,

255
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,640
另外我們還需要四五張床來安置小一點的孩子
nor would four or five more beds for the smaller children,

256
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,450
還有  我是不是嚇到你了
And... I'm overwhelming you.

257
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,340
不  不
No, no.

258
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,010
我很樂意能將精力花在做善事上
I'm eager to put my energies to good.

259
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:45,980
我也正是這么想的
Exactly.

260
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,580
孩子們都被嚇壞了  上尉
The children are frightened, captain.

261
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,530
今天又有一個人被絞死  也不知道誰會是下一個
Another hung today and not an inkling who's to be next.

262
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,990
如今他們也不知道誰更可怕
They're unsure who to fear more...

263
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,240
巫師  還是追捕他們的那些人
Witches or those who pursue them.

264
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,930
誰能怪他們呢
Well, who can blame them?

265
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,540
他不怎么合群
He doesn't play with the others.

266
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,650
那個深色頭發的男孩
The dark-haired boy.

267
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,270
他來這兩年了
He's been here two years.

268
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,520
父母都被印第安人殺害
His parents were murdered by Indians.

269
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,790
有人說他目睹了一切
They say he saw.

270
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,260
沒人知道他是怎么活下來的
No one knows how he survived.

271
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,140
有人問過他嗎
Has anyone asked?

272
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,410
他從不說話
He doesn't talk.

273
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,820
至少  從那以后
At least, not anymore.

274
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,080
就再也不說了
Not since...then.

275
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,290
打擾一下
Excuse me.

276
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,200
你會修屋頂嗎
Do you know anything about patching a roof?

277
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,870
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley?

278
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,000
女主人出去了
The mistress is out.

279
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,400
有什么要告訴她的  都可以對我說
Anything needed to be said to her can be said to me.

280
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,930
它真漂亮
Oh, that's beautiful!

281
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,640
我的親信
My familiar.

282
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,060
親信
Familiar?

283
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:28,400
這是惡魔的饋贈  它為我賣命
A gift from the devil to do my bidding,

284
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,090
我的靈魂伴侶
My spiritual companion.

285
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,300
我是這樣喂食它的
This is how she feeds.

286
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,520
我也能得到親信嗎
Will I get a familiar?

287
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,620
會有的
In time.

288
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,640
我要如何選擇它呢
How do I choose?

289
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:55,890
由不得你
You don't.

290
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,480
它會選擇你
It chooses you.

291
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,050
日安  西布里夫人
Good day, Mrs. Sibley.

292
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,220
姑娘們
Girls.

293
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,780
我們正準備去墓地與梅西見面
We're off to meet mercy in the graveyard.

294
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:39,590
這樣嗎
Well.

295
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,600
那就快去吧
On your way, then.

296
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,530
姐妹的死我與你們一樣深感悲痛
We all grieve the loss of our sister.

297
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,130
{\an8}愿她能在地獄之門與魔鬼共舞

298
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,460
{\an8}-另一位姐妹又怎么說  -蘿絲

299
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:24,020
{\an8}不是死于敵人之手  卻是拜她深愛及保護之人所賜

300
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,100
{\an8}你才是該死的那個人

301
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,180
我不會為自己辯白
I do not argue this.

302
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,950
但我想讓你們知道  我別無選擇
But beg remembrance that I was given little choice.

303
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,080
惡靈
The malum...

304
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,770
我們大祭典的必須之物
...without which our grand rite would not be possible.

305
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:57,490
蘿絲未經我同意  便將這件死亡之器
Rose brought it here, this instrument of death,

306
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,000
帶來了這里  想以此挑戰并擊敗我
without my knowledge, to challenge and defeat me.

307
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:19,080
為了你們  也為了我們崇高的大業
It is for you, retrieved at great cost,

308
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:22,410
我不惜一切代價將其奪回
relinquished with love and ardor for our cause.

309
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,780
如今  我將它交予你們
I leave you now with the only tool

310
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,730
這個世界上唯一能控制我的物品
that exists on earth to control me.

311
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,900
{\an8}拿回去

312
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,380
{\an8}我們不稀罕你這些小玩意

313
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,600
{\an8}我們早有了控制你的籌碼

314
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,590
劈柴的訣竅在于讓它們自然裂開
The trick to making shakes is to split them...

315
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:58,850
不靠砍也不靠鋸  而是裂開
Not chopped or sawed, but to split.

316
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,530
謝謝
Thank you.

317
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:09,770
到你了
Your turn.

318
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,800
就是這樣  干得漂亮
Right! Well done.

319
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,430
上尉
Captain.

320
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,330
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley.

321
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:25,990
年輕人
Young man.

322
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,830
你能去給我找些水來喝嗎
Why don't you go see if there's any fresh water.

323
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,330
今早的事真是轟動
Big doings this morning.

324
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,310
如今每天似乎都有意想不到的事情發生
Seems every day brings its fair share of surprises.

325
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,700
我聽說你丈夫在英克里斯那里
I heard old Increase took possession of your husband.

326
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,060
是的
Yes, he did.

327
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,590
我想把他帶回來
And I'm eager to get him back.

328
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,300
是嗎
You are?

329
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,770
為什么
Why?

330
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,910
一個妻子想讓丈夫回家
Is it so unusual, captain,

331
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,240
就這么讓人驚訝嗎  上尉
for a wife to want her husband at home?

332
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,640
對大部分人來說不是
In most cases, it's not unusual at all.

333
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,970
聽說我的幫手口渴了
I heard my hard worker was thirsty.

334
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,810
您也在啊  西布里夫人
Oh, Mrs. Sibley.

335
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,860
要來點新鮮的蘋果汁嗎
Uh, fresh apple water on offer.

336
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,630
不了  謝謝你  安
No, thank you, Anne.

337
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,080
再見  上尉
Good day, captain. 

338
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,360
年輕人
Young man.

339
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,950
上尉
Captain.

340
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,850
{\an8}尋寶杖

341
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,490
{\an8}本日停業

342
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,010
這個能給我嗎
May I?

343
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,950
就算你已經決定了徹底放縱自我
If you're going to capitulate to your weakness,

344
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,210
你一定要弄得這么眾人皆知嗎
must it be on constant public display?

345
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,830
或許我該將舞臺留給您  父親
Shall I leave public display to you, father?

346
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,880
不如把絞刑架拆了
Shall we abolish the noose

347
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,780
這樣您就能親手折斷他們的脖子
so that you may break necks with your own two hands?

348
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,120
她之前就死了
She was dead.

349
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,560
那個鴇母是自殺的
The whore runner killed herself.

350
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,140
她都已經死了
She was already dead,

351
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,800
而你還要絞死她
and yet you hung her.

352
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,170
我說過她會被絞死
I said she would hang.

353
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,550
我說到做到
and hang she did.

354
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,400
如果言而無信  那我們就什么都不是
We are nothing if we do not keep our word,

355
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,140
可惜你卻似乎并不懂得這條原則
A principle which seems to mean very little to you, I fear.

356
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,910
您就這么憎恨我嗎
Must you hate me so?

357
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,860
我的柯頓
Oh, Cotton.

358
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,170
你母親是柯頓家族一員
Your mother was a Cotton, as you know.

359
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,930
也是我同母異父的妹妹
And my stepsister.

360
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,900
我們的婚姻是歷史的必然
Our marriage was a historical inevitability.

361
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,680
柯頓家和麥哲家
The Cottons and the Mathers...

362
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,600
誰能拒絕兩家
Who could resist such a..

363
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:36,000
如此的強強聯合呢
Such a joining of...of power and prestige?

364
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,570
你當然不會拒絕
Certainly not you.

365
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,550
她是個好女人
She was a good woman,

366
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,700
也是個稱職的母親
and she was a fit enough mother,

367
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,130
但是
But...

368
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,030
我并不愛她
I didn't love her.

369
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,000
我不懂愛
I didn't love.

370
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,880
后來  便有了你
And then you were born.

371
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,800
然后你出生了
And there you were, a...

372
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,150
這么小的一個小人兒  只會哭
Squalling mess of limbs and of hair, and...

373
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,520
這么微不足道
You weren't much.

374
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,860
但你卻足以讓我明白了愛
But you were enough to show me love.

375
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,690
真是諷刺
What utter irony

376
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,380
如今你卻執意要奪走我身邊的愛
That you would then take the self-same thing from me.

377
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,390
你不能再喝了  先生
You are cut off, sir!

378
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,590
不  我有錢
No. I have money!

379
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,900
我要喝個痛快
I will drink muchly and often!

380
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,700
不行  趕緊離開
You will not. Now be on your way.

381
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,360
我不干
I think not. 

382
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,620
不行  走開
Oh, no, no. Whoa. Go!

383
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,430
美酒是上帝的賞賜
The wine is from god.

384
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,800
醉漢則是魔鬼的懲罰
The drunkard is from the devil.

385
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,100
趕緊振作起來
Pull yourself together.

386
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,150
還有很多事要做
There's much work to be done.

387
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,880
讓我殺了他
Let me kill him.

388
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,110
我告訴過你了
I have told you.

389
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,400
不能殺了英克里斯
We cannot kill Increase.

390
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,320
不是又老又蠢的英克里斯
Not silly old Increase.

391
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,780
我是說西布里先生
Mr. Sibley.

392
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,460
你就是這么教她的嗎
This is what you teach her?

393
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,490
遇到問題  首先就想到殺人
For any problem, murder is the first course of action?

394
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,140
我們不能殺了喬治
We cannot kill George.

395
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,340
為什么
Why not?

396
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,630
你如此有權勢  你大權在握
You are so powerful... you alone.

397
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,250
你不需要他  
You do not need him.

398
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,440
這你就錯了  親愛的
That is where you are wrong, my dear.

399
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,120
我們非常需要他
We need him desperately.

400
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,370
沒有喬治  一切就都沒了
Without george, it all goes away.

401
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,880
我就只是個一無所有的寡婦
I am a widow with nothing...

402
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,830
無權掌控生意  無權在委員會中發聲
No business to run, no voice with the selectmen.

403
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,220
只要他活著  我就能通過他來發話
With him alive, I can speak through him...

404
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:03,230
做一個模仿他意愿的玩偶
A puppet to parrot his wishes and thoughts.

405
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:08,260
但他死了就沒用了  我也就沒有權勢了
But dead, he is useless and I am without power.

406
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,420
可你要如何阻止他說出實情
But how will you stop him from speaking?

407
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,630
我要進入他的大腦  從內部毀了他
I will enter his mind and destroy it from within.

408
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,510
他的肉身還活著  但不會再有意識了
His body will live on, but his mind will be gone.

409
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,420
這要怎么做
How will you do that?

410
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,870
閉嘴  問題夠多了  
Quiet girl! That is enough questions.

411
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,460
你無權讓我閉嘴
Don't you tell me to be quiet.

412
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,340
-閉嘴  -夠了
- Quiet.  - Enough!

413
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,720
你們倆都出去
Both of you, leave me now.

414
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,700
-可我能幫你  -出去
- But I can help you.  - Get out!

415
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:34,990
放開我
Let go of me!

416
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,150
放開
Let go!

417
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,130
知道我們能殺了誰嗎
You know who we could kill?

418
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,040
你
You.

419
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,450
不行  她不會讓你這么做的
You can't. She would never let you.

420
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,930
也許不會  也許會
Maybe, maybe not.

421
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,630
你不會想知道的
You don't want to find out.

422
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,050
你這個嫉妒刻薄的壞女人
You're jealous and spiteful and awful.

423
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:53,960
我已經等很多很多年了
Years... I have waited many, many years.

424
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,590
別礙我的事  賤人
Stay out of my way, you little bitch.

425
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,810
西布里夫人一心只為你好
Mrs. Sibley's only ever had your best interest at heart.

426
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,490
可盡管如此
Yet still...

427
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,180
在你最為絕望的時刻
Your moment's worst desperation,

428
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,540
開口求救卻并未說出她的名字
It was not her name you uttered for rescue

429
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,010
你居然叫了老麥哲牧師
But that of the reverend Mather senior.

430
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,670
我這個
What do I,

431
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,470
在你那里只得到過暴力
Who have known only violence 

432
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,520
和惡意的人
and malice from your eager hands,

433
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,080
又怎么會在乎你的死活呢
care a whit about your rosy outlook?

434
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,330
瑪麗
Mary.

435
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,040
瑪麗
Mary.

436
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,030
如今擺脫了你的親信
Free of your precious familiar,

437
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,310
我終于又贏回了夢想
I finally got hold of my dreams back.

438
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,140
在你這黑暗扭曲的意識里
Hmm. A beatific choice

439
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,730
這還真是個美好的選擇
For such a dark and twisted mind.

440
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,530
你還記得來過這兒嗎
You remember coming here?

441
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:27,260
記得  那次野餐
Yes. A picnic. 

442
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,970
你唯一沒讓我心懷鄙視的一天
The one and only day I almost didn't despise you.

443
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,640
你從沒給過我機會
You never gave me a chance.

444
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,880
你早就對我下了定論
Your mind was long made up.

445
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,450
能怪我嗎
Can you blame me?

446
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,360
你偷走了我的人生
You stole my life.

447
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,130
現在你則偷走了我的
And now you've stolen mine.

448
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,660
我們就快成功了
We are close.

449
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,180
非常接近了
So very close.

450
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,260
大祭典就快完成了
The grand rite is almost complete.

451
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,360
然后呢
And then what?

452
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,310
又一個王國供你主宰嗎
Another kingdom for you to rule?

453
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,350
沒錯
Yes.

454
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:54,260
一個我不再需要你的世界
A world in which I no longer need you.

455
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,600
在那個美好的世界里  你終于可以徹底死去
A blessed world in which you can finally die.

456
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,800
你就這么迫害威脅自己的丈夫嗎
Peril and threats.

457
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,200
比我們更不堪的夫婦數不勝數
Many a union has relied on less.

458
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,740
別這么擔心  喬治
Don't look so worried, George.

459
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,570
我們還沒有完全成功
We're a little ways off yet.

460
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,220
如今  我只需要你閉嘴
For now, I just need you quiet,

461
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,790
在你骯臟的圍兜里像個天使般沉睡吧
Sleeping like an angel in your dirty bibs and nappies.

462
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,500
永別了  喬治
Farewell, George.

463
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,940
賤人
You bitch!

464
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,470
賤人
You bitch!

465
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,090
混蛋
Oh, that bastard.

466
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:01,830
西布里嗎
Sibley? 

467
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,270
英克里斯·麥哲
Increase Mather.

468
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,680
他在那里
He was there.

469
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,620
保護著喬治
Protecting george.

470
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,390
即便是他睡夢中的意識
Guarding his mind even in sleep.

471
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,360
我們還有個麻煩
We have another problem.

472
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,350
我們必須對那女孩采取點措施
We must do something about the girl.

473
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,950
梅西
Mercy.

474
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,290
她很不可靠
She is...unreliable.

475
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,070
終有一天我們將無法再控制他
It is only a matter of time before

476
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,630
這只是個時間問題
we can no longer control her.

477
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,550
此時此刻
At a time such as this

478
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,190
我比任何時候都有可能被發現
when I am nearer to discovery and annihilation

479
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,440
命運懸于一線
than ever before,

480
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,740
你卻讓自己
you would distract yourself

481
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,610
為那些不值一提的嫉妒和惡意中傷分心
with petty jealousy and spiteful accusations.

482
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,580
我試著要
I am trying to make --

483
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,530
我比任何時候都需要你
Never have I needed you more.

484
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,400
你卻從沒像如今這樣讓我失望
And never have you disappointed me so gravely.

485
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,240
我愿意為你做任何事
I would do anything for you.

486
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,170
-我愛你  -我倒希望你別愛我
- I love you. - Oh, and I wish to god you didn't.

487
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,990
別那么愛我  或許這樣會更好
Love me less and you will love me better.

488
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,470
想辦法接近喬治
Find a way to get to George.

489
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,100
明天我們涂漆
Tomorrow, we'll work on the paint.

490
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,110
當然了  如果你還有空的話
That is, if you're still available, of course.

491
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,330
干得好
Excellent.

492
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,850
干得好  孩子
Excellent, son.

493
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,240
史蒂芬
Stephen.

494
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,010
史蒂芬
Stephen.

495
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,430
你見過我女兒
You've seen my daughter.

496
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,520
你可以走了  這里只有孩子
You can move along. There's kids here.

497
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,420
我就是在找孩子  我的孩子
I'm looking for a kid -- my kid.

498
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,280
我說了  快滾
And I said, "Move along."

499
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,980
霍普金斯先生
Mr. Hopkins.

500
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,420
有什么能幫你的嗎
How can we help you?

501
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,640
我入獄之后  我女兒是不是住在這里
My daughter came to stay here after when I was in jail?

502
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:36,690
艾米莉
Emily?

503
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,270
不  霍普金斯先生  她沒有
No, Mr. Hopkins. She did not.

504
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,740
你在附近見過她嗎
Have you seen her around?

505
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:42,910
不  先生  我沒有
No, sir. I haven't.

506
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,620
告訴她我在找她
You tell her I'm looking for her.

507
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,590
告訴她  讓她趕緊回家
You tell her she needs to come home.

508
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,800
是  霍普金斯先生  我會的
Yes, Mr. Hopkins. I'll do that.

509
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:04,640
利茲
Lizzy...

510
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,580
你把雞毛
Did you bring the chicken feathers

511
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,830
和干馬糞帶來了嗎
and the dried horse dung?

512
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:11,060
雞毛我帶來了  但是馬糞不太干
I brung the feathers, but the dung weren't dry.

513
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,630
老鼠呢
And what about the mice?

514
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,180
貓把陷阱里的老鼠都嚇跑了
They scattered when the cat come to the trap.

515
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,450
梅西馬上就要到了
Mercy is to be here any minute.

516
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,440
難道什么事都要我親自做嗎
Must I do everything myself?

517
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,010
霍普金斯小姐  能借一步說話嗎
Miss Hopkins, may I have a word?

518
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,580
你父親被釋放了
Your father has been freed.

519
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,400
知道了
I see.

520
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,680
他正在找你
And he's been looking for you,

521
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:48,280
說讓你馬上回家
asks that you come home immediately.

522
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,420
霍爾小姐
Miss Hale.

523
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,620
有什么可以幫忙的嗎
Can we help you?

524
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,300
我只是來告訴霍普金斯小姐
I've only come to tell Miss Hopkins

525
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,900
她父親被釋放了
that her father has been freed.

526
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,820
你人真好
How kind.

527
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,900
他似乎
And that he seemed...

528
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,880
酩酊大醉失去理智了
quite inebriated and not himself,

529
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,910
也許她今晚最好先別回家
and that perhaps she oughtn't to go home tonight.

530
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,180
或許可以在孤兒院待一晚
Perhaps she ought to stay in the orphanage 

531
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,410
在那里她會很安全
where she'd be safe.

532
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,250
她很安全
She is safe.

533
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,230
和我們在一起
With us.

534
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,150
是嗎
Is she?

535
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,090
或許你可以留下
Would you care to stay and...

536
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,600
親眼見證
see for yourself...

537
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:38,530
安
Anne?

538
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:47,440
今晚不了
Not tonight.

539
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,670
住手
Stop.

540
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,900
那是什么
What is that?

541
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,850
這是止痛藥劑
A tonic. For pain.

542
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,630
你從哪里拿到的
Where did you get it?

543
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,070
蘭姆先生給我的
Mr. Lamb gave it to me

544
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,530
-你出去的時候  -不是
- while you were out. - No.

545
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,180
不是嗎
No?

546
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,080
年輕人
Young man...

547
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:30,660
年輕人  我給過你機會不是嗎
Young man, I offered you an opportunity, did I not?

548
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,810
你還記得
Do you remember?

549
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:35,220
世界  廣袤的世界  陽光
The world -- the vast world, the sunlight.

550
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,130
我曾經懷疑過你
I somehow suspected you would find a way

551
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,210
還是會忍不住自輕自賤
to undermine yourself.

552
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,480
雖然我希望你不會這么做
But I did -- I hoped against hope that you wouldn't,

553
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,540
你卻仍被我不幸言中
but you did.

554
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,940
因為你不僅是個白癡還是個廢物
Because not only are you a cretin, you're a failure.

555
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,760
你是個無可救藥的廢物  和所有廢物一樣
You're a cretinous failure, and like all failures,

556
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,040
你對自己說  "我從未有過機會
You say to yourself, "But I never get the chance!

557
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,520
從未得到機遇"
I never get the opportunity,"

558
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,680
但其實并不是這樣  不是嗎
But it just ain't so, is it?

559
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,950
不
No.

560
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,720
和所有廢物一樣  你做了什么
And like every failure, what do you do?

561
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,010
你在機會面前退卻了
You just piss in the well of possibility.

562
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:09,820
現在你告訴我是誰給你這藥劑的
And now you are going to tell me who gave you the potion.

563
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:13,210
硬如干柴  冷如巖石
Stiff as a stick, cold as a marble.

564
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,380
輕如精靈  輕徙鳥舉
Light as a spirit, lift yourself.

565
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,820
輕如羽毛  硬如石板
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.

566
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,240
輕如羽毛  硬如石板
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.

567
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,340
輕如羽毛  硬如石板
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.

568
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,660
蜘蛛之王  收放自若
Master spider, stilted or stifled...

569
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:27,080
編汝之網  回吾之召
Spin us a web and heed our call.

570
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,480
蜘蛛之王  收放自若
Master spider, stilted or stifled,

571
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,570
編汝之網  回吾之召
Spin us a web and heed our call.

572
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:34,100
蜘蛛之王  收放自若
Master spider, stilted or stifled...

573
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,240
誰給你的
Who gave it you?

574
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,460
誰給你的
Hmm? Who gave it you?

575
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,340
抬頭  抬頭
Head up. Head up.

576
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,240
-它不是藥劑  -不是藥劑嗎
- It's not a potion. - It's not a potion?

577
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,190
它不是
It's not a po--

578
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,340
看我  孩子
Look at me, boy.

579
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,740
這是  補藥
It's -- it's medicine.

580
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,050
再說一次
One more time.

581
00:36:56,510 --> 00:37:00,030
我問你  誰給你的
I'm going to ask you, who gave it to you?

582
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,680
蜘蛛之王  收放自若
Master spider, stilted or stifled,

583
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,090
編汝之網  回吾之召
Spin us a web and heed our call.

584
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,750
蜘蛛之王  收放自若
Master spider, stilted or stifled...

585
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,750
我們會這么做
What we'll do is this --

586
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,930
這是補藥
It's medicine.

587
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,840
我會把你的肚子剖開
I'm going to slit your belly open.

588
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,050
那是藥
It's medicine.

589
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:19,230
我會伸手進去猛的一拉
I'm going to reach in, pull out,

590
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,920
然后用你的腸子勒住你的脖子
and I'm going to throttle you with your own intestines.

591
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,950
回吾之召
...heed our call.

592
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,530
蜘蛛之王  收放自若
Master spider, stilted or stifled,

593
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,740
編汝之網  回吾之召
Spin us a web and heed our call.

594
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,430
蜘蛛之王  收放自若
Master spider, stilted or stifled...

595
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,930
不  不  不
No. No. No.

596
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,000
現在  你趕緊告訴我
Now, you tell me right now,

597
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,550
誰給你的
who gave it to you?!

598
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,140
告訴我  艾薩克
Tell me, Isaac!

599
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,360
告訴我
Tell me!

600
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,400
西布里夫人絕不會傷害生靈
Mrs. Sibley could bring no harm to a living thing.

601
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,210
只要是她給的藥水
If -- if she provided me the medicine,

602
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,710
我絕對相信她
that's good enough for me.

603
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,520
西布里夫人  是嗎
Mrs. Sibley, eh?

604
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,040
干得好
Well done.

605
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,230
你現在可以走了
Off with you now.

606
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,510
走
Go.

607
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,260
快走  從我眼前消失
Go on! Out of my sight!

608
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,360
私通者艾薩克
Isaac the fornicator!

609
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,380
喬治
George.

610
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,270
喬治
George!

611
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,520
喬治
George!

612
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,900
你好  父親
Hello, father.

613
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,580
跟你說了他們會放了我的
Told you I'd get out.

614
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,120
是的  你說了
Yes, you did.

615
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,070
我說過這事沒完
I told you this weren't over.

616
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,910
你依然會被賣掉  如果妓女還要你
You'll be sold still, if the whores will have you.

617
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,270
我哪都不去
I'm not going anywhere.

618
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,350
你會的
You will.

619
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,530
你會去我要你去的地方
You will go where I tell you!

620
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,820
我不會
I won't.

621
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,040
我不會  我
I won't. I --

622
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,000
求你
Please!

623
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,910
亨利·霍普金斯
Henry Hopkins.

624
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,510
這是干什么
What is this?

625
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:05,740
史蒂芬
Stephen.

626
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,590
他叫這名字  那孩子
That's his name, the boy.

627
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,480
他告訴你的嗎
He told you?

628
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,490
是的
Yep.

629
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,540
兩年了  他一言不發
Two years without speaking,

630
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,660
而你只用一天就知道了他的名字
and in one day, he tells you his name.

631
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:20,800
他一定很喜歡你  上尉
He must have really taken to you, captain.

632
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,230
不  我不這么覺得
No, I wouldn't say that.

633
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,760
誰又能怪他
And who could blame him?

634
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,660
男孩子總需要特別關注
Boys need attention

635
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,710
還有辛勤勞動來消耗他們多余的精力
and hard work to burn off their energy.

636
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,980
我很感激
And I'm grateful...

637
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,320
您的辛勤努力
for your hard work.

638
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,350
這是我回來以后第一次
It's the first hours passed since I've come back

639
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:43,160
不再滿腦子都想著巫師的事
where I haven't thought about witches.

640
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,300
我想人們都會愿意選擇這種生活
I supposed one could choose that life --

641
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,840
本分工作  團結互助  溫馨的家庭
Honest work, community, a loving family,

642
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,680
不會再有巫師
and not a witch in sight.

643
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,450
也許我們還有希望
Maybe there's hope for us yet.

644
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:00,940
你
You!

645
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,710
去通知行政委員
Alert the selectmen.

646
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,730
又一個女巫已經出現  跟我來
Another witch has been revealed. Follow me.

647
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,350
也許不是
Or maybe not.

648
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,060
瑪麗·西布里
Mary Sibley!

649
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,280
你丈夫醒了
Your husband is awake.

650
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,240
喬治醒了
George is awake?

651
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,350
他說話了嗎
Has he spoken?

652
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:33,080
他已被奪取言語能力
He is rendered incapable of speech.

653
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,810
然而  讓他飽受折磨之人的姓名已出現
Nevertheless, the name of his tormentor has been divulged.

654
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:38,970
那是什么意思
What does that mean --

655
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,720
被奪取言語能力
"Rendered unable to speak"?

656
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,160
你認得這瓶藥劑嗎
Do you recognize this potion?

657
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,270
是的
Yes.

658
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:48,430
那是止痛藥劑
It's a physic for pain.

659
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,290
我讓艾薩克拿去給西布里先生的
I gave it to Isaac to give to Mr. Sibley.

660
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:53,130
止痛藥劑
A physic for pain?

661
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:58,350
告訴我  止痛藥劑會不會
Tell me, would a physic for pain

662
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,700
讓西布里先生的嘴被
seal Mr. Sibley's mouth shut...

663
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,130
黃金蛛網封住呢
with a golden web?

664
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,230
止痛藥劑
A tonic for pain.

665
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:24,500
別無其他
Nothing more.

666
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,740
我能說一句嗎  父親
Might I suggest, father,

667
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,320
西布里夫人的藥水可能如其所述
That Mrs. Sibley's tonic is just that,

668
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,250
而造成蛛網出現的
and the work of the web is due,

669
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,920
很可能是真正巫師的蜘蛛親信
more likely, to the real witch's spider familiar.

670
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,240
是的
Yes.

671
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,830
是一種可能  搜查房屋
It's a possibility. Search the house.

672
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,720
等下
Wait!

673
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,250
我很抱歉  先生
I'm sorry, sir.

674
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,110
你是說蜘蛛嗎
Did you say a spider?

675
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:57,520
路易絲家的孩子  曾經被巫師附身折磨
The Lewis child, once tortured and possessed by witches.

676
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,660
可如今她看起來十分健康
Yet now she looks remarkably well.

677
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:01,820
多虧了西布里夫人的悉心照料
All due to Mrs. Sibley's kindness.

678
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,820
她拯救了我的生命
She saved my life.

679
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,580
我曾被飽經折磨
I was tortured and tormented,

680
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,440
在死亡邊緣尋求解脫
at the verge of begging for death,

681
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,480
而瑪麗·西布里將我帶離邪惡
and Mary sibley delivered me from evil.

682
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,280
所以我有些猶豫要不要說
Which is why I hesitate to say --

683
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,940
你想要說什么  姑娘
What is it you have to say, girl?

684
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:19,750
那天早晨
The other morning,

685
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:23,520
當西布里夫人外出處理船運業務的時候
when Mrs. Sibley was out on shipping business...

686
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,350
-然后  -我經過了緹圖芭的房間
- Yes? - ...I did pass Tituba's room,

687
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,620
當時她正在做一件極其詭異的事
and she was doing the strangest thing.

688
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,530
告訴我們  梅西  告訴我們你看到了什么
Tell us, Mercy. Tell us what you saw.

689
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:37,430
她將一個蜘蛛捧在肩頭
She held a spider to her neck.

690
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,170
然后呢
Yes?

691
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:41,980
然后呢
Yes?

692
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,100
她好像在喂它
She seemed to feed it.

693
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:47,800
你
You.

694
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,250
過來
Come here.

695
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:03,460
我在此以
I hereby arrest you...

696
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,700
涉嫌巫術的罪名逮捕你
on the charge of witchcraft.

697
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:08,920
守衛
Guards.

698
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:09,790
是的  長官
Yes, sir. 

699
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,760
好的  長官
Aye, sir.

《塞勒姆》前情提要
Previously on "Salem"...

16
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:03,440
父亲
Father?

17
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,250
把她关起来
Take her to the cage.

18
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,850
柯顿  柯顿
Cotton! Cotton!

19
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,350
你好  父亲
Hello, father.

20
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,900
你依然会被卖掉  如果妓女还要你
You'll be sold still, if the whores will have you.

21
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,120
我哪都不去
I'm not going anywhere.

22
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,470
对不起
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,300
带她到马匹所能及的最远之处
Take her as far as your steeds will travel.

24
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,190
告诉我们  梅西  告诉我们你看到了什么
Tell us, Mercy. Tell us what you saw.

25
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,950
她将一个蜘蛛捧在肩头
She held a spider to her neck.

26
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,260
她好像在喂它
She seemed to feed it.

27
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,300
你
You.

28
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,950
我在此以
I hereby arrest you...

29
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,420
涉嫌巫术的罪名逮捕你
on the charge of witchcraft.

30
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,800
守卫
Guards.

31
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,320
你的怒火中烧
Your wrath burns like fire.

32
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,240
你视我如无物
You look upon me as worthy of nothing.

33
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,390
你纯净的目光中
You are of purer eyes

34
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,100
容不下我的存在
than to bear to have me in your sight.

35
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,880
在你眼中  我比万恶的毒蛇
I am 10,000 times more abominable in your eyes

36
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,670
还要让人憎恶
than the most hateful, venomous serpent is in mine.

37
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,330
我的罪恶让我万劫不复
My wickedness makes me as heavy as lead,

38
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,650
如果你不再眷顾我  主啊
and if you should let me go, Lord,

39
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,670
我愿意堕入地狱
I will plunge into the bottomless pit,

40
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,360
我所有的正义不再能
and all my righteousness would have no more influence

41
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,190
支撑我逃出生天
to uphold me and keep me out of hell

42
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,950
就如螳臂焉能当车
than a spider's web would have to stop a falling rock.

43
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,620
还有什么话对你父亲说吗
Any last words for your father?

44
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,380
愿恶魔像你对我那样
May the devil be as kind and considerate to you

45
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,700
照顾你
as you were to me.

46
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,900
我想梅西了
I miss Mercy.

47
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,330
我们的梅西永远于我们同在
Our Mercy is always with us.

48
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,720
也许那家伙现在是梅西的仆人之一了
Perhaps that's one of her servants now,

49
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,340
照顾着我们  编织着命运的网
watching over us and weaving its web of destiny.

50
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,370
梅西
Mercy...

51
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,250
梅西
Mercy...

52
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,380
你躲不了的  这可是我家
You cannot hide from me in my own house.

53
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,550
你为什么那么做
Why did you do it?

54
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,310
你怎么能
How could you?

55
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,900
赶紧给我出来
Come out from there at once.

56
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,340
我是为了你啊
I did it for you.

57
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,130
为我
For me?

58
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,110
他是冲着你来的
He was coming for you.

59
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,400
如果我没所作为
If I hadn't done anything,

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,680
现在就是你在受难了
it would be you in the house of pain.

61
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,500
你应该感谢我
You should thank me.

62
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,660
也许吧
Perhaps.

63
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,470
但这由不得你做主
But it was not up to you.

64
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,740
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

65
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,920
*鼓鸣震天*
*Witch drums*

66
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,420
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

67
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,750
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

68
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,900
*鼓鸣震天*
*The witch drums*

69
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,370
*宁入地狱*
*Better pray for hell*

70
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:09,450
*不留人间*
*Not hallelujah*

71
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,550
找到你了
There you are.

72
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,470
我认识缇图芭甚至比你更久
I have known Tituba even longer than you have,

73
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,400
那时候她还是个孩子
ever since she was a small child.

74
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,540
她这一生经历了很多
With all that she has endured in her life,

75
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,810
如果说谁最可靠  那肯定是她
if there is anyone who can hold out, it is she.

76
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,590
如果
"If."

77
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,710
小小的一个词儿
Such a small word

78
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,060
却要承担我们所有人都无法承受的后果
with such immense consequence for all of us.

79
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,890
你必须信任她
You must trust her.

80
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,960
她会利用好机会的
She will use the opportunity.

81
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,770
机会
Opportunity?

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,510
折磨也算机会吗
You call torture an opportunity?

83
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,180
我说的机会  是把英克里斯的注意力
The opportunity to divert Increase's attention

84
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,980
向我们所希望的方向转移
to where we want it and away from where we do not.

85
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,140
我不在乎
I don't care.

86
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,570
我接受不了
I can't bear it,

87
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,910
一想到他会怎么折磨她
the thought of what he might do to her.

88
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,210
我不会坐视不理的
I won't stand for it.

89
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,450
你觉得怎么样
Do you like it?

90
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,940
"苦痛出真言"
"Truth through pain."

91
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,320
我觉得还挺合适的
I find it a fitting,

92
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,800
算是对塞勒姆的好人们最委婉的示意吧
almost poetic demonstration to the good people of Salem

93
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,310
这正是他们目前最需要做的
as to what is now expected of them. Hmm?

94
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,450
你想想  把这个
Imagine transforming 

95
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,940
寻花问柳的地方  
this house of woebegone pleasure

96
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,070
变成一间忏悔室
into a place of repentance.

97
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,030
我听说他们已经给它起名叫苦难屋了
I understand already they call it my house of pain.

98
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,790
你同意了吗
And you approve?

99
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,420
是的  是的  我同意
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed, I do.

100
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,250
让人们打心眼儿里记住这些苦痛
Oh, keeping the pains of hell foremost in one's mind

101
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,190
是最可靠...  不  不
is the surest... nay, nay, the...

102
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,010
是唯一能防止他们虚度年华的办法
the only road to prevent spending eternity there.

103
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,500
今天有什么我能帮你的吗
And how may I help you this fine day?

104
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,220
你关了一个我的人在这儿
You keep someone here that belongs to me.

105
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,020
我有充分的理由相信
Well, I have very good reason to believe

106
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,100
她属于恶魔
that she belongs to the devil himself.

107
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,180
胡说
Nonsense.

108
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,440
我从小就认识她了
I've known her since we were girls.

109
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,080
老实说  她不只是我的仆人
Truth be told, she is not just my servant.

110
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,590
她也是我的朋友
She is also my friend.

111
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,790
我在想
Well, I wonder, then,

112
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,470
也许正因为跟自己的女主人成为朋友
becoming befriended by...by one's mistress

113
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,730
才让她误入歧途的
is perhaps the reason that she went astray.

114
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,410
也许...
Perhaps...

115
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,910
也许不是她
Perhaps it is not she,

116
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,090
而是你  来这里会更加受益匪浅
but... but you who could most benefit from being here.

117
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,820
你好像忘记是在跟谁说话了  父亲
I think you forget to whom you are speaking, Father.

118
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,120
柯顿都能起床走动了啊  很好
Cotton up and about. Good.

119
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,470
不不  我知道这是玛丽·西布里
No, no. I know this is Mary Sibley,

120
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,500
我的朋友乔治的妻子
wife of my friend George,

121
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,560
就是在她的悉心照料下
under whose under tender care

122
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,600
乔治莫名其妙地形同枯槁了
he has mysteriously withered into an invalid.

123
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,140
您这话什么意思  先生
I resent your implications, sir.

124
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,650
我没什么意思  只是直说而已
I imply nothing. No, I say outright.

125
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,860
往好了说  你只是个软弱不负责任的女人
At best, I find you to be a weak and irresponsible woman.

126
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,580
往坏处想的话...
And at worst... well, 

127
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,330
我们还是不要往坏处想了吧
let us not even consider the worst.

128
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,840
不不  我该对乔治
No, no. I shall take responsibility 

129
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,820
还有那个奴隶  缇图芭负责
for George and for the slave, 

130
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,800
至少目前如此
Tituba, for the time being.

131
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,870
与此同时  我建议你回家
Meantime, I suggest you get you home

132
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,780
回到西布里先生的七角尖阁里去吧
to Mr. Sibley's House of Seven Gables.

133
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,780
{\an8}小说《七个尖角阁的老宅》
描写了一个家族前人作孽后人遭殃的故事 

134
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,640
柯顿  我们去办事
Cotton, to business.

135
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,190
撕舌器
Tongue tearer.

136
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,090
这个是用来
This is for

137
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,460
让我们审讯的人开口讲出真话的
snipping the lies from the mouths of those we question.

138
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,720
碎骨器
Skull crusher.

139
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,850
夹乳钳
Breast ripper.

140
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,990
这些东西
Both of these are,

141
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,730
都简单粗暴  名如其物
well, quite aptly, if somewhat crudely, named.

142
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,700
父亲  我曾经把一个无辜的人逼死
Father, I once pressed an innocent man to death.

143
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,840
肯定有更好的方法
There must be a better way.

144
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,890
父亲  你得知道  囚犯为了
Father, you must know, a tortured prisoner

145
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,900
免受折磨  肯定会承认任何事的
will confess to anything to stop the pain...

146
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,060
任何事  不论真假
Anything... true or not!

147
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,440
对  确实如此
Yes, that is surely so.

148
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,450
但是如果你以为我会笨到
But you...you grossly mistake my faculties

149
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,280
相信一个刚被拷打之人
if you think me fool enough to accept as truth

150
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,040
因为痛苦而说出的一切
the first pained pourings that invariably come

151
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,110
那就太低估我的刑具了
from the tormented lips.

152
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,090
但是  真相显而易见...
But, sir, it is a self-evident truth...

153
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,860
没有真相是显而易见的
I take no truth to be self-evident,

154
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,360
可能今天这里发生的
save perhaps that whatever acts of horror 

155
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,140
一切恐怖行为
take place here today

156
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,310
都是我不在期间你的松懈倦怠造成的
are due entirely to your laxity during my absence.

157
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,200
不要让他误导你
Do not let him mislead you,

158
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,960
不要妄想
and abandon all hope

159
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,030
他或者其他任何人来救你
of your deliverance by him or by any other agent.

160
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,210
现在你需要做的
Now, what you must do

161
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,230
就是思考...
is meditate...

162
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,690
你眼前的这些工具
on these instruments which you see before you.

163
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,960
你必须一心一意
You must set your mind

164
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,790
去追求那些
firmly in pursuit of the goals

165
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,410
你必须实现的目标
which you must achieve,

166
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,450
也就是你的生存和你的救赎
that of your survival and your salvation.

167
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,200
异端尖叉
The heretic's fork.

168
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,010
好
Yes.

169
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,270
让你时刻集中注意  保持警觉
To keep you attentive and alert during the process.

170
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,140
还有这个...
And this...

171
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,310
你肯定知道是什么吧
Well, this you surely recognize --

172
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,580
这是拇指夹
Thumbscrews.

173
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,980
我觉得这是最简单
I believe these to be the simplest,

174
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,380
最高效的刑讯工具了
and yet the most effective method of revealing the truth.

175
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,690
我们开始
And so let us begin.

176
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,570
你使用宗教法庭的
You employ the very tools of oppression

177
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,410
镇压工具...
perfected by the inquisition...

178
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,500
那些称我们为异教徒的人
...tools used against good puritans

179
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,680
用来对付善良清教徒的工具
by those who would call us heretics.

180
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,420
这叫以毒攻毒  孩子
Fire with fire, my boy.

181
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,510
她人呢  安去哪里了
Where is she? Where is Anne?

182
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,500
你的傻瓜女儿
Your foolish daughter

183
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,410
做了件非常危险的事
has done something exceedingly dangerous.

184
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,360
她戴了我的面具
She put my mask on.

185
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,120
那快点把她带回来啊
Well, bring her home this instant.

186
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,720
我做不到
I cannot.

187
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,080
每次只能有一个人用
Only one traveler may use it at a time,

188
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,760
鉴于她没有经验
and as she has no experience,

189
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,440
所以肯定不知道怎么才能利用面具回来
she will have no idea how to use it in order to get back.

190
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,630
现在这个面具只会成为对付我的证据
The only possible use for it now is as evidence against me.

191
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,680
可她去哪里了
But where has she gone?

192
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,730
去树林了
To the woods.

193
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,090
我会找到她的
I shall find her.

194
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,790
你有勇气去面对印第安人
You, man enough to face Indians...

195
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,000
面对野狼  面对你假装能控制的魔鬼吗
and wolves or the devils you pretend to command?

196
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,400
我也别无他法
There is no alternative.

197
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,360
那就想个办法
Find one,

198
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,230
我发誓...
for I swear by...

199
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,810
以你敬若神明的那个东西发誓
by whatever it is you hold holy,

200
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,550
如果今晚我们的女儿没在自己床上安睡
if our daughter is not asleep in her own bed this very night,

201
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,400
我一定会到处去说  直到你
my tongue will wag until you are tied to a stake

202
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,890
被绑上绞刑架为止
in the middle of the commons.

203
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,250
注意点  妻子
Take care, wife.

204
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,180
你这样只会害了自己
You shall only implicate yourself.

205
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,900
那我们就玉石俱焚吧
Then we will taste each other's ashes.

206
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,360
这是梦  只是个白日梦而已
This is a dream... nothing but a waking dream.

207
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,570
那个面具
The mask.

208
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,070
父亲的研究
My father's study.

209
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,610
这片树林
These woods.

210
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,420
只是个梦罢了
It's all but a dream.

211
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,920
此时此刻  我正躺在卧室的床上
At this moment, I lie upon my bed in my room...

212
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,570
就在家里
at home.

213
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,500
快醒醒
Wake up!

214
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,020
醒醒
Wake up!

215
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,810
我怎么来的不重要
It doesn't matter how I got here.

216
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,770
我得回到塞勒姆
I must get back to Salem.

217
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,370
东边
East.

218
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,720
这边走
This way.

219
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,850
你怎么知道她在树林里
What makes you think she's in the woods?

220
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,040
我了解自己的女儿
I-I know my daughter,

221
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,520
了解她的想法  也知道她有时根本不加思考
how she thinks and how at times she doesn't.

222
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,250
我知道你觉得我作为塞勒姆
I-I know you feel that I have somehow failed

223
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,860
秉持天赋人权的治安官
in my duties as... as magistrate

224
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,350
多少有些失职
to uphold the natural rights here in Salem

225
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,160
也明白你对我那些阴暗的揣测
And that you hold whatever dark suspicions you do about me.

226
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,770
但我不是为了自己
But I ask not for myself.

227
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,860
是为了安
For Anne.

228
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,050
走吧
Let's go.

229
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,660
谢谢你
Thank you.

230
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,810
等发现她还活着再谢我吧
You can thank me if we find her...alive.

231
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,790
自地狱中拯救吾等吧  天父
Save us from hell, Father?!

232
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,010
你现在所做的
Is that what you're doing 

233
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,360
是在拯救吾等于地狱吗
saving us from hell?

234
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,220
已经太晚了
Well, too late.

235
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,540
塞勒姆就是地狱  我则身在其中
Salem is hell, and I am not out of it.

236
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,060
我是你创造之物
I am the creature you have made.

237
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,170
我无法成为你希望的样子
I cannot be who you will me to be,

238
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,100
但我又没有其他的志向
yet I lack the will to be anything else.

239
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,270
像是畸婴出世
Like that monstrous birth,

240
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,630
我还不如不出生的好
it were better had I never been born.

241
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,920
但我无法打破时间的沙漏
Though I cannot draw back the sands of time,

242
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,560
无法停止时间流逝
I can break the hourglass.

243
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,440
再见了  天父
Goodbye, Father.

244
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,510
我会在地狱安家  等待与你相见
I will make my home in hell and await you there.

245
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,940
太软弱了
Weak.

246
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,920
我连这微弱的烛光都无法熄灭
Too weak even to snuff this feeble candle.

247
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,520
你很厉害
Well, you're wonderful.

248
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,820
颇有本事
Quite remarkable.

249
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,630
你列出了村里起码半数人的名字
You've named at least half the people in the village.

250
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,320
当然了  他们都不是巫师
Of course, none of them are witches.

251
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,880
你如此迫切地供出他们  恰恰证明了这一点
The fact that you offer them up so eagerly attests to that.

252
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,230
但你已经进步不少了
But you made great progress.

253
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,750
我们就要拨开谎言的迷雾了
We are working our way through the lies.

254
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,650
要不了多久  那一刻就会到来
Very soon, we will come to that precise moment

255
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,460
当痛苦难以承受
when the agony will be so unendurable

256
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,370
即使谎言之王
that even a-a loyal servant

257
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,300
最忠实的仆人  也将背弃谎言
of the prince of lies can lie no longer.

258
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,370
这个工具
This tool...

259
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,320
它叫做涩梨子
it is called the choke pear,

260
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,410
我也听说过叫"痛苦之梨"
Although I have heard it called the pear of anguish.

261
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:55,770
它能伸进黑暗的穴洞之中
It is inserted into the darker cavities and then...

262
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,060
然后张开
...opened up,

263
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,770
洞中的东西
with the expectation

264
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,820
也会被撑开
that the subject, too, will open up.

265
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,730
现在  给我真正的名字
Now, tell me the real names.

266
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,620
在塞勒姆天上的父啊  你徒有其名
My father, who art in Salem, hollow be thy name.

267
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,870
你的国已毁
Thy kingdom's done,

268
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,810
你的旨意行在地上
Your will I shun,

269
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,030
已遭背离
on Earth...

270
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,770
如同行在你那天堂铸就的地狱之中
As in the hell you'd make of heaven.

271
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,060
魔鬼要来带我走了
The devil himself come to take me.

272
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,330
带我走吧  魔鬼
Take me, devil.

273
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,340
我本该将生命的每一刻当做最后一刻
I should have lived every hour on Earth as if it were my last.

274
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,440
现在就是最后一刻了
And now it is.

275
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,200
置之死地而后生
Out of death comes life.

276
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,950
我明白了  主  这才是你的本意
I see now, Lord, that is your true face.

277
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,820
你不会理解我做了什么
You cannot know what I have done

278
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,660
又侍奉了谁
or who I have served

279
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,940
除非你先知道原因
until you know why.

280
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,820
那么
So...

281
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,680
就告诉我
then tell me.

282
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,730
为什么
Why?

283
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,120
为了正义
For justice.

284
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,600
我不是巫师
I am not a witch.

285
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,960
也不是清教徒
I am not a puritan.

286
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,900
我是阿拉瓦克部落人
I am of the Arawak tribe...

287
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,340
或者曾经是
or I once was.

288
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,210
但当我闭上双眼
But I close my eyes,

289
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:06,650
我仍能看见那些翠绿的灌丛
And I can still see the green of my jungle

290
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,040
以及英国佬那些惨白的面孔
and the deadly white of the Englishmen's faces.

291
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,510
我以前从没见过那种肤色
I had never seen skin like that,

292
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,840
如此苍白  他们向我们走来时
so white when we see them walking towards us,

293
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,980
我们以为那是幽灵
We think they are ghosts.

294
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,230
奴隶
Slavers.

295
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,620
他们屠杀了我们大多数的男人
They slaughtered many of our men,

296
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,140
用铁链铐住剩下的
chained the rest, 

297
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,510
然后对女人纵享其欢
and have their way with the women.

298
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,930
我还太小  对他们毫无用处
I am too young to be of use to them,

299
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,590
但妈妈和姐姐们就不同了
but my mother and sisters are not.

300
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,930
他们还强迫我去看
and they forced me to watch.

301
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,540
之后  挂着镣铐的我回头望去
Later, in chains, I look back,

302
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,510
他们将村里的棚屋付之一炬
and they're burning the huts of my village,

303
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,750
我看到树林之外
And I see two red eyes staring back at me, 

304
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,100
有两只血红的眼睛盯着我
out of the trees.

305
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,560
接着它们开口对我说
And the red eyes speak to me,

306
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,870
"缇图芭  你是我的"
"Tituba, you are mine."

307
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:56,000
撒旦对我们说话时  总会用我们的母语
Satan speaks to each of us in our own native tongue.

308
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,110
现在  还要继续吗
And now shall we continue?

309
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,080
这里不久前有人来过
Someone came through here quite recently...

310
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,270
某些迷失了方向的人
Someone who didn't know where they were going...

311
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,850
并且彻底不见了  就像...
And moved radically, as if lost or...

312
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,030
柯顿  你搞什么鬼
Cotton! What in the hell?

313
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,970
不是鬼  小约翰
Oh, not hell, Johnny,

314
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,070
也不是神
Nor heaven.

315
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:35,740
是大地
Just earth...

316
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,520
光辉无比的大地
Glorious, glorious earth.

317
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,370
恐怕牧师已经神志不清了
I fear the reverend has gone mad.

318
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,640
柯顿  赶紧给我滚下来
Cotton, get your drunk ass down here.

319
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,630
不  我就不
No, sir, I will not.

320
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,750
我在这儿站得高看得远
I can see far more clearly from here.

321
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,270
不光看得远  什么都看得见
In fact, I can see everything.

322
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,780
我看到上帝正亲身走过这片树林
God himself walks among these woods,

323
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,840
身后流动着五彩祥云
Trailing clouds of animal glory.

324
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,160
你到底怎么了
What happened to you?

325
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,070
我把靴子拖了
I took my boots off.

326
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,050
然后呢
Yeah, so?

327
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,430
然后我就感觉到了大地
So, I felt the earth!

328
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,410
在我赤裸的双脚下
I felt the raw, 

329
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,400
我感觉到了这原始的  神圣的土地
sacred earth beneath my naked feet.

330
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,240
我感觉到了大地的呼吸
I felt the earth breathe.

331
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,590
赶紧回家
Go home.

332
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,940
要是你那强大的感知力是真的
If your great insight is real,

333
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,550
那回你屋里也一样能继续感知
It will be just as real in your chambers

334
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,040
而且安全得多
And a whole lot safer.

335
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,960
森林的空气
The forest air and this...

336
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,310
和这挺拔的大树  现在是我的老师了
Sturdy tree are my teachers now.

337
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,870
咱们没时间跟他耗着了
We haven't time for this.

338
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,760
我还有很多要学的呢
I still have much to learn!

339
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:44,180
你到底什么时候把灵魂出卖给魔鬼的
When exactly did you sell your soul to the devil?

340
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,140
我的身体已经被买卖过很多次了
My body was bought and sold many times,

341
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,120
但我从未出卖过灵魂
But never my soul,

342
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,310
直到我来了塞勒姆
Not until I came to salem.

343
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,370
年幼的我被关在笼子里
I am a child in a cage,

344
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,170
在船上得到的食物比畜生还少
Given less to eat than the animals on the ship.

345
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,540
我很怕自己再也无法重见天日了
I fear I will never see the sun again.

346
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,670
然后  来了一个男人
And then a man comes.

347
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,310
就是他把我带到了塞勒姆
It was he that brought me to Salem,

348
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,960
他买我只是为了再把我卖出去
Only to be bought and sold again.

349
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,150
我被一次又一次转卖
I am sold from hand to hand, from man to man.

350
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,360
但起码我不用再待在笼子里了
But at least I am no longer in a cage.

351
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,680
而且最后买下我的还是个好人家
And my final owner is not cruel.

352
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,540
沃科特家给了我一张可以睡觉的床
The Wolcotts give me a bed to sleep in.

353
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,760
他们家的女儿  玛丽  待我亲如姐妹
Their girl child, Mary, treats me almost like a sister.

354
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:33,270
但每到夜晚  我仍会为了母亲而哭泣
But still at night, I weep for my mother,

355
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,770
我哭着从自己的草榻上跑出去
And I ride a river of tears out of my straw bed,

356
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,070
跑进了黑森林
Into the dark woods.

357
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,910
黑森林
The dark woods?

358
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,800
你去黑森林见谁
Who do you meet in the dark woods?

359
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,930
卡耐马恶鬼
The kenaima.

360
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:59,260
他是来救我的  来救我们所有人
He has come to save me... save all of us.

361
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,100
他召唤所有受伤的人们
He draws to him all who hurt,

362
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,350
所有在躲藏的人们
All who hide,

363
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,180
所有心怀仇恨的人们
All who hate,

364
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,720
所有渴望正义的人们
All who thirst for justice,

365
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,730
他将我们召集成一圈
Gathers us into the circle 

366
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,030
许诺给我们一个领袖
and promises us a leader,

367
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,350
一个救世主
A savior,

368
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,350
一个将用神力击溃敌人的人
One who will crush our enemies with a mighty fist.

369
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,360
他是个信守承诺的人
And he keeps his promise.

370
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,470
姑娘
Girl, 

371
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,290
我也是个信守承诺的人
I, too, keep my promises.

372
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,510
我现在许诺你
And I promise you now

373
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:40,690
如果你不告诉我那圈子里还有谁
I will put your eyes out this instant

374
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,200
我就立马把你的眼珠子挖出来
If you do not tell me who is in the circle,

375
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,750
都有谁  说名字
Who, the names,

376
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,470
巫师的圈子里还有谁
Who is in the circle of witches.

377
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,490
告诉我
Tell me.

378
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,010
真是坚强啊
What fortitude.

379
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,110
因无情的压迫而团结一致
Solidarity amongst the rudely oppressed.

380
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,280
相互鼓舞
Inspiring.It's... 

381
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,570
真是太感人了
it's all so very touching.

382
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,820
但我要告诉你  你上当了
But I tell you, you're duped.

383
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,870
这些东西可不是你的朋友
These creatures are not your friends,

384
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,810
他们不是任何人的朋友
Nor anyone's friends.

385
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,990
他们是所有人类的敌人
They are the enemies of all mankind.

386
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,230
告诉我  到底是谁挑起了
Tell me, who started this war

387
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,790
这场巫师和清教徒的战争
Between witches and puritans,

388
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,570
是四处分散的他们  还是人多势众的你们
The scattered few of them or the mighty many of you?

389
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,350
就按你说的来理解
By your own admission,

390
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,500
这些东西为了复仇
These creatures have sold their very souls

391
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,720
将灵魂出卖给了魔鬼
For vengeance to the devil.

392
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,950
不是吗
Is this not so?

393
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,490
你们的人就没当过奴隶吗
Were your people never slaves?

394
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,670
他们从未在荒野中哭喊着寻求正义吗
Did they never cry out in the wilderness for justice?

395
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,370
你们的上帝听到他们的哭喊
And did your god not hear their cries 

396
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,980
难道不是报以雷击吗
and answer with thunder?

397
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,790
你还不明白吗
Don't you see?

398
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,400
根本没有巫师
There are no witches,

399
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,130
只有像我这样的可怜人
Only poor people like me,

400
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,270
被围追堵截
hunted and harried,

401
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,920
折磨灭口
tortured and murdered,

402
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,750
没什么别的理由 只因为他们不是你
and for no reason other than they are not you!

403
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,770
她来过这儿
She was here. 

404
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,180
我又找到她的痕迹了
I've got her track again.

405
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,650
不管发生什么
No matter what happens,

406
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,910
保持冷静别说话
just stay calm and say nothing.

407
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,330
[土人语]

408
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,160
[土人语]

409
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,110
[土人语]

410
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,810
[土人语]

411
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,360
[土人语]

412
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,230
[土人语]

413
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,470
[土人语]

414
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,640
你真是谜中之谜  上尉
You are a mystery within a mystery, captain.

415
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,750
像猎食者般在丛林游走
Walk the woods like a predator,

416
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,180
如同自己也是土人一样和他们顺畅交流
speak to savages as if you were one of them.

417
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,640
他们看见她了  但没有动她
They saw her, but they did not touch her.

418
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,840
你相信他们吗
And you believe them?

419
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,160
我信
I do.

420
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,450
他们用了一个词来形容她
They used a word to describe her.

421
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,620
这词有很多意思
It can mean a lot of different things,

422
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,620
不过一般它是指"疯狂"
but it usually just means "Crazy."

423
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,560
有很多词可以形容我女儿  上尉
My daughter is many things, captain,

424
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,390
但是疯狂绝不是其中之一
but crazy is not one of them.

425
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,520
他们这么认为真是她走运
Well, lucky for her they thought she was.

426
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:54,090
他们觉得疯子是我们称之为圣人的人
They think crazy people are what we call holy...

427
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,210
世界与世界间的游走者
Walkers between worlds.

428
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,870
你能想到什么吗
Make any sense to you?

429
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,470
你问我谁挑起的战争
You ask me who began this war.

430
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,400
作为一个
As one scarred

431
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,560
抗争了40年的老兵
with 40 years soldiering in it,

432
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,970
我现在告诉你
I tell you now...

433
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,180
这根本不重要
It does not matter...

434
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,190
只有战争结束才重要
...only that it end.

435
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,070
战争会结束
And end it will.

436
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,400
你等族类希望渺茫
You and your kind have no hope.

437
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,620
你们会流血  会受伤
You will bleed, and you will hurt...

438
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,820
最后在绝望中死去
and you will die in a hopeless cause.

439
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,720
爱不会让人绝望
Love is not a hopeless cause.

440
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,810
我是不会背叛我此生真爱的
I will not betray the one true love of my life.

441
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,750
我懂了
I understand.

442
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,470
我终于懂了
Finally I understand it all.

443
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,740
什么都懂了
I understand everything.

444
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,450
可怜的家伙
You poor thing.

445
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,110
就是个小女孩
Just a little girl,

446
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:32,090
被绑架  奴役  孤独一人
kidnapped, enslaved, alone,

447
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,970
寻求世人的理解
seeking understanding,

448
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,480
和安慰
comfort...

449
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,110
寻求爱
seeking love.

450
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,460
你还不明白吗
Do you not see?

451
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,040
我不怀疑你爱着
I do not doubt that you love.

452
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:54,580
但现在你和我单独在这里  诚实点吧
But just for this one moment here alone with me, be honest,

453
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,490
不是对我  至少也对你自己
if not with me, at least with yourself.

454
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,510
你真的相信他们像你爱着他们
Do you really believe that they love you

455
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,520
那样地爱你吗
as much as you love them?

456
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,590
想想吧  女人
Think, woman.

457
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,620
想想他  那个人
Think of that, that person.

458
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,760
在脑海里描绘他们
Picture them in your mind.

459
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,070
你了解他们
You know them so well.

460
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,000
考虑一下他们是什么人
Consider who they are,

461
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:20,630
不是你希望他们是什么人  而是他们的真面目
not who you wish them to be, but who they really are,

462
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,880
扪心自问  要是躺在这儿的是他们
and ask yourself, were they here,

463
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:26,400
到底会不会供出你的名字
would they or would they not offer up your name

464
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,500
以求自保
to save themselves?

465
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,490
他们会瞬间背叛你来保全自身
They would betray you in an instant to save themselves,

466
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,700
这就是你爱的人
and this is the person that you love

467
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,600
绝不会像你爱他那样地爱你
and who will never love you the same way.

468
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:44,710
真的值得吗  你忍受的恐惧
Is it worth it all, the horrors you have endured,

469
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,930
和煎熬
and the agonies...

470
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:58,760
还有你面前那无比丑陋的死亡
...and the ugly, ugly death you have in front of you?

471
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,950
这是你真心想要的吗
Is that really what you want,

472
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:06,140
在你已经对自己敞开心扉
now that you have now admitted to yourself

473
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,170
看清了他们的真面目之后
who they really are?

474
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,290
缇图芭
Tituba...

475
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:17,210
你知道世间最大的欢愉是什么吗
Do you know the greatest pleasure in the world?

476
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:22,410
就是当痛苦停止的时刻
It is when the pain stops.

477
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,190
痛苦会停止的
And stop it will.

478
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,050
你只要告诉我一个名字
You have but to tell me a name.

479
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,720
轻轻说出来就好
Just whisper it.

480
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,760
告诉我谁是塞勒姆
Tell me who is the leader

481
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,640
巫师中的领头人
of the witches in Salem.

482
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,450
我发誓  你要找的人...
On my soul, the one you seek...

483
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,700
还能更糟吗
It could be worse.

484
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,760
竟然下雨了
It could be raining.

485
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,320
你终于找到回家的路了
At last, you found your way home.

486
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:34,880
安
Anne!

487
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,470
没事了
It's all right.

488
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:48,970
我以为我失去你了
I thought I'd lost you.

489
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,650
我也是
Me too.

490
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,010
怎么找到的
How?

491
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,290
怎么找到的
How?

492
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,060
你们怎么找到我的
How did you find me?

493
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,140
多谢奥登上尉吧
Give all credit to captain Alden

494
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:12,160
他在丛林里那些不可思议的技巧
and his preternatural skills in these woods.

495
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,110
只要找到这里  追踪足迹就很简单了
Following the tracks was easy once I found my way out here.

496
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,870
但我不明白你是怎么离开塞勒姆这么远的
But what I can't figure is how you got so far out of Salem

497
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,580
中间的路途几乎无迹可寻
Leaving so few tracks and traces between here and there.

498
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,130
我傻傻的  还闹着脾气
I am a silly thing, and in a fit of petulance,

499
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:45,000
我跑进了林子
I-I ran into these woods

500
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,690
根本没思考要去哪  或是天有多晚
without thinking where I was going or how late it was...

501
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,300
等反应过来已经太迟了
Until it was too late.

502
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,060
离开塞勒姆没留下任何踪迹
Without leaving any tracks out of Salem.

503
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,230
在我徘徊的时候
It... it rained briefly while I was...

504
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,810
下了会雨
wandering.

505
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,290
也许洗刷掉了我的踪迹
Perhaps that washed away my tracks,

506
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,970
或者是你没找到
or perhaps you just didn't find them.

507
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,230
不管怎样
In either case...

508
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,020
请原谅我
please forgive me

509
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,300
带给你们两位的麻烦
for the trouble I've put you both through.

510
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,370
谢谢你
Thank you.

511
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,530
我相信如果我有需要
Well, I'm sure you'd do the same thing for me

512
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,740
你也会
if I ever needed...

513
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,440
救我的
Rescuing.

514
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,300
你说得没错
You were correct.

515
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,280
她的确是位非凡的女子
She's a remarkable young woman.

516
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:05,660
我可以明白她为什么不仅仅
I can understand why she's not merely your...

517
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:09,590
是你的仆人  还是你的朋友
your servant, but your friend, as well.

518
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:12,110
我发现了一些非常了不起的事
I've discovered something quite extraordinary.

519
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:14,680
我发现了很多爱
I find so much love.

520
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,560
爱
Love?

521
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,180
令我不解的是
What I did not understand

522
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,600
塞勒姆的巫师统领
was that the chief witch of Salem

523
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,570
不仅仅是她的领袖
is not merely her leader...

524
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,960
也是她的爱人
but her lover.

525
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,120
她招供了吗
She confessed?

526
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:29,540
爱是一枚双面硬币  不是吗
Love is a-a two-faced coin, is it not?

527
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,120
有一面必定代表背叛
And one face is surely betrayal.

528
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:36,770
你介意吗
Do you mind?

529
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:37,860
什么
What?

530
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,800
请便
Oh. Yes, please.

531
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,600
我不常放纵  但是
I rarely indulge, but...

532
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,380
我感觉需要恢复点元气
I feel the need of a restorative.

533
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,150
乔治啊  乔治
Oh, George George.

534
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,620
他总是能做出殖民地里最好的酒窖
He's always cultivated the finest cellar in the colony,

535
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,090
我刚说什么来的
What was I saying?

536
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:03,910
爱
Love.

537
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,770
对
Yes.

538
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,260
你知道吗
You know...

539
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:12,640
虽然事实如此  但没有人会承认
It is true that, and no one will admit, 

540
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,770
爱情并不平等
that love is never equal.

541
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:18,030
而它的不平等
And in its inequality 

542
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,250
成就了它的脆弱
lies its fragility,

543
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,700
被爱的更少的那一方
for the one who is loved less

544
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,630
总有一天会觉得爱情如烟
will one day find love tastes like ashes.

545
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:31,070
这也是缇图芭小姐现在的心情
That is indeed what poor Miss Tituba found.

546
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:34,840
不过她倒是跟我说了一切
But she did tell me everything,

547
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,950
她先跟我说了梅西·路易丝
And she started with Mercy Lewis.

548
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,880
梅西
Mercy?

549
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:43,310
梅西·路易丝也许一开始是
Mercy Lewis may well have begun

550
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,980
邪恶的受害者  但是她
as a victim of malice, but she...

551
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:51,430
她被攻击她的野兽变成了女巫
she was made witch by the very beast that assailed her.

552
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,140
她不在这
She's not here.

553
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,060
她下午出去了
Uh, she went out this afternoon.

554
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,470
她还没回来
She's not returned.

555
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,400
那并不是很重要
Well, it is no great matter.

556
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,530
反正  她还能跑到哪去
After all, where can she run to?

557
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,430
我会在太阳升起前
I will have her and her girls

558
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,600
抓住她和她的那些女孩们
by the time the sun comes up.

559
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,080
我刚回到萨勒姆的时候
When I first returned to Salem,

560
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,530
我曾非常坚信撒旦的同伴
I was convinced that satan's true partner

561
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:32,080
就在我的眼前
was right in front of me

562
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:35,570
而我需要做的就是伸出手抓住她
and all I need do is reach out my hand to take her.

563
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:40,810
你可以想象当我知道约翰·奥登上尉
You can imagine my shock to discover that Captain John Alden

564
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,620
是萨勒姆恐怖事件的幕后黑手时有多惊讶
stands behind all of Salem's horror.

565
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:55,010
我恐怕  需要呼吸点新鲜空气
I fear I...need a breath of air.

566
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,560
能和我出去走走吗  玛丽·西布里
Will you walk with me, Mary Sibley,

567
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:01,870
在夜晚的清爽中
In the evening air...

568
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:07,610
也许我们能找到一个好地方
where we may have a good vantage point

569
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,960
观看一场逮捕
from which to witness an arrest?

570
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:18,260
我想回去看看柯顿怎么样了
I'm tempted to go back, see if Cotton's all right.

571
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:20,260
他可能会在森林里迷路
He could get lost in those woods

572
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,520
然后在熊的肚子里醒来
and wake up inside the belly of a bear.

573

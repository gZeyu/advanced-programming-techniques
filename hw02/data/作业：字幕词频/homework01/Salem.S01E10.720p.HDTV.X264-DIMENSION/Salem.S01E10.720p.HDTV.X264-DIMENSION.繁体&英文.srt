《塞勒姆》前情提要
Previously on "Salem"...

16
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:03,440
父親
Father?

17
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,250
把她關起來
Take her to the cage.

18
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,850
柯頓  柯頓
Cotton! Cotton!

19
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,350
你好  父親
Hello, father.

20
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,900
你依然會被賣掉  如果妓女還要你
You'll be sold still, if the whores will have you.

21
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,120
我哪都不去
I'm not going anywhere.

22
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,470
對不起
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,300
帶她到馬匹所能及的最遠之處
Take her as far as your steeds will travel.

24
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,190
告訴我們  梅西  告訴我們你看到了什么
Tell us, Mercy. Tell us what you saw.

25
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,950
她將一個蜘蛛捧在肩頭
She held a spider to her neck.

26
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,260
她好像在喂它
She seemed to feed it.

27
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,300
你
You.

28
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,950
我在此以
I hereby arrest you...

29
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,420
涉嫌巫術的罪名逮捕你
on the charge of witchcraft.

30
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,800
守衛
Guards.

31
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,320
你的怒火中燒
Your wrath burns like fire.

32
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,240
你視我如無物
You look upon me as worthy of nothing.

33
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,390
你純凈的目光中
You are of purer eyes

34
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,100
容不下我的存在
than to bear to have me in your sight.

35
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,880
在你眼中  我比萬惡的毒蛇
I am 10,000 times more abominable in your eyes

36
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,670
還要讓人憎惡
than the most hateful, venomous serpent is in mine.

37
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,330
我的罪惡讓我萬劫不復
My wickedness makes me as heavy as lead,

38
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,650
如果你不再眷顧我  主啊
and if you should let me go, Lord,

39
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,670
我愿意墮入地獄
I will plunge into the bottomless pit,

40
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,360
我所有的正義不再能
and all my righteousness would have no more influence

41
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,190
支撐我逃出生天
to uphold me and keep me out of hell

42
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,950
就如螳臂焉能當車
than a spider's web would have to stop a falling rock.

43
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,620
還有什么話對你父親說嗎
Any last words for your father?

44
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,380
愿惡魔像你對我那樣
May the devil be as kind and considerate to you

45
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,700
照顧你
as you were to me.

46
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,900
我想梅西了
I miss Mercy.

47
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,330
我們的梅西永遠于我們同在
Our Mercy is always with us.

48
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,720
也許那家伙現在是梅西的仆人之一了
Perhaps that's one of her servants now,

49
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,340
照顧著我們  編織著命運的網
watching over us and weaving its web of destiny.

50
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,370
梅西
Mercy...

51
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,250
梅西
Mercy...

52
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,380
你躲不了的  這可是我家
You cannot hide from me in my own house.

53
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,550
你為什么那么做
Why did you do it?

54
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,310
你怎么能
How could you?

55
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,900
趕緊給我出來
Come out from there at once.

56
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,340
我是為了你啊
I did it for you.

57
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,130
為我
For me?

58
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,110
他是沖著你來的
He was coming for you.

59
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,400
如果我沒所作為
If I hadn't done anything,

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,680
現在就是你在受難了
it would be you in the house of pain.

61
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,500
你應該感謝我
You should thank me.

62
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,660
也許吧
Perhaps.

63
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,470
但這由不得你做主
But it was not up to you.

64
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,740
*擂我戰鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

65
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,920
*鼓鳴震天*
*Witch drums*

66
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,420
*擂我戰鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

67
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,750
*擂我戰鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

68
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,900
*鼓鳴震天*
*The witch drums*

69
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,370
*寧入地獄*
*Better pray for hell*

70
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:09,450
*不留人間*
*Not hallelujah*

71
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,550
找到你了
There you are.

72
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,470
我認識緹圖芭甚至比你更久
I have known Tituba even longer than you have,

73
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,400
那時候她還是個孩子
ever since she was a small child.

74
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,540
她這一生經歷了很多
With all that she has endured in her life,

75
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,810
如果說誰最可靠  那肯定是她
if there is anyone who can hold out, it is she.

76
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,590
如果
"If."

77
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,710
小小的一個詞兒
Such a small word

78
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,060
卻要承擔我們所有人都無法承受的后果
with such immense consequence for all of us.

79
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,890
你必須信任她
You must trust her.

80
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,960
她會利用好機會的
She will use the opportunity.

81
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,770
機會
Opportunity?

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,510
折磨也算機會嗎
You call torture an opportunity?

83
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,180
我說的機會  是把英克里斯的注意力
The opportunity to divert Increase's attention

84
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,980
向我們所希望的方向轉移
to where we want it and away from where we do not.

85
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,140
我不在乎
I don't care.

86
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,570
我接受不了
I can't bear it,

87
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,910
一想到他會怎么折磨她
the thought of what he might do to her.

88
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,210
我不會坐視不理的
I won't stand for it.

89
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,450
你覺得怎么樣
Do you like it?

90
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,940
"苦痛出真言"
"Truth through pain."

91
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,320
我覺得還挺合適的
I find it a fitting,

92
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,800
算是對塞勒姆的好人們最委婉的示意吧
almost poetic demonstration to the good people of Salem

93
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,310
這正是他們目前最需要做的
as to what is now expected of them. Hmm?

94
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,450
你想想  把這個
Imagine transforming 

95
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,940
尋花問柳的地方  
this house of woebegone pleasure

96
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,070
變成一間懺悔室
into a place of repentance.

97
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,030
我聽說他們已經給它起名叫苦難屋了
I understand already they call it my house of pain.

98
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,790
你同意了嗎
And you approve?

99
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,420
是的  是的  我同意
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed, I do.

100
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,250
讓人們打心眼兒里記住這些苦痛
Oh, keeping the pains of hell foremost in one's mind

101
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,190
是最可靠...  不  不
is the surest... nay, nay, the...

102
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,010
是唯一能防止他們虛度年華的辦法
the only road to prevent spending eternity there.

103
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,500
今天有什么我能幫你的嗎
And how may I help you this fine day?

104
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,220
你關了一個我的人在這兒
You keep someone here that belongs to me.

105
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,020
我有充分的理由相信
Well, I have very good reason to believe

106
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,100
她屬于惡魔
that she belongs to the devil himself.

107
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,180
胡說
Nonsense.

108
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,440
我從小就認識她了
I've known her since we were girls.

109
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,080
老實說  她不只是我的仆人
Truth be told, she is not just my servant.

110
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,590
她也是我的朋友
She is also my friend.

111
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,790
我在想
Well, I wonder, then,

112
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,470
也許正因為跟自己的女主人成為朋友
becoming befriended by...by one's mistress

113
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,730
才讓她誤入歧途的
is perhaps the reason that she went astray.

114
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,410
也許...
Perhaps...

115
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,910
也許不是她
Perhaps it is not she,

116
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,090
而是你  來這里會更加受益匪淺
but... but you who could most benefit from being here.

117
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,820
你好像忘記是在跟誰說話了  父親
I think you forget to whom you are speaking, Father.

118
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,120
柯頓都能起床走動了啊  很好
Cotton up and about. Good.

119
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,470
不不  我知道這是瑪麗·西布里
No, no. I know this is Mary Sibley,

120
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,500
我的朋友喬治的妻子
wife of my friend George,

121
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,560
就是在她的悉心照料下
under whose under tender care

122
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,600
喬治莫名其妙地形同枯槁了
he has mysteriously withered into an invalid.

123
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,140
您這話什么意思  先生
I resent your implications, sir.

124
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,650
我沒什么意思  只是直說而已
I imply nothing. No, I say outright.

125
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,860
往好了說  你只是個軟弱不負責任的女人
At best, I find you to be a weak and irresponsible woman.

126
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,580
往壞處想的話...
And at worst... well, 

127
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,330
我們還是不要往壞處想了吧
let us not even consider the worst.

128
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,840
不不  我該對喬治
No, no. I shall take responsibility 

129
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,820
還有那個奴隸  緹圖芭負責
for George and for the slave, 

130
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,800
至少目前如此
Tituba, for the time being.

131
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,870
與此同時  我建議你回家
Meantime, I suggest you get you home

132
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,780
回到西布里先生的七角尖閣里去吧
to Mr. Sibley's House of Seven Gables.

133
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,780
{\an8}小說《七個尖角閣的老宅》
描寫了一個家族前人作孽后人遭殃的故事 

134
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,640
柯頓  我們去辦事
Cotton, to business.

135
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,190
撕舌器
Tongue tearer.

136
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,090
這個是用來
This is for

137
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,460
讓我們審訊的人開口講出真話的
snipping the lies from the mouths of those we question.

138
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,720
碎骨器
Skull crusher.

139
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,850
夾乳鉗
Breast ripper.

140
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,990
這些東西
Both of these are,

141
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,730
都簡單粗暴  名如其物
well, quite aptly, if somewhat crudely, named.

142
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,700
父親  我曾經把一個無辜的人逼死
Father, I once pressed an innocent man to death.

143
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,840
肯定有更好的方法
There must be a better way.

144
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,890
父親  你得知道  囚犯為了
Father, you must know, a tortured prisoner

145
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,900
免受折磨  肯定會承認任何事的
will confess to anything to stop the pain...

146
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,060
任何事  不論真假
Anything... true or not!

147
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,440
對  確實如此
Yes, that is surely so.

148
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,450
但是如果你以為我會笨到
But you...you grossly mistake my faculties

149
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,280
相信一個剛被拷打之人
if you think me fool enough to accept as truth

150
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,040
因為痛苦而說出的一切
the first pained pourings that invariably come

151
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,110
那就太低估我的刑具了
from the tormented lips.

152
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,090
但是  真相顯而易見...
But, sir, it is a self-evident truth...

153
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,860
沒有真相是顯而易見的
I take no truth to be self-evident,

154
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,360
可能今天這里發生的
save perhaps that whatever acts of horror 

155
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,140
一切恐怖行為
take place here today

156
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,310
都是我不在期間你的松懈倦怠造成的
are due entirely to your laxity during my absence.

157
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,200
不要讓他誤導你
Do not let him mislead you,

158
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,960
不要妄想
and abandon all hope

159
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,030
他或者其他任何人來救你
of your deliverance by him or by any other agent.

160
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,210
現在你需要做的
Now, what you must do

161
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,230
就是思考...
is meditate...

162
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,690
你眼前的這些工具
on these instruments which you see before you.

163
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,960
你必須一心一意
You must set your mind

164
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,790
去追求那些
firmly in pursuit of the goals

165
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,410
你必須實現的目標
which you must achieve,

166
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,450
也就是你的生存和你的救贖
that of your survival and your salvation.

167
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,200
異端尖叉
The heretic's fork.

168
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,010
好
Yes.

169
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,270
讓你時刻集中注意  保持警覺
To keep you attentive and alert during the process.

170
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,140
還有這個...
And this...

171
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,310
你肯定知道是什么吧
Well, this you surely recognize --

172
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,580
這是拇指夾
Thumbscrews.

173
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,980
我覺得這是最簡單
I believe these to be the simplest,

174
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,380
最高效的刑訊工具了
and yet the most effective method of revealing the truth.

175
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,690
我們開始
And so let us begin.

176
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,570
你使用宗教法庭的
You employ the very tools of oppression

177
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,410
鎮壓工具...
perfected by the inquisition...

178
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,500
那些稱我們為異教徒的人
...tools used against good puritans

179
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,680
用來對付善良清教徒的工具
by those who would call us heretics.

180
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,420
這叫以毒攻毒  孩子
Fire with fire, my boy.

181
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,510
她人呢  安去哪里了
Where is she? Where is Anne?

182
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,500
你的傻瓜女兒
Your foolish daughter

183
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,410
做了件非常危險的事
has done something exceedingly dangerous.

184
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,360
她戴了我的面具
She put my mask on.

185
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,120
那快點把她帶回來啊
Well, bring her home this instant.

186
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,720
我做不到
I cannot.

187
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,080
每次只能有一個人用
Only one traveler may use it at a time,

188
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,760
鑒于她沒有經驗
and as she has no experience,

189
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,440
所以肯定不知道怎么才能利用面具回來
she will have no idea how to use it in order to get back.

190
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,630
現在這個面具只會成為對付我的證據
The only possible use for it now is as evidence against me.

191
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,680
可她去哪里了
But where has she gone?

192
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,730
去樹林了
To the woods.

193
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,090
我會找到她的
I shall find her.

194
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,790
你有勇氣去面對印第安人
You, man enough to face Indians...

195
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,000
面對野狼  面對你假裝能控制的魔鬼嗎
and wolves or the devils you pretend to command?

196
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,400
我也別無他法
There is no alternative.

197
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,360
那就想個辦法
Find one,

198
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,230
我發誓...
for I swear by...

199
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,810
以你敬若神明的那個東西發誓
by whatever it is you hold holy,

200
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,550
如果今晚我們的女兒沒在自己床上安睡
if our daughter is not asleep in her own bed this very night,

201
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,400
我一定會到處去說  直到你
my tongue will wag until you are tied to a stake

202
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,890
被綁上絞刑架為止
in the middle of the commons.

203
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,250
注意點  妻子
Take care, wife.

204
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,180
你這樣只會害了自己
You shall only implicate yourself.

205
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,900
那我們就玉石俱焚吧
Then we will taste each other's ashes.

206
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,360
這是夢  只是個白日夢而已
This is a dream... nothing but a waking dream.

207
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,570
那個面具
The mask.

208
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,070
父親的研究
My father's study.

209
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,610
這片樹林
These woods.

210
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,420
只是個夢罷了
It's all but a dream.

211
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,920
此時此刻  我正躺在臥室的床上
At this moment, I lie upon my bed in my room...

212
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,570
就在家里
at home.

213
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,500
快醒醒
Wake up!

214
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,020
醒醒
Wake up!

215
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,810
我怎么來的不重要
It doesn't matter how I got here.

216
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,770
我得回到塞勒姆
I must get back to Salem.

217
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,370
東邊
East.

218
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,720
這邊走
This way.

219
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,850
你怎么知道她在樹林里
What makes you think she's in the woods?

220
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,040
我了解自己的女兒
I-I know my daughter,

221
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,520
了解她的想法  也知道她有時根本不加思考
how she thinks and how at times she doesn't.

222
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,250
我知道你覺得我作為塞勒姆
I-I know you feel that I have somehow failed

223
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,860
秉持天賦人權的治安官
in my duties as... as magistrate

224
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,350
多少有些失職
to uphold the natural rights here in Salem

225
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,160
也明白你對我那些陰暗的揣測
And that you hold whatever dark suspicions you do about me.

226
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,770
但我不是為了自己
But I ask not for myself.

227
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,860
是為了安
For Anne.

228
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,050
走吧
Let's go.

229
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,660
謝謝你
Thank you.

230
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,810
等發現她還活著再謝我吧
You can thank me if we find her...alive.

231
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,790
自地獄中拯救吾等吧  天父
Save us from hell, Father?!

232
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,010
你現在所做的
Is that what you're doing 

233
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,360
是在拯救吾等于地獄嗎
saving us from hell?

234
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,220
已經太晚了
Well, too late.

235
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,540
塞勒姆就是地獄  我則身在其中
Salem is hell, and I am not out of it.

236
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,060
我是你創造之物
I am the creature you have made.

237
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,170
我無法成為你希望的樣子
I cannot be who you will me to be,

238
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,100
但我又沒有其他的志向
yet I lack the will to be anything else.

239
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,270
像是畸嬰出世
Like that monstrous birth,

240
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,630
我還不如不出生的好
it were better had I never been born.

241
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,920
但我無法打破時間的沙漏
Though I cannot draw back the sands of time,

242
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,560
無法停止時間流逝
I can break the hourglass.

243
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,440
再見了  天父
Goodbye, Father.

244
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,510
我會在地獄安家  等待與你相見
I will make my home in hell and await you there.

245
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,940
太軟弱了
Weak.

246
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,920
我連這微弱的燭光都無法熄滅
Too weak even to snuff this feeble candle.

247
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,520
你很厲害
Well, you're wonderful.

248
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,820
頗有本事
Quite remarkable.

249
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,630
你列出了村里起碼半數人的名字
You've named at least half the people in the village.

250
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,320
當然了  他們都不是巫師
Of course, none of them are witches.

251
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,880
你如此迫切地供出他們  恰恰證明了這一點
The fact that you offer them up so eagerly attests to that.

252
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,230
但你已經進步不少了
But you made great progress.

253
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,750
我們就要撥開謊言的迷霧了
We are working our way through the lies.

254
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,650
要不了多久  那一刻就會到來
Very soon, we will come to that precise moment

255
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,460
當痛苦難以承受
when the agony will be so unendurable

256
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,370
即使謊言之王
that even a-a loyal servant

257
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,300
最忠實的仆人  也將背棄謊言
of the prince of lies can lie no longer.

258
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,370
這個工具
This tool...

259
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,320
它叫做澀梨子
it is called the choke pear,

260
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,410
我也聽說過叫"痛苦之梨"
Although I have heard it called the pear of anguish.

261
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:55,770
它能伸進黑暗的穴洞之中
It is inserted into the darker cavities and then...

262
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,060
然后張開
...opened up,

263
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,770
洞中的東西
with the expectation

264
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,820
也會被撐開
that the subject, too, will open up.

265
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,730
現在  給我真正的名字
Now, tell me the real names.

266
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,620
在塞勒姆天上的父啊  你徒有其名
My father, who art in Salem, hollow be thy name.

267
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,870
你的國已毀
Thy kingdom's done,

268
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,810
你的旨意行在地上
Your will I shun,

269
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,030
已遭背離
on Earth...

270
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,770
如同行在你那天堂鑄就的地獄之中
As in the hell you'd make of heaven.

271
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,060
魔鬼要來帶我走了
The devil himself come to take me.

272
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,330
帶我走吧  魔鬼
Take me, devil.

273
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,340
我本該將生命的每一刻當做最后一刻
I should have lived every hour on Earth as if it were my last.

274
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,440
現在就是最后一刻了
And now it is.

275
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,200
置之死地而后生
Out of death comes life.

276
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,950
我明白了  主  這才是你的本意
I see now, Lord, that is your true face.

277
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,820
你不會理解我做了什么
You cannot know what I have done

278
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,660
又侍奉了誰
or who I have served

279
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,940
除非你先知道原因
until you know why.

280
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,820
那么
So...

281
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,680
就告訴我
then tell me.

282
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,730
為什么
Why?

283
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,120
為了正義
For justice.

284
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,600
我不是巫師
I am not a witch.

285
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,960
也不是清教徒
I am not a puritan.

286
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,900
我是阿拉瓦克部落人
I am of the Arawak tribe...

287
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,340
或者曾經是
or I once was.

288
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,210
但當我閉上雙眼
But I close my eyes,

289
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:06,650
我仍能看見那些翠綠的灌叢
And I can still see the green of my jungle

290
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,040
以及英國佬那些慘白的面孔
and the deadly white of the Englishmen's faces.

291
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,510
我以前從沒見過那種膚色
I had never seen skin like that,

292
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,840
如此蒼白  他們向我們走來時
so white when we see them walking towards us,

293
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,980
我們以為那是幽靈
We think they are ghosts.

294
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,230
奴隸
Slavers.

295
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,620
他們屠殺了我們大多數的男人
They slaughtered many of our men,

296
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,140
用鐵鏈銬住剩下的
chained the rest, 

297
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,510
然后對女人縱享其歡
and have their way with the women.

298
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,930
我還太小  對他們毫無用處
I am too young to be of use to them,

299
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,590
但媽媽和姐姐們就不同了
but my mother and sisters are not.

300
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,930
他們還強迫我去看
and they forced me to watch.

301
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,540
之后  掛著鐐銬的我回頭望去
Later, in chains, I look back,

302
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,510
他們將村里的棚屋付之一炬
and they're burning the huts of my village,

303
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,750
我看到樹林之外
And I see two red eyes staring back at me, 

304
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,100
有兩只血紅的眼睛盯著我
out of the trees.

305
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,560
接著它們開口對我說
And the red eyes speak to me,

306
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,870
"緹圖芭  你是我的"
"Tituba, you are mine."

307
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:56,000
撒旦對我們說話時  總會用我們的母語
Satan speaks to each of us in our own native tongue.

308
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,110
現在  還要繼續嗎
And now shall we continue?

309
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,080
這里不久前有人來過
Someone came through here quite recently...

310
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,270
某些迷失了方向的人
Someone who didn't know where they were going...

311
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,850
并且徹底不見了  就像...
And moved radically, as if lost or...

312
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,030
柯頓  你搞什么鬼
Cotton! What in the hell?

313
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,970
不是鬼  小約翰
Oh, not hell, Johnny,

314
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,070
也不是神
Nor heaven.

315
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:35,740
是大地
Just earth...

316
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,520
光輝無比的大地
Glorious, glorious earth.

317
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,370
恐怕牧師已經神志不清了
I fear the reverend has gone mad.

318
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,640
柯頓  趕緊給我滾下來
Cotton, get your drunk ass down here.

319
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,630
不  我就不
No, sir, I will not.

320
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,750
我在這兒站得高看得遠
I can see far more clearly from here.

321
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,270
不光看得遠  什么都看得見
In fact, I can see everything.

322
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,780
我看到上帝正親身走過這片樹林
God himself walks among these woods,

323
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,840
身后流動著五彩祥云
Trailing clouds of animal glory.

324
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,160
你到底怎么了
What happened to you?

325
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,070
我把靴子拖了
I took my boots off.

326
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,050
然后呢
Yeah, so?

327
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,430
然后我就感覺到了大地
So, I felt the earth!

328
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,410
在我赤裸的雙腳下
I felt the raw, 

329
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,400
我感覺到了這原始的  神圣的土地
sacred earth beneath my naked feet.

330
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,240
我感覺到了大地的呼吸
I felt the earth breathe.

331
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,590
趕緊回家
Go home.

332
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,940
要是你那強大的感知力是真的
If your great insight is real,

333
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,550
那回你屋里也一樣能繼續感知
It will be just as real in your chambers

334
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,040
而且安全得多
And a whole lot safer.

335
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,960
森林的空氣
The forest air and this...

336
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,310
和這挺拔的大樹  現在是我的老師了
Sturdy tree are my teachers now.

337
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,870
咱們沒時間跟他耗著了
We haven't time for this.

338
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,760
我還有很多要學的呢
I still have much to learn!

339
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:44,180
你到底什么時候把靈魂出賣給魔鬼的
When exactly did you sell your soul to the devil?

340
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,140
我的身體已經被買賣過很多次了
My body was bought and sold many times,

341
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,120
但我從未出賣過靈魂
But never my soul,

342
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,310
直到我來了塞勒姆
Not until I came to salem.

343
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,370
年幼的我被關在籠子里
I am a child in a cage,

344
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,170
在船上得到的食物比畜生還少
Given less to eat than the animals on the ship.

345
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,540
我很怕自己再也無法重見天日了
I fear I will never see the sun again.

346
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,670
然后  來了一個男人
And then a man comes.

347
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,310
就是他把我帶到了塞勒姆
It was he that brought me to Salem,

348
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,960
他買我只是為了再把我賣出去
Only to be bought and sold again.

349
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,150
我被一次又一次轉賣
I am sold from hand to hand, from man to man.

350
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,360
但起碼我不用再待在籠子里了
But at least I am no longer in a cage.

351
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,680
而且最后買下我的還是個好人家
And my final owner is not cruel.

352
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,540
沃科特家給了我一張可以睡覺的床
The Wolcotts give me a bed to sleep in.

353
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,760
他們家的女兒  瑪麗  待我親如姐妹
Their girl child, Mary, treats me almost like a sister.

354
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:33,270
但每到夜晚  我仍會為了母親而哭泣
But still at night, I weep for my mother,

355
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,770
我哭著從自己的草榻上跑出去
And I ride a river of tears out of my straw bed,

356
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,070
跑進了黑森林
Into the dark woods.

357
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,910
黑森林
The dark woods?

358
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,800
你去黑森林見誰
Who do you meet in the dark woods?

359
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,930
卡耐馬惡鬼
The kenaima.

360
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:59,260
他是來救我的  來救我們所有人
He has come to save me... save all of us.

361
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,100
他召喚所有受傷的人們
He draws to him all who hurt,

362
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,350
所有在躲藏的人們
All who hide,

363
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,180
所有心懷仇恨的人們
All who hate,

364
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,720
所有渴望正義的人們
All who thirst for justice,

365
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,730
他將我們召集成一圈
Gathers us into the circle 

366
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,030
許諾給我們一個領袖
and promises us a leader,

367
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,350
一個救世主
A savior,

368
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,350
一個將用神力擊潰敵人的人
One who will crush our enemies with a mighty fist.

369
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,360
他是個信守承諾的人
And he keeps his promise.

370
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,470
姑娘
Girl, 

371
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,290
我也是個信守承諾的人
I, too, keep my promises.

372
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,510
我現在許諾你
And I promise you now

373
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:40,690
如果你不告訴我那圈子里還有誰
I will put your eyes out this instant

374
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,200
我就立馬把你的眼珠子挖出來
If you do not tell me who is in the circle,

375
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,750
都有誰  說名字
Who, the names,

376
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,470
巫師的圈子里還有誰
Who is in the circle of witches.

377
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,490
告訴我
Tell me.

378
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,010
真是堅強啊
What fortitude.

379
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,110
因無情的壓迫而團結一致
Solidarity amongst the rudely oppressed.

380
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,280
相互鼓舞
Inspiring.It's... 

381
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,570
真是太感人了
it's all so very touching.

382
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,820
但我要告訴你  你上當了
But I tell you, you're duped.

383
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,870
這些東西可不是你的朋友
These creatures are not your friends,

384
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,810
他們不是任何人的朋友
Nor anyone's friends.

385
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,990
他們是所有人類的敵人
They are the enemies of all mankind.

386
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,230
告訴我  到底是誰挑起了
Tell me, who started this war

387
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,790
這場巫師和清教徒的戰爭
Between witches and puritans,

388
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,570
是四處分散的他們  還是人多勢眾的你們
The scattered few of them or the mighty many of you?

389
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,350
就按你說的來理解
By your own admission,

390
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,500
這些東西為了復仇
These creatures have sold their very souls

391
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,720
將靈魂出賣給了魔鬼
For vengeance to the devil.

392
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,950
不是嗎
Is this not so?

393
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,490
你們的人就沒當過奴隸嗎
Were your people never slaves?

394
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,670
他們從未在荒野中哭喊著尋求正義嗎
Did they never cry out in the wilderness for justice?

395
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,370
你們的上帝聽到他們的哭喊
And did your god not hear their cries 

396
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,980
難道不是報以雷擊嗎
and answer with thunder?

397
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,790
你還不明白嗎
Don't you see?

398
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,400
根本沒有巫師
There are no witches,

399
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,130
只有像我這樣的可憐人
Only poor people like me,

400
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,270
被圍追堵截
hunted and harried,

401
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,920
折磨滅口
tortured and murdered,

402
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,750
沒什么別的理由 只因為他們不是你
and for no reason other than they are not you!

403
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,770
她來過這兒
She was here. 

404
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,180
我又找到她的痕跡了
I've got her track again.

405
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,650
不管發生什么
No matter what happens,

406
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,910
保持冷靜別說話
just stay calm and say nothing.

407
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,330
[土人語]

408
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,160
[土人語]

409
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,110
[土人語]

410
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,810
[土人語]

411
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,360
[土人語]

412
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,230
[土人語]

413
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,470
[土人語]

414
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,640
你真是謎中之謎  上尉
You are a mystery within a mystery, captain.

415
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,750
像獵食者般在叢林游走
Walk the woods like a predator,

416
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,180
如同自己也是土人一樣和他們順暢交流
speak to savages as if you were one of them.

417
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,640
他們看見她了  但沒有動她
They saw her, but they did not touch her.

418
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,840
你相信他們嗎
And you believe them?

419
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,160
我信
I do.

420
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,450
他們用了一個詞來形容她
They used a word to describe her.

421
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,620
這詞有很多意思
It can mean a lot of different things,

422
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,620
不過一般它是指"瘋狂"
but it usually just means "Crazy."

423
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,560
有很多詞可以形容我女兒  上尉
My daughter is many things, captain,

424
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,390
但是瘋狂絕不是其中之一
but crazy is not one of them.

425
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,520
他們這么認為真是她走運
Well, lucky for her they thought she was.

426
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:54,090
他們覺得瘋子是我們稱之為圣人的人
They think crazy people are what we call holy...

427
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,210
世界與世界間的游走者
Walkers between worlds.

428
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,870
你能想到什么嗎
Make any sense to you?

429
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,470
你問我誰挑起的戰爭
You ask me who began this war.

430
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,400
作為一個
As one scarred

431
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,560
抗爭了40年的老兵
with 40 years soldiering in it,

432
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,970
我現在告訴你
I tell you now...

433
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,180
這根本不重要
It does not matter...

434
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,190
只有戰爭結束才重要
...only that it end.

435
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,070
戰爭會結束
And end it will.

436
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,400
你等族類希望渺茫
You and your kind have no hope.

437
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,620
你們會流血  會受傷
You will bleed, and you will hurt...

438
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,820
最后在絕望中死去
and you will die in a hopeless cause.

439
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,720
愛不會讓人絕望
Love is not a hopeless cause.

440
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,810
我是不會背叛我此生真愛的
I will not betray the one true love of my life.

441
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,750
我懂了
I understand.

442
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,470
我終于懂了
Finally I understand it all.

443
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,740
什么都懂了
I understand everything.

444
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,450
可憐的家伙
You poor thing.

445
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,110
就是個小女孩
Just a little girl,

446
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:32,090
被綁架  奴役  孤獨一人
kidnapped, enslaved, alone,

447
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,970
尋求世人的理解
seeking understanding,

448
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,480
和安慰
comfort...

449
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,110
尋求愛
seeking love.

450
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,460
你還不明白嗎
Do you not see?

451
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,040
我不懷疑你愛著
I do not doubt that you love.

452
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:54,580
但現在你和我單獨在這里  誠實點吧
But just for this one moment here alone with me, be honest,

453
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,490
不是對我  至少也對你自己
if not with me, at least with yourself.

454
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,510
你真的相信他們像你愛著他們
Do you really believe that they love you

455
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,520
那樣地愛你嗎
as much as you love them?

456
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,590
想想吧  女人
Think, woman.

457
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,620
想想他  那個人
Think of that, that person.

458
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,760
在腦海里描繪他們
Picture them in your mind.

459
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,070
你了解他們
You know them so well.

460
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,000
考慮一下他們是什么人
Consider who they are,

461
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:20,630
不是你希望他們是什么人  而是他們的真面目
not who you wish them to be, but who they really are,

462
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,880
捫心自問  要是躺在這兒的是他們
and ask yourself, were they here,

463
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:26,400
到底會不會供出你的名字
would they or would they not offer up your name

464
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,500
以求自保
to save themselves?

465
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,490
他們會瞬間背叛你來保全自身
They would betray you in an instant to save themselves,

466
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,700
這就是你愛的人
and this is the person that you love

467
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,600
絕不會像你愛他那樣地愛你
and who will never love you the same way.

468
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:44,710
真的值得嗎  你忍受的恐懼
Is it worth it all, the horrors you have endured,

469
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,930
和煎熬
and the agonies...

470
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:58,760
還有你面前那無比丑陋的死亡
...and the ugly, ugly death you have in front of you?

471
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,950
這是你真心想要的嗎
Is that really what you want,

472
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:06,140
在你已經對自己敞開心扉
now that you have now admitted to yourself

473
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,170
看清了他們的真面目之后
who they really are?

474
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,290
緹圖芭
Tituba...

475
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:17,210
你知道世間最大的歡愉是什么嗎
Do you know the greatest pleasure in the world?

476
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:22,410
就是當痛苦停止的時刻
It is when the pain stops.

477
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,190
痛苦會停止的
And stop it will.

478
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,050
你只要告訴我一個名字
You have but to tell me a name.

479
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,720
輕輕說出來就好
Just whisper it.

480
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,760
告訴我誰是塞勒姆
Tell me who is the leader

481
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,640
巫師中的領頭人
of the witches in Salem.

482
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,450
我發誓  你要找的人...
On my soul, the one you seek...

483
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,700
還能更糟嗎
It could be worse.

484
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,760
竟然下雨了
It could be raining.

485
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,320
你終于找到回家的路了
At last, you found your way home.

486
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:34,880
安
Anne!

487
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,470
沒事了
It's all right.

488
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:48,970
我以為我失去你了
I thought I'd lost you.

489
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,650
我也是
Me too.

490
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,010
怎么找到的
How?

491
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,290
怎么找到的
How?

492
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,060
你們怎么找到我的
How did you find me?

493
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,140
多謝奧登上尉吧
Give all credit to captain Alden

494
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:12,160
他在叢林里那些不可思議的技巧
and his preternatural skills in these woods.

495
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,110
只要找到這里  追蹤足跡就很簡單了
Following the tracks was easy once I found my way out here.

496
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,870
但我不明白你是怎么離開塞勒姆這么遠的
But what I can't figure is how you got so far out of Salem

497
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,580
中間的路途幾乎無跡可尋
Leaving so few tracks and traces between here and there.

498
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,130
我傻傻的  還鬧著脾氣
I am a silly thing, and in a fit of petulance,

499
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:45,000
我跑進了林子
I-I ran into these woods

500
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,690
根本沒思考要去哪  或是天有多晚
without thinking where I was going or how late it was...

501
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,300
等反應過來已經太遲了
Until it was too late.

502
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,060
離開塞勒姆沒留下任何蹤跡
Without leaving any tracks out of Salem.

503
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,230
在我徘徊的時候
It... it rained briefly while I was...

504
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,810
下了會雨
wandering.

505
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,290
也許洗刷掉了我的蹤跡
Perhaps that washed away my tracks,

506
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,970
或者是你沒找到
or perhaps you just didn't find them.

507
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,230
不管怎樣
In either case...

508
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,020
請原諒我
please forgive me

509
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,300
帶給你們兩位的麻煩
for the trouble I've put you both through.

510
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,370
謝謝你
Thank you.

511
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,530
我相信如果我有需要
Well, I'm sure you'd do the same thing for me

512
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,740
你也會
if I ever needed...

513
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,440
救我的
Rescuing.

514
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,300
你說得沒錯
You were correct.

515
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,280
她的確是位非凡的女子
She's a remarkable young woman.

516
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:05,660
我可以明白她為什么不僅僅
I can understand why she's not merely your...

517
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:09,590
是你的仆人  還是你的朋友
your servant, but your friend, as well.

518
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:12,110
我發現了一些非常了不起的事
I've discovered something quite extraordinary.

519
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:14,680
我發現了很多愛
I find so much love.

520
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,560
愛
Love?

521
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,180
令我不解的是
What I did not understand

522
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,600
塞勒姆的巫師統領
was that the chief witch of Salem

523
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,570
不僅僅是她的領袖
is not merely her leader...

524
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,960
也是她的愛人
but her lover.

525
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,120
她招供了嗎
She confessed?

526
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:29,540
愛是一枚雙面硬幣  不是嗎
Love is a-a two-faced coin, is it not?

527
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,120
有一面必定代表背叛
And one face is surely betrayal.

528
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:36,770
你介意嗎
Do you mind?

529
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:37,860
什么
What?

530
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,800
請便
Oh. Yes, please.

531
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,600
我不常放縱  但是
I rarely indulge, but...

532
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,380
我感覺需要恢復點元氣
I feel the need of a restorative.

533
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,150
喬治啊  喬治
Oh, George George.

534
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,620
他總是能做出殖民地里最好的酒窖
He's always cultivated the finest cellar in the colony,

535
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,090
我剛說什么來的
What was I saying?

536
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:03,910
愛
Love.

537
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,770
對
Yes.

538
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,260
你知道嗎
You know...

539
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:12,640
雖然事實如此  但沒有人會承認
It is true that, and no one will admit, 

540
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,770
愛情并不平等
that love is never equal.

541
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:18,030
而它的不平等
And in its inequality 

542
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,250
成就了它的脆弱
lies its fragility,

543
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,700
被愛的更少的那一方
for the one who is loved less

544
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,630
總有一天會覺得愛情如煙
will one day find love tastes like ashes.

545
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:31,070
這也是緹圖芭小姐現在的心情
That is indeed what poor Miss Tituba found.

546
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:34,840
不過她倒是跟我說了一切
But she did tell me everything,

547
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,950
她先跟我說了梅西·路易絲
And she started with Mercy Lewis.

548
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,880
梅西
Mercy?

549
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:43,310
梅西·路易絲也許一開始是
Mercy Lewis may well have begun

550
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,980
邪惡的受害者  但是她
as a victim of malice, but she...

551
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:51,430
她被攻擊她的野獸變成了女巫
she was made witch by the very beast that assailed her.

552
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,140
她不在這
She's not here.

553
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,060
她下午出去了
Uh, she went out this afternoon.

554
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,470
她還沒回來
She's not returned.

555
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,400
那并不是很重要
Well, it is no great matter.

556
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,530
反正  她還能跑到哪去
After all, where can she run to?

557
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,430
我會在太陽升起前
I will have her and her girls

558
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,600
抓住她和她的那些女孩們
by the time the sun comes up.

559
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,080
我剛回到薩勒姆的時候
When I first returned to Salem,

560
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,530
我曾非常堅信撒旦的同伴
I was convinced that satan's true partner

561
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:32,080
就在我的眼前
was right in front of me

562
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:35,570
而我需要做的就是伸出手抓住她
and all I need do is reach out my hand to take her.

563
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:40,810
你可以想象當我知道約翰·奧登上尉
You can imagine my shock to discover that Captain John Alden

564
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,620
是薩勒姆恐怖事件的幕后黑手時有多驚訝
stands behind all of Salem's horror.

565
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:55,010
我恐怕  需要呼吸點新鮮空氣
I fear I...need a breath of air.

566
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,560
能和我出去走走嗎  瑪麗·西布里
Will you walk with me, Mary Sibley,

567
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:01,870
在夜晚的清爽中
In the evening air...

568
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:07,610
也許我們能找到一個好地方
where we may have a good vantage point

569
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,960
觀看一場逮捕
from which to witness an arrest?

570
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:18,260
我想回去看看柯頓怎么樣了
I'm tempted to go back, see if Cotton's all right.

571
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:20,260
他可能會在森林里迷路
He could get lost in those woods

572
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,520
然后在熊的肚子里醒來
and wake up inside the belly of a bear.

573
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,270
他在那
There he is!

574
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,100
約翰·奧登
John Alden...

575
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,620
奉英克里斯·麥哲之命
...by order of Increase Mather

576
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,850
以塞勒姆行政委員之名
and in the name of the selectmen of Salem,

577
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,540
我宣布逮捕你
I place you under arrest.

578
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,280
這次又是因為什么
What for this time?

579
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,390
公開說臟話嗎
Swearing in public?

580
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,550
巫術
Witchcraft.

581
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:13,990
解除他的武裝  拷上他
Disarm him, shackle him.

582
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:16,090
不
No!

583
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,750
不  父親  阻止他們
No! Father, stop them!

584
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,680
父親  求你了
Father, please!

585
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,420
求你了  你有能力  你可以做些什么
Please! You have the power to do something!

586
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,750
等著
Wait.

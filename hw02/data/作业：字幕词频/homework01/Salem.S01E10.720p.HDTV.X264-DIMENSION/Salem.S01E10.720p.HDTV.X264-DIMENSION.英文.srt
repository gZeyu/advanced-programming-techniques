15
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,770
Previously on "Salem"...

16
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:03,440
Father?

17
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,250
Take her to the cage.

18
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,850
Cotton! Cotton!

19
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,350
Hello, father.

20
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,900
You'll be sold still, if the whores will have you.

21
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,120
I'm not going anywhere.

22
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,470
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,300
Take her as far as your steeds will travel.

24
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,190
Tell us, Mercy. Tell us what you saw.

25
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,950
She held a spider to her neck.

26
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,260
She seemed to feed it.

27
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,300
You.

28
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,950
I hereby arrest you...

29
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,420
on the charge of witchcraft.

30
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,800
Guards.

31
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,320
Your wrath burns like fire.

32
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,240
You look upon me as worthy of nothing.

33
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,390
You are of purer eyes

34
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,100
than to bear to have me in your sight.

35
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,880
I am 10,000 times more abominable in your eyes

36
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,670
than the most hateful, venomous serpent is in mine.

37
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,330
My wickedness makes me as heavy as lead,

38
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,650
and if you should let me go, Lord,

39
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,670
I will plunge into the bottomless pit,

40
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,360
and all my righteousness would have no more influence

41
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,190
to uphold me and keep me out of hell

42
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,950
than a spider's web would have to stop a falling rock.

43
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,620
Any last words for your father?

44
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,380
May the devil be as kind and considerate to you

45
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,700
as you were to me.

46
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,900
I miss Mercy.

47
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,330
Our Mercy is always with us.

48
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,720
Perhaps that's one of her servants now,

49
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,340
watching over us and weaving its web of destiny.

50
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,370
Mercy...

51
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,250
Mercy...

52
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,380
You cannot hide from me in my own house.

53
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,550
Why did you do it?

54
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,310
How could you?

55
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,900
Come out from there at once.

56
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,340
I did it for you.

57
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,130
For me?

58
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,110
He was coming for you.

59
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,400
If I hadn't done anything,

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,680
it would be you in the house of pain.

61
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,500
You should thank me.

62
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,660
Perhaps.

63
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,470
But it was not up to you.

64
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,740
*Pound me the witch drums*

65
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,920
*Witch drums*

66
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,420
*Pound me the witch drums*

67
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,750
*Pound me the witch drums*

68
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,900
*The witch drums*

69
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,370
*Better pray for hell*

70
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:09,450
*Not hallelujah*

71
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,550
There you are.

72
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,470
I have known Tituba even longer than you have,

73
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,400
ever since she was a small child.

74
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,540
With all that she has endured in her life,

75
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,810
if there is anyone who can hold out, it is she.

76
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,590
"If."

77
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,710
Such a small word

78
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,060
with such immense consequence for all of us.

79
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,890
You must trust her.

80
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,960
She will use the opportunity.

81
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,770
Opportunity?

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,510
You call torture an opportunity?

83
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,180
The opportunity to divert Increase's attention

84
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,980
to where we want it and away from where we do not.

85
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,140
I don't care.

86
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,570
I can't bear it,

87
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,910
the thought of what he might do to her.

88
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,210
I won't stand for it.

89
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,450
Do you like it?

90
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,940
"Truth through pain."

91
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,320
I find it a fitting,

92
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,800
almost poetic demonstration to the good people of Salem

93
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,310
as to what is now expected of them. Hmm?

94
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,450
Imagine transforming 

95
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,940
this house of woebegone pleasure

96
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,070
into a place of repentance.

97
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,030
I understand already they call it my house of pain.

98
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,790
And you approve?

99
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,420
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed, I do.

100
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,250
Oh, keeping the pains of hell foremost in one's mind

101
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,190
is the surest... nay, nay, the...

102
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,010
the only road to prevent spending eternity there.

103
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,500
And how may I help you this fine day?

104
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,220
You keep someone here that belongs to me.

105
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,020
Well, I have very good reason to believe

106
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,100
that she belongs to the devil himself.

107
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,180
Nonsense.

108
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,440
I've known her since we were girls.

109
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,080
Truth be told, she is not just my servant.

110
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,590
She is also my friend.

111
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,790
Well, I wonder, then,

112
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,470
becoming befriended by...by one's mistress

113
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,730
is perhaps the reason that she went astray.

114
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,410
Perhaps...

115
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,910
Perhaps it is not she,

116
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,090
but... but you who could most benefit from being here.

117
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,820
I think you forget to whom you are speaking, Father.

118
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,120
Cotton up and about. Good.

119
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,470
No, no. I know this is Mary Sibley,

120
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,500
wife of my friend George,

121
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,560
under whose under tender care

122
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,600
he has mysteriously withered into an invalid.

123
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,140
I resent your implications, sir.

124
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,650
I imply nothing. No, I say outright.

125
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,860
At best, I find you to be a weak and irresponsible woman.

126
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,580
And at worst... well, 

127
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,330
let us not even consider the worst.

128
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,840
No, no. I shall take responsibility 

129
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,820
for George and for the slave, 

130
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,800
Tituba, for the time being.

131
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,870
Meantime, I suggest you get you home

132
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,780
to Mr. Sibley's House of Seven Gables.

134
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,640
Cotton, to business.

135
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,190
Tongue tearer.

136
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,090
This is for

137
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,460
snipping the lies from the mouths of those we question.

138
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,720
Skull crusher.

139
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,850
Breast ripper.

140
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,990
Both of these are,

141
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,730
well, quite aptly, if somewhat crudely, named.

142
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,700
Father, I once pressed an innocent man to death.

143
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,840
There must be a better way.

144
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,890
Father, you must know, a tortured prisoner

145
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,900
will confess to anything to stop the pain...

146
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,060
Anything... true or not!

147
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,440
Yes, that is surely so.

148
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,450
But you...you grossly mistake my faculties

149
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,280
if you think me fool enough to accept as truth

150
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,040
the first pained pourings that invariably come

151
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,110
from the tormented lips.

152
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,090
But, sir, it is a self-evident truth...

153
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,860
I take no truth to be self-evident,

154
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,360
save perhaps that whatever acts of horror 

155
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,140
take place here today

156
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,310
are due entirely to your laxity during my absence.

157
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,200
Do not let him mislead you,

158
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,960
and abandon all hope

159
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,030
of your deliverance by him or by any other agent.

160
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,210
Now, what you must do

161
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,230
is meditate...

162
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,690
on these instruments which you see before you.

163
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,960
You must set your mind

164
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,790
firmly in pursuit of the goals

165
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,410
which you must achieve,

166
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,450
that of your survival and your salvation.

167
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,200
The heretic's fork.

168
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,010
Yes.

169
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,270
To keep you attentive and alert during the process.

170
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,140
And this...

171
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,310
Well, this you surely recognize --

172
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,580
Thumbscrews.

173
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,980
I believe these to be the simplest,

174
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,380
and yet the most effective method of revealing the truth.

175
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,690
And so let us begin.

176
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,570
You employ the very tools of oppression

177
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,410
perfected by the inquisition...

178
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,500
...tools used against good puritans

179
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,680
by those who would call us heretics.

180
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,420
Fire with fire, my boy.

181
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,510
Where is she? Where is Anne?

182
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,500
Your foolish daughter

183
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,410
has done something exceedingly dangerous.

184
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,360
She put my mask on.

185
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,120
Well, bring her home this instant.

186
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,720
I cannot.

187
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,080
Only one traveler may use it at a time,

188
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,760
and as she has no experience,

189
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,440
she will have no idea how to use it in order to get back.

190
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,630
The only possible use for it now is as evidence against me.

191
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,680
But where has she gone?

192
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,730
To the woods.

193
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,090
I shall find her.

194
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,790
You, man enough to face Indians...

195
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,000
and wolves or the devils you pretend to command?

196
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,400
There is no alternative.

197
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,360
Find one,

198
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,230
for I swear by...

199
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,810
by whatever it is you hold holy,

200
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,550
if our daughter is not asleep in her own bed this very night,

201
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,400
my tongue will wag until you are tied to a stake

202
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,890
in the middle of the commons.

203
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,250
Take care, wife.

204
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,180
You shall only implicate yourself.

205
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,900
Then we will taste each other's ashes.

206
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,360
This is a dream... nothing but a waking dream.

207
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,570
The mask.

208
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,070
My father's study.

209
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,610
These woods.

210
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,420
It's all but a dream.

211
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,920
At this moment, I lie upon my bed in my room...

212
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,570
at home.

213
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,500
Wake up!

214
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,020
Wake up!

215
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,810
It doesn't matter how I got here.

216
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,770
I must get back to Salem.

217
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,370
East.

218
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,720
This way.

219
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,850
What makes you think she's in the woods?

220
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,040
I-I know my daughter,

221
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,520
how she thinks and how at times she doesn't.

222
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,250
I-I know you feel that I have somehow failed

223
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,860
in my duties as... as magistrate

224
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,350
to uphold the natural rights here in Salem

225
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,160
And that you hold whatever dark suspicions you do about me.

226
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,770
But I ask not for myself.

227
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,860
For Anne.

228
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,050
Let's go.

229
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,660
Thank you.

230
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,810
You can thank me if we find her...alive.

231
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,790
Save us from hell, Father?!

232
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,010
Is that what you're doing 

233
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,360
saving us from hell?

234
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,220
Well, too late.

235
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,540
Salem is hell, and I am not out of it.

236
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,060
I am the creature you have made.

237
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,170
I cannot be who you will me to be,

238
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,100
yet I lack the will to be anything else.

239
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,270
Like that monstrous birth,

240
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,630
it were better had I never been born.

241
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,920
Though I cannot draw back the sands of time,

242
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,560
I can break the hourglass.

243
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,440
Goodbye, Father.

244
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,510
I will make my home in hell and await you there.

245
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,940
Weak.

246
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,920
Too weak even to snuff this feeble candle.

247
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,520
Well, you're wonderful.

248
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,820
Quite remarkable.

249
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,630
You've named at least half the people in the village.

250
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,320
Of course, none of them are witches.

251
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,880
The fact that you offer them up so eagerly attests to that.

252
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,230
But you made great progress.

253
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,750
We are working our way through the lies.

254
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,650
Very soon, we will come to that precise moment

255
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,460
when the agony will be so unendurable

256
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,370
that even a-a loyal servant

257
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,300
of the prince of lies can lie no longer.

258
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,370
This tool...

259
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,320
it is called the choke pear,

260
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,410
Although I have heard it called the pear of anguish.

261
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:55,770
It is inserted into the darker cavities and then...

262
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,060
...opened up,

263
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,770
with the expectation

264
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,820
that the subject, too, will open up.

265
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,730
Now, tell me the real names.

266
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,620
My father, who art in Salem, hollow be thy name.

267
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,870
Thy kingdom's done,

268
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,810
Your will I shun,

269
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,030
on Earth...

270
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,770
As in the hell you'd make of heaven.

271
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,060
The devil himself come to take me.

272
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,330
Take me, devil.

273
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,340
I should have lived every hour on Earth as if it were my last.

274
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,440
And now it is.

275
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,200
Out of death comes life.

276
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,950
I see now, Lord, that is your true face.

277
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,820
You cannot know what I have done

278
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,660
or who I have served

279
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,940
until you know why.

280
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,820
So...

281
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,680
then tell me.

282
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,730
Why?

283
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,120
For justice.

284
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,600
I am not a witch.

285
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,960
I am not a puritan.

286
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,900
I am of the Arawak tribe...

287
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,340
or I once was.

288
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,210
But I close my eyes,

289
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:06,650
And I can still see the green of my jungle

290
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,040
and the deadly white of the Englishmen's faces.

291
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,510
I had never seen skin like that,

292
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,840
so white when we see them walking towards us,

293
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,980
We think they are ghosts.

294
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,230
Slavers.

295
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,620
They slaughtered many of our men,

296
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,140
chained the rest, 

297
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,510
and have their way with the women.

298
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,930
I am too young to be of use to them,

299
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,590
but my mother and sisters are not.

300
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,930
and they forced me to watch.

301
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,540
Later, in chains, I look back,

302
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,510
and they're burning the huts of my village,

303
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,750
And I see two red eyes staring back at me, 

304
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,100
out of the trees.

305
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,560
And the red eyes speak to me,

306
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,870
"Tituba, you are mine."

307
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:56,000
Satan speaks to each of us in our own native tongue.

308
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,110
And now shall we continue?

309
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,080
Someone came through here quite recently...

310
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,270
Someone who didn't know where they were going...

311
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,850
And moved radically, as if lost or...

312
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,030
Cotton! What in the hell?

313
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,970
Oh, not hell, Johnny,

314
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,070
Nor heaven.

315
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:35,740
Just earth...

316
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,520
Glorious, glorious earth.

317
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,370
I fear the reverend has gone mad.

318
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,640
Cotton, get your drunk ass down here.

319
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,630
No, sir, I will not.

320
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,750
I can see far more clearly from here.

321
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,270
In fact, I can see everything.

322
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,780
God himself walks among these woods,

323
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,840
Trailing clouds of animal glory.

324
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,160
What happened to you?

325
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,070
I took my boots off.

326
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,050
Yeah, so?

327
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,430
So, I felt the earth!

328
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,410
I felt the raw, 

329
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,400
sacred earth beneath my naked feet.

330
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,240
I felt the earth breathe.

331
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,590
Go home.

332
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,940
If your great insight is real,

333
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,550
It will be just as real in your chambers

334
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,040
And a whole lot safer.

335
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,960
The forest air and this...

336
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,310
Sturdy tree are my teachers now.

337
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,870
We haven't time for this.

338
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,760
I still have much to learn!

339
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:44,180
When exactly did you sell your soul to the devil?

340
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,140
My body was bought and sold many times,

341
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,120
But never my soul,

342
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,310
Not until I came to salem.

343
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,370
I am a child in a cage,

344
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,170
Given less to eat than the animals on the ship.

345
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,540
I fear I will never see the sun again.

346
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,670
And then a man comes.

347
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,310
It was he that brought me to Salem,

348
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,960
Only to be bought and sold again.

349
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,150
I am sold from hand to hand, from man to man.

350
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,360
But at least I am no longer in a cage.

351
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,680
And my final owner is not cruel.

352
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,540
The Wolcotts give me a bed to sleep in.

353
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,760
Their girl child, Mary, treats me almost like a sister.

354
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:33,270
But still at night, I weep for my mother,

355
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,770
And I ride a river of tears out of my straw bed,

356
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,070
Into the dark woods.

357
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,910
The dark woods?

358
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,800
Who do you meet in the dark woods?

359
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,930
The kenaima.

360
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:59,260
He has come to save me... save all of us.

361
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,100
He draws to him all who hurt,

362
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,350
All who hide,

363
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,180
All who hate,

364
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,720
All who thirst for justice,

365
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,730
Gathers us into the circle 

366
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,030
and promises us a leader,

367
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,350
A savior,

368
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,350
One who will crush our enemies with a mighty fist.

369
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,360
And he keeps his promise.

370
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,470
Girl, 

371
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,290
I, too, keep my promises.

372
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,510
And I promise you now

373
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:40,690
I will put your eyes out this instant

374
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,200
If you do not tell me who is in the circle,

375
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,750
Who, the names,

376
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,470
Who is in the circle of witches.

377
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,490
Tell me.

378
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,010
What fortitude.

379
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,110
Solidarity amongst the rudely oppressed.

380
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,280
Inspiring.It's... 

381
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,570
it's all so very touching.

382
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,820
But I tell you, you're duped.

383
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,870
These creatures are not your friends,

384
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,810
Nor anyone's friends.

385
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,990
They are the enemies of all mankind.

386
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,230
Tell me, who started this war

387
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,790
Between witches and puritans,

388
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,570
The scattered few of them or the mighty many of you?

389
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,350
By your own admission,

390
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,500
These creatures have sold their very souls

391
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,720
For vengeance to the devil.

392
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,950
Is this not so?

393
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,490
Were your people never slaves?

394
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,670
Did they never cry out in the wilderness for justice?

395
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,370
And did your god not hear their cries 

396
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,980
and answer with thunder?

397
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,790
Don't you see?

398
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,400
There are no witches,

399
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,130
Only poor people like me,

400
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,270
hunted and harried,

401
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,920
tortured and murdered,

402
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,750
and for no reason other than they are not you!

403
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,770
She was here. 

404
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,180
I've got her track again.

405
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,650
No matter what happens,

406
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,910
just stay calm and say nothing.

414
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,640
You are a mystery within a mystery, captain.

415
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,750
Walk the woods like a predator,

416
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,180
speak to savages as if you were one of them.

417
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,640
They saw her, but they did not touch her.

418
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,840
And you believe them?

419
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,160
I do.

420
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,450
They used a word to describe her.

421
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,620
It can mean a lot of different things,

422
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,620
but it usually just means "Crazy."

423
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,560
My daughter is many things, captain,

424
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,390
but crazy is not one of them.

425
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,520
Well, lucky for her they thought she was.

426
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:54,090
They think crazy people are what we call holy...

427
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,210
Walkers between worlds.

428
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,870
Make any sense to you?

429
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,470
You ask me who began this war.

430
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,400
As one scarred

431
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,560
with 40 years soldiering in it,

432
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,970
I tell you now...

433
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,180
It does not matter...

434
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,190
...only that it end.

435
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,070
And end it will.

436
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,400
You and your kind have no hope.

437
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,620
You will bleed, and you will hurt...

438
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,820
and you will die in a hopeless cause.

439
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,720
Love is not a hopeless cause.

440
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,810
I will not betray the one true love of my life.

441
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,750
I understand.

442
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,470
Finally I understand it all.

443
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,740
I understand everything.

444
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,450
You poor thing.

445
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,110
Just a little girl,

446
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:32,090
kidnapped, enslaved, alone,

447
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,970
seeking understanding,

448
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,480
comfort...

449
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,110
seeking love.

450
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,460
Do you not see?

451
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,040
I do not doubt that you love.

452
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:54,580
But just for this one moment here alone with me, be honest,

453
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,490
if not with me, at least with yourself.

454
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,510
Do you really believe that they love you

455
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,520
as much as you love them?

456
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,590
Think, woman.

457
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,620
Think of that, that person.

458
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,760
Picture them in your mind.

459
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,070
You know them so well.

460
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,000
Consider who they are,

461
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:20,630
not who you wish them to be, but who they really are,

462
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,880
and ask yourself, were they here,

463
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:26,400
would they or would they not offer up your name

464
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,500
to save themselves?

465
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,490
They would betray you in an instant to save themselves,

466
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,700
and this is the person that you love

467
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,600
and who will never love you the same way.

468
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:44,710
Is it worth it all, the horrors you have endured,

469
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,930
and the agonies...

470
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:58,760
...and the ugly, ugly death you have in front of you?

471
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,950
Is that really what you want,

472
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:06,140
now that you have now admitted to yourself

473
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,170
who they really are?

474
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,290
Tituba...

475
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:17,210
Do you know the greatest pleasure in the world?

476
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:22,410
It is when the pain stops.

477
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,190
And stop it will.

478
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,050
You have but to tell me a name.

479
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,720
Just whisper it.

480
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,760
Tell me who is the leader

481
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,640
of the witches in Salem.

482
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,450
On my soul, the one you seek...

483
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,700
It could be worse.

484
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,760
It could be raining.

485
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,320
At last, you found your way home.

486
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:34,880
Anne!

487
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,470
It's all right.

488
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:48,970
I thought I'd lost you.

489
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,650
Me too.

490
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,010
How?

491
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,290
How?

492
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,060
How did you find me?

493
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,140
Give all credit to captain Alden

494
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:12,160
and his preternatural skills in these woods.

495
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,110
Following the tracks was easy once I found my way out here.

496
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,870
But what I can't figure is how you got so far out of Salem

497
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,580
Leaving so few tracks and traces between here and there.

498
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,130
I am a silly thing, and in a fit of petulance,

499
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:45,000
I-I ran into these woods

500
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,690
without thinking where I was going or how late it was...

501
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,300
Until it was too late.

502
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,060
Without leaving any tracks out of Salem.

503
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,230
It... it rained briefly while I was...

504
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,810
wandering.

505
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,290
Perhaps that washed away my tracks,

506
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,970
or perhaps you just didn't find them.

507
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,230
In either case...

508
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,020
please forgive me

509
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,300
for the trouble I've put you both through.

510
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,370
Thank you.

511
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,530
Well, I'm sure you'd do the same thing for me

512
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,740
if I ever needed...

513
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,440
Rescuing.

514
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,300
You were correct.

515
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,280
She's a remarkable young woman.

516
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:05,660
I can understand why she's not merely your...

517
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:09,590
your servant, but your friend, as well.

518
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:12,110
I've discovered something quite extraordinary.

519
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:14,680
I find so much love.

520
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,560
Love?

521
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,180
What I did not understand

522
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,600
was that the chief witch of Salem

523
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,570
is not merely her leader...

524
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,960
but her lover.

525
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,120
She confessed?

526
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:29,540
Love is a-a two-faced coin, is it not?

527
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,120
And one face is surely betrayal.

528
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:36,770
Do you mind?

529
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:37,860
What?

530
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,800
Oh. Yes, please.

531
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,600
I rarely indulge, but...

532
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,380
I feel the need of a restorative.

533
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,150
Oh, George George.

534
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,620
He's always cultivated the finest cellar in the colony,

535
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,090
What was I saying?

536
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:03,910
Love.

537
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,770
Yes.

538
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,260
You know...

539
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:12,640
It is true that, and no one will admit, 

540
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,770
that love is never equal.

541
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:18,030
And in its inequality 

542
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,250
lies its fragility,

543
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,700
for the one who is loved less

544
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,630
will one day find love tastes like ashes.

545
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:31,070
That is indeed what poor Miss Tituba found.

546
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:34,840
But she did tell me everything,

547
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,950
And she started with Mercy Lewis.

548
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,880
Mercy?

549
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:43,310
Mercy Lewis may well have begun

550
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,980
as a victim of malice, but she...

551
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:51,430
she was made witch by the very beast that assailed her.

552
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,140
She's not here.

553
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,060
Uh, she went out this afternoon.

554
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,470
She's not returned.

555
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,400
Well, it is no great matter.

556
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,530
After all, where can she run to?

557
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,430
I will have her and her girls

558
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,600
by the time the sun comes up.

559
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,080
When I first returned to Salem,

560
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,530
I was convinced that satan's true partner

561
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:32,080
was right in front of me

562
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:35,570
and all I need do is reach out my hand to take her.

563
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:40,810
You can imagine my shock to discover that Captain John Alden

564
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,620
stands behind all of Salem's horror.

565
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:55,010
I fear I...need a breath of air.

566
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,560
Will you walk with me, Mary Sibley,

567
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:01,870
In the evening air...

568
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:07,610
where we may have a good vantage point

569
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,960
from which to witness an arrest?

570
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:18,260
I'm tempted to go back, see if Cotton's all right.

571
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:20,260
He could get lost in those woods

572
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,520
and wake up inside the belly of a bear.

573
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,270
There he is!

574
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,100
John Alden...

575
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,620
...by order of Increase Mather

576
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,850
and in the name of the selectmen of Salem,

577
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,540
I place you under arrest.

578
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,280
What for this time?

579
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,390
Swearing in public?

580
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,550
Witchcraft.

581
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:13,990
Disarm him, shackle him.

582
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:16,090
No!

583
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,750
No! Father, stop them!

584
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,680
Father, please!

585
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,420
Please! You have the power to do something!

586
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,750
Wait.

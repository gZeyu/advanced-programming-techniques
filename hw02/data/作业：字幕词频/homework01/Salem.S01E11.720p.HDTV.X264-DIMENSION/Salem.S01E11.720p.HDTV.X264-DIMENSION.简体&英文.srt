第一季  第十一集

14
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,940
《塞勒姆》前情提要
Previously on Salem.

15
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,040
这名妓女自此被驱逐
This whore is hereby banished.

16
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,120
我很遗憾你心上人所遭遇的一切
I am sorry about your girl.

17
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,880
他已被夺取言语能力
He is rendered incapable of speech.

18
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,060
她将一个蜘蛛捧在肩头
She held a spider to her neck.

19
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,050
她好像在喂它
She seemed to feed it.

20
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,610
你只要告诉我一个名字
You have but to tell me a name.

21
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,710
她先跟我说了梅西·路易丝
And she started with Mercy Lewis.

22
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,480
梅西
Mercy?

23
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,960
我会抓住她和她的那些女孩们
I will have her and her girls.

24
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,000
她不在这  她下午出去了
She's not here. She went out this afternoon.

25
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,250
她还没回来
She's not returned.

26
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,500
你可以想象当我知道
You can imagine my shock

27
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,310
约翰·奥登上尉是塞勒姆恐怖事件的
to discover that John Alden

28
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,900
幕后黑手时有多惊讶
stands behind all of Salem's horror.

29
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,960
我宣布以巫术罪名逮捕你
I place you under arrest for witchcraft.

30
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,440
曾经我多希望你能是我的儿子
There was a time I wished you my own son.

31
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,620
那你就该知道我不是巫师
Then you know I'm no witch.

32
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,930
很遗憾  上尉
Sadly, captain...

33
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,780
你不再是我了解的那个人了
I do not know you at all anymore.

34
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,810
你真相信他有罪吗
Do you truly belive him guilty?

35
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,330
无论我相信与否  在这讨论都没有意义
Whatever I believe of John Alden is not at issue here.

36
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,650
所以我们才需要一场审判
This is why we have a trial.

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,560
审判约翰·奥登
A trial of John Alden.

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,100
你很吃惊吗
Does this surprise you?

39
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,720
你的侍女对他的指认坚定不移
Your own servant's accusations were firm and... and very clear.

40
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,610
除非...
Unless...

41
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,500
当然有这种可能
Unless, of course,

42
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,060
也许是你被情感蒙蔽了双眼
perhaps your own feelings cloud your judgment?

43
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,370
我对约翰·奥登的情意
Any feelings I once had for John Alden were extinguished

44
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,110
早在我嫁给乔治时就消失殆尽了
once I gave my heart to George.

45
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,340
但我担心的不是我的情感
But it is not my feelings that concern me.

46
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,350
那是谁的
Then whose?

47
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,430
塞勒姆的人们
Salem's.

48
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,640
虽然约翰·奥登是颗毒瘤  但人们崇拜他
John Alden is a firebrand, but he is adored by the commoners.

49
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,430
我已经听到下面人蠢蠢欲动的惊慌了
I've already heard their whispers of dismay.

50
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,550
你是在建议我不要把奥登送上法庭吗
Tell me...are you suggesting that I not bring Alden to trial?

51
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,580
不
No.

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,590
我是建议你不要孤军奋战
I am suggesting you do not fight this battle alone.

53
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,180
让行政委员会去决定到底要不要审判
Allow the select board to decide whether a trial is warranted.

54
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,940
有他们的支持  我相信他们会全力支持你
With their backing... and I assure you, you have it fully...

55
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,930
其他人绝不会再有异议
you will quell any dissent.

56
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,420
你就这么自信
And are you confident

57
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,270
行政委员会会投票把奥登送上法庭吗
that the board will vote to bring Alden to trial?

58
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,190
非常确定
As sure as I stand before you.

59
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,380
那好
Yes.

60
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,440
我去召集行政委员会开个会  谢谢你
I shall summon the board at once. Thank you.

61
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,290
还有  牧师
Oh, and, reverend?

62
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,770
梅西·路易丝那儿有消息了吗
Any luck in finding Mercy Lewis?

63
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,070
她也一定要接受末日的审判
She, too, must face her day of reckoning.

64
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,990
还没找到
Not yet.

65
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,770
但我很有耐心
But I'm a patient man.

66
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,690
她躲得了一时  躲不了一世
And a witch can't hide forever.

67
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,110
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

68
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,200
*鼓鸣震天*
*Witch drums*

69
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,680
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

70
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,080
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

71
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,190
*鼓鸣震天*
*The witch drums*

72
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,740
*宁入地狱*
*Better pray for hell*

73
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:08,760
*不留人间*
*Not hallelujah*

74
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,290
这到底是什么
What is it?

75
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:29,800
告诉我
Tell me.

76
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,910
你为什么要销毁它
And why you felt the need to detroy it.

77
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,600
告诉你什么
Tell you?

78
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,720
好像是你告诉我的
Was it not you who just told me

79
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,130
这是个神奇的瞬移面具吧
that it was a magical transporting mask?

80
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,320
我没说错吧
Did I get that right?

81
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,350
别糊弄我
Don't you dare mock me.

82
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,430
我给了你很多次机会  让你私下解释
I've afforded you the privacy to explain.

83
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,180
你还要我说多少次
Which I have done many times.

84
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,200
这是我旅行时买的工艺品
It is an artifact of my travels.

85
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,110
够了
Stop.

86
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,960
别再骗我了  我只想知道真相
No more lies. I simply want the truth.

87
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,810
这个面具的真相吗
The truth of the mask?

88
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,160
你的真相
The truth of you.

89
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,020
你到底是什么身份
Of who and what you are.

90
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,350
好吧
Fine.

91
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,390
也许有人不会嫌我问题多
Perhaps there is someone who is not yet tired of my questions,

92
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,200
一个熟知外面的世界
someone with knowledge of other worlds

93
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,840
并且不畏分享的人
who isn't afraid to share it.

94
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,790
英克里斯·麦哲
Increase Mather.

95
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,300
为什么你一定要拿这种荒唐的事儿
What on earth would you want to bother him

96
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,400
去麻烦人家呢
with this nonsense for?

97
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,360
荒唐
Nonsense?

98
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,480
那不如去让英克里斯鉴定一下吧
Why don't we see if Increase regards this as nonsense?

99
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,880
我相信他不会觉得荒唐
For I do not believe he will.

100
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,700
安
Anne.

101
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,700
安
Anne!

102
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,720
你知道我为什么要回到塞勒姆吗
Do you know why I came back to Salem?

103
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,850
呵呵
Lovely.

104
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,180
我的回答只会让你不满
More questions I can answer to your dissatisfaction.

105
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,940
我回来不只是为了追捕巫师
Not only to hunt witches, 

106
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,370
更重要的是让我儿子成人
but to make a man of my son.

107
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,150
你抓到几个巫师
You found some witches?

108
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,910
那你也算不虚此行了
So your trip is not a total loss.

109
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,170
你真的看不见我为你铺好的路吗
Do you really not see the path that I've set you on?

110
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,250
那个妓女已经不在了
The whore is gone.

111
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,360
现在正是千载难逢的机会
A rare opportunity awaits you now

112
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,730
你可以在塞勒姆所有人民面前宣告自己
to announce yourself before the entire province.

113
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,960
宣告什么
And what is that?

114
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,760
明天我会将约翰·奥登的案子提交委员会
Tomorrow I shall bring John Alden's case before the board.

115
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,210
柯顿  你是个既有天赋又有说服力的发言人
Cotton, you are a persuasive... nay, a gifted speaker.

116
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,090
我希望你支持我
I want you there by my side.

117
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,130
我不去
I will not.

118
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,230
约翰·奥登是我的朋友  可能是我唯一的朋友
John Alden is my friend, perhaps my only one.

119
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,260
你会让友情
And you would allow friendship

120
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,280
阻挡你自我提升的步伐吗
to stand in the way of your own elevation?

121
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,510
他是无辜的
He is innocent.

122
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,720
你明明知道
And you know it.

123
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,490
我知道吗
Do I?

124
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,680
你又知道吗
Do you?

125
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,030
他就是你的酒肉朋友  突然你就能
A man shares your whiskey and suddenly you can...

126
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,190
就能看清他的灵魂
you can see into his very soul

127
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,280
证明他没被恶魔侵蚀走向黑暗了吗
and attest that it has not been blackened by the devil.

128
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,370
我可没有这番本事
I, myself, possess no such omniscience.

129
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,250
很久以前  我也面临过同样的困境
You know, long ago, I faced the same dilemma as you.

130
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,820
我要么跟一个我很喜欢的同学反目
It was state the case against a fellow student, a classmate,

131
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,430
一个我喜欢的年轻人
a young man I... I quite liked

132
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,640
要么缄口不语  放走一个被指控的巫师
or remain silent and allow an accused witch to walk free.

133
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,140
让我猜猜
And let me guess.

134
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,230
你眼睁睁看着他被烧死了
You watched him burn.

135
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:21,780
没有
No.

136
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,270
我的情感打败了理智  那个年轻人被释放了
I let my feelings intercede, and the young man was freed.

137
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,760
可是两年后
And two years later,

138
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,490
他在一次邪教仪式上把两个处女割喉了
he slit the throats of two virgins in a satanic ritual.

139
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,280
都怪我
My mistake.

140
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,880
此后我便一直心存愧疚
And it has haunted me ever since.

141
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,360
所以考虑好你的决定
So consider carefully your decision.

142
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,620
你很了解我
You know me well.

143
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,060
但你有多了解约翰·奥登呢
Just how well do you know John Alden?

144
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,580
按照你的要求  我调查了委员会成员
I surveyed the board per your request.

145
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,590
结果呢
And?

146
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,650
六位委员确定
Six of the selectmen will, indeed,

147
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,550
会选择让奥登受审
opt to take Alden to trial.

148
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,290
其余五位  念及昔日他的父亲
The other five, loyal to the memory of his father,

149
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,590
会投反对票
will vote for dismissal.

150
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,430
还有两个席位
That leaves two seats.

151
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,970
我会按照你的要求投票
I shall vote as you have asked.

152
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,570
我保证
I assure you.

153
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,530
那就只能由我
So this leaves me,

154
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,550
作为病重丈夫的代表  打破平衡僵局了
as a proxy for my ailing husband, to break the tie.

155
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,620
来  我们把这件事解决了
Come. Let's get this over with.

156
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,660
所有人民
Must we not hold all our citizens,

157
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:31,090
不论贫穷富贵
both commoner and the sons of privilege, 

158
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,150
标准面前无一例外
to the same standard?

159
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,760
如若不忠  必将上颈手枷
When they cheat, must they not be pilloried?

160
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,430
如若偷窃  必将施以鞭刑
When they steal, must they not be whipped?

161
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,390
如若背弃对上帝的承诺
And when they fail to uphold their promise to God and choose,

162
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,710
选择与恶魔为伍
instead, to take league with the devil,

163
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,490
必将因此受到审判
must they not then be judged by their decision?

164
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,910
谢谢  牧师
Thank you, Reverend.

165
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,160
相信委员会已做好投票准备
I believe the board is ready to vote.

166
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,020
奥登上尉被指控施以巫术
Captain Alden has been accused of the practice of witchcraft.

167
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,610
牧师慷慨同意
The good reverend has graciously agreed

168
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,430
让委员会决定他是否要接受审判
to allow the board to decide whether he should go to trial.

169
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,960
所以  认为奥登上尉
So, those who believe

170
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,230
应该被当做巫师接受审判的人有谁
that captain Alden should be tried as a witch?

171
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,850
六人同意审判
Six for trial.

172
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,000
那认为奥登上尉
And those who believe

173
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,220
为人正直  此项指控
that captain Alden's distinguished character

174
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,580
毫无根据的有谁
renders such accusations baseless?

175
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,550
五人反对审判
Five for dismissal.

176
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,980
霍尔先生
Mr. Hale?

177
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,730
塞勒姆人民在等待你的投票
Salem awaits your vote.

178
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,800
反对
Dismissal.

179
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,110
六比六
Six to six.

180
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,930
也就是说决定性的一票在我手上
Which means I must break the deadlock.

181
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,220
我投...
And I shall cast my vote --

182
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,110
其实  西布里夫人
Actually, Mrs. Sibley...

183
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,930
你不用投票
Your vote is not required.

184
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,480
你肯定会很高兴
You will be pleased to learn

185
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,790
因为乔治的身体状况大有好转
that George's health has progressed,

186
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,650
至少已经可以自己行使投票权了
at least to the point where he is able to cast his own vote.

187
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,920
谢谢你  医生
Thank you, doctor.

188
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,760
牧师  是你说他被巫师控制了
Reverend, you yourself said that he was held in the witch's grip.

189
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,200
可能吧  也可能不是
Perhaps. Perhaps not.

190
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,820
他的身体状况已在稳步好转
His condition has steadily improved.

191
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,360
好转  他都不能说话
Improved? He cannot speak.

192
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,690
动也几乎不能动
He can barely move.

193
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,310
他就只会  吐痰
All he can do...is spit.

194
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,020
正是
Yes, precisely.

195
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,080
乔治  亲爱的老朋友
George, my dear old friend, 

196
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,850
如果你能理解
if you can understand the words

197
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,760
我现在说的话  请吐一口痰
that I am speaking to you, please spit.

198
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,060
简直荒唐
This is ludicrous.

199
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,720
西布里夫人  其实一点都不荒唐
Actually, Mrs. Sibley, it is anything but.

200
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,750
你丈夫是委员
Your husband is a selectman

201
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,150
他非常想履行自己的公民义务
and he is eager to perform his civic duty.

202
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,750
那好  准备好了
Well, then. Sir?

203
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:26,580
现在  乔治  你告诉我  你觉得
And now, George, tell me -- do you believe that this man,

204
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:30,230
约翰·奥登应不应该接受审判
John Alden, should now stand trial?

205
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,760
同意还是反对
Yea or nay?

206
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,440
如果你表示赞成
If your answer is in the affirmative,

207
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,950
请吐口水
will you please spit?

208
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,900
把他关回牢里
Return him to the jail.

209
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,900
奥登上尉将接受审判
Captain Alden will stand trial

210
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,470
罪名为施用巫术
on the charge of witchcraft.

211
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,120
开门
Open it.

212
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,950
是  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

213
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,870
退下
Now leave us.

214
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,620
是  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

215
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,800
我警告过你
I warned you.

216
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,600
我说过留在塞勒姆  你会死的
I told you that should you stay in Salem, you would die here.

217
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,520
你是来提醒我的吗
So you came here to remind me? 

218
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,640
还是来送葬
Or to bury me?

219
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,500
我是来道歉的
I came to apologize.

220
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,540
不是为了今天的投票
Not for today's vote,

221
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,460
而且为了我当初的选择  害你沦落至此
But for the one that I cast that sent you on this course.

222
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,580
要是我接受你的建议去纽约
Had I accepted your offer to go to New York,

223
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,530
远离这里
far from this place,

224
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:07,330
就不必理会英克里斯·麦哲的投票或是审判了
we would know nothing of votes or trials or Increase Mather.

225
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,330
如果我不去打仗
And if I hadn't gone to war

226
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,870
如果你不嫁给西布里
or you hadn't married Sibley.

227
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,690
我们今天的局面不是单一的选择造成的
There was no one choice that sent our course awry.

228
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,510
听我说
Listen to me.

229
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,680
如果你接受审判  他们会绞死你
If you go to trial, they will hang you.

230
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,260
但还有办法能逃过这一劫
But there is still a way to prevent such a fate.

231
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,720
如果你离开  就无法接受审判了
They cannot try you if you are not here to be tried.

232
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,830
越狱吗
Escape?

233
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,600
-你打算...  -我会安排好
- Is that what you...  - I will arrange it.

234
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,350
这事不容易  但只要计划周详
It won't be easy, but properly planned.

235
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,370
我有手段  人脉任我调遣
I have resources, means at my disposal.

236
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,000
-玛丽  -资源之广远超过你想象
- Mary. - Far more widespread than you might imagine.

237
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,290
玛丽  不要
Mary, no.

238
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,120
我不走
I won't go.

239
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,800
审判的结局只有上绞刑架
But a trial will result with you in the gallows.

240
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,760
你得知道
You must know this.

241
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,820
我一直不懂吉尔斯·科里为何不抵抗
You know, I always wondered why Giles Corey never fought back,

242
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,180
为何他宁可被逼至死
why he let them press him to death

243
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,210
也不肯认罪
rather than plead to their charges.

244
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,520
现在我懂了
But now I know.

245
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,540
他明白一旦遂了他们的心意就彻底输了
He knew he lost the moment he played their game,

246
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,780
就会令他们的疯狂之举显得冠冕堂皇
dignified their madness.

247
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,850
所以我不会从我出生的地方逃走
So, no, I won't run, not from my birthplace.

248
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,550
我宁愿死在这里
I'd rather die here.

249
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,320
你或许能如愿以偿
And so perhaps you will get your wish.

250
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,740
麦哲牧师
Reverend Mather?

251
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,010
你是霍尔家的小姐
You're the Hale girl.

252
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:05,810
安  先生
Anne, sir.

253
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,950
你是想跟我聊聊
Do you wish to speak to me,

254
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,250
还是只想观看我用餐
or are you simply content to watch me eat?

255
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,470
我有个问题
I have a question...

256
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,140
关于巫师
of witches.

257
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,810
可不是嘛
Indeed.

258
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,360
你只是好奇  还是遇见巫师了
Are you merely curious or have you encountered one?

259
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,500
安  你在这儿啊
Well... Anne, there you are.

260
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,560
打扰麦哲牧师用餐了
Interrupting Reverend Mather's dinner.

261
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,090
她在询问有关巫术之事
She was querying me about witchcraft.

262
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,380
是吗
Was she?

263
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,920
麦哲牧师正准备回答我的问题
Reverend Mather was about to answer my questions

264
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,300
而其他人都不能老实回答我
that others seem unable to answer truthfully.

265
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,450
也许我能提供一些帮助
Well, perhaps I can be of some assistance

266
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,130
好让牧师安心继续用餐
so the reverend can finish his meal in peace.

267
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,240
也许  但你会老实回答吗
Perhaps. But will you speak honestly?

268
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,010
我会的
I will.

269
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,280
我并不介意
Well, it is no matter to me.

270
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,660
治安官  霍尔小姐
Magistrate, Miss Hale.

271
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,590
别再说谎了
No more lies.

272
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,840
不再说谎了
No more lies.

273
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,260
你们有谁玩累了吗
Have either of you tired of this game?

274
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,060
我向你们保证  我可不累
For I assure you, I have not.

275
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,890
梅西比你聪明得多
Mercy's too smart for you.

276
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,010
我们绝不供出她的下落
We'll never tell you where she is.

277
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,500
你们是这么想的吗
Is that what you think?

278
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,560
我们在这里
That we're here together

279
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,310
是因为我要你们帮忙找到梅西·路易丝吗
because I require your help in locating Mercy Lewis?

280
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,820
不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no.

281
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,810
我来这里是出于善举
I am here as an act of charity.

282
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,600
善举
Charity?

283
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,540
帮我逮捕她  就能饶你们一命
Aid me in apprehending her and your lives will be spared.

284
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,990
但要是你们负隅顽抗
But if you persist in defying me,

285
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,040
我无从选择  唯有处死你们
I can offer you no alternative to the stake.

286
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,170
梅西不会让我们死的
Mercy won't let us die.

287
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,890
她会来救我们
She will come for us.

288
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,620
也许无眠长夜中这种想法能聊以慰藉
Perhaps such a thought comforts you in your sleepless night,

289
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,420
但我向你们保证
But I assure you, 

290
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:16,720
不管你们是否帮忙  我都会找到梅西·路易丝
I will find Mercy Lewis with or without your help.

291
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,560
你来晚了
You're late.

292
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,510
我很抱歉  但我也得小心提防
Well, I'm sorry, my lady, but I have to take precautions

293
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,300
英克里斯还在四处找我
with Increase still searching for me.

294
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,800
你是对的
You're right to.

295
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,060
关于英克里斯  你曾经提出了一个办法
You offered a solution once for Increase,

296
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,500
被我否决了
one that I dismissed,

297
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,260
也许我当时的反应是错误的
but perhaps it was only my response which was misguided.

298
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,260
你是什么意思
So what are you saying?

299
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,610
我是说英克里斯·麦哲必须死
I'm saying that Increase Mather must die.

300
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,390
这件事得我们来做
And we are the ones to do it.

301
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:19,930
杀了他吗
Kill him?

302
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,080
为什么是现在
But why now?

303
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,540
他的魔爪越伸越长
The shadow he casts grows longer.

304
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,880
而缇图芭的指控危及到了一个我很在乎的人
And Tituba's accusations jeopardize one that I care for deeply.

305
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,070
约翰·奥登
John Alden?

306
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,500
不
No.

307
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,440
我亲爱的梅西
My dear, dear Mercy.

308
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,090
是你
You.

309
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,770
你从一个迷失少女成为恶魔的助手
Your path from lost girl to devil's assistant

310
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,380
这是我也走过的路
is one that I walked, too.

311
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,820
我会保护你  就像保护我自己一样
I would protect you as I would mine own self.

312
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:58,330
如今缇图芭靠出卖我们换得释放
Now, Tituba's released, rewarded for her treachery,

313
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,590
而你却像个野兽般被追捕着  恐惧着
And you live like an animal, hunted and fearful.

314
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,150
我要怎么做  何时动手
So how will I do it and when?

315
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,020
别急  亲爱的
Easy, my dear.

316
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,540
许多巫师曾试图杀死英克里斯
Many a witch has sought to claim Increase's life

317
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,570
最后却都丢了他们自己的小命
And lost theirs in the process.

318
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:18,370
我们的计划必须考虑周全
Our efforts must be planned...carefully.

319
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,300
你一定已经想到办法了吧
Surely you must have a method in mind.

320
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:20,990
没错
Yes.

321
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,750
的确有  把手指给我看看  
I do. Show me your fingers.

322
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,280
手指
My fingers?

323
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,680
应该能行
These will do.

324
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,450
什么能行
For what?

325
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,600
袭击我
Now strike me.

326
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,680
小姐
My lady?

327
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,690
像对待敌人般撕扯我的血肉
Tear at my flesh as you would your vilest enemy.

328
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,200
不用怀疑你的耳朵和信仰
Do not question your ears nor your faith.

329
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,160
照我说的做
Do as I ask.

330
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,590
你很快就会明白了
And soon you will understand.

331
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,050
八岁时  我亲眼看着父母被烧死
I was 8 years old when I watched my parents burn.

332
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,500
火刑是消灭巫师亘古不变的方法
Timeless solution for exterminating witches.

333
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,570
你知道那是什么感觉吗
Do you know what it's like

334
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,390
眼睁睁看着
To witness the death of those you love

335
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,960
你最爱的人死去
More than anyone else in the world?

336
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,330
我无法想象
I can't imagine.

337
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,400
那能让你意识到自己的能力
It teaches you what you are capable of.

338
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,920
那种深埋体内  你也许永远不会察觉的能力
The depths and limits you never knew you had.

339
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,830
然而  即便他们已被挫骨扬灰
And, yet, even as their ashes lingered in the air,

340
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,210
我却幸免于难
Steps were taken to spare me a similar fate.

341
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,260
我被赶出英格兰  漂洋过海
So I was whisked from England, sent across the sea,

342
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,400
在瘟疫和鼠疫中幸存下来
surviving plague and pestilence,

343
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,000
来到了这个新世界
to the new world.

344
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,110
我被忠诚的巫师信徒收养
I was taken in by those loyal to the cause

345
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,520
他们养育我长大  并教会我两件事
who raised me with a twin mission...

346
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,970
一是如何发掘出自身的能力
Teach me to harness the power of who I was

347
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,960
同时隐藏这种能力不被世人所知
And yet to keep it hidden from the world.

348
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,660
后来  我有了自己的家庭
And then I was raising a family of my own

349
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,210
深知我最珍爱的两个人
knowing that those I held most precious

350
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,930
恰恰被我自己所危及着
live in every bit the jeopardy that I do.

351
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,180
我是巫师吗
Am I a witch?

352
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,460
是
Yes.

353
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,380
但那会减少丝毫我对你的父爱吗
But does that make me any less of a loving father?

354
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,490
不会
No.

355
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,260
绝对不会
Most certainly not.

356
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,740
进来
Enter.

357
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,900
您一召唤我就来了
I came as soon as you summoned me.

358
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,770
您好像不太高兴
I suspect you're not pleased.

359
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,490
怎么回事  西布里夫人
What happened, Mrs. Sibley?

360
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,460
哦  这个啊
Oh, uh, this.

361
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,410
我还一直在自欺欺人
And here my own vanity convinced me 

362
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,950
以为不会有人注意到呢
it was hardly noticeable.

363
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,480
陪我喝杯茶吧
Join me in tea, 

364
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,830
让我跟你讲讲我的悲惨遭遇
and I will tell you my sad tale.

365
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,400
我去了树林
I went to the woods, 

366
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:27,320
想整理一下思绪  最近的麻烦太多了
hoping to clear my mind after recent troubling events.

367
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:28,760
要糖吗
Sugar?

368
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,460
不用  谢谢
No, thank you.

369
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,240
我沉浸在自己的世界里  没注意到她
Lost in my own thoughts, I scarcely noticed her.

370
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,640
喝吧  艾萨克  
Drink, Isaac.

371
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,590
直到她扑到了我身上
Until she was upon me.

372
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,400
谁
Who?

373
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,950
梅西·路易丝
Mercy Lewis, 

374
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,870
她没有因为我曾经收留过她
who greeted me not with kindness

375
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,440
而心怀感恩
for once taking her in...

376
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,100
却向我回报以暴力和愤怒
But with violence and anger.

377
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,700
缇图芭被指控  她认为我难逃其咎
She finds me guilty for Tituba's accusations.

378
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,870
仿佛我还得对自己女仆的想法负责似的
as if I'm responsible for my servant's mind.

379
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,020
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley?

380
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,120
怎么  艾萨克
Yes, Isaac?

381
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,480
这茶
The tea.

382
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,710
怎么了
What about it?

383
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,290
让你周身发热了吗  还是觉得很困
Is it making you warm or just sleepy?

384
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,200
都有
Both.

385
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,680
很好  那说明有用了
Good. Then it's working.

386
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,420
我不介意告诉你实话
I don't mind telling you this

387
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,980
因为等你醒了就什么都不记得了
Because when you wake, you'll remember nothing.

388
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,310
不过我确实抱歉要这样利用你
Although I do regret using you like this.

389
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,730
即便在塞勒姆  也还有像你这样的好人
Even in Salem, there are those who deserve better.

390
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,610
但英克里斯深知你胆小本分
But Increase knows that you're far too scared and guileless

391
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,030
不可能再次骗他
to betray him again.

392
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,250
他会相信你的话
He will take your words as fact.

393
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,110
我的话
Words?

394
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,460
你听说梅西在附近出没
That hearing that Mercy lurked nearby,

395
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,160
于是去树林里找她
you sought her in the woods.

396
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,040
但她动作太快  被她逃脱了
But she was too quick, and she evaded you.

397
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,410
英克里斯会仔细分析你每一句话
Increase will parse your words

398
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,830
直到他相信你说的是实话
until he is convinced they are truth.

399
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,360
跟我重复一遍  艾萨克
So repeat after me, Isaac.

400
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,450
"我去丛林里"
"I went to the woods..."

401
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,760
"我去丛林里"
I went to the woods...

402
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,690
"为了找梅西·路易丝"
"...to find Mercy Lewis."

403
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,350
"为了找梅西·路易丝"
...to find Mercy Lewis.

404
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:54,560
"穿过小河  在低垂的树枝旁  我发现了她"
"Past the lake, beside the weeping tree, I spied her."

405
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,450
"穿过小河  在低垂的树枝旁  我发现了她"
Past the lake, beside the weeping tree, I spied her.

406
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,010
很好  再说一遍
Very good. Again.

407
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,390
我们真的了解自己身边的人吗
Can we ever truly know our neighbor,

408
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,400
相信他们就是看上去的那样
trust that they are whom they seem to be,

409
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,040
那些他们想让我们相信的形象
who they would have us believe them to be?

410
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,160
有人说某个年轻女子  小姑娘
We are told that a young woman, a girl,

411
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,370
被当做巫师的工具  不料却发现她
really was a tool of the witches only to find that she is,

412
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,410
实际上就是巫师本人
in fact, a witch herself.

413
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:25,900
如今  塞勒姆先驱者之子也被控以同样罪名
And now Salem's first son stands likewise accused.

414
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,680
看看周围
Look around.

415
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,470
看看你的左右
Look to either side.

416
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,710
看看你身旁的人
Look to your neighbor.

417
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,940
扪心自问
And ask yourself, 

418
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,640
他们是朋友还是男巫
"Friend or sorcerer? 

419
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,990
是妻子还是女巫
Wife or witch?"

420
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,380
是上帝还是魔鬼
God or devil!

421
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:49,740
谁说的  出来
Who said that? Show yourself.

422
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,780
是我儿子啊
It is my son.

423
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,960
不用理睬他
Pay him no mind.

424
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,070
别用你们的宽容放纵他
Do not reward him with your indulgence.

425
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:08,010
你以上帝之名问着
You question who the people of Salem are 

426
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,580
塞勒姆的民众都是谁
in the name of god.

427
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,070
然后呢
Yes?

428
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,100
但是塞勒姆的民众该不该也问问你是谁
But should the people of Salem not question who you are?

429
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,950
因为魔鬼也会反其道而行
For how else would the devil appear...

430
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,750
以上帝之名出现
but in the cloak of the lord?

431
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,180
出去
Get out.

432
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,530
你喝醉了
You are drunk!

433
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,190
你的大喊大叫只会给自己蒙羞
Your rantings only serve to embarrass yourself.

434
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,370
现在出去
Remove yourself now.

435
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:44,850
还不走
You will not?

436
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,080
我亲自送你走
I will remove you myself!

437
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,190
指认自己的父亲
Point the finger at her own father?

438
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,290
她绝不会的
She would never.

439
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,050
你肯定吗
Are you certain of that?

440
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,570
昨晚我才发现她和英克里斯在一起呢
Wasn't it just last night that I found her with Increase?

441
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,860
她没有这个企图
She had no intention.

442
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,850
就是装装样子
She was simply acting out.

443
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,670
塞勒姆有一堆装腔作势的人
Salem is filled with those who act out --

444
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,060
朋友装成敌人
friends who act like enemies, 

445
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,100
敌人装成判决者
enemies who act as executioners.

446
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,070
这些对她来说都太陌生
This is all new to her.

447
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:30,230
放心吧  她会慢慢接受的
Trust that, in time, she will accept it.

448
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,950
是啊  但要是没接受  又怎么办
Yes, and if not, what then?

449
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,850
那就是时候告诉她剩下的故事了
Then it may be time to tell her the rest of the story.

450
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,490
恐怕现在已经是时候了
I'm afraid that time has already come.

451
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,830
你的故事很是引人入胜
Your story is really quite fantastic.

452
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:49,390
玛丽·西布里被梅西·路易丝攻击了
Mary Sibley attacked by Mercy Lewis.

453
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,270
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

454
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,250
出于对玛丽的忠诚
And out of loyalty to Mary,

455
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,690
你追踪那个姑娘进了丛林
you followed the girl into the woods.

456
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:56,820
对玛丽的忠诚
Loyalty to Mary?

457
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,810
不是的  先生  是对您的忠诚
No, sir. Loyalty to you.

458
00:26:58,810 --> 00:26:59,630
对我
Me?

459
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,590
您不是急着想找那个姑娘吗
Are you not eager to find the girl?

460
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:03,900
您不是告诉我
Did you not tell me

461
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,410
要替您眼观四路耳听八方吗
to keep my eyes and ears open on your behalf?

462
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,700
所以当我得知她出没在丛林边缘时
So when I learned she lurked at the wood's edge,

463
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,460
我就遵照您的意图去寻找她了
I sought her out, as I knew you would have wanted.

464
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,470
这叫刺挠
This is called a cilice.

465
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,700
我穿着它来时刻提醒自己所犯下的罪恶
I wear this to remind myself of my own failing.

466
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,210
你是否很惊讶  艾萨克
Does it surprise you, Isaac,

467
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:35,270
当你听到即使是我也身负罪恶
to learn that even I have sins I must atone for?

468
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,090
你犯过罪吗
Have you ever sinned?

469
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,890
有也不是故意的  先生
Not intentionally, sir.

470
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,600
你现在在犯罪吗
Are you sinning now?

471
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,540
你是否在骗我
Are you lying to me?

472
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,810
我说的是实话  牧师
I speak the truth, reverend.

473
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,670
我看见她了  但是没法抓住她
I saw her, but could not catch her.

474
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,320
你还记得最后一次看见梅西是在哪儿吗
And can you recall where it was you last laid eyes on Mercy?

475
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:58,230
穿过小河  在低垂的树枝旁  我发现了她
Past the lake, beside the weeping tree, I spied her.

476
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,380
你能带我去那儿吗
And you could -- you could lead me there?

477
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,840
是的  当然了  先生
Yes, of course, sir.

478
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:04,730
那么
Well, then. 

479
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,590
收拾一下吧  小伙子
prepare yourself, my boy.

480
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,070
我们两个
For you and I... 

481
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,930
要去猎捕巫师了
are going witch hunting.

482
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,570
霍尔小姐
Miss Hale.

483
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,360
是不是打扰到你了  牧师
Am I intruding, reverend?

484
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,620
我正准备享用我的下午"茶"
Well, I was just about to enjoy my late-afternoon drink.

485
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,220
可别把这跟我的晚"茶"弄混了
Not to be confused, of course, with my early-evening drink,

486
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,630
不过也差不多是时候了
which I anticipate taking place shortly, as well.

487
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,960
你也来一杯吗
Perhaps?

488
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,630
不用  谢谢  我不能久留
Oh, no, thank you. I can not stay.

489
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,120
我只是来说一声  我很抱歉
I simply came to say... I'm sorry.

490
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,880
为了什么
For?

491
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,920
所有事
Everything.

492
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,980
我没有好好对待你
I have not treated you well... 

493
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,570
也不完全公平
nor entirely fairly.

494
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,250
所以说我父亲的所为让你觉得我很可怜  是吗
So my father has earned me your pity. Is that right?

495
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,070
不
No.

496
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,320
我只是看到了我们的相似之处
I simply see that we are alike.

497
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,700
都有一个心机深沉的父亲
Both children of complicated men.

498
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,960
霍尔治安官  心机深沉吗
Magistrate Hale, complicated?

499
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,730
说实话  我总觉得他就是个
In truth, he's always seemed a bit of a...

500
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,790
单纯的白痴
a simpleton to me.

501
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,020
不  我向你保证
No, I assure you.

502
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,080
他和塞勒姆中的人一样充满心机
He is as complex as any man in Salem.

503
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:52,040
听说你对巫师颇有研究啊
You have made quite a study of them -- witches.

504
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,210
即便如此  我仍觉得自己对他们一无所知
For all my studies, I'm not sure I truly know a thing.

505
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,580
我可不这么认为
Oh, I doubt that.

506
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,730
你一定能告诉我许多关于他们的事情
I'm sure you could tell me all about them.

507
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,540
我还不知道你也相信巫师的存在
I did not know you even believed in witches.

508
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,740
我改变了想法
I've had a change of heart.

509
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,070
为什么呢
And why is that?

510
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,620
也许是我一直都对其有兴趣
Perhaps it is an interest I've lived with my entire life,

511
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,960
但是直到最近才发现
but wasn't aware of until recently.

512
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,370
好吧
Well, um...

513
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,440
如果你有时间  就请坐吧
If you have a moment, please sit,

514
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,170
我会告诉你关于巫师的一切
and I will tell you all about witches.

515
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,900
就是这  牧师
It's here, reverend.

516
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,890
你确定吗
You're sure?

517
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,740
这就是那条通往她藏身之处的小路
It was the trail I took that led me to her.

518
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,400
小心点  先生
Careful, sir.

519
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,570
我们得提防她的突然袭击
We do not know when she could strike.

520
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,080
告诉我  你真的独自一人
Tell me, did you really travel 

521
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,090
走进丛林深处
this deep into the woods alone

522
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,360
只为了找到那个女孩吗
to find the girl?

523
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,650
为了你  先生
For you, sir.

524
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,570
为了我
For me?

525
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,480
我很感动
I'm touched.

526
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,070
但我却仍然无法相信你
I'm also extremely skeptical.

527
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,280
牧师
Reverend?

528
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,800
你到底有何意图
What is your plan?

529
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,570
意图
Plan?

530
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,260
引我来此  好对我下手吗
To lure me? To kill me?

531
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:25,420
不  我为什么要这么做
No. Why would I? How?

532
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,420
或者说
Or perhaps 

533
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,990
或者你别无选择
perhaps you did not have a choice.

534
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,060
告诉我  你在为谁卖命
Tell me, whose bidding is it that you do?

535
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,950
是约翰·奥登想让我死吗
Is it John Alden who wants me dead?

536
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,440
还是玛丽·西布里
Or Mary Sibley?

537
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,560
又或者他俩同流合污
Or do they work in concert? 

538
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,700
马上告诉我  不然我就顺脖一刀
Tell me now or I'll slide this blade along your throat

539
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,270
在我擦血入鞘之前你就会早已死透
and you'll be dead before I clean and sheath it.

540
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:49,390
牧师  我发誓这么做都是为了您
Reverend, I promise you I'm here on your behalf

541
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,650
绝无二心
and yours alone.

542
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,480
先生
Sir!

543
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,560
追上她  快去
After her! Go on!

544
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,570
你曾亲眼见过她们
You've seen one?

545
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,980
我是说  一个女巫
A witch, I mean?

546
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,020
是的
I have.

547
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,930
这恶毒的老怪物多年来一直未被人识破
A vile creature who walked undetected for years

548
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,020
幸好最终  她终究暴露了本性
until finally her true nature was revealed.

549
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,890
就是说她们藏在我们之中吗
So they hide amongst us?

550
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,920
这想法改变的真彻底
This change of heart is remarkable.

551
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,650
真不懂为什么我花了这么久才明白
Remarkable that it took so long.

552
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,570
生活在塞勒姆却不相信有巫师
Living in Salem and not believing in witches

553
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,230
就如同生活在伦敦却不相信有大雾一般
is like living in london and not believing in fog.

554
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,080
我居然傻到去否认摆在眼前的事实
It is to deny what is right in front of you.

555
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,360
你父亲怎么看待你这种转变
And what does your father think of your conversion?

556
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,440
我父亲
My father...

557
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,180
他正是
above all is...

558
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,830
转变我看法的原因
responsible for it.

559
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,460
或许他真如你说的一样心机深沉
Perhaps he's as complicated as you say.

560
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,270
但是我父亲没有说明的是
But what my father did not answer is...

561
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,470
巫师们想要什么
what do witches want?

562
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,550
有人说他们只想与我们和平共处
Some say they want only to live in peace.

563
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,960
其他人  譬如我父亲
Others, like my father, 

564
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,350
说他们的目的只有一个
say that they desire nothing less 

565
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,650
那就是将人类彻底灭绝
than the destruction of all mankind.

566
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,530
如果你父亲是正确的呢
And is your father correct?

567
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,340
我父亲大多数时候都是正确的
My father's correct in most matters.

568
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,970
他对你的看法也是正确的吗
Is he correct about you?

569
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,360
我父亲认为我是个废物
My father thinks I'm a failure.

570
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:22,270
因为我既不虔诚  还终日酗酒
Since I have failed at both piety and sobriety.

571
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,310
没错
Yes.

572
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,540
我想这两点大家都有目共睹
The evidence supports his case.

573
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,170
他错了
He's wrong.

574
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,250
如今我的失败又加上了一件
Another failure to add to my list.

575
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:58,250
你唯一的失败就是没有成为你的父亲
Your only failure is not becoming your father.

576
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,720
而那根本不算失败
And that is no failure.

577
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,240
[咒语]
Terra sunt carnes et ossa.

578
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,230
[咒语]
Domini est terra et ossa.

579
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,790
[咒语]
Terra sunt carnes et ossa.

580
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,530
[咒语]
Domini est terra et ossa.

581
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,920
我没看到她
I do not see her.

582
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,120
不用担心  她会回来的
Fear not. She will return.

583
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,590
要不她还怎么杀掉我呢
For how else can she attempt to kill me?

584
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,660
[咒语]
Domini est terra et ossa.

585
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,810
撒旦是个强大的敌人
Satan is a formidable enemy

586
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,930
不是因为他的邪恶  而是因为他很狡猾
not because he's evil, but because he is sly.

587
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,100
我们俩是老相识了
Oh, we know each other well.

588
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:05,260
[咒语]
Et nos unum benedictus.

589
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,350
牧师
Reverend?

590
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,870
先生
Sir?

591
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,200
先生  麦哲牧师
Sir? Reverend Mather?

592
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,160
在找我吗  牧师
Looking for me, reverend?

593
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,470
我会将你抓回塞勒姆
You will return with me to Salem,

594
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:45,290
你会受到审判的  巫师
and you will stand trial, witch.

595
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,690
我可不这么认为
I don't think so.

596
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,890
难道你真的以为
Did you think it would only take 

597
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,050
仅凭一把小刀便能杀了我吗  牧师
one knife to kill me, reverend?

598
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,090
快追上去
After her!

599
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,570
艾萨克  别让她跑了
Isaac, don't let her get away!

600
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,610
艾萨克
Isaac!

601
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,870
梅西的武器
Mercy's weapon.

602
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,450
可怜的孩子
Oh, my poor boy.

603
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,020
别用力呼吸
Breathe shallow.

604
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,410
有我陪着你
You are not alone.

605
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,380
什么事
Yes? 

606
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,260
麦哲牧师让您去他那一趟
Reverend Mather has requested you in his quarters.

607
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,180
柯顿吗
Cotton?

608
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,070
不  夫人
Uh, no, ma'am.

609
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,100
是英克里斯
Increase.

610
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,380
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley, 

611
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:43,970
这边请
this way.

612
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,060
能让我单独跟他待一阵吗
May I have a moment with him?

613
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,250
艾萨克
Isaac.

614
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,940
亲爱的艾萨克
Oh, sweet isaac.

615
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,330
我从未想过你会因此而受伤
I never intended for you to meet this fate.

616
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,040
我向你保证
So I promise you --

617
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,890
尽管塞勒姆即将迎来腥风血雨
though a grim future awaits the people of Salem --

618
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,470
但我不会让你再受到任何伤害
I will protect you from any further pain.

619
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,980
我向你保证
I swear to you.

620
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,700
我们出去吧
Come now.

621
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,730
他需要休息
He needs his rest.

622
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,740
牧师  我不明白
Reverend, I am at a loss.

623
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:57,190
为什么艾萨克会独自一人去寻找梅西
why Isaac would take it upon himself to seek out mercy...

624
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,550
我也问了他同样的问题
I asked him the same question.

625
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,710
他怎么说
And what did he say?

626
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:09,890
他说是为了我
He said he did it on my behalf, 

627
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,250
但我却无法相信
which I find very odd

628
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,150
因为我很清楚  他十分憎恨我
when you consider the fact that he detests me.

629
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,760
憎恨您
Detests you?

630
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,880
不  艾萨克不会恨任何人
No. No, isaac hates no one.

631
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,380
他做不到
He is incapable of it.

632
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,360
那至少你应该同意
Well, at least you will agree his mind is...

633
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,790
他就像个小孩
childlike.

634
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,100
正因如此
And, like a child,

635
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,870
他会听从别人的意识和想法
he absorbs the thoughts and the intents of others.

636
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,170
什么别人
What others?

637
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,500
那些真正恨我的
Someone who does hate me...

638
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:47,080
想我死的人
and desires me...dead.

639
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,380
还有一件事  牧师
And one other matter, reverend --

640
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:03,150
我对约翰·奥登是巫师一事仍心存怀疑
I remain skeptical that John Alden is a witch.

641
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,950
如果不是奥登
Ah, if not Alden, 

642
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,670
那告诉我  到底是谁
tell me who, then, is responsible

643
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,270
导致了塞勒姆发生的一切
for what has transpired in Salem?

644
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,860
很可惜  我不知道
Regrettably, I do not know.

645
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,170
或许我们可以一起祈祷
Well, perhaps we can hope together

646
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,090
那个真正有罪的人能站出来
that the truly guilty party will step forward

647
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,930
洗脱上尉的罪名
and...exonerate the good captain.

648
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,140
你觉得这有可能吗  玛丽
Do you think that's a possibility, Mary?

649
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,380
这里是塞勒姆
This is Salem.

650
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,950
凡事皆有可能
I think there are no limits to what is possible.

651
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:24,070
你又是来冲我发脾气的吗
Am I to expect another outburst?

652
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,160
不
No. 

653
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,490
我已经几个小时没沾酒了
I've not had a drink for hours.

654
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:32,800
真不敢相信你居然认为这也算进步
Amazing what one comes to accept as a sign of progress.

655
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,710
你这个时候来做什么
Why have you come at this hour?

656
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,200
我一直在考虑您的提议
I've been contemplating your offer.

657
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,430
参与奥登上尉的审判
To join you in the prosecution of captain Alden.

658
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:46,370
你终于想清楚我说的好处了
And you have seen the wisdom in it?

659
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,060
我确实明白了
I have seen wisdom...

660
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,080
但不是您说的那些
But not yours.

661
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,080
我决定为奥登上尉辩护
I've decided to defend captain Alden.

662
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,310
为他辩护
To defend?

663
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,830
你知道我有多骄傲吗
Oh, imagine how proud I am to have...

664
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:07,470
看着我亲手养育的儿子
raised a son so steadfast in his ability

665
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:10,810
总是如此坚定地做出错误的决定
to consistently make the wrong decision.

666
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,170
安
Anne.

667
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,090
明天再说吧  父亲  我该睡了
Please, father, it's far past my bedtime.

668
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,670
我只要一小会
I only require a moment.

669
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,640
有些事我一直没有告诉你
Something I neglected to tell you before...

670
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,870
是关于那个面具的
regarding that mask.

671
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,510
这事能晚点再说吗
Truly, can this wait?

672
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,360
不能再等了
It has waited long enough.

673
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,360
是这样的
And it is this 

674
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,770
那个面具的能力
that the power of that mask

675
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:53,470
只能被一种人所激活
can only be accessed by those of one kind.

676
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,080
哪种人
And what kind is that?

677
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,730
跟我一样的人
My kind.

678
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,670
但我激活了...
But it worked when I...

679
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,330
你是说我是...
are you saying that I am...

680
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,020
跟我一样
like me.

681
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,940
是个巫师
A witch.

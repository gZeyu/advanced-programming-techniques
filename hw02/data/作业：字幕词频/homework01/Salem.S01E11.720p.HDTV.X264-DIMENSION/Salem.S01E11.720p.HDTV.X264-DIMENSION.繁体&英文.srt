第一季  第十一集

14
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,940
《塞勒姆》前情提要
Previously on Salem.

15
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,040
這名妓女自此被驅逐
This whore is hereby banished.

16
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,120
我很遺憾你心上人所遭遇的一切
I am sorry about your girl.

17
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,880
他已被奪取言語能力
He is rendered incapable of speech.

18
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,060
她將一個蜘蛛捧在肩頭
She held a spider to her neck.

19
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,050
她好像在喂它
She seemed to feed it.

20
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,610
你只要告訴我一個名字
You have but to tell me a name.

21
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,710
她先跟我說了梅西·路易絲
And she started with Mercy Lewis.

22
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,480
梅西
Mercy?

23
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,960
我會抓住她和她的那些女孩們
I will have her and her girls.

24
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,000
她不在這  她下午出去了
She's not here. She went out this afternoon.

25
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,250
她還沒回來
She's not returned.

26
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,500
你可以想象當我知道
You can imagine my shock

27
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,310
約翰·奧登上尉是塞勒姆恐怖事件的
to discover that John Alden

28
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,900
幕后黑手時有多驚訝
stands behind all of Salem's horror.

29
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,960
我宣布以巫術罪名逮捕你
I place you under arrest for witchcraft.

30
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,440
曾經我多希望你能是我的兒子
There was a time I wished you my own son.

31
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,620
那你就該知道我不是巫師
Then you know I'm no witch.

32
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,930
很遺憾  上尉
Sadly, captain...

33
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,780
你不再是我了解的那個人了
I do not know you at all anymore.

34
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,810
你真相信他有罪嗎
Do you truly belive him guilty?

35
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,330
無論我相信與否  在這討論都沒有意義
Whatever I believe of John Alden is not at issue here.

36
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,650
所以我們才需要一場審判
This is why we have a trial.

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,560
審判約翰·奧登
A trial of John Alden.

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,100
你很吃驚嗎
Does this surprise you?

39
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,720
你的侍女對他的指認堅定不移
Your own servant's accusations were firm and... and very clear.

40
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,610
除非...
Unless...

41
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,500
當然有這種可能
Unless, of course,

42
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,060
也許是你被情感蒙蔽了雙眼
perhaps your own feelings cloud your judgment?

43
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,370
我對約翰·奧登的情意
Any feelings I once had for John Alden were extinguished

44
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,110
早在我嫁給喬治時就消失殆盡了
once I gave my heart to George.

45
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,340
但我擔心的不是我的情感
But it is not my feelings that concern me.

46
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,350
那是誰的
Then whose?

47
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,430
塞勒姆的人們
Salem's.

48
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,640
雖然約翰·奧登是顆毒瘤  但人們崇拜他
John Alden is a firebrand, but he is adored by the commoners.

49
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,430
我已經聽到下面人蠢蠢欲動的驚慌了
I've already heard their whispers of dismay.

50
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,550
你是在建議我不要把奧登送上法庭嗎
Tell me...are you suggesting that I not bring Alden to trial?

51
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,580
不
No.

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,590
我是建議你不要孤軍奮戰
I am suggesting you do not fight this battle alone.

53
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,180
讓行政委員會去決定到底要不要審判
Allow the select board to decide whether a trial is warranted.

54
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,940
有他們的支持  我相信他們會全力支持你
With their backing... and I assure you, you have it fully...

55
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,930
其他人絕不會再有異議
you will quell any dissent.

56
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,420
你就這么自信
And are you confident

57
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,270
行政委員會會投票把奧登送上法庭嗎
that the board will vote to bring Alden to trial?

58
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,190
非常確定
As sure as I stand before you.

59
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,380
那好
Yes.

60
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,440
我去召集行政委員會開個會  謝謝你
I shall summon the board at once. Thank you.

61
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,290
還有  牧師
Oh, and, reverend?

62
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,770
梅西·路易絲那兒有消息了嗎
Any luck in finding Mercy Lewis?

63
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,070
她也一定要接受末日的審判
She, too, must face her day of reckoning.

64
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,990
還沒找到
Not yet.

65
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,770
但我很有耐心
But I'm a patient man.

66
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,690
她躲得了一時  躲不了一世
And a witch can't hide forever.

67
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,110
*擂我戰鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

68
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,200
*鼓鳴震天*
*Witch drums*

69
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,680
*擂我戰鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

70
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,080
*擂我戰鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

71
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,190
*鼓鳴震天*
*The witch drums*

72
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,740
*寧入地獄*
*Better pray for hell*

73
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:08,760
*不留人間*
*Not hallelujah*

74
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,290
這到底是什么
What is it?

75
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:29,800
告訴我
Tell me.

76
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,910
你為什么要銷毀它
And why you felt the need to detroy it.

77
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,600
告訴你什么
Tell you?

78
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,720
好像是你告訴我的
Was it not you who just told me

79
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,130
這是個神奇的瞬移面具吧
that it was a magical transporting mask?

80
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,320
我沒說錯吧
Did I get that right?

81
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,350
別糊弄我
Don't you dare mock me.

82
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,430
我給了你很多次機會  讓你私下解釋
I've afforded you the privacy to explain.

83
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,180
你還要我說多少次
Which I have done many times.

84
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,200
這是我旅行時買的工藝品
It is an artifact of my travels.

85
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,110
夠了
Stop.

86
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,960
別再騙我了  我只想知道真相
No more lies. I simply want the truth.

87
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,810
這個面具的真相嗎
The truth of the mask?

88
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,160
你的真相
The truth of you.

89
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,020
你到底是什么身份
Of who and what you are.

90
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,350
好吧
Fine.

91
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,390
也許有人不會嫌我問題多
Perhaps there is someone who is not yet tired of my questions,

92
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,200
一個熟知外面的世界
someone with knowledge of other worlds

93
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,840
并且不畏分享的人
who isn't afraid to share it.

94
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,790
英克里斯·麥哲
Increase Mather.

95
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,300
為什么你一定要拿這種荒唐的事兒
What on earth would you want to bother him

96
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,400
去麻煩人家呢
with this nonsense for?

97
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,360
荒唐
Nonsense?

98
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,480
那不如去讓英克里斯鑒定一下吧
Why don't we see if Increase regards this as nonsense?

99
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,880
我相信他不會覺得荒唐
For I do not believe he will.

100
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,700
安
Anne.

101
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,700
安
Anne!

102
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,720
你知道我為什么要回到塞勒姆嗎
Do you know why I came back to Salem?

103
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,850
呵呵
Lovely.

104
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,180
我的回答只會讓你不滿
More questions I can answer to your dissatisfaction.

105
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,940
我回來不只是為了追捕巫師
Not only to hunt witches, 

106
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,370
更重要的是讓我兒子成人
but to make a man of my son.

107
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,150
你抓到幾個巫師
You found some witches?

108
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,910
那你也算不虛此行了
So your trip is not a total loss.

109
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,170
你真的看不見我為你鋪好的路嗎
Do you really not see the path that I've set you on?

110
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,250
那個妓女已經不在了
The whore is gone.

111
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,360
現在正是千載難逢的機會
A rare opportunity awaits you now

112
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,730
你可以在塞勒姆所有人民面前宣告自己
to announce yourself before the entire province.

113
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,960
宣告什么
And what is that?

114
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,760
明天我會將約翰·奧登的案子提交委員會
Tomorrow I shall bring John Alden's case before the board.

115
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,210
柯頓  你是個既有天賦又有說服力的發言人
Cotton, you are a persuasive... nay, a gifted speaker.

116
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,090
我希望你支持我
I want you there by my side.

117
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,130
我不去
I will not.

118
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,230
約翰·奧登是我的朋友  可能是我唯一的朋友
John Alden is my friend, perhaps my only one.

119
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,260
你會讓友情
And you would allow friendship

120
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,280
阻擋你自我提升的步伐嗎
to stand in the way of your own elevation?

121
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,510
他是無辜的
He is innocent.

122
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,720
你明明知道
And you know it.

123
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,490
我知道嗎
Do I?

124
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,680
你又知道嗎
Do you?

125
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,030
他就是你的酒肉朋友  突然你就能
A man shares your whiskey and suddenly you can...

126
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,190
就能看清他的靈魂
you can see into his very soul

127
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,280
證明他沒被惡魔侵蝕走向黑暗了嗎
and attest that it has not been blackened by the devil.

128
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,370
我可沒有這番本事
I, myself, possess no such omniscience.

129
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,250
很久以前  我也面臨過同樣的困境
You know, long ago, I faced the same dilemma as you.

130
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,820
我要么跟一個我很喜歡的同學反目
It was state the case against a fellow student, a classmate,

131
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,430
一個我喜歡的年輕人
a young man I... I quite liked

132
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,640
要么緘口不語  放走一個被指控的巫師
or remain silent and allow an accused witch to walk free.

133
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,140
讓我猜猜
And let me guess.

134
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,230
你眼睜睜看著他被燒死了
You watched him burn.

135
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:21,780
沒有
No.

136
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,270
我的情感打敗了理智  那個年輕人被釋放了
I let my feelings intercede, and the young man was freed.

137
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,760
可是兩年后
And two years later,

138
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,490
他在一次邪教儀式上把兩個處女割喉了
he slit the throats of two virgins in a satanic ritual.

139
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,280
都怪我
My mistake.

140
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,880
此后我便一直心存愧疚
And it has haunted me ever since.

141
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,360
所以考慮好你的決定
So consider carefully your decision.

142
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,620
你很了解我
You know me well.

143
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,060
但你有多了解約翰·奧登呢
Just how well do you know John Alden?

144
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,580
按照你的要求  我調查了委員會成員
I surveyed the board per your request.

145
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,590
結果呢
And?

146
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,650
六位委員確定
Six of the selectmen will, indeed,

147
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,550
會選擇讓奧登受審
opt to take Alden to trial.

148
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,290
其余五位  念及昔日他的父親
The other five, loyal to the memory of his father,

149
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,590
會投反對票
will vote for dismissal.

150
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,430
還有兩個席位
That leaves two seats.

151
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,970
我會按照你的要求投票
I shall vote as you have asked.

152
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,570
我保證
I assure you.

153
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,530
那就只能由我
So this leaves me,

154
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,550
作為病重丈夫的代表  打破平衡僵局了
as a proxy for my ailing husband, to break the tie.

155
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,620
來  我們把這件事解決了
Come. Let's get this over with.

156
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,660
所有人民
Must we not hold all our citizens,

157
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:31,090
不論貧窮富貴
both commoner and the sons of privilege, 

158
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,150
標準面前無一例外
to the same standard?

159
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,760
如若不忠  必將上頸手枷
When they cheat, must they not be pilloried?

160
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,430
如若偷竊  必將施以鞭刑
When they steal, must they not be whipped?

161
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,390
如若背棄對上帝的承諾
And when they fail to uphold their promise to God and choose,

162
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,710
選擇與惡魔為伍
instead, to take league with the devil,

163
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,490
必將因此受到審判
must they not then be judged by their decision?

164
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,910
謝謝  牧師
Thank you, Reverend.

165
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,160
相信委員會已做好投票準備
I believe the board is ready to vote.

166
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,020
奧登上尉被指控施以巫術
Captain Alden has been accused of the practice of witchcraft.

167
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,610
牧師慷慨同意
The good reverend has graciously agreed

168
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,430
讓委員會決定他是否要接受審判
to allow the board to decide whether he should go to trial.

169
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,960
所以  認為奧登上尉
So, those who believe

170
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,230
應該被當做巫師接受審判的人有誰
that captain Alden should be tried as a witch?

171
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,850
六人同意審判
Six for trial.

172
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,000
那認為奧登上尉
And those who believe

173
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,220
為人正直  此項指控
that captain Alden's distinguished character

174
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,580
毫無根據的有誰
renders such accusations baseless?

175
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,550
五人反對審判
Five for dismissal.

176
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,980
霍爾先生
Mr. Hale?

177
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,730
塞勒姆人民在等待你的投票
Salem awaits your vote.

178
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,800
反對
Dismissal.

179
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,110
六比六
Six to six.

180
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,930
也就是說決定性的一票在我手上
Which means I must break the deadlock.

181
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,220
我投...
And I shall cast my vote --

182
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,110
其實  西布里夫人
Actually, Mrs. Sibley...

183
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,930
你不用投票
Your vote is not required.

184
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,480
你肯定會很高興
You will be pleased to learn

185
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,790
因為喬治的身體狀況大有好轉
that George's health has progressed,

186
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,650
至少已經可以自己行使投票權了
at least to the point where he is able to cast his own vote.

187
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,920
謝謝你  醫生
Thank you, doctor.

188
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,760
牧師  是你說他被巫師控制了
Reverend, you yourself said that he was held in the witch's grip.

189
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,200
可能吧  也可能不是
Perhaps. Perhaps not.

190
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,820
他的身體狀況已在穩步好轉
His condition has steadily improved.

191
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,360
好轉  他都不能說話
Improved? He cannot speak.

192
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,690
動也幾乎不能動
He can barely move.

193
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,310
他就只會  吐痰
All he can do...is spit.

194
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,020
正是
Yes, precisely.

195
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,080
喬治  親愛的老朋友
George, my dear old friend, 

196
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,850
如果你能理解
if you can understand the words

197
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,760
我現在說的話  請吐一口痰
that I am speaking to you, please spit.

198
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,060
簡直荒唐
This is ludicrous.

199
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,720
西布里夫人  其實一點都不荒唐
Actually, Mrs. Sibley, it is anything but.

200
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,750
你丈夫是委員
Your husband is a selectman

201
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,150
他非常想履行自己的公民義務
and he is eager to perform his civic duty.

202
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,750
那好  準備好了
Well, then. Sir?

203
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:26,580
現在  喬治  你告訴我  你覺得
And now, George, tell me -- do you believe that this man,

204
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:30,230
約翰·奧登應不應該接受審判
John Alden, should now stand trial?

205
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,760
同意還是反對
Yea or nay?

206
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,440
如果你表示贊成
If your answer is in the affirmative,

207
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,950
請吐口水
will you please spit?

208
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,900
把他關回牢里
Return him to the jail.

209
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,900
奧登上尉將接受審判
Captain Alden will stand trial

210
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,470
罪名為施用巫術
on the charge of witchcraft.

211
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,120
開門
Open it.

212
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,950
是  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

213
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,870
退下
Now leave us.

214
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,620
是  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

215
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,800
我警告過你
I warned you.

216
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,600
我說過留在塞勒姆  你會死的
I told you that should you stay in Salem, you would die here.

217
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,520
你是來提醒我的嗎
So you came here to remind me? 

218
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,640
還是來送葬
Or to bury me?

219
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,500
我是來道歉的
I came to apologize.

220
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,540
不是為了今天的投票
Not for today's vote,

221
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,460
而且為了我當初的選擇  害你淪落至此
But for the one that I cast that sent you on this course.

222
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,580
要是我接受你的建議去紐約
Had I accepted your offer to go to New York,

223
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,530
遠離這里
far from this place,

224
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:07,330
就不必理會英克里斯·麥哲的投票或是審判了
we would know nothing of votes or trials or Increase Mather.

225
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,330
如果我不去打仗
And if I hadn't gone to war

226
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,870
如果你不嫁給西布里
or you hadn't married Sibley.

227
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,690
我們今天的局面不是單一的選擇造成的
There was no one choice that sent our course awry.

228
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,510
聽我說
Listen to me.

229
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,680
如果你接受審判  他們會絞死你
If you go to trial, they will hang you.

230
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,260
但還有辦法能逃過這一劫
But there is still a way to prevent such a fate.

231
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,720
如果你離開  就無法接受審判了
They cannot try you if you are not here to be tried.

232
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,830
越獄嗎
Escape?

233
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,600
-你打算...  -我會安排好
- Is that what you...  - I will arrange it.

234
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,350
這事不容易  但只要計劃周詳
It won't be easy, but properly planned.

235
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,370
我有手段  人脈任我調遣
I have resources, means at my disposal.

236
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,000
-瑪麗  -資源之廣遠超過你想象
- Mary. - Far more widespread than you might imagine.

237
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,290
瑪麗  不要
Mary, no.

238
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,120
我不走
I won't go.

239
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,800
審判的結局只有上絞刑架
But a trial will result with you in the gallows.

240
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,760
你得知道
You must know this.

241
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,820
我一直不懂吉爾斯·科里為何不抵抗
You know, I always wondered why Giles Corey never fought back,

242
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,180
為何他寧可被逼至死
why he let them press him to death

243
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,210
也不肯認罪
rather than plead to their charges.

244
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,520
現在我懂了
But now I know.

245
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,540
他明白一旦遂了他們的心意就徹底輸了
He knew he lost the moment he played their game,

246
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,780
就會令他們的瘋狂之舉顯得冠冕堂皇
dignified their madness.

247
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,850
所以我不會從我出生的地方逃走
So, no, I won't run, not from my birthplace.

248
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,550
我寧愿死在這里
I'd rather die here.

249
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,320
你或許能如愿以償
And so perhaps you will get your wish.

250
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,740
麥哲牧師
Reverend Mather?

251
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,010
你是霍爾家的小姐
You're the Hale girl.

252
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:05,810
安  先生
Anne, sir.

253
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,950
你是想跟我聊聊
Do you wish to speak to me,

254
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,250
還是只想觀看我用餐
or are you simply content to watch me eat?

255
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,470
我有個問題
I have a question...

256
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,140
關于巫師
of witches.

257
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,810
可不是嘛
Indeed.

258
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,360
你只是好奇  還是遇見巫師了
Are you merely curious or have you encountered one?

259
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,500
安  你在這兒啊
Well... Anne, there you are.

260
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,560
打擾麥哲牧師用餐了
Interrupting Reverend Mather's dinner.

261
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,090
她在詢問有關巫術之事
She was querying me about witchcraft.

262
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,380
是嗎
Was she?

263
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,920
麥哲牧師正準備回答我的問題
Reverend Mather was about to answer my questions

264
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,300
而其他人都不能老實回答我
that others seem unable to answer truthfully.

265
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,450
也許我能提供一些幫助
Well, perhaps I can be of some assistance

266
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,130
好讓牧師安心繼續用餐
so the reverend can finish his meal in peace.

267
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,240
也許  但你會老實回答嗎
Perhaps. But will you speak honestly?

268
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,010
我會的
I will.

269
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,280
我并不介意
Well, it is no matter to me.

270
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,660
治安官  霍爾小姐
Magistrate, Miss Hale.

271
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,590
別再說謊了
No more lies.

272
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,840
不再說謊了
No more lies.

273
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,260
你們有誰玩累了嗎
Have either of you tired of this game?

274
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,060
我向你們保證  我可不累
For I assure you, I have not.

275
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,890
梅西比你聰明得多
Mercy's too smart for you.

276
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,010
我們絕不供出她的下落
We'll never tell you where she is.

277
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,500
你們是這么想的嗎
Is that what you think?

278
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,560
我們在這里
That we're here together

279
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,310
是因為我要你們幫忙找到梅西·路易絲嗎
because I require your help in locating Mercy Lewis?

280
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,820
不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no.

281
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,810
我來這里是出于善舉
I am here as an act of charity.

282
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,600
善舉
Charity?

283
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,540
幫我逮捕她  就能饒你們一命
Aid me in apprehending her and your lives will be spared.

284
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,990
但要是你們負隅頑抗
But if you persist in defying me,

285
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,040
我無從選擇  唯有處死你們
I can offer you no alternative to the stake.

286
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,170
梅西不會讓我們死的
Mercy won't let us die.

287
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,890
她會來救我們
She will come for us.

288
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,620
也許無眠長夜中這種想法能聊以慰藉
Perhaps such a thought comforts you in your sleepless night,

289
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,420
但我向你們保證
But I assure you, 

290
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:16,720
不管你們是否幫忙  我都會找到梅西·路易絲
I will find Mercy Lewis with or without your help.

291
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,560
你來晚了
You're late.

292
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,510
我很抱歉  但我也得小心提防
Well, I'm sorry, my lady, but I have to take precautions

293
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,300
英克里斯還在四處找我
with Increase still searching for me.

294
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,800
你是對的
You're right to.

295
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,060
關于英克里斯  你曾經提出了一個辦法
You offered a solution once for Increase,

296
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,500
被我否決了
one that I dismissed,

297
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,260
也許我當時的反應是錯誤的
but perhaps it was only my response which was misguided.

298
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,260
你是什么意思
So what are you saying?

299
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,610
我是說英克里斯·麥哲必須死
I'm saying that Increase Mather must die.

300
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,390
這件事得我們來做
And we are the ones to do it.

301
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:19,930
殺了他嗎
Kill him?

302
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,080
為什么是現在
But why now?

303
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,540
他的魔爪越伸越長
The shadow he casts grows longer.

304
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,880
而緹圖芭的指控危及到了一個我很在乎的人
And Tituba's accusations jeopardize one that I care for deeply.

305
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,070
約翰·奧登
John Alden?

306
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,500
不
No.

307
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,440
我親愛的梅西
My dear, dear Mercy.

308
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,090
是你
You.

309
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,770
你從一個迷失少女成為惡魔的助手
Your path from lost girl to devil's assistant

310
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,380
這是我也走過的路
is one that I walked, too.

311
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,820
我會保護你  就像保護我自己一樣
I would protect you as I would mine own self.

312
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:58,330
如今緹圖芭靠出賣我們換得釋放
Now, Tituba's released, rewarded for her treachery,

313
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,590
而你卻像個野獸般被追捕著  恐懼著
And you live like an animal, hunted and fearful.

314
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,150
我要怎么做  何時動手
So how will I do it and when?

315
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,020
別急  親愛的
Easy, my dear.

316
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,540
許多巫師曾試圖殺死英克里斯
Many a witch has sought to claim Increase's life

317
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,570
最后卻都丟了他們自己的小命
And lost theirs in the process.

318
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:18,370
我們的計劃必須考慮周全
Our efforts must be planned...carefully.

319
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,300
你一定已經想到辦法了吧
Surely you must have a method in mind.

320
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:20,990
沒錯
Yes.

321
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,750
的確有  把手指給我看看  
I do. Show me your fingers.

322
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,280
手指
My fingers?

323
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,680
應該能行
These will do.

324
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,450
什么能行
For what?

325
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,600
襲擊我
Now strike me.

326
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,680
小姐
My lady?

327
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,690
像對待敵人般撕扯我的血肉
Tear at my flesh as you would your vilest enemy.

328
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,200
不用懷疑你的耳朵和信仰
Do not question your ears nor your faith.

329
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,160
照我說的做
Do as I ask.

330
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,590
你很快就會明白了
And soon you will understand.

331
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,050
八歲時  我親眼看著父母被燒死
I was 8 years old when I watched my parents burn.

332
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,500
火刑是消滅巫師亙古不變的方法
Timeless solution for exterminating witches.

333
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,570
你知道那是什么感覺嗎
Do you know what it's like

334
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,390
眼睜睜看著
To witness the death of those you love

335
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,960
你最愛的人死去
More than anyone else in the world?

336
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,330
我無法想象
I can't imagine.

337
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,400
那能讓你意識到自己的能力
It teaches you what you are capable of.

338
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,920
那種深埋體內  你也許永遠不會察覺的能力
The depths and limits you never knew you had.

339
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,830
然而  即便他們已被挫骨揚灰
And, yet, even as their ashes lingered in the air,

340
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,210
我卻幸免于難
Steps were taken to spare me a similar fate.

341
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,260
我被趕出英格蘭  漂洋過海
So I was whisked from England, sent across the sea,

342
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,400
在瘟疫和鼠疫中幸存下來
surviving plague and pestilence,

343
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,000
來到了這個新世界
to the new world.

344
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,110
我被忠誠的巫師信徒收養
I was taken in by those loyal to the cause

345
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,520
他們養育我長大  并教會我兩件事
who raised me with a twin mission...

346
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,970
一是如何發掘出自身的能力
Teach me to harness the power of who I was

347
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,960
同時隱藏這種能力不被世人所知
And yet to keep it hidden from the world.

348
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,660
后來  我有了自己的家庭
And then I was raising a family of my own

349
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,210
深知我最珍愛的兩個人
knowing that those I held most precious

350
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,930
恰恰被我自己所危及著
live in every bit the jeopardy that I do.

351
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,180
我是巫師嗎
Am I a witch?

352
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,460
是
Yes.

353
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,380
但那會減少絲毫我對你的父愛嗎
But does that make me any less of a loving father?

354
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,490
不會
No.

355
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,260
絕對不會
Most certainly not.

356
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,740
進來
Enter.

357
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,900
您一召喚我就來了
I came as soon as you summoned me.

358
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,770
您好像不太高興
I suspect you're not pleased.

359
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,490
怎么回事  西布里夫人
What happened, Mrs. Sibley?

360
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,460
哦  這個啊
Oh, uh, this.

361
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,410
我還一直在自欺欺人
And here my own vanity convinced me 

362
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,950
以為不會有人注意到呢
it was hardly noticeable.

363
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,480
陪我喝杯茶吧
Join me in tea, 

364
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,830
讓我跟你講講我的悲慘遭遇
and I will tell you my sad tale.

365
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,400
我去了樹林
I went to the woods, 

366
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:27,320
想整理一下思緒  最近的麻煩太多了
hoping to clear my mind after recent troubling events.

367
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:28,760
要糖嗎
Sugar?

368
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,460
不用  謝謝
No, thank you.

369
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,240
我沉浸在自己的世界里  沒注意到她
Lost in my own thoughts, I scarcely noticed her.

370
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,640
喝吧  艾薩克  
Drink, Isaac.

371
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,590
直到她撲到了我身上
Until she was upon me.

372
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,400
誰
Who?

373
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,950
梅西·路易絲
Mercy Lewis, 

374
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,870
她沒有因為我曾經收留過她
who greeted me not with kindness

375
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,440
而心懷感恩
for once taking her in...

376
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,100
卻向我回報以暴力和憤怒
But with violence and anger.

377
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,700
緹圖芭被指控  她認為我難逃其咎
She finds me guilty for Tituba's accusations.

378
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,870
仿佛我還得對自己女仆的想法負責似的
as if I'm responsible for my servant's mind.

379
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,020
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley?

380
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,120
怎么  艾薩克
Yes, Isaac?

381
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,480
這茶
The tea.

382
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,710
怎么了
What about it?

383
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,290
讓你周身發熱了嗎  還是覺得很困
Is it making you warm or just sleepy?

384
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,200
都有
Both.

385
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,680
很好  那說明有用了
Good. Then it's working.

386
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,420
我不介意告訴你實話
I don't mind telling you this

387
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,980
因為等你醒了就什么都不記得了
Because when you wake, you'll remember nothing.

388
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,310
不過我確實抱歉要這樣利用你
Although I do regret using you like this.

389
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,730
即便在塞勒姆  也還有像你這樣的好人
Even in Salem, there are those who deserve better.

390
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,610
但英克里斯深知你膽小本分
But Increase knows that you're far too scared and guileless

391
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,030
不可能再次騙他
to betray him again.

392
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,250
他會相信你的話
He will take your words as fact.

393
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,110
我的話
Words?

394
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,460
你聽說梅西在附近出沒
That hearing that Mercy lurked nearby,

395
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,160
于是去樹林里找她
you sought her in the woods.

396
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,040
但她動作太快  被她逃脫了
But she was too quick, and she evaded you.

397
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,410
英克里斯會仔細分析你每一句話
Increase will parse your words

398
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,830
直到他相信你說的是實話
until he is convinced they are truth.

399
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,360
跟我重復一遍  艾薩克
So repeat after me, Isaac.

400
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,450
"我去叢林里"
"I went to the woods..."

401
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,760
"我去叢林里"
I went to the woods...

402
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,690
"為了找梅西·路易絲"
"...to find Mercy Lewis."

403
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,350
"為了找梅西·路易絲"
...to find Mercy Lewis.

404
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:54,560
"穿過小河  在低垂的樹枝旁  我發現了她"
"Past the lake, beside the weeping tree, I spied her."

405
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,450
"穿過小河  在低垂的樹枝旁  我發現了她"
Past the lake, beside the weeping tree, I spied her.

406
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,010
很好  再說一遍
Very good. Again.

407
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,390
我們真的了解自己身邊的人嗎
Can we ever truly know our neighbor,

408
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,400
相信他們就是看上去的那樣
trust that they are whom they seem to be,

409
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,040
那些他們想讓我們相信的形象
who they would have us believe them to be?

410
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,160
有人說某個年輕女子  小姑娘
We are told that a young woman, a girl,

411
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,370
被當做巫師的工具  不料卻發現她
really was a tool of the witches only to find that she is,

412
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,410
實際上就是巫師本人
in fact, a witch herself.

413
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:25,900
如今  塞勒姆先驅者之子也被控以同樣罪名
And now Salem's first son stands likewise accused.

414
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,680
看看周圍
Look around.

415
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,470
看看你的左右
Look to either side.

416
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,710
看看你身旁的人
Look to your neighbor.

417
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,940
捫心自問
And ask yourself, 

418
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,640
他們是朋友還是男巫
"Friend or sorcerer? 

419
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,990
是妻子還是女巫
Wife or witch?"

420
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,380
是上帝還是魔鬼
God or devil!

421
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:49,740
誰說的  出來
Who said that? Show yourself.

422
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,780
是我兒子啊
It is my son.

423
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,960
不用理睬他
Pay him no mind.

424
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,070
別用你們的寬容放縱他
Do not reward him with your indulgence.

425
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:08,010
你以上帝之名問著
You question who the people of Salem are 

426
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,580
塞勒姆的民眾都是誰
in the name of god.

427
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,070
然后呢
Yes?

428
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,100
但是塞勒姆的民眾該不該也問問你是誰
But should the people of Salem not question who you are?

429
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,950
因為魔鬼也會反其道而行
For how else would the devil appear...

430
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,750
以上帝之名出現
but in the cloak of the lord?

431
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,180
出去
Get out.

432
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,530
你喝醉了
You are drunk!

433
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,190
你的大喊大叫只會給自己蒙羞
Your rantings only serve to embarrass yourself.

434
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,370
現在出去
Remove yourself now.

435
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:44,850
還不走
You will not?

436
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,080
我親自送你走
I will remove you myself!

437
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,190
指認自己的父親
Point the finger at her own father?

438
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,290
她絕不會的
She would never.

439
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,050
你肯定嗎
Are you certain of that?

440
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,570
昨晚我才發現她和英克里斯在一起呢
Wasn't it just last night that I found her with Increase?

441
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,860
她沒有這個企圖
She had no intention.

442
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,850
就是裝裝樣子
She was simply acting out.

443
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,670
塞勒姆有一堆裝腔作勢的人
Salem is filled with those who act out --

444
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,060
朋友裝成敵人
friends who act like enemies, 

445
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,100
敵人裝成判決者
enemies who act as executioners.

446
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,070
這些對她來說都太陌生
This is all new to her.

447
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:30,230
放心吧  她會慢慢接受的
Trust that, in time, she will accept it.

448
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,950
是啊  但要是沒接受  又怎么辦
Yes, and if not, what then?

449
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,850
那就是時候告訴她剩下的故事了
Then it may be time to tell her the rest of the story.

450
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,490
恐怕現在已經是時候了
I'm afraid that time has already come.

451
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,830
你的故事很是引人入勝
Your story is really quite fantastic.

452
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:49,390
瑪麗·西布里被梅西·路易絲攻擊了
Mary Sibley attacked by Mercy Lewis.

453
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,270
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

454
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,250
出于對瑪麗的忠誠
And out of loyalty to Mary,

455
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,690
你追蹤那個姑娘進了叢林
you followed the girl into the woods.

456
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:56,820
對瑪麗的忠誠
Loyalty to Mary?

457
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,810
不是的  先生  是對您的忠誠
No, sir. Loyalty to you.

458
00:26:58,810 --> 00:26:59,630
對我
Me?

459
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,590
您不是急著想找那個姑娘嗎
Are you not eager to find the girl?

460
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:03,900
您不是告訴我
Did you not tell me

461
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,410
要替您眼觀四路耳聽八方嗎
to keep my eyes and ears open on your behalf?

462
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,700
所以當我得知她出沒在叢林邊緣時
So when I learned she lurked at the wood's edge,

463
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,460
我就遵照您的意圖去尋找她了
I sought her out, as I knew you would have wanted.

464
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,470
這叫刺撓
This is called a cilice.

465
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,700
我穿著它來時刻提醒自己所犯下的罪惡
I wear this to remind myself of my own failing.

466
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,210
你是否很驚訝  艾薩克
Does it surprise you, Isaac,

467
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:35,270
當你聽到即使是我也身負罪惡
to learn that even I have sins I must atone for?

468
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,090
你犯過罪嗎
Have you ever sinned?

469
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,890
有也不是故意的  先生
Not intentionally, sir.

470
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,600
你現在在犯罪嗎
Are you sinning now?

471
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,540
你是否在騙我
Are you lying to me?

472
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,810
我說的是實話  牧師
I speak the truth, reverend.

473
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,670
我看見她了  但是沒法抓住她
I saw her, but could not catch her.

474
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,320
你還記得最后一次看見梅西是在哪兒嗎
And can you recall where it was you last laid eyes on Mercy?

475
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:58,230
穿過小河  在低垂的樹枝旁  我發現了她
Past the lake, beside the weeping tree, I spied her.

476
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,380
你能帶我去那兒嗎
And you could -- you could lead me there?

477
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,840
是的  當然了  先生
Yes, of course, sir.

478
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:04,730
那么
Well, then. 

479
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,590
收拾一下吧  小伙子
prepare yourself, my boy.

480
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,070
我們兩個
For you and I... 

481
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,930
要去獵捕巫師了
are going witch hunting.

482
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,570
霍爾小姐
Miss Hale.

483
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,360
是不是打擾到你了  牧師
Am I intruding, reverend?

484
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,620
我正準備享用我的下午"茶"
Well, I was just about to enjoy my late-afternoon drink.

485
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,220
可別把這跟我的晚"茶"弄混了
Not to be confused, of course, with my early-evening drink,

486
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,630
不過也差不多是時候了
which I anticipate taking place shortly, as well.

487
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,960
你也來一杯嗎
Perhaps?

488
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,630
不用  謝謝  我不能久留
Oh, no, thank you. I can not stay.

489
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,120
我只是來說一聲  我很抱歉
I simply came to say... I'm sorry.

490
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,880
為了什么
For?

491
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,920
所有事
Everything.

492
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,980
我沒有好好對待你
I have not treated you well... 

493
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,570
也不完全公平
nor entirely fairly.

494
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,250
所以說我父親的所為讓你覺得我很可憐  是嗎
So my father has earned me your pity. Is that right?

495
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,070
不
No.

496
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,320
我只是看到了我們的相似之處
I simply see that we are alike.

497
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,700
都有一個心機深沉的父親
Both children of complicated men.

498
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,960
霍爾治安官  心機深沉嗎
Magistrate Hale, complicated?

499
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,730
說實話  我總覺得他就是個
In truth, he's always seemed a bit of a...

500
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,790
單純的白癡
a simpleton to me.

501
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,020
不  我向你保證
No, I assure you.

502
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,080
他和塞勒姆中的人一樣充滿心機
He is as complex as any man in Salem.

503
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:52,040
聽說你對巫師頗有研究啊
You have made quite a study of them -- witches.

504
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,210
即便如此  我仍覺得自己對他們一無所知
For all my studies, I'm not sure I truly know a thing.

505
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,580
我可不這么認為
Oh, I doubt that.

506
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,730
你一定能告訴我許多關于他們的事情
I'm sure you could tell me all about them.

507
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,540
我還不知道你也相信巫師的存在
I did not know you even believed in witches.

508
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,740
我改變了想法
I've had a change of heart.

509
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,070
為什么呢
And why is that?

510
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,620
也許是我一直都對其有興趣
Perhaps it is an interest I've lived with my entire life,

511
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,960
但是直到最近才發現
but wasn't aware of until recently.

512
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,370
好吧
Well, um...

513
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,440
如果你有時間  就請坐吧
If you have a moment, please sit,

514
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,170
我會告訴你關于巫師的一切
and I will tell you all about witches.

515
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,900
就是這  牧師
It's here, reverend.

516
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,890
你確定嗎
You're sure?

517
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,740
這就是那條通往她藏身之處的小路
It was the trail I took that led me to her.

518
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,400
小心點  先生
Careful, sir.

519
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,570
我們得提防她的突然襲擊
We do not know when she could strike.

520
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,080
告訴我  你真的獨自一人
Tell me, did you really travel 

521
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,090
走進叢林深處
this deep into the woods alone

522
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,360
只為了找到那個女孩嗎
to find the girl?

523
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,650
為了你  先生
For you, sir.

524
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,570
為了我
For me?

525
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,480
我很感動
I'm touched.

526
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,070
但我卻仍然無法相信你
I'm also extremely skeptical.

527
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,280
牧師
Reverend?

528
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,800
你到底有何意圖
What is your plan?

529
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,570
意圖
Plan?

530
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,260
引我來此  好對我下手嗎
To lure me? To kill me?

531
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:25,420
不  我為什么要這么做
No. Why would I? How?

532
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,420
或者說
Or perhaps 

533
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,990
或者你別無選擇
perhaps you did not have a choice.

534
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,060
告訴我  你在為誰賣命
Tell me, whose bidding is it that you do?

535
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,950
是約翰·奧登想讓我死嗎
Is it John Alden who wants me dead?

536
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,440
還是瑪麗·西布里
Or Mary Sibley?

537
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,560
又或者他倆同流合污
Or do they work in concert? 

538
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,700
馬上告訴我  不然我就順脖一刀
Tell me now or I'll slide this blade along your throat

539
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,270
在我擦血入鞘之前你就會早已死透
and you'll be dead before I clean and sheath it.

540
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:49,390
牧師  我發誓這么做都是為了您
Reverend, I promise you I'm here on your behalf

541
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,650
絕無二心
and yours alone.

542
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,480
先生
Sir!

543
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,560
追上她  快去
After her! Go on!

544
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,570
你曾親眼見過她們
You've seen one?

545
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,980
我是說  一個女巫
A witch, I mean?

546
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,020
是的
I have.

547
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,930
這惡毒的老怪物多年來一直未被人識破
A vile creature who walked undetected for years

548
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,020
幸好最終  她終究暴露了本性
until finally her true nature was revealed.

549
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,890
就是說她們藏在我們之中嗎
So they hide amongst us?

550
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,920
這想法改變的真徹底
This change of heart is remarkable.

551
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,650
真不懂為什么我花了這么久才明白
Remarkable that it took so long.

552
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,570
生活在塞勒姆卻不相信有巫師
Living in Salem and not believing in witches

553
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,230
就如同生活在倫敦卻不相信有大霧一般
is like living in london and not believing in fog.

554
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,080
我居然傻到去否認擺在眼前的事實
It is to deny what is right in front of you.

555
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,360
你父親怎么看待你這種轉變
And what does your father think of your conversion?

556
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,440
我父親
My father...

557
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,180
他正是
above all is...

558
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,830
轉變我看法的原因
responsible for it.

559
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,460
或許他真如你說的一樣心機深沉
Perhaps he's as complicated as you say.

560
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,270
但是我父親沒有說明的是
But what my father did not answer is...

561
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,470
巫師們想要什么
what do witches want?

562
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,550
有人說他們只想與我們和平共處
Some say they want only to live in peace.

563
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,960
其他人  譬如我父親
Others, like my father, 

564
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,350
說他們的目的只有一個
say that they desire nothing less 

565
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,650
那就是將人類徹底滅絕
than the destruction of all mankind.

566
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,530
如果你父親是正確的呢
And is your father correct?

567
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,340
我父親大多數時候都是正確的
My father's correct in most matters.

568
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,970
他對你的看法也是正確的嗎
Is he correct about you?

569
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,360
我父親認為我是個廢物
My father thinks I'm a failure.

570
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:22,270
因為我既不虔誠  還終日酗酒
Since I have failed at both piety and sobriety.

571
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,310
沒錯
Yes.

572
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,540
我想這兩點大家都有目共睹
The evidence supports his case.

573
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,170
他錯了
He's wrong.

574
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,250
如今我的失敗又加上了一件
Another failure to add to my list.

575
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:58,250
你唯一的失敗就是沒有成為你的父親
Your only failure is not becoming your father.

576
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,720
而那根本不算失敗
And that is no failure.

577
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,240
[咒語]
Terra sunt carnes et ossa.

578
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,230
[咒語]
Domini est terra et ossa.

579
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,790
[咒語]
Terra sunt carnes et ossa.

580
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,530
[咒語]
Domini est terra et ossa.

581
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,920
我沒看到她
I do not see her.

582
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,120
不用擔心  她會回來的
Fear not. She will return.

583
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,590
要不她還怎么殺掉我呢
For how else can she attempt to kill me?

584
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,660
[咒語]
Domini est terra et ossa.

585
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,810
撒旦是個強大的敵人
Satan is a formidable enemy

586
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,930
不是因為他的邪惡  而是因為他很狡猾
not because he's evil, but because he is sly.

587
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,100
我們倆是老相識了
Oh, we know each other well.

588
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:05,260
[咒語]
Et nos unum benedictus.

589
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,350
牧師
Reverend?

590
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,870
先生
Sir?

591
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,200
先生  麥哲牧師
Sir? Reverend Mather?

592
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,160
在找我嗎  牧師
Looking for me, reverend?

593
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,470
我會將你抓回塞勒姆
You will return with me to Salem,

594
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:45,290
你會受到審判的  巫師
and you will stand trial, witch.

595
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,690
我可不這么認為
I don't think so.

596
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,890
難道你真的以為
Did you think it would only take 

597
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,050
僅憑一把小刀便能殺了我嗎  牧師
one knife to kill me, reverend?

598
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,090
快追上去
After her!

599
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,570
艾薩克  別讓她跑了
Isaac, don't let her get away!

600
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,610
艾薩克
Isaac!

601
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,870
梅西的武器
Mercy's weapon.

602
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,450
可憐的孩子
Oh, my poor boy.

603
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,020
別用力呼吸
Breathe shallow.

604
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,410
有我陪著你
You are not alone.

605
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,380
什么事
Yes? 

606
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,260
麥哲牧師讓您去他那一趟
Reverend Mather has requested you in his quarters.

607
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,180
柯頓嗎
Cotton?

608
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,070
不  夫人
Uh, no, ma'am.

609
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,100
是英克里斯
Increase.

610
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,380
西布里夫人
Mrs. Sibley, 

611
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:43,970
這邊請
this way.

612
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,060
能讓我單獨跟他待一陣嗎
May I have a moment with him?

613
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,250
艾薩克
Isaac.

614
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,940
親愛的艾薩克
Oh, sweet isaac.

615
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,330
我從未想過你會因此而受傷
I never intended for you to meet this fate.

616
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,040
我向你保證
So I promise you --

617
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,890
盡管塞勒姆即將迎來腥風血雨
though a grim future awaits the people of Salem --

618
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,470
但我不會讓你再受到任何傷害
I will protect you from any further pain.

619
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,980
我向你保證
I swear to you.

620
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,700
我們出去吧
Come now.

621
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,730
他需要休息
He needs his rest.

622
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,740
牧師  我不明白
Reverend, I am at a loss.

623
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:57,190
為什么艾薩克會獨自一人去尋找梅西
why Isaac would take it upon himself to seek out mercy...

624
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,550
我也問了他同樣的問題
I asked him the same question.

625
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,710
他怎么說
And what did he say?

626
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:09,890
他說是為了我
He said he did it on my behalf, 

627
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,250
但我卻無法相信
which I find very odd

628
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,150
因為我很清楚  他十分憎恨我
when you consider the fact that he detests me.

629
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,760
憎恨您
Detests you?

630
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,880
不  艾薩克不會恨任何人
No. No, isaac hates no one.

631
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,380
他做不到
He is incapable of it.

632
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,360
那至少你應該同意
Well, at least you will agree his mind is...

633
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,790
他就像個小孩
childlike.

634
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,100
正因如此
And, like a child,

635
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,870
他會聽從別人的意識和想法
he absorbs the thoughts and the intents of others.

636
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,170
什么別人
What others?

637
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,500
那些真正恨我的
Someone who does hate me...

638
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:47,080
想我死的人
and desires me...dead.

639
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,380
還有一件事  牧師
And one other matter, reverend --

640
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:03,150
我對約翰·奧登是巫師一事仍心存懷疑
I remain skeptical that John Alden is a witch.

641
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,950
如果不是奧登
Ah, if not Alden, 

642
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,670
那告訴我  到底是誰
tell me who, then, is responsible

643
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,270
導致了塞勒姆發生的一切
for what has transpired in Salem?

644
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,860
很可惜  我不知道
Regrettably, I do not know.

645
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,170
或許我們可以一起祈禱
Well, perhaps we can hope together

646
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,090
那個真正有罪的人能站出來
that the truly guilty party will step forward

647
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,930
洗脫上尉的罪名
and...exonerate the good captain.

648
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,140
你覺得這有可能嗎  瑪麗
Do you think that's a possibility, Mary?

649
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,380
這里是塞勒姆
This is Salem.

650
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,950
凡事皆有可能
I think there are no limits to what is possible.

651
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:24,070
你又是來沖我發脾氣的嗎
Am I to expect another outburst?

652
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,160
不
No. 

653
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,490
我已經幾個小時沒沾酒了
I've not had a drink for hours.

654
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:32,800
真不敢相信你居然認為這也算進步
Amazing what one comes to accept as a sign of progress.

655
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,710
你這個時候來做什么
Why have you come at this hour?

656
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,200
我一直在考慮您的提議
I've been contemplating your offer.

657
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,430
參與奧登上尉的審判
To join you in the prosecution of captain Alden.

658
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:46,370
你終于想清楚我說的好處了
And you have seen the wisdom in it?

659
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,060
我確實明白了
I have seen wisdom...

660
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,080
但不是您說的那些
But not yours.

661
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,080
我決定為奧登上尉辯護
I've decided to defend captain Alden.

662
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,310
為他辯護
To defend?

663
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,830
你知道我有多驕傲嗎
Oh, imagine how proud I am to have...

664
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:07,470
看著我親手養育的兒子
raised a son so steadfast in his ability

665
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:10,810
總是如此堅定地做出錯誤的決定
to consistently make the wrong decision.

666
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,170
安
Anne.

667
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,090
明天再說吧  父親  我該睡了
Please, father, it's far past my bedtime.

668
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,670
我只要一小會
I only require a moment.

669
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,640
有些事我一直沒有告訴你
Something I neglected to tell you before...

670
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,870
是關于那個面具的
regarding that mask.

671
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,510
這事能晚點再說嗎
Truly, can this wait?

672
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,360
不能再等了
It has waited long enough.

673
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,360
是這樣的
And it is this 

674
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,770
那個面具的能力
that the power of that mask

675
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:53,470
只能被一種人所激活
can only be accessed by those of one kind.

676
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,080
哪種人
And what kind is that?

677
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,730
跟我一樣的人
My kind.

678
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,670
但我激活了...
But it worked when I...

679
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,330
你是說我是...
are you saying that I am...

680
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,020
跟我一樣
like me.

681
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,940
是個巫師
A witch.

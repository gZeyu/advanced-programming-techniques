14
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,940
Previously on Salem.

15
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,040
This whore is hereby banished.

16
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,120
I am sorry about your girl.

17
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,880
He is rendered incapable of speech.

18
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,060
She held a spider to her neck.

19
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,050
She seemed to feed it.

20
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,610
You have but to tell me a name.

21
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,710
And she started with Mercy Lewis.

22
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,480
Mercy?

23
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,960
I will have her and her girls.

24
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,000
She's not here. She went out this afternoon.

25
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,250
She's not returned.

26
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,500
You can imagine my shock

27
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,310
to discover that John Alden

28
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,900
stands behind all of Salem's horror.

29
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,960
I place you under arrest for witchcraft.

30
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,440
There was a time I wished you my own son.

31
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,620
Then you know I'm no witch.

32
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,930
Sadly, captain...

33
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,780
I do not know you at all anymore.

34
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,810
Do you truly belive him guilty?

35
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,330
Whatever I believe of John Alden is not at issue here.

36
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,650
This is why we have a trial.

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,560
A trial of John Alden.

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,100
Does this surprise you?

39
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,720
Your own servant's accusations were firm and... and very clear.

40
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,610
Unless...

41
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,500
Unless, of course,

42
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,060
perhaps your own feelings cloud your judgment?

43
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,370
Any feelings I once had for John Alden were extinguished

44
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,110
once I gave my heart to George.

45
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,340
But it is not my feelings that concern me.

46
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,350
Then whose?

47
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,430
Salem's.

48
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,640
John Alden is a firebrand, but he is adored by the commoners.

49
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,430
I've already heard their whispers of dismay.

50
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,550
Tell me...are you suggesting that I not bring Alden to trial?

51
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,580
No.

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,590
I am suggesting you do not fight this battle alone.

53
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,180
Allow the select board to decide whether a trial is warranted.

54
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,940
With their backing... and I assure you, you have it fully...

55
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,930
you will quell any dissent.

56
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,420
And are you confident

57
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,270
that the board will vote to bring Alden to trial?

58
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,190
As sure as I stand before you.

59
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,380
Yes.

60
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,440
I shall summon the board at once. Thank you.

61
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,290
Oh, and, reverend?

62
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,770
Any luck in finding Mercy Lewis?

63
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,070
She, too, must face her day of reckoning.

64
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,990
Not yet.

65
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,770
But I'm a patient man.

66
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,690
And a witch can't hide forever.

67
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,110
*Pound me the witch drums*

68
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,200
*Witch drums*

69
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,680
*Pound me the witch drums*

70
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,080
*Pound me the witch drums*

71
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,190
*The witch drums*

72
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,740
*Better pray for hell*

73
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:08,760
*Not hallelujah*

74
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,290
What is it?

75
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:29,800
Tell me.

76
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,910
And why you felt the need to detroy it.

77
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,600
Tell you?

78
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,720
Was it not you who just told me

79
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,130
that it was a magical transporting mask?

80
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,320
Did I get that right?

81
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,350
Don't you dare mock me.

82
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,430
I've afforded you the privacy to explain.

83
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,180
Which I have done many times.

84
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,200
It is an artifact of my travels.

85
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,110
Stop.

86
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,960
No more lies. I simply want the truth.

87
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,810
The truth of the mask?

88
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,160
The truth of you.

89
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,020
Of who and what you are.

90
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,350
Fine.

91
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,390
Perhaps there is someone who is not yet tired of my questions,

92
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,200
someone with knowledge of other worlds

93
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,840
who isn't afraid to share it.

94
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,790
Increase Mather.

95
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,300
What on earth would you want to bother him

96
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,400
with this nonsense for?

97
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,360
Nonsense?

98
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,480
Why don't we see if Increase regards this as nonsense?

99
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,880
For I do not believe he will.

100
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,700
Anne.

101
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,700
Anne!

102
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,720
Do you know why I came back to Salem?

103
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,850
Lovely.

104
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,180
More questions I can answer to your dissatisfaction.

105
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,940
Not only to hunt witches, 

106
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,370
but to make a man of my son.

107
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,150
You found some witches?

108
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,910
So your trip is not a total loss.

109
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,170
Do you really not see the path that I've set you on?

110
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,250
The whore is gone.

111
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,360
A rare opportunity awaits you now

112
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,730
to announce yourself before the entire province.

113
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,960
And what is that?

114
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,760
Tomorrow I shall bring John Alden's case before the board.

115
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,210
Cotton, you are a persuasive... nay, a gifted speaker.

116
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,090
I want you there by my side.

117
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,130
I will not.

118
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,230
John Alden is my friend, perhaps my only one.

119
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,260
And you would allow friendship

120
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,280
to stand in the way of your own elevation?

121
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,510
He is innocent.

122
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,720
And you know it.

123
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,490
Do I?

124
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,680
Do you?

125
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,030
A man shares your whiskey and suddenly you can...

126
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,190
you can see into his very soul

127
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,280
and attest that it has not been blackened by the devil.

128
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,370
I, myself, possess no such omniscience.

129
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,250
You know, long ago, I faced the same dilemma as you.

130
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,820
It was state the case against a fellow student, a classmate,

131
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,430
a young man I... I quite liked

132
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,640
or remain silent and allow an accused witch to walk free.

133
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,140
And let me guess.

134
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,230
You watched him burn.

135
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:21,780
No.

136
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,270
I let my feelings intercede, and the young man was freed.

137
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,760
And two years later,

138
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,490
he slit the throats of two virgins in a satanic ritual.

139
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,280
My mistake.

140
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,880
And it has haunted me ever since.

141
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,360
So consider carefully your decision.

142
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,620
You know me well.

143
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,060
Just how well do you know John Alden?

144
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,580
I surveyed the board per your request.

145
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,590
And?

146
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,650
Six of the selectmen will, indeed,

147
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,550
opt to take Alden to trial.

148
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,290
The other five, loyal to the memory of his father,

149
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,590
will vote for dismissal.

150
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,430
That leaves two seats.

151
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,970
I shall vote as you have asked.

152
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,570
I assure you.

153
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,530
So this leaves me,

154
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,550
as a proxy for my ailing husband, to break the tie.

155
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,620
Come. Let's get this over with.

156
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,660
Must we not hold all our citizens,

157
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:31,090
both commoner and the sons of privilege, 

158
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,150
to the same standard?

159
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,760
When they cheat, must they not be pilloried?

160
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,430
When they steal, must they not be whipped?

161
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,390
And when they fail to uphold their promise to God and choose,

162
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,710
instead, to take league with the devil,

163
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,490
must they not then be judged by their decision?

164
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,910
Thank you, Reverend.

165
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,160
I believe the board is ready to vote.

166
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,020
Captain Alden has been accused of the practice of witchcraft.

167
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,610
The good reverend has graciously agreed

168
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,430
to allow the board to decide whether he should go to trial.

169
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,960
So, those who believe

170
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,230
that captain Alden should be tried as a witch?

171
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,850
Six for trial.

172
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,000
And those who believe

173
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,220
that captain Alden's distinguished character

174
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,580
renders such accusations baseless?

175
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,550
Five for dismissal.

176
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,980
Mr. Hale?

177
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,730
Salem awaits your vote.

178
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,800
Dismissal.

179
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,110
Six to six.

180
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,930
Which means I must break the deadlock.

181
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,220
And I shall cast my vote --

182
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,110
Actually, Mrs. Sibley...

183
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,930
Your vote is not required.

184
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,480
You will be pleased to learn

185
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,790
that George's health has progressed,

186
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,650
at least to the point where he is able to cast his own vote.

187
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,920
Thank you, doctor.

188
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,760
Reverend, you yourself said that he was held in the witch's grip.

189
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,200
Perhaps. Perhaps not.

190
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,820
His condition has steadily improved.

191
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,360
Improved? He cannot speak.

192
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,690
He can barely move.

193
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,310
All he can do...is spit.

194
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,020
Yes, precisely.

195
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,080
George, my dear old friend, 

196
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,850
if you can understand the words

197
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,760
that I am speaking to you, please spit.

198
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,060
This is ludicrous.

199
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,720
Actually, Mrs. Sibley, it is anything but.

200
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,750
Your husband is a selectman

201
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,150
and he is eager to perform his civic duty.

202
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,750
Well, then. Sir?

203
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:26,580
And now, George, tell me -- do you believe that this man,

204
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:30,230
John Alden, should now stand trial?

205
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,760
Yea or nay?

206
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,440
If your answer is in the affirmative,

207
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,950
will you please spit?

208
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,900
Return him to the jail.

209
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,900
Captain Alden will stand trial

210
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,470
on the charge of witchcraft.

211
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,120
Open it.

212
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,950
Yes, ma'am.

213
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,870
Now leave us.

214
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,620
Yes, ma'am.

215
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,800
I warned you.

216
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,600
I told you that should you stay in Salem, you would die here.

217
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,520
So you came here to remind me? 

218
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,640
Or to bury me?

219
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,500
I came to apologize.

220
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,540
Not for today's vote,

221
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,460
But for the one that I cast that sent you on this course.

222
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,580
Had I accepted your offer to go to New York,

223
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,530
far from this place,

224
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:07,330
we would know nothing of votes or trials or Increase Mather.

225
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,330
And if I hadn't gone to war

226
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,870
or you hadn't married Sibley.

227
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,690
There was no one choice that sent our course awry.

228
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,510
Listen to me.

229
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,680
If you go to trial, they will hang you.

230
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,260
But there is still a way to prevent such a fate.

231
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,720
They cannot try you if you are not here to be tried.

232
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,830
Escape?

233
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,600
- Is that what you...  - I will arrange it.

234
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,350
It won't be easy, but properly planned.

235
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,370
I have resources, means at my disposal.

236
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,000
- Mary. - Far more widespread than you might imagine.

237
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,290
Mary, no.

238
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,120
I won't go.

239
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,800
But a trial will result with you in the gallows.

240
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,760
You must know this.

241
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,820
You know, I always wondered why Giles Corey never fought back,

242
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,180
why he let them press him to death

243
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,210
rather than plead to their charges.

244
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,520
But now I know.

245
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,540
He knew he lost the moment he played their game,

246
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,780
dignified their madness.

247
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,850
So, no, I won't run, not from my birthplace.

248
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,550
I'd rather die here.

249
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,320
And so perhaps you will get your wish.

250
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,740
Reverend Mather?

251
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,010
You're the Hale girl.

252
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:05,810
Anne, sir.

253
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,950
Do you wish to speak to me,

254
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,250
or are you simply content to watch me eat?

255
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,470
I have a question...

256
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,140
of witches.

257
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,810
Indeed.

258
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,360
Are you merely curious or have you encountered one?

259
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,500
Well... Anne, there you are.

260
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,560
Interrupting Reverend Mather's dinner.

261
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,090
She was querying me about witchcraft.

262
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,380
Was she?

263
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,920
Reverend Mather was about to answer my questions

264
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,300
that others seem unable to answer truthfully.

265
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,450
Well, perhaps I can be of some assistance

266
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,130
so the reverend can finish his meal in peace.

267
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,240
Perhaps. But will you speak honestly?

268
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,010
I will.

269
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,280
Well, it is no matter to me.

270
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,660
Magistrate, Miss Hale.

271
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,590
No more lies.

272
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,840
No more lies.

273
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,260
Have either of you tired of this game?

274
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,060
For I assure you, I have not.

275
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,890
Mercy's too smart for you.

276
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,010
We'll never tell you where she is.

277
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,500
Is that what you think?

278
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,560
That we're here together

279
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,310
because I require your help in locating Mercy Lewis?

280
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,820
No, no, no, no, no, no.

281
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,810
I am here as an act of charity.

282
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,600
Charity?

283
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,540
Aid me in apprehending her and your lives will be spared.

284
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,990
But if you persist in defying me,

285
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,040
I can offer you no alternative to the stake.

286
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,170
Mercy won't let us die.

287
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,890
She will come for us.

288
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,620
Perhaps such a thought comforts you in your sleepless night,

289
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,420
But I assure you, 

290
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:16,720
I will find Mercy Lewis with or without your help.

291
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,560
You're late.

292
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,510
Well, I'm sorry, my lady, but I have to take precautions

293
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,300
with Increase still searching for me.

294
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,800
You're right to.

295
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,060
You offered a solution once for Increase,

296
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,500
one that I dismissed,

297
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,260
but perhaps it was only my response which was misguided.

298
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,260
So what are you saying?

299
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,610
I'm saying that Increase Mather must die.

300
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,390
And we are the ones to do it.

301
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:19,930
Kill him?

302
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,080
But why now?

303
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,540
The shadow he casts grows longer.

304
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,880
And Tituba's accusations jeopardize one that I care for deeply.

305
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,070
John Alden?

306
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,500
No.

307
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,440
My dear, dear Mercy.

308
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,090
You.

309
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,770
Your path from lost girl to devil's assistant

310
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,380
is one that I walked, too.

311
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,820
I would protect you as I would mine own self.

312
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:58,330
Now, Tituba's released, rewarded for her treachery,

313
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,590
And you live like an animal, hunted and fearful.

314
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,150
So how will I do it and when?

315
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,020
Easy, my dear.

316
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,540
Many a witch has sought to claim Increase's life

317
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,570
And lost theirs in the process.

318
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:18,370
Our efforts must be planned...carefully.

319
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,300
Surely you must have a method in mind.

320
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:20,990
Yes.

321
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,750
I do. Show me your fingers.

322
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,280
My fingers?

323
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,680
These will do.

324
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,450
For what?

325
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,600
Now strike me.

326
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,680
My lady?

327
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,690
Tear at my flesh as you would your vilest enemy.

328
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,200
Do not question your ears nor your faith.

329
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,160
Do as I ask.

330
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,590
And soon you will understand.

331
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,050
I was 8 years old when I watched my parents burn.

332
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,500
Timeless solution for exterminating witches.

333
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,570
Do you know what it's like

334
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,390
To witness the death of those you love

335
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,960
More than anyone else in the world?

336
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,330
I can't imagine.

337
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,400
It teaches you what you are capable of.

338
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,920
The depths and limits you never knew you had.

339
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,830
And, yet, even as their ashes lingered in the air,

340
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,210
Steps were taken to spare me a similar fate.

341
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,260
So I was whisked from England, sent across the sea,

342
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,400
surviving plague and pestilence,

343
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,000
to the new world.

344
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,110
I was taken in by those loyal to the cause

345
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,520
who raised me with a twin mission...

346
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,970
Teach me to harness the power of who I was

347
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,960
And yet to keep it hidden from the world.

348
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,660
And then I was raising a family of my own

349
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,210
knowing that those I held most precious

350
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,930
live in every bit the jeopardy that I do.

351
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,180
Am I a witch?

352
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,460
Yes.

353
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,380
But does that make me any less of a loving father?

354
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,490
No.

355
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,260
Most certainly not.

356
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,740
Enter.

357
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,900
I came as soon as you summoned me.

358
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,770
I suspect you're not pleased.

359
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,490
What happened, Mrs. Sibley?

360
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,460
Oh, uh, this.

361
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,410
And here my own vanity convinced me 

362
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,950
it was hardly noticeable.

363
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,480
Join me in tea, 

364
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,830
and I will tell you my sad tale.

365
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,400
I went to the woods, 

366
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:27,320
hoping to clear my mind after recent troubling events.

367
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:28,760
Sugar?

368
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,460
No, thank you.

369
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,240
Lost in my own thoughts, I scarcely noticed her.

370
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,640
Drink, Isaac.

371
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,590
Until she was upon me.

372
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,400
Who?

373
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,950
Mercy Lewis, 

374
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,870
who greeted me not with kindness

375
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,440
for once taking her in...

376
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,100
But with violence and anger.

377
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,700
She finds me guilty for Tituba's accusations.

378
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,870
as if I'm responsible for my servant's mind.

379
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,020
Mrs. Sibley?

380
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,120
Yes, Isaac?

381
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,480
The tea.

382
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,710
What about it?

383
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,290
Is it making you warm or just sleepy?

384
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,200
Both.

385
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,680
Good. Then it's working.

386
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,420
I don't mind telling you this

387
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,980
Because when you wake, you'll remember nothing.

388
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,310
Although I do regret using you like this.

389
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,730
Even in Salem, there are those who deserve better.

390
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,610
But Increase knows that you're far too scared and guileless

391
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,030
to betray him again.

392
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,250
He will take your words as fact.

393
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,110
Words?

394
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,460
That hearing that Mercy lurked nearby,

395
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,160
you sought her in the woods.

396
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,040
But she was too quick, and she evaded you.

397
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,410
Increase will parse your words

398
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,830
until he is convinced they are truth.

399
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,360
So repeat after me, Isaac.

400
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,450
"I went to the woods..."

401
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,760
I went to the woods...

402
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,690
"...to find Mercy Lewis."

403
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,350
...to find Mercy Lewis.

404
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:54,560
"Past the lake, beside the weeping tree, I spied her."

405
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,450
Past the lake, beside the weeping tree, I spied her.

406
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,010
Very good. Again.

407
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,390
Can we ever truly know our neighbor,

408
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,400
trust that they are whom they seem to be,

409
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,040
who they would have us believe them to be?

410
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,160
We are told that a young woman, a girl,

411
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,370
really was a tool of the witches only to find that she is,

412
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,410
in fact, a witch herself.

413
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:25,900
And now Salem's first son stands likewise accused.

414
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,680
Look around.

415
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,470
Look to either side.

416
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,710
Look to your neighbor.

417
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,940
And ask yourself, 

418
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,640
"Friend or sorcerer? 

419
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,990
Wife or witch?"

420
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,380
God or devil!

421
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:49,740
Who said that? Show yourself.

422
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,780
It is my son.

423
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,960
Pay him no mind.

424
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,070
Do not reward him with your indulgence.

425
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:08,010
You question who the people of Salem are 

426
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,580
in the name of god.

427
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,070
Yes?

428
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,100
But should the people of Salem not question who you are?

429
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,950
For how else would the devil appear...

430
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,750
but in the cloak of the lord?

431
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,180
Get out.

432
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,530
You are drunk!

433
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,190
Your rantings only serve to embarrass yourself.

434
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,370
Remove yourself now.

435
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:44,850
You will not?

436
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,080
I will remove you myself!

437
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,190
Point the finger at her own father?

438
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,290
She would never.

439
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,050
Are you certain of that?

440
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,570
Wasn't it just last night that I found her with Increase?

441
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,860
She had no intention.

442
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,850
She was simply acting out.

443
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,670
Salem is filled with those who act out --

444
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,060
friends who act like enemies, 

445
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,100
enemies who act as executioners.

446
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,070
This is all new to her.

447
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:30,230
Trust that, in time, she will accept it.

448
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,950
Yes, and if not, what then?

449
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,850
Then it may be time to tell her the rest of the story.

450
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,490
I'm afraid that time has already come.

451
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,830
Your story is really quite fantastic.

452
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:49,390
Mary Sibley attacked by Mercy Lewis.

453
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,270
Yes, sir.

454
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,250
And out of loyalty to Mary,

455
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,690
you followed the girl into the woods.

456
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:56,820
Loyalty to Mary?

457
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,810
No, sir. Loyalty to you.

458
00:26:58,810 --> 00:26:59,630
Me?

459
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,590
Are you not eager to find the girl?

460
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:03,900
Did you not tell me

461
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,410
to keep my eyes and ears open on your behalf?

462
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,700
So when I learned she lurked at the wood's edge,

463
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,460
I sought her out, as I knew you would have wanted.

464
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,470
This is called a cilice.

465
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,700
I wear this to remind myself of my own failing.

466
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,210
Does it surprise you, Isaac,

467
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:35,270
to learn that even I have sins I must atone for?

468
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,090
Have you ever sinned?

469
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,890
Not intentionally, sir.

470
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,600
Are you sinning now?

471
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,540
Are you lying to me?

472
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,810
I speak the truth, reverend.

473
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,670
I saw her, but could not catch her.

474
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,320
And can you recall where it was you last laid eyes on Mercy?

475
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:58,230
Past the lake, beside the weeping tree, I spied her.

476
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,380
And you could -- you could lead me there?

477
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,840
Yes, of course, sir.

478
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:04,730
Well, then. 

479
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,590
prepare yourself, my boy.

480
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,070
For you and I... 

481
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,930
are going witch hunting.

482
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,570
Miss Hale.

483
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,360
Am I intruding, reverend?

484
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,620
Well, I was just about to enjoy my late-afternoon drink.

485
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,220
Not to be confused, of course, with my early-evening drink,

486
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,630
which I anticipate taking place shortly, as well.

487
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,960
Perhaps?

488
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,630
Oh, no, thank you. I can not stay.

489
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,120
I simply came to say... I'm sorry.

490
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,880
For?

491
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,920
Everything.

492
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,980
I have not treated you well... 

493
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,570
nor entirely fairly.

494
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,250
So my father has earned me your pity. Is that right?

495
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,070
No.

496
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,320
I simply see that we are alike.

497
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,700
Both children of complicated men.

498
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,960
Magistrate Hale, complicated?

499
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,730
In truth, he's always seemed a bit of a...

500
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,790
a simpleton to me.

501
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,020
No, I assure you.

502
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,080
He is as complex as any man in Salem.

503
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:52,040
You have made quite a study of them -- witches.

504
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,210
For all my studies, I'm not sure I truly know a thing.

505
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,580
Oh, I doubt that.

506
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,730
I'm sure you could tell me all about them.

507
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,540
I did not know you even believed in witches.

508
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,740
I've had a change of heart.

509
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,070
And why is that?

510
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,620
Perhaps it is an interest I've lived with my entire life,

511
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,960
but wasn't aware of until recently.

512
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,370
Well, um...

513
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,440
If you have a moment, please sit,

514
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,170
and I will tell you all about witches.

515
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,900
It's here, reverend.

516
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,890
You're sure?

517
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,740
It was the trail I took that led me to her.

518
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,400
Careful, sir.

519
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,570
We do not know when she could strike.

520
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,080
Tell me, did you really travel 

521
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,090
this deep into the woods alone

522
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,360
to find the girl?

523
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,650
For you, sir.

524
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,570
For me?

525
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,480
I'm touched.

526
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,070
I'm also extremely skeptical.

527
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,280
Reverend?

528
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,800
What is your plan?

529
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,570
Plan?

530
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,260
To lure me? To kill me?

531
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:25,420
No. Why would I? How?

532
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,420
Or perhaps 

533
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,990
perhaps you did not have a choice.

534
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,060
Tell me, whose bidding is it that you do?

535
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,950
Is it John Alden who wants me dead?

536
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,440
Or Mary Sibley?

537
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,560
Or do they work in concert? 

538
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,700
Tell me now or I'll slide this blade along your throat

539
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,270
and you'll be dead before I clean and sheath it.

540
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:49,390
Reverend, I promise you I'm here on your behalf

541
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,650
and yours alone.

542
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,480
Sir!

543
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,560
After her! Go on!

544
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,570
You've seen one?

545
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,980
A witch, I mean?

546
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,020
I have.

547
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,930
A vile creature who walked undetected for years

548
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,020
until finally her true nature was revealed.

549
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,890
So they hide amongst us?

550
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,920
This change of heart is remarkable.

551
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,650
Remarkable that it took so long.

552
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,570
Living in Salem and not believing in witches

553
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,230
is like living in london and not believing in fog.

554
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,080
It is to deny what is right in front of you.

555
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,360
And what does your father think of your conversion?

556
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,440
My father...

557
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,180
above all is...

558
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,830
responsible for it.

559
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,460
Perhaps he's as complicated as you say.

560
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,270
But what my father did not answer is...

561
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,470
what do witches want?

562
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,550
Some say they want only to live in peace.

563
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,960
Others, like my father, 

564
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,350
say that they desire nothing less 

565
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,650
than the destruction of all mankind.

566
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,530
And is your father correct?

567
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,340
My father's correct in most matters.

568
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,970
Is he correct about you?

569
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,360
My father thinks I'm a failure.

570
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:22,270
Since I have failed at both piety and sobriety.

571
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,310
Yes.

572
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,540
The evidence supports his case.

573
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,170
He's wrong.

574
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,250
Another failure to add to my list.

575
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:58,250
Your only failure is not becoming your father.

576
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,720
And that is no failure.

577
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,240
Terra sunt carnes et ossa.

578
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,230
Domini est terra et ossa.

579
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,790
Terra sunt carnes et ossa.

580
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,530
Domini est terra et ossa.

581
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,920
I do not see her.

582
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,120
Fear not. She will return.

583
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,590
For how else can she attempt to kill me?

584
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,660
Domini est terra et ossa.

585
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,810
Satan is a formidable enemy

586
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,930
not because he's evil, but because he is sly.

587
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,100
Oh, we know each other well.

588
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:05,260
Et nos unum benedictus.

589
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,350
Reverend?

590
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,870
Sir?

591
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,200
Sir? Reverend Mather?

592
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,160
Looking for me, reverend?

593
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,470
You will return with me to Salem,

594
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:45,290
and you will stand trial, witch.

595
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,690
I don't think so.

596
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,890
Did you think it would only take 

597
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,050
one knife to kill me, reverend?

598
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,090
After her!

599
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,570
Isaac, don't let her get away!

600
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,610
Isaac!

601
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,870
Mercy's weapon.

602
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,450
Oh, my poor boy.

603
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,020
Breathe shallow.

604
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,410
You are not alone.

605
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,380
Yes? 

606
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,260
Reverend Mather has requested you in his quarters.

607
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,180
Cotton?

608
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,070
Uh, no, ma'am.

609
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,100
Increase.

610
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,380
Mrs. Sibley, 

611
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:43,970
this way.

612
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,060
May I have a moment with him?

613
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,250
Isaac.

614
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,940
Oh, sweet isaac.

615
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,330
I never intended for you to meet this fate.

616
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,040
So I promise you --

617
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,890
though a grim future awaits the people of Salem --

618
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,470
I will protect you from any further pain.

619
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,980
I swear to you.

620
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,700
Come now.

621
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,730
He needs his rest.

622
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,740
Reverend, I am at a loss.

623
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:57,190
why Isaac would take it upon himself to seek out mercy...

624
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,550
I asked him the same question.

625
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,710
And what did he say?

626
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:09,890
He said he did it on my behalf, 

627
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,250
which I find very odd

628
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,150
when you consider the fact that he detests me.

629
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,760
Detests you?

630
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,880
No. No, isaac hates no one.

631
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,380
He is incapable of it.

632
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,360
Well, at least you will agree his mind is...

633
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,790
childlike.

634
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,100
And, like a child,

635
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,870
he absorbs the thoughts and the intents of others.

636
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,170
What others?

637
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,500
Someone who does hate me...

638
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:47,080
and desires me...dead.

639
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,380
And one other matter, reverend --

640
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:03,150
I remain skeptical that John Alden is a witch.

641
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,950
Ah, if not Alden, 

642
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,670
tell me who, then, is responsible

643
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,270
for what has transpired in Salem?

644
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,860
Regrettably, I do not know.

645
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,170
Well, perhaps we can hope together

646
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,090
that the truly guilty party will step forward

647
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,930
and...exonerate the good captain.

648
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,140
Do you think that's a possibility, Mary?

649
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,380
This is Salem.

650
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,950
I think there are no limits to what is possible.

651
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:24,070
Am I to expect another outburst?

652
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,160
No. 

653
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,490
I've not had a drink for hours.

654
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:32,800
Amazing what one comes to accept as a sign of progress.

655
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,710
Why have you come at this hour?

656
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,200
I've been contemplating your offer.

657
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,430
To join you in the prosecution of captain Alden.

658
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:46,370
And you have seen the wisdom in it?

659
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,060
I have seen wisdom...

660
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,080
But not yours.

661
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,080
I've decided to defend captain Alden.

662
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,310
To defend?

663
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,830
Oh, imagine how proud I am to have...

664
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:07,470
raised a son so steadfast in his ability

665
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:10,810
to consistently make the wrong decision.

666
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,170
Anne.

667
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,090
Please, father, it's far past my bedtime.

668
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,670
I only require a moment.

669
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,640
Something I neglected to tell you before...

670
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,870
regarding that mask.

671
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,510
Truly, can this wait?

672
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,360
It has waited long enough.

673
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,360
And it is this 

674
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,770
that the power of that mask

675
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:53,470
can only be accessed by those of one kind.

676
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,080
And what kind is that?

677
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,730
My kind.

678
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,670
But it worked when I...

679
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,330
are you saying that I am...

680
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,020
like me.

681
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,940
A witch.

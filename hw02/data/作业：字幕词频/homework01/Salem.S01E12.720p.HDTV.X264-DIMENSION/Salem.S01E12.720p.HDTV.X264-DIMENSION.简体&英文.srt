第一季  第十二集

00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,520
《塞勒姆》前情提要
Previously on "Salem"...

16
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,130
我会找到梅西·路易丝
I will find Mercy Lewis

17
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,220
不管你们是否帮忙
with or without your help.

18
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,270
你是说我是...
Are you saying that I am...

19
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,350
是个巫师
A witch.

20
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,580
明天我会将约翰·奥登的案子提交委员会
Tomorrow I shall bring John Alden's case before the board.

21
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,730
他是无辜的
He is innocent.

22
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,600
你明明知道
And you know it.

23
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,930
奉英克里斯·麦哲之命
By order of Increase Mather,

24
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,720
我宣布逮捕你
I place you under arrest.

25
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,290
我决定为奥登上尉辩护
I've decided to defend Captain Alden.

26
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,440
为他辩护
To defend?

27
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,120
让小孩子们都出现在我面前吧
Let the little children come unto me,

28
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,280
因为恶魔的王国属于他们
For the kingdom of the devil belongs to them.

29
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,950
来
Come.

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,560
坐这儿  小可怜
Sit here, poor boy.

31
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,430
可怜的小家伙  因为家人而劳作致死
Poor, sweet boy, worked to death by your family.

32
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,580
你生命的每一天
Every day of your life,

33
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,630
令你无权埋葬在教堂的墓地里
making you unfit for burial in the churchyard,

34
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,220
于是他们把你扔在这儿
so they dumped you here.

35
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,020
爱丽丝
Alice.

36
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,290
分娩而死
Died in child birth,

37
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,040
怀上了你舅父的孩子
pregnant from your mother's brother.

38
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,800
孩子在那儿
There. There, the baby.

39
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,020
他被捂死来隐瞒事实
Smothered to hide the evidence.

40
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,500
让他们母子不再分离
Let mother and child be together.

41
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,450
现在我是你们的母亲
I am your mother now.

42
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,750
你们所有人的母亲
All of you!

43
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,530
你们都是我的孩子
And you all are my children.

44
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,450
我父亲路易丝牧师说
My father, the good Reverend Lewis,

45
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,330
世间并无炼狱
said that there is no purgatory,

46
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,700
迷失在天堂和地狱之间的灵魂无处安息
no place for souls lost between heaven and hell.

47
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,210
但他错了
But he was wrong.

48
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,380
地球就是炼狱
Earth is purgatory.

49
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,360
我们是栖息在这片土地上的幽魂
We are the ghosts that haunt this land.

50
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,590
不  梅西
No, Mercy.

51
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,830
你还活生生的
You are very much alive.

52
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,490
或许比任何人都鲜活
Perhaps more alive than any of us.

53
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,190
只不过你像只幽魂一样隐藏自己
Yet you have hidden yourself like a ghost.

54
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,210
英克里斯到处在找你
Increase searches everywhere for you.

55
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,990
他绝不会找到这儿
He will never look here.

56
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,480
但我的姑娘们
But my girls.

57
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,870
我那些可怜的姑娘们怎么办
What of my poor girls?

58
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,240
他抓了她们四个
He has four of them.

59
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,800
但不要担心
But do not fear for them or yourself.

60
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,310
很快我们的大祭典将净化这片土地上
Soon our grand rite will cleanse this land of the evil men do

61
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,100
一切邪恶的人和事
and the men who do it,

62
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,070
就像圣经时代的大洪水
like the great flood of biblical times,

63
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,460
开辟通往我们新世界的道路
making way for our new world.

64
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,850
放心吧  梅西
And rest assured, Mercy...

65
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,640
你和你的姑娘们
you, your girls,

66
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,270
还有你的孩子们都会有立足之地
and all your children shall have a place there.

67
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,480
谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

68
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,730
但请告诉我
But tell me...

69
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,830
好让我消除他们的疑虑
tell me so I may reassure them in their fear.

70
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,930
到底是什么
What is it?

71
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,270
什么将会来临
What is coming?

72
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,200
死亡
Death.

73
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,770
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

74
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,940
*鼓鸣震天*
*Witch drums*

75
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,510
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

76
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,720
*擂我战鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

77
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,940
*鼓鸣震天*
*The witch drums*

78
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,440
*宁入地狱*
*Better pray for hell*

79
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,610
*不留人间*
*Not hallelujah*

80
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
这是一个古老的真理
'tis an ancient proverbial truth

81
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,770
城门失火  殃及池鱼
that it requires but one dead apple to rot an entire barrel.

82
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,360
我开始相信  只需要一颗烂苹果
And I come to believe it requires but one apple

83
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,950
便能腐化整片大地
to make this whole land equally rotten.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,400
不是随便一颗苹果
And not just any apple,

85
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
而是恶灵
but the malum.

86
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,880
苹果的图像出现在
The icon of the apple

87
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,150
我们所了解的大祭典书里的每一页
runs through almost every image we have of the grand rite.

88
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,950
大祭典会带来死亡
The grand rite brings about death,

89
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,290
大规模的死亡
death on a mass scale.

90
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,350
对于它的操作  我们知之甚少
We know little of its operation,

91
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,430
更别说它将
nor the...the mechanism of magic

92
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,500
如何带来死亡
that unleashes the... the death that follows.

93
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,840
只有这样简单的一句话
Only this one enigmatically simple sentence...

94
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,030
"开启恶灵"
"Malum est aperta."

95
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,760
"邪恶的开始"
"The evil begins."

96
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,760
但这些年来我一直都理解错了
But I have been misreading it all these years.

97
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,500
我们都理解错了  包括我父亲
We all have, my father included.

98
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,640
恶灵可以翻成邪恶  但也可以翻成苹果
"Malum" Means "Evil," But equally "Apple."

99
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,240
现在这句话应该这么理解
And I know believe the sentence to read,

100
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,130
"开启苹果"
"The apple opens,"

101
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,470
也就是说  释放了死亡
And, by implication, unleashes the death that results.

102
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,080
我记得我见过那个苹果
I believe I have seen that apple,

103
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,220
或者装着它的容器
or the box that contains it...

104
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,650
在约翰·奥登家里
In the house of John Alden.

105
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,790
谁啊
Yes?

106
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,800
麦哲牧师
Reverend Mather?

107
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,660
我知道很晚了
I know it is late.

108
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,360
这么晚你还在外面干嘛
What are you doing out?

109
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,880
抱歉
I'm sorry.

110
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,090
我不知道还能找谁
I didn't know who else to turn to.

111
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,610
你是唯一能帮助我的
You are the only one who can help me.

112
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,740
那你就来对了
Well, then you did the right thing by coming.

113
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,170
我要怎么帮你  帮你干什么
Uh...how may I help you, and...and with what?

114
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,110
你觉得有可能吗  一个人身为巫师
Do you think it's possible to be a witch

115
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,850
却不自知
and not even know it?

116
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,520
我想若是他把灵魂交给了撒旦
I-I think one would know

117
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,480
他应该是知道的
if one had...deeded one's soul to satan.

118
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,620
但若是别人代劳的呢
But what if someone deeded it for you?

119
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,240
我向你保证  霍尔小姐
I can assure you, Miss Hale...

120
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,600
不  我不要你的保证
No. I want more than your assurance.

121
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:24,890
我要...
I want...

122
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,320
我要你现在就检查一下我
I want you to examine me now...

123
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,560
看看我有没有恶魔之印记
for the mark of the devil.

124
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,870
然后你就能向我保证了
Then, you may assure me.

125
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,990
我感觉不到恶魔的迹象
I feel no sign of satan.

126
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,640
在我看来  你各个方面
You seem, to me, in every respect,

127
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,230
都没有被恶魔侵袭
unmolested by the devil.

128
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:25,890
我向你保证  霍尔小姐
I assure you, Miss Hale,

129
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,730
如果你是巫师  你肯定会知道的
If you were a witch, you would know it.

130
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,290
不要问此钟为谁而鸣
Ask not for whom the bell tolls.

131
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,870
它是为...
It tolls for...

132
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,490
谁是第一个呢
I wonder who will be first.

133
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,110
是谁呢
Who will it be?

134
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,400
你是什么意思
What do you mean?

135
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,800
开口的人就不用遭受烧灼之痛
Whoever will speak will not burn.

136
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,090
很简单
Simple.

137
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,940
今晚这里有点闷啊  是不是
Close in here this evening, no?

138
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,330
我先出去呼吸一下新鲜空气
Think I'll take some air.

139
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,620
我出去期间  你们...
While I'm gone, consider...

140
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,990
想想谁先开口说明
which of you will be the first to confess

141
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,970
巫师约翰·奥登对你们做了什么
what the witch John Alden did to you.

142
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,600
梅西  谢天谢地
Mercy, thank God.

143
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,760
我们撑不住了
We cannot hold on.

144
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,710
他要逼我们背叛你
He is going to make us turn.

145
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,420
但是你来救我们的对吗
But you have come to save us?

146
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,270
不  不是这样
No, it doesn't work that way.

147
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,480
你们还没准备好像我一样改变
You're not ready to travel as I do.

148
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,400
但要记住  我们仍然侍奉暗夜女王
But remember, we still serve the queen of the night,

149
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,240
她跟我一样  绝对不会忘记你们
and she has not forgotten you any more than I have,

150
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,210
她一定会来救你们的
and there will be a day where she will save you.

151
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,430
我保证
I promise.

152
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,370
但是现在
But for now,

153
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,580
你们必须给那个老家伙他想要的东西
you must give that old goat what he wants.

154
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,190
我特别害怕他要给我们上刑
I'm terribly afraid it's us he's going to serve up.

155
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,210
这当然是她有意为之
This is surely part of her design.

156
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,840
她的网比我们的网都大
Her web is greater than all of ours,

157
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,260
而且她能预示未来
and she has a vision,

158
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,500
预示这片土地未来的样子
a vision of what this land could be.

159
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,610
所以麦哲牧师让你们
So do as reverend Mather asks

160
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,070
在审判时指证约翰·奥登的话你们照做就行
and speak against John Alden at the trial.

161
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,420
{\an8}几代人都失败的事你成功了

162
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,070
{\an8}大祭典快完成了

163
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,080
{\an8}我们还需要的五名受害者已经准备好

164
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,030
{\an8}所有人都将在月出时分死去

165
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,740
{\an8}然后恶灵将会开启

166
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,340
恶灵开启
Malum aperta.

167
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,690
但为何要伤害约翰·奥登
But why John Alden?

168
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,210
{\an8}那是牺牲

169
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,430
{\an8}你已经做出了很大的牺牲

170
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,430
{\an8}你为这片树林献出了一个小生灵

171
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,640
{\an8}所以你应该知道

172
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,230
{\an8}这样才能称之为牺牲

173
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,610
{\an8}就是伤害

174
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,450
但他是无辜的
But he is innocent.

175
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,290
{\an8}对

176
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,460
{\an8}无辜者的鲜血

177
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,200
{\an8}恶灵即将开启

178
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,470
{\an8}很多无辜之人会死去

179
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,220
{\an8}多死他一个又何妨

180
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,710
对我来说很重要
It matters to me.

181
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,050
{\an8}你小时候我们就认识你

182
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,510
{\an8}我们把你抚养长大

183
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,680
{\an8}你就像我们的亲生女儿一样

184
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,780
{\an8}你哭泣时

185
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,780
{\an8}我们也哭泣

186
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,850
{\an8}你流血时

187
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,930
{\an8}我们也流血

188
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,730
{\an8}现在流的即是血泪

189
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:44,140
{\an8}但这血和泪是我们的武器

190
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,900
{\an8}你生性如此

191
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,250
{\an8}任何事都无法改变

192
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,260
玛丽  你听我说
Mary, listen to me.

193
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,060
放了他会在他面前暴露你
To free him would reveal what you are to him.

194
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,770
你觉得这样他还会爱你吗
You think he could love you then?

195
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,790
不要失去他的爱
Do not lose his love.

196
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,480
为了我们要加以利用
Use it for all of us.

197
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,420
这就是应该做出的牺牲
That is the sacrifice.

198
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,790
在所有关于巫术还有恶魔的作品中
In all of the literature on witchcraft,

199
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,660
"恶灵"就是指邪恶
on malice, malum is "Evil."

200
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,720
所以你告诉我为什么现在
So you tell me why, in this particular case,

201
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,120
它指的是"苹果"
should it signify "Apple"?

202
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,220
我有理由相信我们听说的恶灵
I have reason to believe the malum referred to here

203
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,050
指的是实物
is an actual object,

204
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,840
这个物体已经在塞勒姆等着对付我们了
and that object is here in Salem awaiting use against us.

205
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,110
这个说法很有意思
Well, it's an interesting theorem,

206
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,240
但是  不符合理性思维的基本原则
but...it fails the most basic tenet of rational thinking.

207
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,760
你告诉我  两点之间最短的距离是什么
Tell me...the shortest distance between two points is...?

208
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,010
-直线  -对
- A line. - Correct.

209
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,520
通常
And often,

210
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,760
最简单的解释就是正确的解释
the simplest explanation is the correct explanation.

211
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,660
我只是想阻止大祭典
I'm only trying to stop the grand rite.

212
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,810
阻止大祭典
Stop the grand rite?

213
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,050
你吗
You?

214
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,130
天哪  真是年少无知啊
Oh, my, the arrogance of youth.

215
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,880
你知道怎么阻止吗
Would you even know how to stop it?

216
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,270
知道代价是什么吗
And at what cost?

217
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,460
还是你想听听
Or would you like to hear from one

218
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,540
的确付出过代价阻止过它的人说一说
who actually has stopped it and has paid the cost?

219
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,160
你吗
You?

220
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,190
我都不知道
I never knew.

221
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,090
多年以前
Many years ago.

222
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,470
在马尔堡
In Marburg.

223
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,020
你当时还在襁褓之中
You were still just a-a baby.

224
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,900
德国的巫师
The German witches, oh,

225
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,490
比埃塞克斯的巫师大胆得多
far bolder than even the Essex witches.

226
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,580
他们想完成大祭典
They attempted the grand rite.

227
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,270
一个月之内  有十二名儿童失踪
Within the space of a month, a dozen children disappeared.

228
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,410
后来发现他们已成干尸
Their bodies were found bled dry.

229
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,910
他们无辜的鲜血浸透了大地
Their innocent blood soaked the ground.

230
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,700
随着满月的临近  更多儿童失踪
And as the full moon approached, more children disappeared,

231
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,760
我知道大祭典就要完成
And I knew the grand rite was nearing its completion.

232
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,100
所以其他人在搜寻孩子们
So while others searched for the children,

233
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,540
而我去追捕了巫师
I hunted the witch.

234
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,160
我找到了他
And I found him.

235
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,180
他看起来就是六岁的小女孩
He had taken the appearance of a 6-year-old girl,

236
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,400
但我知道他根本不是小女孩
but I knew this was no girl.

237
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,780
就是他
It was him.

238
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,870
我徒手扼死了他
And I strangled her with my bare hands.

239
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:04,790
生命即将离开那具躯体之时
And as the life left that body,

240
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,110
恶魔现身了  想要抢走躯体
the devil reached out and snatched the body,

241
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,140
但我紧抓不放
but I held on.

242
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,620
我决意不让他回到地狱的家园
I was determined that he should not return to his home in hell.

243
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,760
我的双手被沸腾的黑沥青包裹
And my hands were plunged into the boiling black tar.

244
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,870
地狱之火
Hellfire.

245
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,920
这双手曾经触碰过地狱
These hands have actually touched hell.

246
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,830
如今依然灼烧着我
And they burn me still.

247
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,960
但大祭典被终止了
But the grand rite was averted?

248
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,890
只有一条路能终止大祭典
There really is only one way to stop the grand rite.

249
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,660
在月圆之夜一切结束之前
One must kill the witch that began it

250
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,490
杀死开启大祭典的巫师
before the moonrise that ends it.

251
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,900
放在这一次
In this case

252
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,250
就是杀了约翰·奥登
kill John Alden.

253
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,440
很显然
It's no secret

254
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,350
约翰·奥登对我们怀揣冰冷而偏执的恨意
that John Alden has a cold and a willful hatred for us,

255
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,780
恨所有我们相信之事
For everything we believe

256
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,570
恨我们清教徒团体的圣洁之人
and for our puritan community of saints.

257
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,890
故事是这样的
And so, it was

258
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:29,530
年少的约翰·奥登和塞勒姆断绝了关系
that a young John Alden severed himself from Salem

259
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:35,290
漂泊无依  没有信仰和爱情
and, rootless, faithless, and loveless,

260
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,670
把自己放逐到残忍的战争之中
cast himself into the crucible of war,

261
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,260
在那里  他被野蛮的印第安人俘虏
where he was captured by the heathen indians.

262
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:46,740
心里的恶魔之种  已打上坚硬而恶毒之结
And that seed of evil within, already a hard and vicious knot,

263
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,990
此时找到了滋养发育的沃土
found fertile ground in which to flourish.

264
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,930
愤怒而可畏的诸神  其座下的野蛮奴仆
And the savage servants of the angry, eldritch Gods,

265
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,450
他们发现奥登承有撒旦之天赋
they saw in Alden a gift from Satan,

266
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,990
这个强大而可怕的武器
A powerful and vicious weapon

267
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,960
能在他们对我们的绝望之战中大有可为
to be used in their hopeless war against us.

268
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,300
因此  由于对我们的恨意
And so, because of his hatred for us

269
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,140
对背弃之人的恨意
and his hatred for one he felt had betrayed him,

270
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,940
他成为了强大而可怕的武器
a powerful and a vicious weapon he became.

271
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,470
先生  这完全是想象
Sir, this is pure fancy,

272
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,820
大胆的猜想
Bald conjecture.

273
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,230
当奥登上尉为了我们大家
You have no idea what may

274
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,140
和印第安人浴血奋战
or may not have happened to captain Alden

275
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,640
或是被俘之时  做过或没做过什么
while fighting for all our lives against the indians

276
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,570
你都无从知晓
or when he was held their captive.

277
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,020
好啊  那就让他自己说
Well, then, let him speak.

278
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,570
此时此刻就让奥登自己说
Let Alden tell us here and now

279
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,960
你被困在那群野蛮人中那么久
exactly what transpired during that long period of time

280
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,080
真相到底如何
when you were lost amongst the savages.

281
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:39,960
说吧
Speak, man.

282
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,960
说
Speak!

283
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,010
不说吗
No?

284
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,600
那么多年  他能在做什么
All those years, what could he have been doing?

285
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,050
我来告诉你
I will tell you.

286
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,010
就像《约伯记》中撒旦所做的
Like Satan in the Book of Job,

287
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,960
他在大地上徘徊
He was walking to and fro upon the earth

288
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,150
精进邪恶之具
mastering the tools of malice,

289
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,930
习得黑暗之术
learning the dark art

290
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,380
派遣操纵他的恶魔亲信  它们听他吩咐
of sending demonic familiars to do his bidding at a distance.

291
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,520
你们能看到  这里  在他脖颈之上
You will observe, here, upon his neck...

292
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,380
浮起一个坚硬如铁  带孔的肿块
an iron-hard, raised lump with a hole,

293
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:22,360
他就是在这儿喂养他的随从
and it was here where he suckles his familiars.

294
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,960
你不得再笑
You will not laugh again.

295
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,260
我相信你一定暗笑过许多次
I'm sure you have laughed many times to think how,

296
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,720
能在这位忠诚的年轻妻子眼前
beneath the very nose of a devoted young wife,

297
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,560
把我们的领袖  曾经强健的乔治·西布里
you turned our leader, a once robust George Sibley,

298
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,880
变成了今天备受折磨的样子
into a suffering heap that he is today.

299
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,000
当你瓦解了我们的中流砥柱之后
And after you had undermined the pillar of our community,

300
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,040
你便开始宣扬恐怖
you unleashed a campaign of terror.

301
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,540
是奥登制造了恐慌  那个邪恶的老巫婆
It was Alden who projected that specter of dread, the night hag,

302
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,330
还教唆了梅西·路易丝
to terrorize Mercy Lewis.

303
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,730
你会问"为什么是梅西·路易丝"
And you will ask, "Why? Why Mercy Lewis?"

304
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,970
也许是因为她的父亲  亲爱的路易丝牧师
Well, perhaps it was because her father, the good reverend Lewis,

305
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:09,050
把奥登痛失的爱人嫁给了可恨的对手
married Alden's bitterly lost love to a hated rival,

306
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:15,380
又或者只是想表明  塞勒姆无人安全
or perhaps it was just to show that no one in Salem is safe,

307
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:19,160
即使是备受祝福的牧师之女
not even the daughter of a blessed reverend.

308
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,480
柯顿
Cotton!

309
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,900
你照顾过梅西·路易丝
You attended Mercy Lewis.

310
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,330
你很清楚是什么害了她
You had no doubt as to what ailed her.

311
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,060
她的确遭受鬼灵袭击
She was indeed under spectral attack,

312
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,000
但奥登上尉
But Captain Alden --

313
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,710
奥登上尉  当他目睹此般袭击之时
Captain Alden...what did he say

314
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,020
他说了什么
when he witnessed such an attack?

315
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,650
他提出了一些质疑
He cast some doubt upon it.

316
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,570
一些质疑
Some doubt!

317
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,260
我听说
I am told...

318
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,640
他说这是
He said it was...

319
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,800
"一派胡言"
"Bullshit."

320
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,530
他还说这些祈祷是无用的
And he said that prayers were worthless.

321
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,540
祈祷  无用
Prayer? Worthless?

322
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,170
问问你们自己
Ask yourselves --

323
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,510
每次我们试图抓捕阻止巫师
every time we have attempted to catch and stop a witch,

324
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,180
是谁挺身而出为其辩护
who has risen up to defend them?

325
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,490
我们当中又是谁  一次又一次
Who alone among us, in encounter, time after time,

326
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,820
遇到巫师  却屡屡毫发无伤
with witches has emerged with nary a scratch upon him?

327
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,940
吉尔斯·科里濒死之时说了谁的名字
Whose name was on Giles Corey's lips as he died?

328
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,240
又是谁曾经宣称  要让这里的所有人陪葬
Who has proclaimed that he will see every man here in his grave?

329
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,690
谁站出来为布里奇特·毕谢普辩护
And who stood up to defend Bridget Bishop

330
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,760
即使亲眼目睹了她制造的怪物
even in the very sight of the monstrosity she had created?

331
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,630
我向你们发誓
I swear to you

332
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:37,090
这个男人每次开口  就罪加一等
this man condemns himself every time he opens his mouth.

333
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,210
就像伊甸园的撒旦
And like Satan in the Garden of Eden,

334
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,010
约翰·奥登明白  女人是敞开的大门
John Alden understands that women are the open doorway

335
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,290
恶魔通过女人  毒害我们大家
through which evil enters to poison us all.

336
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,900
有多少女人  年长或年幼  好或坏
How many women, young and old, good and bad,

337
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,650
被奥登变成了巫师
has Alden bewitched?

338
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,190
有人目睹  即使是这里地位最崇高的女人
It has been seen that John Alden attempted to seduce

339
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,570
约翰·奥登竟也企图勾引
even the highest women in the land.

340
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,700
西布里夫人
Mary Sibley.

341
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,100
被告是否曾在夜深人静时
Did not the accused forcibly enter your house,

342
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,580
强行闯入您家  不  是您的卧房
Nay, into your very boudoir, in the dead of night?

343
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,650
我会允许这种事发生吗
Would I allow such a thing?

344
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,480
我不知道
I do not know.

345
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,540
但您的仆人证实
But your servant man has testified

346
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:23,140
奥登的确在夜晚强行闯入过
That Alden did indeed forcibly make entry in the night.

347
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,430
他是来讨论政治的
He came to discuss politics.

348
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,950
-政治  -正是
- Politics? - Indeed.

349
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,120
他是来表明
To announce his intention

350
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,980
他想接替他父亲在委员会一职的意图
To take his father's seat on the select board.

351
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,730
大半夜的去说这个
In the middle of the night?

352
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,330
霍尔小姐
Miss Hale.

353
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,120
有人看见被告在公开场合强吻你
The accused was seen kissing you forcibly in public.

354
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,700
当然罪不在你
There is no blame attached to you.

355
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,020
你只是个手无缚鸡之力的少女
You are a... a slight and defenseless slip of a girl.

356
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,550
但此事属实吗
But do you deny it?

357
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,220
属实
He did.

358
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,800
此事属实
He did.

359
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,290
约翰·奥登一直是个潜在的危险
A snake in the grass is what John Alden was

360
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,950
现在也是
And what john alden is.

361
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:23,210
他不是试图引诱西布里夫人
And when he was not attempting to seduce his betters,

362
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,790
便是在满是妓女的房间里
He was satiating his own inhuman lusts

363
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,860
在他手下的女巫所开的妓院里
in roomfuls of whores,

364
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:32,090
填补自己非人的欲壑
in the brothel run by his very own witches.

365
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:37,420
而最糟的是  塞勒姆的年轻姑娘们
And, worst of all, I think, the tender, young maidens of Salem,

366
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,120
却迫不及待想成为他的牺牲品
So eager to fall prey to his serpentine ways.

367
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,910
梅西告诉我们
Mercy told us it was 

368
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:57,060
就是约翰·奥登踏夜前来
it was John Alden who came I-in the shadows in the night,

369
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:03,830
亲吻着  舔舐着她身体的每一寸肌肤
that he...he kissed and licked and bit every part of her.

370
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,750
但他用巫术使她无法说出他的名字
But he bewitched her so she might not name his name

371
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,130
而让她把罪责推给一个老巫婆
But she might blame all on the hag.

372
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:16,530
他在夜晚用魔鬼之身带走了她
He took her in the night in spectral form

373
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:22,600
并把她的身体和灵魂都交给了恶魔
and gave her body and soul to the devil himself.

374
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,560
之后  她用巫术和游戏
And she... she drew us in after that

375
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,260
把我们也引进了他的圈套
w-with magical tricks a-and games.

376
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,670
很快  我们就在树林里与他共舞了
And, soon, we were dancing in the woods with him,

377
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,590
我们相互爱抚  一个接一个地
Where we touched each other and, one after the other,

378
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,670
倒在他怀中
Laid with him.

379
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,790
是吗
Really?

380
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,640
你们所有人
All of you?

381
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,520
艾米莉  你是说
Are you saying, Emily...

382
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,300
你已不是处子了吗
that you are not a maiden?

383
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,180
如果我要检查你
If I were to examine you,

384
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,360
请一位女士检查你
Have one of the women here examine you...

385
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,800
她们会发现你已经不是完璧之身了吗
They would find that you are not intact?

386
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,630
他用舌头和指尖
He...he has tongue and fingers

387
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,380
还有暗藏的寻欢的...器具
and invisible instruments of...of pleasure.

388
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,790
但我闭上了眼
But I-I had my eyes closed.

389
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,180
我不知道他做了什么
I don't know what he did.

390
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,080
这些都是幻想
These are phantasms,

391
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,410
都是脑海中捏造出来的
fabrications of the mind.

392
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,860
我们在座的有哪位  即便是无意的
And who here among us has not had,

393
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:54,290
没有动过一丝淫念呢
even involuntarily, some heated thoughts?

394
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,200
这女孩的神智已经近乎崩溃
This girl has been overwhelmed by them.

395
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:02,270
尤其是当面对我父亲那些
Especially in the face of extreme torture

396
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,040
无所不用其极的酷刑
by my own father.

397
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,720
被绑上拷问台
Put to the rack, 

398
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,790
遭受死亡的威胁
threatened with death,

399
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,630
即便是个无辜的女孩也会以为自己是巫师
Even an innocent girl might think herself a witch,

400
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,750
并觉得周围的所有男人都是恶魔
and any man around her a devil.

401
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,840
我认为  你们今天在此看到的一切
I submit to you that everything you have seen here today

402
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:24,490
都是宗教法庭严刑逼供的结果
is the result of torture worthy of the inquisition!

403
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,120
到底是谁真正在残害女人
Who is it who has really violated women?

404
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,510
约翰·奥登吗
John Alden?

405
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:37,670
还是那个拥有
Or one who possesses...

406
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,140
并使用
and uses...

407
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,150
这种工具的人
Tools such as this?!

408
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,330
你怎么敢
How dare you?

409
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,530
不  先生  是你怎么敢  
No, sir! How dare you?!

410
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:59,080
今日暂且休庭
This session is suspended for the day!

411
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,520
明早等大家冷静下来再继续
We will resume in the morning when tempers have cooled.

412
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,900
整个镇子都想绞死我
The whole town wants to hang me

413
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,650
就好像我是什么怪物
Like I'm some kind of monster,

414
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,620
好像我有什么黑暗的魔法
Like I possess some dark, magic power.

415
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,960
你确实有
And you do.

416
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,400
连你也要这么说吗
Oh, not you, too.

417
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,440
不
No.

418
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,820
我不相信你是巫师
Don't believe you're a witch.

419
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,220
但我相信你的确拥有一件属于黑暗魔法的物件
But I do believe you possess something of dark, magic power.

420
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,880
你把恶灵藏在哪里
Where is the malum?

421
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,640
什么
What?

422
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,570
那个盒子
The box.

423
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,680
你发现的那个
The box you found

424
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,890
用它将老巫婆引到你家的盒子
That lured that infernal witch to your house.

425
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,310
怎么了
Why?

426
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,900
我相信那就是传说中的恶灵
I believe it is the fabled malum,

427
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,520
大祭典的关键
the key to the grand rite.

428
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,120
又是你书上那些胡说八道的东西吗
This more of your book nonsense?

429
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,180
那盒子上有图案
That box covered in images...

430
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,340
我相信那是巫师们最强大的武器
I believe it is the greatest weapon of the witches,

431
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,810
里面藏有某种
that it contains some kind of

432
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,240
超自然的毁灭性事物
Supernatural agent of destruction

433
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,460
一旦大祭典完成就会被开启
which will open when the grand rite is completed,

434
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,070
厄运就会被释放
Releasing its doom upon us like...

435
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,160
就像潘多拉的魔盒
like the myth of Pandora.

436
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,920
听着  如果那东西真是你说的那样
Look, if that thing is what you say it is,

437
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:23,650
你父亲要是知道它在我手里
And your father knows that I have it,

438
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,750
那它就将是钉死我的最后一根钉子
That is the final nail in my coffin.

439
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,500
可如果它是我们唯一的机会呢
And what if it's the only chance we have?

440
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,730
在吉尔斯那
Giles has it.

441
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,760
吉尔斯
Giles?

442
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,590
吉尔斯·科里已经死了
Giles Corey is dead.

443
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,820
我埋在他的坟墓里了
And I buried it in his grave.

444
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,580
你知道要怎么做吧
You know what to do with it?

445
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,510
父亲  我得跟你谈谈
Father, I must speak to you.

446
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,520
怎么
What now?

447
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,350
要来继续羞辱我吗
More disrespect?

448
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,210
不是
No.

449
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,000
父亲大人
Sir.

450
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,350
尽管我依然认为你的行事方法大错特错
I still think what you do is fundamentally wrong,

451
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,200
一定有其他方法解决问题  可是
that there must be other ways, but...

452
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,890
我很害怕
I am afraid.

453
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,450
非常害怕
Deathly afraid.

454
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,680
虽然我们对行事手段意见相悖
I fear, while we disagree on methods,

455
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,590
但我们都致力于中止大祭典的完成
we are both determined to stop the grand rite.

456
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,370
我很欣慰至少你明白这点
I'm gratified that you at least acknowledge that.

457
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,310
恶灵在这里
The malum is here.

458
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,430
或者说曾经在
Or was.

459
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,900
我见过它
I saw it.

460
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,560
甚至触摸过它
I touched it, even.

461
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,540
真的吗
Indeed?

462
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,800
那它在哪儿
Then where is it?

463
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,060
我不知道
I don't know.

464
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,700
告诉我你是在哪里见到它的
Tell me where you saw it.

465
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,570
在约翰·奥登家里
In John Alden's house.

466
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,050
父亲  你不明白
Father, you don't understand.

467
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,320
他是在帮我
He was helping me.

468
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,060
是他设陷阱抓住女巫  并与我一起
It was he who trapped the witch and carried her with me

469
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,620
将她带到丛林里审问然后杀了她的
to the woods to question and kill her.

470
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,470
是你不明白
You don't understand.

471
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,800
从某种意义上说  女巫和我们并无两样
In some respects, the witches are not unlike us.

472
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,680
他们也分派系
They have factions. 

473
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,020
有权力争斗
They have power struggles.

474
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,240
你的朋友奥登不是在抓巫师
Your friend Alden was not trying to catch a witch.

475
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,290
他是在排除异己
He was eliminating a rival.

476
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,050
你被自己的疑惑蒙蔽了双眼
You are blinded by your own doubt,

477
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,890
这样最终会毁掉你
and it will destroy you!

478
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,480
要是我向你承认还有一丝机会
If I grant you that there is a possibility 

479
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,120
那个奥登是清白的
that Alden is innocent,

480
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,040
你就不能看出
can you not grant the possibility

481
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,830
还有十分之一  不  百分之一的机率
that there is a 1 in 10, nay, a 1 in 100 chance

482
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,330
我可能是正确的吗
that I am right?!

483
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,270
如果是这样  千百民众将生灵涂炭
And if I am, thousands will perish.

484
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,420
国将不国
The nation itself may fall.

485
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,950
我们能冒这个险吗  我不能
Can we take that chance? I cannot.

486
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,900
你能吗
Can you?

487
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,820
我告诉你  柯顿
I tell you, Cotton,

488
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,050
你对此人的了解
you do not know this man nearly  

489
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,520
并没有你自己所认为的那样多
as well as you think you do.

490
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,420
我搜查了吉尔斯·科里的坟墓
I searched Giles Corey's grave.

491
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,650
恶灵不在那儿
The malum wasn't there.

492
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,630
不可能  我亲手埋葬的他
That's impossible. I buried it myself.

493
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,770
还有谁知道这事
Who else knew?

494
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:08,900
没有人
No one.

495
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,060
只有你
Just you.

496
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,140
你不相信我
And you don't believe me.

497
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,670
我不确定该相信谁了
I'm not sure what to believe.

498
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,120
我只确定两件事
I am certain only of two things.

499
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,740
我们所有人是生是死
All our lives may depend on

500
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,920
都在于是否找到恶灵并将其摧毁
finding and destroying the malum.

501
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,480
然后呢
And?

502
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,770
你对我或许不是那么诚实
And you are being less than honest with me.

503
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,980
我已经告诉你一切了
I've told you everything.

504
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,340
到底发生什么事了
What the hell is going on?!

505
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,890
上去
Get up.

506
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,510
那几个姑娘是无辜的
Those girls are innocent!

507
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,250
请原谅我
Forgive me!

508
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,390
我唯一感到懊悔的事
It's the only thing I regret 

509
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,480
就是编造了关于你的谎话
lying about you!

510
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,360
我知道他们都对你做了什么
Look, I know what they did to you.

511
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,260
不是你的错
It's not your fault.

512
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,430
快过来
Get over here!

513
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,520
该死的
Damn you!

514
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,400
快做点什么  她们只是些小姑娘而已
Do something! They're just girls!

515
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,690
你  你承诺说会放过我们的
You! You promised you'd spare us!

516
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,550
我放过你们不受这个世界的火刑之苦
I am sparing you the flames of this world

517
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,240
还有来世
and of the next.

518
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,930
你们不会痛苦太久
You will not suffer long.

519
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:57,980
你们腿上都加了全套重物
A full measure of mercy is being added to your legs.

520
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:00,760
放开我
Let go of me!

521
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,390
父亲  你说谎
Father, you lied!

522
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,330
你承诺过这些姑娘不会
You promised these girls they wouldn't --

523
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,260
被烧死
Burn.

524
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,050
她们不会被烧死
Nor shall they.

525
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,210
别这样  父亲
Don't do this, father.

526
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,380
这样做怎么可能会有用呢
How can this possibly help?

527
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,690
你自己也说过了她们是受害者
You said yourself they were victims!

528
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,640
虽然遗憾但这是事实
Sad but true.

529
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,210
她们已经被恶魔玷污
But they're tainted... by the devil.

530
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,700
恐怕如今正怀着他的种
I fear they carry his very seed.

531
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,830
你怎么能确定呢
How can you be certain?

532
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,280
我十分确定
I am certain.

533
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,680
我确定她们对于塞勒姆造成的威胁
I am certain of the threat they pose to Salem,

534
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,570
正如我确定你的软弱会成为对你的威胁
just as I am certain that your weakness poses a threat.

535
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,910
不过重中之重
But above all,

536
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,200
我确信
I am certain that,

537
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,210
如同外科医生一般
like a surgeon, 

538
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,650
我别无选择只有切除
I have no choice but to cut out

539
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:36,100
恶疾的病灶
the malignant manifestation of malice

540
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,660
才能防止疾病进一步扩散
before it can spread any further.

541
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,280
不要  停下
No! Stop!

542
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,630
请救救我啊  救我  救我
Please help me! Please! Please!

543
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,530
退下
Get back!

544
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,650
被地域炼火烧死吧
Burn in hell!

545
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,560
烧死她们
Let them burn!

546
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,890
梅西
Mercy!

547
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,040
你在哪儿
Where are you?!

548
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,290
梅西
Mercy!

549
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,420
怎么了
What is it?

550
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,600
多莉  发生什么了
Dollie, what has happened?

551
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,360
艾米莉  伊丽莎白  苏珊娜和查丽蒂
Emily, Elizabeth, Susanna, and Charity --

552
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,400
英克里斯·麦哲把她们全绞死了
Increase Mather has hung them all.

553
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,580
你曾发誓她们会安全的
You swore that they would be safe,

554
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,850
但是她们死了
but they're dead!

555
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,570
她们所有人都死了
All of them have been killed!

556
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,960
你说你的主人会保护我们
You said your master would protect us,

557
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,480
当她却什么都没做
and she did nothing!

558
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,880
回去塞勒姆
Go back to Salem.

559
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,450
召集年轻人
Gather the young,

560
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,880
穷人  痛苦之人
the poor, the suffering.

561
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:36,130
他们将会作为我们的军队
They will be our army.

562
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,280
新的时代即将到来
A new day is upon us.

563
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,880
而那个新的时代需要
And that new day demands

564
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,460
一位新的黑夜女王
a new queen of the night!

565
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,380
我知道你们大多数人很难接受
I know that so many of you find it hard to accept,

566
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,230
不敢相信那约翰·奥登
impossible to believe that John Alden,

567
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,060
我们奠基者的儿子
son of one of our founders 

568
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,800
守卫我们的好士兵
and a brave soldier in our defense,

569
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:02,200
居然私自修行邪恶巫术
is guilty of malefic witchcraft.

570
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:03,490
没关系
Fine.

571
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,330
随你们怎么想
Fine!

572
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,930
不管你相不相信  都没有关系
Suspend your belief or not. It doesn't matter.

573
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,160
唯一重要的
The only thing that matters 

574
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,100
只有让奥登
is that Alden...

575
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,260
被判有罪
be convicted

576
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:19,620
并对他真实的一面进行判罚
and sentenced for what he truly is,

577
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,410
他叛徒与杀人犯的一面
a traitor and a murderer.

578
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,340
什么
What?

579
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,290
你这是什么意思
Whatever do you mean?

580
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:30,210
我提出约翰·奥登与印第安人在一起时
I submit that while John Alden was with the indians,

581
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,210
他不仅与他们交往
he not only took up with them.

582
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,300
还拿起武器对抗自己的人民
He took up arms against his own people,

583
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,100
屠杀了他的战友  那些民兵团员
Slaughtering militiamen in his own company,

584
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,870
那些年轻的英国好小伙  一个没留
good new england men, every one of them.

585
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:47,740
我发誓这是真的
I swear this to be true.

586
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:52,360
我打赌约翰·奥登绝不敢否认
And I dare John Alden to deny it!

587
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,360
你敢不敢告诉大家
I dare you to tell me

588
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,660
你没有在脸上涂满颜料
that you did not paint your face 

589
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,600
成为一名野蛮印第安人
as a heathen Indian

590
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,110
然后砸碎了你同伴的头颅
and smash the skulls of men in your own company!

591
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,260
无理的指控
Outrageous accusations!

592
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,590
你从哪听来的此等胡言
Wherever did you find such nonsense?

593
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,520
我有来自奴隶缇图芭的证词
I have sworn testimony from the slave Tituba!

594
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,000
谎言与幻想
Lies and fantasies.

595
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,460
谎言  上尉
Lies? Captain?

596
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,580
幻想
Fantasies?

597
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,530
你要否认控告吗
Do you dispute the charges?

598
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,490
说话
Speak.

599
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:28,920
上尉
Captain...

600
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,130
这都是真的吗
is this all true?

601
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,990
这里每个有理智的人都知道我不是巫师
Every sane man in this place knows I ain't a witch.

602
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,460
你是叛徒吗
Are you a traitor?

603
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,120
你是杀人犯吗
Are you a murderer?

604
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,790
该死的  约翰  回答他
Damn you, John. Answer him.

605
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,740
正如你所看到的
So, you see...

606
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,000
有时候  沉默是最力的供诉
Sometimes, silence can be the most eloquent confession of all.

607
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,580
我深信不疑
I have no doubt, not a sliver of a doubt,

608
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,980
约翰·奥登是个巫师
that John Alden is a witch.

609
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,860
但是
But...

610
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,550
即便不为此
even had I not...

611
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,810
我依然坚持
I would still maintain

612
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,530
他必须被吊死
that he must hang 

613
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,230
为他那些无法否认的罪行
for crimes he will not deny.

614
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,500
你也该如此
And nor should you.

615
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,180
看在上帝的份上  告诉我父亲是错的
For god's sake, tell me my father is wrong.

616
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,280
告诉我你不是他说的那种人
Tell me you are not the man he says you are.

617
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,820
现在还重要吗
What does it matter now?

618
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,070
对我很重要
It matters to me --

619
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,480
这决定你是否一直在骗我
Whether you duped me all this time.

620
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,310
你真想知道真相吗
Are you sure you want the truth?

621
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,470
你真的清楚明白
Are you really damn sure

622
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,240
善与恶之间的区别吗
you know the difference between good and evil?

623
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,830
因为你们这些清教徒
'cause you puritans,

624
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,990
认为世界只有黑与白
you think the world is just black and white.

625
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,520
但如果我告诉你
What if the truth of the world is 

626
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,970
这是一个灰色的世界呢
that it's nothing but gray?

627
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,390
经过大沼泽一战
After the battle of the great swamp,

628
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,260
我被部队遗弃  只能等死
I was left for dead.

629
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,770
但莫霍克人发现了我
But I was found by the Mohawk --

630
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,130
不是那些与我们对战的印第安人
Not the indians we fought, no.

631
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,420
莫霍克人虽然不是我们的朋友
The Mohawk aren't our friends,

632
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,920
但他们是与我们战斗的阿布纳基人的敌人
but they are the enemies of the Abenaki we fight.

633
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,070
说句实话  我
In all honesty, I...

634
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:42,160
我想我永远不会明白他们为什么要救我
I don't think I'll ever understand why they saved me.

635
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,040
直到现在依然困惑着我
It is a mystery to me to this day.

636
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,220
你老头子找到的那个伤疤
The scar your old man found

637
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,540
他说是用来喂养亲信的那个
he said was from feeding a familiar?

638
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,070
那是他们把铅弹从我体内取出
That was from digging a ball of lead out of me

639
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,310
并用他们的药品治疗后留下的伤疤
and healing it with their medicines.

640
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,980
他们想用你换取赎金吗
They held you for ransom?

641
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,050
不
No.

642
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,170
他们待我以仁慈和尊敬
They treated me with kindness and respect.

643
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,480
而且他们的圣者对我很感兴趣
And their holy men took an interest in me.

644
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,110
我不知道为什么或是他看上了我哪点
I'm not even sure why or what he saw in me,

645
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,280
不过如果不是他
but if he hadn't...

646
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,780
我早死了
I'd be dead.

647
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,850
所以我就和他们生活在一起
So I lived amongst them.

648
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,900
与他们共享食物与住所
I shared their food and their shelter.

649
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,290
甚至和他们一起打猎
I even hunted with them.

650
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,720
一天  我和一些勇士打猎归来
One day, me and a few braves returned from a hunt

651
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:34,530
发现村庄被烧掠殆尽
to find the village had been burned to the ground.

652
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,600
妇女和儿童的尸体散落在四处
The women and the children, they're all scattered

653
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:42,420
整个村庄死气沉沉  哀鸿遍野
like dead, fallen leaves, slaughtered.

654
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:43,940
是阿布纳基人干的
By the Abenaki?

655
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,770
不
No.

656
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:46,660
民兵团
Militia.

657
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,130
我们的民兵团
Our militia.

658
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:52,710
甚至懒得费心分辨
Couldn't even be bothered

659
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,180
各个印第安部落间的不同
to tell one indian tribe from another.

660
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,960
一股血气直通我头顶
A red fog descended upon me,

661
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,960
于是我冲进丛林
and it did not lift until I ran through those woods

662
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,360
杀光了那帮禽兽
And killed every one of those bastards,

663
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,700
除了一个
everyone but one.

664
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,850
但他也被我在找到木盒的那一夜解决了
And that I corrected the night I found the box.

665
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,420
那恶灵呢
And the malum?

666
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,420
我对此一无所知
I didn't know nothing about that.

667
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,450
你说那东西对巫师至关重要
You said it was something that the witches wanted badly.

668
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,930
那晚在树林里让那女巫跑了后
When we lost that witch in the woods,

669
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,060
我想最好将它藏起来
I thought it was best to hide it,

670
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,930
于是我就把它埋在了吉尔斯的墓里
So, like I told you, I buried it with Giles.

671
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,640
那一定是有人又将它挖了出来
Well, then someone unburied it.

672
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,270
或许你根本无须担心
Maybe you have nothing to worry about, then,

673
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,490
据你父亲所说
Because according to your father,

674
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,210
我正是幕后主使
I am the witch behind it.

675
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,110
所以你们只要绞死我
So, all you have to do is hang me,

676
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,150
一切就都解决了
and then everything will be just fine.

677
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,100
让我一直想不透
What I can't figure out,

678
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,320
努力想弄清的是
what I am trying to surmise,

679
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,810
在发生了这么多事
is, after all of this,

680
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,750
我们经历的这一切之后
after everything we've been through --

681
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:05,220
你需要的到底是朋友  还是卒子
you needed a friend or a pawn?

682
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,700
泪水帮不了你
Weeping don't help.

683
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,990
相信我
Trust me.

684
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,220
我深有体会
Done my fair share.

685
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,450
艾萨克
Isaac.

686
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,570
天哪  你还在流血
God, you're still bleeding.

687
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,890
在这里  谁又不是呢
Around here, who ain't?

688
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,420
我都做了什么
What have I done?

689
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:58,580
这一切都不是你的错
I know none of this is your fault,

690
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,170
都是我的错
and all of it's mine.

691
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,370
那天他已经要离开了
He was on his way out of town that day.

692
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,560
是我阻止了他
I stopped him.

693
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,250
如果不是我  他早已远离这是非之地
If it weren't for me, he'd be long gone.

694
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,940
这一切都不会发生
None of this would have happened.

695
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,200
是我亲手将绞索套上了他的脖子
I might as well pull the rope myself in the morning.

696
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,300
我害死了约翰·奥登
I've as good as killed John Alden.

697
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:16,830
但你
But you...

698
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,560
你可以救他
You can save him.

699
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,970
不行  我做不到
I can't. I can't!

700
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:22,910
你是玛丽
You're Mary.

701
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,490
你可是玛丽
You're Mary.

702
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,740
在外人眼中  你是玛丽·西布里
They all call you Mary Sibley.

703
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,110
可你知道在我心中
Do you know what I call you

704
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,610
我又是怎么看待你的吗
in my head, to myself, in my heart?

705
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,740
"神奇的玛丽"
"Magic Mary."

706
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,330
你总有一种魔力
You were always magic,

707
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:41,160
即使在我们小的时候
even back when we was just sprouts.

708
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,240
你可以做到任何事
And you could do anything --

709
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,710
一直都能
Always could.

710
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,590
只要你足够渴望它
You just have to want it bad enough.

711
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,800
而你也有
And you do.

712
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,890
不是吗
Don't you?

713
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,730
你渴望约翰·奥登能活下来
You do want John Alden to live.

714
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:27,140
你是怎么进来的
How did you get in here?

715
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,010
他们明天就会送你上绞刑架
They will hang you tomorrow.

716
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:32,010
他们
"They"?

717
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,780
你不也正是他们的一员吗  西布里夫人
Well, aren't you one of them, Mrs. Sibley?

718
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:42,470
有时候  我都记不清自己到底是谁
Sometimes, I no longer remember who I am.

719
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,200
但我知道你是谁
But I know who you are --

720
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,100
一个无辜的人
An innocent man.

721
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,750
我不是
Hardly.

722
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,860
想来可笑
Now it's almost funny.

723
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,270
塞勒姆终于头一遭
Salem finally sentenced someone to die

724
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,150
可以处死一个罪有应得的人
for something they've actually done.

725
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:01,680
回家吧  玛丽
Go home, Mary.

726
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,450
继续过你的人生  西布里夫人
Go back to your life, Mrs. Sibley.

727
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:09,950
你就是我的人生
You are my life.

728
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:16,080
现在才这么想或许有点太迟了
Well, it's a little late for that thought.

729
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,740
我不会让他们吊死你的
I'll not let you hang.

730
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,600
我可以救你
I can save you.

731
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,270
塞勒姆的善良人们
The good people of salem,

732
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,630
那些我誓死捍卫的人们
the people I've been trying to save,

733
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:26,720
他们都恨不得我死
they all want me dead.

734
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,930
他们认为我就是恶魔
They think I'm the devil himself.

735
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,060
我不是
I'm no devil.

736
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,980
但我确实犯下了叛国
But I am guilty of treason...

737
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,060
及谋杀之罪
and murder.

738
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,970
因此我罪有应得
And I'm ready to hang for it.

739
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,170
再说
Besides...

740
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,810
我已经厌倦了
I'm awfully tired.

741
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,430
厌倦了没有你的人生
Tired of living without you.

742
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,160
我们还有可能在一起
There's still a way for us to be together.

743
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,320
不可能了
It's over.

744
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:02,780
你到底是怎么了
What's wrong with you?

745
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,460
难道你跟镇里其他人一样都疯了吗
Have you gone mad like everyone else in this town?

746
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:08,110
约翰  我向你发誓
John, I promise you --

747
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:09,440
不  别这样
No, don't.

748
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,920
你很清楚我们都不擅于遵守誓言
Neither of us is very good with promises, 

749
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,290
所以别再发誓了
so no more vows.

750
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:15,280
听我说
Listen to me.

751
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,950
我在听呢
I am listening to you,

752
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,880
可你说的根本不可能
and you aren't making any sense.

753
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:22,130
看看四周
Look around you.

754
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,900
这些坚固的石墙
These are stone walls.

755
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:29,280
装有栅栏的窗户
barred windows,

756
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,790
沉重的铁门
An iron door.

757
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:35,610
而我们头顶  是等待着我的绞索
Right above us, a thick rope awaiting my neck.

758
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,300
这都是铁一般的事实
Those are the stubborn facts.

759
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:40,640
就算你有全世界的爱
And all the love in the world

760
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,540
也改变不了任何一切
can't change a single one of them.

761
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:43,470
你错了
You're wrong.

762
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:45,690
爱远比这一切强大
Love is stronger than fact, 

763
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,210
比任何事物都强大
stronger than everything.

764
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,570
但我告诉你  约翰
But I tell you, John,

765
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,850
这世上仍有你我的容身之处
there is still a place for us in this world.

766
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,440
只有在梦里
Only in dreams.

767
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:00,340
既然这样
All right, then.

768
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,270
最后一次
One last time...

769
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:06,230
与我一起做个美梦吧
dream with me.

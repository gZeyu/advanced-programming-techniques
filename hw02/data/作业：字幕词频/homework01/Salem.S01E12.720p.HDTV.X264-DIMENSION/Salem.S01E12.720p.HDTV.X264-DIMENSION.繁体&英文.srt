第一季  第十二集

00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,520
《塞勒姆》前情提要
Previously on "Salem"...

16
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,130
我會找到梅西·路易絲
I will find Mercy Lewis

17
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,220
不管你們是否幫忙
with or without your help.

18
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,270
你是說我是...
Are you saying that I am...

19
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,350
是個巫師
A witch.

20
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,580
明天我會將約翰·奧登的案子提交委員會
Tomorrow I shall bring John Alden's case before the board.

21
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,730
他是無辜的
He is innocent.

22
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,600
你明明知道
And you know it.

23
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,930
奉英克里斯·麥哲之命
By order of Increase Mather,

24
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,720
我宣布逮捕你
I place you under arrest.

25
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,290
我決定為奧登上尉辯護
I've decided to defend Captain Alden.

26
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,440
為他辯護
To defend?

27
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,120
讓小孩子們都出現在我面前吧
Let the little children come unto me,

28
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,280
因為惡魔的王國屬于他們
For the kingdom of the devil belongs to them.

29
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,950
來
Come.

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,560
坐這兒  小可憐
Sit here, poor boy.

31
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,430
可憐的小家伙  因為家人而勞作致死
Poor, sweet boy, worked to death by your family.

32
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,580
你生命的每一天
Every day of your life,

33
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,630
令你無權埋葬在教堂的墓地里
making you unfit for burial in the churchyard,

34
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,220
于是他們把你扔在這兒
so they dumped you here.

35
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,020
愛麗絲
Alice.

36
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,290
分娩而死
Died in child birth,

37
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,040
懷上了你舅父的孩子
pregnant from your mother's brother.

38
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,800
孩子在那兒
There. There, the baby.

39
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,020
他被捂死來隱瞞事實
Smothered to hide the evidence.

40
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,500
讓他們母子不再分離
Let mother and child be together.

41
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,450
現在我是你們的母親
I am your mother now.

42
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,750
你們所有人的母親
All of you!

43
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,530
你們都是我的孩子
And you all are my children.

44
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,450
我父親路易絲牧師說
My father, the good Reverend Lewis,

45
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,330
世間并無煉獄
said that there is no purgatory,

46
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,700
迷失在天堂和地獄之間的靈魂無處安息
no place for souls lost between heaven and hell.

47
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,210
但他錯了
But he was wrong.

48
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,380
地球就是煉獄
Earth is purgatory.

49
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,360
我們是棲息在這片土地上的幽魂
We are the ghosts that haunt this land.

50
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,590
不  梅西
No, Mercy.

51
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,830
你還活生生的
You are very much alive.

52
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,490
或許比任何人都鮮活
Perhaps more alive than any of us.

53
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,190
只不過你像只幽魂一樣隱藏自己
Yet you have hidden yourself like a ghost.

54
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,210
英克里斯到處在找你
Increase searches everywhere for you.

55
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,990
他絕不會找到這兒
He will never look here.

56
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,480
但我的姑娘們
But my girls.

57
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,870
我那些可憐的姑娘們怎么辦
What of my poor girls?

58
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,240
他抓了她們四個
He has four of them.

59
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,800
但不要擔心
But do not fear for them or yourself.

60
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,310
很快我們的大祭典將凈化這片土地上
Soon our grand rite will cleanse this land of the evil men do

61
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,100
一切邪惡的人和事
and the men who do it,

62
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,070
就像圣經時代的大洪水
like the great flood of biblical times,

63
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,460
開辟通往我們新世界的道路
making way for our new world.

64
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,850
放心吧  梅西
And rest assured, Mercy...

65
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,640
你和你的姑娘們
you, your girls,

66
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,270
還有你的孩子們都會有立足之地
and all your children shall have a place there.

67
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,480
謝謝你
Oh, thank you.

68
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,730
但請告訴我
But tell me...

69
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,830
好讓我消除他們的疑慮
tell me so I may reassure them in their fear.

70
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,930
到底是什么
What is it?

71
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,270
什么將會來臨
What is coming?

72
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,200
死亡
Death.

73
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,770
*擂我戰鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

74
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,940
*鼓鳴震天*
*Witch drums*

75
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,510
*擂我戰鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

76
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,720
*擂我戰鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

77
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,940
*鼓鳴震天*
*The witch drums*

78
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,440
*寧入地獄*
*Better pray for hell*

79
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,610
*不留人間*
*Not hallelujah*

80
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
這是一個古老的真理
'tis an ancient proverbial truth

81
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,770
城門失火  殃及池魚
that it requires but one dead apple to rot an entire barrel.

82
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,360
我開始相信  只需要一顆爛蘋果
And I come to believe it requires but one apple

83
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,950
便能腐化整片大地
to make this whole land equally rotten.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,400
不是隨便一顆蘋果
And not just any apple,

85
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
而是惡靈
but the malum.

86
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,880
蘋果的圖像出現在
The icon of the apple

87
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,150
我們所了解的大祭典書里的每一頁
runs through almost every image we have of the grand rite.

88
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,950
大祭典會帶來死亡
The grand rite brings about death,

89
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,290
大規模的死亡
death on a mass scale.

90
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,350
對于它的操作  我們知之甚少
We know little of its operation,

91
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,430
更別說它將
nor the...the mechanism of magic

92
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,500
如何帶來死亡
that unleashes the... the death that follows.

93
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,840
只有這樣簡單的一句話
Only this one enigmatically simple sentence...

94
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,030
"開啟惡靈"
"Malum est aperta."

95
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,760
"邪惡的開始"
"The evil begins."

96
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,760
但這些年來我一直都理解錯了
But I have been misreading it all these years.

97
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,500
我們都理解錯了  包括我父親
We all have, my father included.

98
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,640
惡靈可以翻成邪惡  但也可以翻成蘋果
"Malum" Means "Evil," But equally "Apple."

99
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,240
現在這句話應該這么理解
And I know believe the sentence to read,

100
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,130
"開啟蘋果"
"The apple opens,"

101
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,470
也就是說  釋放了死亡
And, by implication, unleashes the death that results.

102
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,080
我記得我見過那個蘋果
I believe I have seen that apple,

103
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,220
或者裝著它的容器
or the box that contains it...

104
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,650
在約翰·奧登家里
In the house of John Alden.

105
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,790
誰啊
Yes?

106
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,800
麥哲牧師
Reverend Mather?

107
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,660
我知道很晚了
I know it is late.

108
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,360
這么晚你還在外面干嘛
What are you doing out?

109
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,880
抱歉
I'm sorry.

110
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,090
我不知道還能找誰
I didn't know who else to turn to.

111
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,610
你是唯一能幫助我的
You are the only one who can help me.

112
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,740
那你就來對了
Well, then you did the right thing by coming.

113
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,170
我要怎么幫你  幫你干什么
Uh...how may I help you, and...and with what?

114
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,110
你覺得有可能嗎  一個人身為巫師
Do you think it's possible to be a witch

115
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,850
卻不自知
and not even know it?

116
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,520
我想若是他把靈魂交給了撒旦
I-I think one would know

117
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,480
他應該是知道的
if one had...deeded one's soul to satan.

118
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,620
但若是別人代勞的呢
But what if someone deeded it for you?

119
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,240
我向你保證  霍爾小姐
I can assure you, Miss Hale...

120
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,600
不  我不要你的保證
No. I want more than your assurance.

121
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:24,890
我要...
I want...

122
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,320
我要你現在就檢查一下我
I want you to examine me now...

123
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,560
看看我有沒有惡魔之印記
for the mark of the devil.

124
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,870
然后你就能向我保證了
Then, you may assure me.

125
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,990
我感覺不到惡魔的跡象
I feel no sign of satan.

126
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,640
在我看來  你各個方面
You seem, to me, in every respect,

127
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,230
都沒有被惡魔侵襲
unmolested by the devil.

128
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:25,890
我向你保證  霍爾小姐
I assure you, Miss Hale,

129
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,730
如果你是巫師  你肯定會知道的
If you were a witch, you would know it.

130
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,290
不要問此鐘為誰而鳴
Ask not for whom the bell tolls.

131
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,870
它是為...
It tolls for...

132
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,490
誰是第一個呢
I wonder who will be first.

133
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,110
是誰呢
Who will it be?

134
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,400
你是什么意思
What do you mean?

135
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,800
開口的人就不用遭受燒灼之痛
Whoever will speak will not burn.

136
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,090
很簡單
Simple.

137
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,940
今晚這里有點悶啊  是不是
Close in here this evening, no?

138
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,330
我先出去呼吸一下新鮮空氣
Think I'll take some air.

139
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,620
我出去期間  你們...
While I'm gone, consider...

140
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,990
想想誰先開口說明
which of you will be the first to confess

141
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,970
巫師約翰·奧登對你們做了什么
what the witch John Alden did to you.

142
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,600
梅西  謝天謝地
Mercy, thank God.

143
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,760
我們撐不住了
We cannot hold on.

144
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,710
他要逼我們背叛你
He is going to make us turn.

145
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,420
但是你來救我們的對嗎
But you have come to save us?

146
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,270
不  不是這樣
No, it doesn't work that way.

147
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,480
你們還沒準備好像我一樣改變
You're not ready to travel as I do.

148
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,400
但要記住  我們仍然侍奉暗夜女王
But remember, we still serve the queen of the night,

149
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,240
她跟我一樣  絕對不會忘記你們
and she has not forgotten you any more than I have,

150
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,210
她一定會來救你們的
and there will be a day where she will save you.

151
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,430
我保證
I promise.

152
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,370
但是現在
But for now,

153
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,580
你們必須給那個老家伙他想要的東西
you must give that old goat what he wants.

154
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,190
我特別害怕他要給我們上刑
I'm terribly afraid it's us he's going to serve up.

155
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,210
這當然是她有意為之
This is surely part of her design.

156
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,840
她的網比我們的網都大
Her web is greater than all of ours,

157
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,260
而且她能預示未來
and she has a vision,

158
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,500
預示這片土地未來的樣子
a vision of what this land could be.

159
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,610
所以麥哲牧師讓你們
So do as reverend Mather asks

160
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,070
在審判時指證約翰·奧登的話你們照做就行
and speak against John Alden at the trial.

161
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,420
{\an8}幾代人都失敗的事你成功了

162
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,070
{\an8}大祭典快完成了

163
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,080
{\an8}我們還需要的五名受害者已經準備好

164
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,030
{\an8}所有人都將在月出時分死去

165
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,740
{\an8}然后惡靈將會開啟

166
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,340
惡靈開啟
Malum aperta.

167
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,690
但為何要傷害約翰·奧登
But why John Alden?

168
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,210
{\an8}那是犧牲

169
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,430
{\an8}你已經做出了很大的犧牲

170
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,430
{\an8}你為這片樹林獻出了一個小生靈

171
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,640
{\an8}所以你應該知道

172
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,230
{\an8}這樣才能稱之為犧牲

173
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,610
{\an8}就是傷害

174
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,450
但他是無辜的
But he is innocent.

175
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,290
{\an8}對

176
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,460
{\an8}無辜者的鮮血

177
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,200
{\an8}惡靈即將開啟

178
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,470
{\an8}很多無辜之人會死去

179
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,220
{\an8}多死他一個又何妨

180
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,710
對我來說很重要
It matters to me.

181
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,050
{\an8}你小時候我們就認識你

182
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,510
{\an8}我們把你撫養長大

183
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,680
{\an8}你就像我們的親生女兒一樣

184
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,780
{\an8}你哭泣時

185
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,780
{\an8}我們也哭泣

186
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,850
{\an8}你流血時

187
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,930
{\an8}我們也流血

188
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,730
{\an8}現在流的即是血淚

189
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:44,140
{\an8}但這血和淚是我們的武器

190
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,900
{\an8}你生性如此

191
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,250
{\an8}任何事都無法改變

192
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,260
瑪麗  你聽我說
Mary, listen to me.

193
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,060
放了他會在他面前暴露你
To free him would reveal what you are to him.

194
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,770
你覺得這樣他還會愛你嗎
You think he could love you then?

195
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,790
不要失去他的愛
Do not lose his love.

196
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,480
為了我們要加以利用
Use it for all of us.

197
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,420
這就是應該做出的犧牲
That is the sacrifice.

198
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,790
在所有關于巫術還有惡魔的作品中
In all of the literature on witchcraft,

199
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,660
"惡靈"就是指邪惡
on malice, malum is "Evil."

200
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,720
所以你告訴我為什么現在
So you tell me why, in this particular case,

201
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,120
它指的是"蘋果"
should it signify "Apple"?

202
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,220
我有理由相信我們聽說的惡靈
I have reason to believe the malum referred to here

203
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,050
指的是實物
is an actual object,

204
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,840
這個物體已經在塞勒姆等著對付我們了
and that object is here in Salem awaiting use against us.

205
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,110
這個說法很有意思
Well, it's an interesting theorem,

206
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,240
但是  不符合理性思維的基本原則
but...it fails the most basic tenet of rational thinking.

207
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,760
你告訴我  兩點之間最短的距離是什么
Tell me...the shortest distance between two points is...?

208
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,010
-直線  -對
- A line. - Correct.

209
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,520
通常
And often,

210
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,760
最簡單的解釋就是正確的解釋
the simplest explanation is the correct explanation.

211
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,660
我只是想阻止大祭典
I'm only trying to stop the grand rite.

212
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,810
阻止大祭典
Stop the grand rite?

213
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,050
你嗎
You?

214
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,130
天哪  真是年少無知啊
Oh, my, the arrogance of youth.

215
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,880
你知道怎么阻止嗎
Would you even know how to stop it?

216
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,270
知道代價是什么嗎
And at what cost?

217
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,460
還是你想聽聽
Or would you like to hear from one

218
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,540
的確付出過代價阻止過它的人說一說
who actually has stopped it and has paid the cost?

219
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,160
你嗎
You?

220
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,190
我都不知道
I never knew.

221
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,090
多年以前
Many years ago.

222
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,470
在馬爾堡
In Marburg.

223
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,020
你當時還在襁褓之中
You were still just a-a baby.

224
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,900
德國的巫師
The German witches, oh,

225
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,490
比埃塞克斯的巫師大膽得多
far bolder than even the Essex witches.

226
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,580
他們想完成大祭典
They attempted the grand rite.

227
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,270
一個月之內  有十二名兒童失蹤
Within the space of a month, a dozen children disappeared.

228
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,410
后來發現他們已成干尸
Their bodies were found bled dry.

229
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,910
他們無辜的鮮血浸透了大地
Their innocent blood soaked the ground.

230
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,700
隨著滿月的臨近  更多兒童失蹤
And as the full moon approached, more children disappeared,

231
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,760
我知道大祭典就要完成
And I knew the grand rite was nearing its completion.

232
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,100
所以其他人在搜尋孩子們
So while others searched for the children,

233
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,540
而我去追捕了巫師
I hunted the witch.

234
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,160
我找到了他
And I found him.

235
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,180
他看起來就是六歲的小女孩
He had taken the appearance of a 6-year-old girl,

236
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,400
但我知道他根本不是小女孩
but I knew this was no girl.

237
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,780
就是他
It was him.

238
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,870
我徒手扼死了他
And I strangled her with my bare hands.

239
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:04,790
生命即將離開那具軀體之時
And as the life left that body,

240
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,110
惡魔現身了  想要搶走軀體
the devil reached out and snatched the body,

241
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,140
但我緊抓不放
but I held on.

242
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,620
我決意不讓他回到地獄的家園
I was determined that he should not return to his home in hell.

243
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,760
我的雙手被沸騰的黑瀝青包裹
And my hands were plunged into the boiling black tar.

244
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,870
地獄之火
Hellfire.

245
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,920
這雙手曾經觸碰過地獄
These hands have actually touched hell.

246
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,830
如今依然灼燒著我
And they burn me still.

247
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,960
但大祭典被終止了
But the grand rite was averted?

248
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,890
只有一條路能終止大祭典
There really is only one way to stop the grand rite.

249
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,660
在月圓之夜一切結束之前
One must kill the witch that began it

250
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,490
殺死開啟大祭典的巫師
before the moonrise that ends it.

251
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,900
放在這一次
In this case

252
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,250
就是殺了約翰·奧登
kill John Alden.

253
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,440
很顯然
It's no secret

254
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,350
約翰·奧登對我們懷揣冰冷而偏執的恨意
that John Alden has a cold and a willful hatred for us,

255
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,780
恨所有我們相信之事
For everything we believe

256
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,570
恨我們清教徒團體的圣潔之人
and for our puritan community of saints.

257
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,890
故事是這樣的
And so, it was

258
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:29,530
年少的約翰·奧登和塞勒姆斷絕了關系
that a young John Alden severed himself from Salem

259
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:35,290
漂泊無依  沒有信仰和愛情
and, rootless, faithless, and loveless,

260
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,670
把自己放逐到殘忍的戰爭之中
cast himself into the crucible of war,

261
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,260
在那里  他被野蠻的印第安人俘虜
where he was captured by the heathen indians.

262
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:46,740
心里的惡魔之種  已打上堅硬而惡毒之結
And that seed of evil within, already a hard and vicious knot,

263
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,990
此時找到了滋養發育的沃土
found fertile ground in which to flourish.

264
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,930
憤怒而可畏的諸神  其座下的野蠻奴仆
And the savage servants of the angry, eldritch Gods,

265
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,450
他們發現奧登承有撒旦之天賦
they saw in Alden a gift from Satan,

266
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,990
這個強大而可怕的武器
A powerful and vicious weapon

267
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,960
能在他們對我們的絕望之戰中大有可為
to be used in their hopeless war against us.

268
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,300
因此  由于對我們的恨意
And so, because of his hatred for us

269
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,140
對背棄之人的恨意
and his hatred for one he felt had betrayed him,

270
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,940
他成為了強大而可怕的武器
a powerful and a vicious weapon he became.

271
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,470
先生  這完全是想象
Sir, this is pure fancy,

272
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,820
大膽的猜想
Bald conjecture.

273
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,230
當奧登上尉為了我們大家
You have no idea what may

274
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,140
和印第安人浴血奮戰
or may not have happened to captain Alden

275
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,640
或是被俘之時  做過或沒做過什么
while fighting for all our lives against the indians

276
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,570
你都無從知曉
or when he was held their captive.

277
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,020
好啊  那就讓他自己說
Well, then, let him speak.

278
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,570
此時此刻就讓奧登自己說
Let Alden tell us here and now

279
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,960
你被困在那群野蠻人中那么久
exactly what transpired during that long period of time

280
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,080
真相到底如何
when you were lost amongst the savages.

281
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:39,960
說吧
Speak, man.

282
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,960
說
Speak!

283
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,010
不說嗎
No?

284
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,600
那么多年  他能在做什么
All those years, what could he have been doing?

285
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,050
我來告訴你
I will tell you.

286
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,010
就像《約伯記》中撒旦所做的
Like Satan in the Book of Job,

287
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,960
他在大地上徘徊
He was walking to and fro upon the earth

288
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,150
精進邪惡之具
mastering the tools of malice,

289
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,930
習得黑暗之術
learning the dark art

290
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,380
派遣操縱他的惡魔親信  它們聽他吩咐
of sending demonic familiars to do his bidding at a distance.

291
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,520
你們能看到  這里  在他脖頸之上
You will observe, here, upon his neck...

292
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,380
浮起一個堅硬如鐵  帶孔的腫塊
an iron-hard, raised lump with a hole,

293
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:22,360
他就是在這兒喂養他的隨從
and it was here where he suckles his familiars.

294
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,960
你不得再笑
You will not laugh again.

295
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,260
我相信你一定暗笑過許多次
I'm sure you have laughed many times to think how,

296
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,720
能在這位忠誠的年輕妻子眼前
beneath the very nose of a devoted young wife,

297
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,560
把我們的領袖  曾經強健的喬治·西布里
you turned our leader, a once robust George Sibley,

298
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,880
變成了今天備受折磨的樣子
into a suffering heap that he is today.

299
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,000
當你瓦解了我們的中流砥柱之后
And after you had undermined the pillar of our community,

300
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,040
你便開始宣揚恐怖
you unleashed a campaign of terror.

301
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,540
是奧登制造了恐慌  那個邪惡的老巫婆
It was Alden who projected that specter of dread, the night hag,

302
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,330
還教唆了梅西·路易絲
to terrorize Mercy Lewis.

303
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,730
你會問"為什么是梅西·路易絲"
And you will ask, "Why? Why Mercy Lewis?"

304
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,970
也許是因為她的父親  親愛的路易絲牧師
Well, perhaps it was because her father, the good reverend Lewis,

305
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:09,050
把奧登痛失的愛人嫁給了可恨的對手
married Alden's bitterly lost love to a hated rival,

306
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:15,380
又或者只是想表明  塞勒姆無人安全
or perhaps it was just to show that no one in Salem is safe,

307
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:19,160
即使是備受祝福的牧師之女
not even the daughter of a blessed reverend.

308
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,480
柯頓
Cotton!

309
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,900
你照顧過梅西·路易絲
You attended Mercy Lewis.

310
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,330
你很清楚是什么害了她
You had no doubt as to what ailed her.

311
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,060
她的確遭受鬼靈襲擊
She was indeed under spectral attack,

312
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,000
但奧登上尉
But Captain Alden --

313
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,710
奧登上尉  當他目睹此般襲擊之時
Captain Alden...what did he say

314
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,020
他說了什么
when he witnessed such an attack?

315
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,650
他提出了一些質疑
He cast some doubt upon it.

316
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,570
一些質疑
Some doubt!

317
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,260
我聽說
I am told...

318
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,640
他說這是
He said it was...

319
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,800
"一派胡言"
"Bullshit."

320
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,530
他還說這些祈禱是無用的
And he said that prayers were worthless.

321
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,540
祈禱  無用
Prayer? Worthless?

322
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,170
問問你們自己
Ask yourselves --

323
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,510
每次我們試圖抓捕阻止巫師
every time we have attempted to catch and stop a witch,

324
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,180
是誰挺身而出為其辯護
who has risen up to defend them?

325
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,490
我們當中又是誰  一次又一次
Who alone among us, in encounter, time after time,

326
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,820
遇到巫師  卻屢屢毫發無傷
with witches has emerged with nary a scratch upon him?

327
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,940
吉爾斯·科里瀕死之時說了誰的名字
Whose name was on Giles Corey's lips as he died?

328
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,240
又是誰曾經宣稱  要讓這里的所有人陪葬
Who has proclaimed that he will see every man here in his grave?

329
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,690
誰站出來為布里奇特·畢謝普辯護
And who stood up to defend Bridget Bishop

330
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,760
即使親眼目睹了她制造的怪物
even in the very sight of the monstrosity she had created?

331
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,630
我向你們發誓
I swear to you

332
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:37,090
這個男人每次開口  就罪加一等
this man condemns himself every time he opens his mouth.

333
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,210
就像伊甸園的撒旦
And like Satan in the Garden of Eden,

334
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,010
約翰·奧登明白  女人是敞開的大門
John Alden understands that women are the open doorway

335
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,290
惡魔通過女人  毒害我們大家
through which evil enters to poison us all.

336
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,900
有多少女人  年長或年幼  好或壞
How many women, young and old, good and bad,

337
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,650
被奧登變成了巫師
has Alden bewitched?

338
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,190
有人目睹  即使是這里地位最崇高的女人
It has been seen that John Alden attempted to seduce

339
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,570
約翰·奧登竟也企圖勾引
even the highest women in the land.

340
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,700
西布里夫人
Mary Sibley.

341
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,100
被告是否曾在夜深人靜時
Did not the accused forcibly enter your house,

342
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,580
強行闖入您家  不  是您的臥房
Nay, into your very boudoir, in the dead of night?

343
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,650
我會允許這種事發生嗎
Would I allow such a thing?

344
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,480
我不知道
I do not know.

345
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,540
但您的仆人證實
But your servant man has testified

346
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:23,140
奧登的確在夜晚強行闖入過
That Alden did indeed forcibly make entry in the night.

347
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,430
他是來討論政治的
He came to discuss politics.

348
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,950
-政治  -正是
- Politics? - Indeed.

349
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,120
他是來表明
To announce his intention

350
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,980
他想接替他父親在委員會一職的意圖
To take his father's seat on the select board.

351
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,730
大半夜的去說這個
In the middle of the night?

352
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,330
霍爾小姐
Miss Hale.

353
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,120
有人看見被告在公開場合強吻你
The accused was seen kissing you forcibly in public.

354
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,700
當然罪不在你
There is no blame attached to you.

355
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,020
你只是個手無縛雞之力的少女
You are a... a slight and defenseless slip of a girl.

356
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,550
但此事屬實嗎
But do you deny it?

357
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,220
屬實
He did.

358
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,800
此事屬實
He did.

359
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,290
約翰·奧登一直是個潛在的危險
A snake in the grass is what John Alden was

360
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,950
現在也是
And what john alden is.

361
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:23,210
他不是試圖引誘西布里夫人
And when he was not attempting to seduce his betters,

362
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,790
便是在滿是妓女的房間里
He was satiating his own inhuman lusts

363
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,860
在他手下的女巫所開的妓院里
in roomfuls of whores,

364
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:32,090
填補自己非人的欲壑
in the brothel run by his very own witches.

365
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:37,420
而最糟的是  塞勒姆的年輕姑娘們
And, worst of all, I think, the tender, young maidens of Salem,

366
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,120
卻迫不及待想成為他的犧牲品
So eager to fall prey to his serpentine ways.

367
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,910
梅西告訴我們
Mercy told us it was 

368
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:57,060
就是約翰·奧登踏夜前來
it was John Alden who came I-in the shadows in the night,

369
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:03,830
親吻著  舔舐著她身體的每一寸肌膚
that he...he kissed and licked and bit every part of her.

370
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,750
但他用巫術使她無法說出他的名字
But he bewitched her so she might not name his name

371
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,130
而讓她把罪責推給一個老巫婆
But she might blame all on the hag.

372
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:16,530
他在夜晚用魔鬼之身帶走了她
He took her in the night in spectral form

373
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:22,600
并把她的身體和靈魂都交給了惡魔
and gave her body and soul to the devil himself.

374
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,560
之后  她用巫術和游戲
And she... she drew us in after that

375
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,260
把我們也引進了他的圈套
w-with magical tricks a-and games.

376
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,670
很快  我們就在樹林里與他共舞了
And, soon, we were dancing in the woods with him,

377
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,590
我們相互愛撫  一個接一個地
Where we touched each other and, one after the other,

378
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,670
倒在他懷中
Laid with him.

379
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,790
是嗎
Really?

380
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,640
你們所有人
All of you?

381
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,520
艾米莉  你是說
Are you saying, Emily...

382
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,300
你已不是處子了嗎
that you are not a maiden?

383
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,180
如果我要檢查你
If I were to examine you,

384
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,360
請一位女士檢查你
Have one of the women here examine you...

385
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,800
她們會發現你已經不是完璧之身了嗎
They would find that you are not intact?

386
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,630
他用舌頭和指尖
He...he has tongue and fingers

387
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,380
還有暗藏的尋歡的...器具
and invisible instruments of...of pleasure.

388
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,790
但我閉上了眼
But I-I had my eyes closed.

389
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,180
我不知道他做了什么
I don't know what he did.

390
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,080
這些都是幻想
These are phantasms,

391
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,410
都是腦海中捏造出來的
fabrications of the mind.

392
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,860
我們在座的有哪位  即便是無意的
And who here among us has not had,

393
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:54,290
沒有動過一絲淫念呢
even involuntarily, some heated thoughts?

394
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,200
這女孩的神智已經近乎崩潰
This girl has been overwhelmed by them.

395
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:02,270
尤其是當面對我父親那些
Especially in the face of extreme torture

396
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,040
無所不用其極的酷刑
by my own father.

397
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,720
被綁上拷問臺
Put to the rack, 

398
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,790
遭受死亡的威脅
threatened with death,

399
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,630
即便是個無辜的女孩也會以為自己是巫師
Even an innocent girl might think herself a witch,

400
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,750
并覺得周圍的所有男人都是惡魔
and any man around her a devil.

401
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,840
我認為  你們今天在此看到的一切
I submit to you that everything you have seen here today

402
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:24,490
都是宗教法庭嚴刑逼供的結果
is the result of torture worthy of the inquisition!

403
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,120
到底是誰真正在殘害女人
Who is it who has really violated women?

404
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,510
約翰·奧登嗎
John Alden?

405
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:37,670
還是那個擁有
Or one who possesses...

406
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,140
并使用
and uses...

407
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,150
這種工具的人
Tools such as this?!

408
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,330
你怎么敢
How dare you?

409
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,530
不  先生  是你怎么敢  
No, sir! How dare you?!

410
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:59,080
今日暫且休庭
This session is suspended for the day!

411
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,520
明早等大家冷靜下來再繼續
We will resume in the morning when tempers have cooled.

412
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,900
整個鎮子都想絞死我
The whole town wants to hang me

413
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,650
就好像我是什么怪物
Like I'm some kind of monster,

414
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,620
好像我有什么黑暗的魔法
Like I possess some dark, magic power.

415
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,960
你確實有
And you do.

416
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,400
連你也要這么說嗎
Oh, not you, too.

417
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,440
不
No.

418
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,820
我不相信你是巫師
Don't believe you're a witch.

419
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,220
但我相信你的確擁有一件屬于黑暗魔法的物件
But I do believe you possess something of dark, magic power.

420
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,880
你把惡靈藏在哪里
Where is the malum?

421
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,640
什么
What?

422
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,570
那個盒子
The box.

423
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,680
你發現的那個
The box you found

424
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,890
用它將老巫婆引到你家的盒子
That lured that infernal witch to your house.

425
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,310
怎么了
Why?

426
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,900
我相信那就是傳說中的惡靈
I believe it is the fabled malum,

427
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,520
大祭典的關鍵
the key to the grand rite.

428
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,120
又是你書上那些胡說八道的東西嗎
This more of your book nonsense?

429
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,180
那盒子上有圖案
That box covered in images...

430
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,340
我相信那是巫師們最強大的武器
I believe it is the greatest weapon of the witches,

431
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,810
里面藏有某種
that it contains some kind of

432
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,240
超自然的毀滅性事物
Supernatural agent of destruction

433
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,460
一旦大祭典完成就會被開啟
which will open when the grand rite is completed,

434
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,070
厄運就會被釋放
Releasing its doom upon us like...

435
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,160
就像潘多拉的魔盒
like the myth of Pandora.

436
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,920
聽著  如果那東西真是你說的那樣
Look, if that thing is what you say it is,

437
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:23,650
你父親要是知道它在我手里
And your father knows that I have it,

438
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,750
那它就將是釘死我的最后一根釘子
That is the final nail in my coffin.

439
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,500
可如果它是我們唯一的機會呢
And what if it's the only chance we have?

440
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,730
在吉爾斯那
Giles has it.

441
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,760
吉爾斯
Giles?

442
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,590
吉爾斯·科里已經死了
Giles Corey is dead.

443
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,820
我埋在他的墳墓里了
And I buried it in his grave.

444
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,580
你知道要怎么做吧
You know what to do with it?

445
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,510
父親  我得跟你談談
Father, I must speak to you.

446
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,520
怎么
What now?

447
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,350
要來繼續羞辱我嗎
More disrespect?

448
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,210
不是
No.

449
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,000
父親大人
Sir.

450
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,350
盡管我依然認為你的行事方法大錯特錯
I still think what you do is fundamentally wrong,

451
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,200
一定有其他方法解決問題  可是
that there must be other ways, but...

452
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,890
我很害怕
I am afraid.

453
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,450
非常害怕
Deathly afraid.

454
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,680
雖然我們對行事手段意見相悖
I fear, while we disagree on methods,

455
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,590
但我們都致力于中止大祭典的完成
we are both determined to stop the grand rite.

456
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,370
我很欣慰至少你明白這點
I'm gratified that you at least acknowledge that.

457
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,310
惡靈在這里
The malum is here.

458
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,430
或者說曾經在
Or was.

459
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,900
我見過它
I saw it.

460
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,560
甚至觸摸過它
I touched it, even.

461
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,540
真的嗎
Indeed?

462
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,800
那它在哪兒
Then where is it?

463
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,060
我不知道
I don't know.

464
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,700
告訴我你是在哪里見到它的
Tell me where you saw it.

465
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,570
在約翰·奧登家里
In John Alden's house.

466
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,050
父親  你不明白
Father, you don't understand.

467
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,320
他是在幫我
He was helping me.

468
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,060
是他設陷阱抓住女巫  并與我一起
It was he who trapped the witch and carried her with me

469
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,620
將她帶到叢林里審問然后殺了她的
to the woods to question and kill her.

470
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,470
是你不明白
You don't understand.

471
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,800
從某種意義上說  女巫和我們并無兩樣
In some respects, the witches are not unlike us.

472
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,680
他們也分派系
They have factions. 

473
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,020
有權力爭斗
They have power struggles.

474
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,240
你的朋友奧登不是在抓巫師
Your friend Alden was not trying to catch a witch.

475
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,290
他是在排除異己
He was eliminating a rival.

476
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,050
你被自己的疑惑蒙蔽了雙眼
You are blinded by your own doubt,

477
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,890
這樣最終會毀掉你
and it will destroy you!

478
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,480
要是我向你承認還有一絲機會
If I grant you that there is a possibility 

479
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,120
那個奧登是清白的
that Alden is innocent,

480
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,040
你就不能看出
can you not grant the possibility

481
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,830
還有十分之一  不  百分之一的機率
that there is a 1 in 10, nay, a 1 in 100 chance

482
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,330
我可能是正確的嗎
that I am right?!

483
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,270
如果是這樣  千百民眾將生靈涂炭
And if I am, thousands will perish.

484
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,420
國將不國
The nation itself may fall.

485
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,950
我們能冒這個險嗎  我不能
Can we take that chance? I cannot.

486
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,900
你能嗎
Can you?

487
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,820
我告訴你  柯頓
I tell you, Cotton,

488
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,050
你對此人的了解
you do not know this man nearly  

489
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,520
并沒有你自己所認為的那樣多
as well as you think you do.

490
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,420
我搜查了吉爾斯·科里的墳墓
I searched Giles Corey's grave.

491
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,650
惡靈不在那兒
The malum wasn't there.

492
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,630
不可能  我親手埋葬的他
That's impossible. I buried it myself.

493
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,770
還有誰知道這事
Who else knew?

494
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:08,900
沒有人
No one.

495
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,060
只有你
Just you.

496
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,140
你不相信我
And you don't believe me.

497
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,670
我不確定該相信誰了
I'm not sure what to believe.

498
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,120
我只確定兩件事
I am certain only of two things.

499
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,740
我們所有人是生是死
All our lives may depend on

500
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,920
都在于是否找到惡靈并將其摧毀
finding and destroying the malum.

501
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,480
然后呢
And?

502
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,770
你對我或許不是那么誠實
And you are being less than honest with me.

503
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,980
我已經告訴你一切了
I've told you everything.

504
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,340
到底發生什么事了
What the hell is going on?!

505
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,890
上去
Get up.

506
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,510
那幾個姑娘是無辜的
Those girls are innocent!

507
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,250
請原諒我
Forgive me!

508
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,390
我唯一感到懊悔的事
It's the only thing I regret 

509
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,480
就是編造了關于你的謊話
lying about you!

510
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,360
我知道他們都對你做了什么
Look, I know what they did to you.

511
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,260
不是你的錯
It's not your fault.

512
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,430
快過來
Get over here!

513
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,520
該死的
Damn you!

514
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,400
快做點什么  她們只是些小姑娘而已
Do something! They're just girls!

515
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,690
你  你承諾說會放過我們的
You! You promised you'd spare us!

516
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,550
我放過你們不受這個世界的火刑之苦
I am sparing you the flames of this world

517
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,240
還有來世
and of the next.

518
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,930
你們不會痛苦太久
You will not suffer long.

519
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:57,980
你們腿上都加了全套重物
A full measure of mercy is being added to your legs.

520
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:00,760
放開我
Let go of me!

521
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,390
父親  你說謊
Father, you lied!

522
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,330
你承諾過這些姑娘不會
You promised these girls they wouldn't --

523
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,260
被燒死
Burn.

524
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,050
她們不會被燒死
Nor shall they.

525
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,210
別這樣  父親
Don't do this, father.

526
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,380
這樣做怎么可能會有用呢
How can this possibly help?

527
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,690
你自己也說過了她們是受害者
You said yourself they were victims!

528
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,640
雖然遺憾但這是事實
Sad but true.

529
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,210
她們已經被惡魔玷污
But they're tainted... by the devil.

530
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,700
恐怕如今正懷著他的種
I fear they carry his very seed.

531
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,830
你怎么能確定呢
How can you be certain?

532
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,280
我十分確定
I am certain.

533
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,680
我確定她們對于塞勒姆造成的威脅
I am certain of the threat they pose to Salem,

534
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,570
正如我確定你的軟弱會成為對你的威脅
just as I am certain that your weakness poses a threat.

535
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,910
不過重中之重
But above all,

536
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,200
我確信
I am certain that,

537
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,210
如同外科醫生一般
like a surgeon, 

538
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,650
我別無選擇只有切除
I have no choice but to cut out

539
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:36,100
惡疾的病灶
the malignant manifestation of malice

540
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,660
才能防止疾病進一步擴散
before it can spread any further.

541
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,280
不要  停下
No! Stop!

542
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,630
請救救我啊  救我  救我
Please help me! Please! Please!

543
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,530
退下
Get back!

544
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,650
被地域煉火燒死吧
Burn in hell!

545
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,560
燒死她們
Let them burn!

546
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,890
梅西
Mercy!

547
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,040
你在哪兒
Where are you?!

548
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,290
梅西
Mercy!

549
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,420
怎么了
What is it?

550
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,600
多莉  發生什么了
Dollie, what has happened?

551
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,360
艾米莉  伊麗莎白  蘇珊娜和查麗蒂
Emily, Elizabeth, Susanna, and Charity --

552
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,400
英克里斯·麥哲把她們全絞死了
Increase Mather has hung them all.

553
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,580
你曾發誓她們會安全的
You swore that they would be safe,

554
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,850
但是她們死了
but they're dead!

555
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,570
她們所有人都死了
All of them have been killed!

556
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,960
你說你的主人會保護我們
You said your master would protect us,

557
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,480
當她卻什么都沒做
and she did nothing!

558
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,880
回去塞勒姆
Go back to Salem.

559
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,450
召集年輕人
Gather the young,

560
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,880
窮人  痛苦之人
the poor, the suffering.

561
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:36,130
他們將會作為我們的軍隊
They will be our army.

562
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,280
新的時代即將到來
A new day is upon us.

563
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,880
而那個新的時代需要
And that new day demands

564
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,460
一位新的黑夜女王
a new queen of the night!

565
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,380
我知道你們大多數人很難接受
I know that so many of you find it hard to accept,

566
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,230
不敢相信那約翰·奧登
impossible to believe that John Alden,

567
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,060
我們奠基者的兒子
son of one of our founders 

568
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,800
守衛我們的好士兵
and a brave soldier in our defense,

569
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:02,200
居然私自修行邪惡巫術
is guilty of malefic witchcraft.

570
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:03,490
沒關系
Fine.

571
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,330
隨你們怎么想
Fine!

572
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,930
不管你相不相信  都沒有關系
Suspend your belief or not. It doesn't matter.

573
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,160
唯一重要的
The only thing that matters 

574
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,100
只有讓奧登
is that Alden...

575
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,260
被判有罪
be convicted

576
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:19,620
并對他真實的一面進行判罰
and sentenced for what he truly is,

577
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,410
他叛徒與殺人犯的一面
a traitor and a murderer.

578
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,340
什么
What?

579
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,290
你這是什么意思
Whatever do you mean?

580
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:30,210
我提出約翰·奧登與印第安人在一起時
I submit that while John Alden was with the indians,

581
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,210
他不僅與他們交往
he not only took up with them.

582
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,300
還拿起武器對抗自己的人民
He took up arms against his own people,

583
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,100
屠殺了他的戰友  那些民兵團員
Slaughtering militiamen in his own company,

584
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,870
那些年輕的英國好小伙  一個沒留
good new england men, every one of them.

585
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:47,740
我發誓這是真的
I swear this to be true.

586
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:52,360
我打賭約翰·奧登絕不敢否認
And I dare John Alden to deny it!

587
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,360
你敢不敢告訴大家
I dare you to tell me

588
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,660
你沒有在臉上涂滿顏料
that you did not paint your face 

589
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,600
成為一名野蠻印第安人
as a heathen Indian

590
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,110
然后砸碎了你同伴的頭顱
and smash the skulls of men in your own company!

591
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,260
無理的指控
Outrageous accusations!

592
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,590
你從哪聽來的此等胡言
Wherever did you find such nonsense?

593
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,520
我有來自奴隸緹圖芭的證詞
I have sworn testimony from the slave Tituba!

594
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,000
謊言與幻想
Lies and fantasies.

595
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,460
謊言  上尉
Lies? Captain?

596
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,580
幻想
Fantasies?

597
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,530
你要否認控告嗎
Do you dispute the charges?

598
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,490
說話
Speak.

599
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:28,920
上尉
Captain...

600
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,130
這都是真的嗎
is this all true?

601
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,990
這里每個有理智的人都知道我不是巫師
Every sane man in this place knows I ain't a witch.

602
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,460
你是叛徒嗎
Are you a traitor?

603
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,120
你是殺人犯嗎
Are you a murderer?

604
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,790
該死的  約翰  回答他
Damn you, John. Answer him.

605
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,740
正如你所看到的
So, you see...

606
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,000
有時候  沉默是最力的供訴
Sometimes, silence can be the most eloquent confession of all.

607
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,580
我深信不疑
I have no doubt, not a sliver of a doubt,

608
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,980
約翰·奧登是個巫師
that John Alden is a witch.

609
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,860
但是
But...

610
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,550
即便不為此
even had I not...

611
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,810
我依然堅持
I would still maintain

612
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,530
他必須被吊死
that he must hang 

613
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,230
為他那些無法否認的罪行
for crimes he will not deny.

614
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,500
你也該如此
And nor should you.

615
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,180
看在上帝的份上  告訴我父親是錯的
For god's sake, tell me my father is wrong.

616
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,280
告訴我你不是他說的那種人
Tell me you are not the man he says you are.

617
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,820
現在還重要嗎
What does it matter now?

618
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,070
對我很重要
It matters to me --

619
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,480
這決定你是否一直在騙我
Whether you duped me all this time.

620
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,310
你真想知道真相嗎
Are you sure you want the truth?

621
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,470
你真的清楚明白
Are you really damn sure

622
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,240
善與惡之間的區別嗎
you know the difference between good and evil?

623
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,830
因為你們這些清教徒
'cause you puritans,

624
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,990
認為世界只有黑與白
you think the world is just black and white.

625
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,520
但如果我告訴你
What if the truth of the world is 

626
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,970
這是一個灰色的世界呢
that it's nothing but gray?

627
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,390
經過大沼澤一戰
After the battle of the great swamp,

628
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,260
我被部隊遺棄  只能等死
I was left for dead.

629
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,770
但莫霍克人發現了我
But I was found by the Mohawk --

630
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,130
不是那些與我們對戰的印第安人
Not the indians we fought, no.

631
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,420
莫霍克人雖然不是我們的朋友
The Mohawk aren't our friends,

632
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,920
但他們是與我們戰斗的阿布納基人的敵人
but they are the enemies of the Abenaki we fight.

633
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,070
說句實話  我
In all honesty, I...

634
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:42,160
我想我永遠不會明白他們為什么要救我
I don't think I'll ever understand why they saved me.

635
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,040
直到現在依然困惑著我
It is a mystery to me to this day.

636
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,220
你老頭子找到的那個傷疤
The scar your old man found

637
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,540
他說是用來喂養親信的那個
he said was from feeding a familiar?

638
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,070
那是他們把鉛彈從我體內取出
That was from digging a ball of lead out of me

639
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,310
并用他們的藥品治療后留下的傷疤
and healing it with their medicines.

640
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,980
他們想用你換取贖金嗎
They held you for ransom?

641
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,050
不
No.

642
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,170
他們待我以仁慈和尊敬
They treated me with kindness and respect.

643
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,480
而且他們的圣者對我很感興趣
And their holy men took an interest in me.

644
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,110
我不知道為什么或是他看上了我哪點
I'm not even sure why or what he saw in me,

645
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,280
不過如果不是他
but if he hadn't...

646
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,780
我早死了
I'd be dead.

647
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,850
所以我就和他們生活在一起
So I lived amongst them.

648
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,900
與他們共享食物與住所
I shared their food and their shelter.

649
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,290
甚至和他們一起打獵
I even hunted with them.

650
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,720
一天  我和一些勇士打獵歸來
One day, me and a few braves returned from a hunt

651
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:34,530
發現村莊被燒掠殆盡
to find the village had been burned to the ground.

652
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,600
婦女和兒童的尸體散落在四處
The women and the children, they're all scattered

653
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:42,420
整個村莊死氣沉沉  哀鴻遍野
like dead, fallen leaves, slaughtered.

654
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:43,940
是阿布納基人干的
By the Abenaki?

655
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,770
不
No.

656
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:46,660
民兵團
Militia.

657
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,130
我們的民兵團
Our militia.

658
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:52,710
甚至懶得費心分辨
Couldn't even be bothered

659
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,180
各個印第安部落間的不同
to tell one indian tribe from another.

660
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,960
一股血氣直通我頭頂
A red fog descended upon me,

661
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,960
于是我沖進叢林
and it did not lift until I ran through those woods

662
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,360
殺光了那幫禽獸
And killed every one of those bastards,

663
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,700
除了一個
everyone but one.

664
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,850
但他也被我在找到木盒的那一夜解決了
And that I corrected the night I found the box.

665
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,420
那惡靈呢
And the malum?

666
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,420
我對此一無所知
I didn't know nothing about that.

667
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,450
你說那東西對巫師至關重要
You said it was something that the witches wanted badly.

668
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,930
那晚在樹林里讓那女巫跑了后
When we lost that witch in the woods,

669
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,060
我想最好將它藏起來
I thought it was best to hide it,

670
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,930
于是我就把它埋在了吉爾斯的墓里
So, like I told you, I buried it with Giles.

671
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,640
那一定是有人又將它挖了出來
Well, then someone unburied it.

672
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,270
或許你根本無須擔心
Maybe you have nothing to worry about, then,

673
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,490
據你父親所說
Because according to your father,

674
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,210
我正是幕后主使
I am the witch behind it.

675
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,110
所以你們只要絞死我
So, all you have to do is hang me,

676
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,150
一切就都解決了
and then everything will be just fine.

677
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,100
讓我一直想不透
What I can't figure out,

678
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,320
努力想弄清的是
what I am trying to surmise,

679
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,810
在發生了這么多事
is, after all of this,

680
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,750
我們經歷的這一切之后
after everything we've been through --

681
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:05,220
你需要的到底是朋友  還是卒子
you needed a friend or a pawn?

682
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,700
淚水幫不了你
Weeping don't help.

683
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,990
相信我
Trust me.

684
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,220
我深有體會
Done my fair share.

685
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,450
艾薩克
Isaac.

686
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,570
天哪  你還在流血
God, you're still bleeding.

687
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,890
在這里  誰又不是呢
Around here, who ain't?

688
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,420
我都做了什么
What have I done?

689
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:58,580
這一切都不是你的錯
I know none of this is your fault,

690
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,170
都是我的錯
and all of it's mine.

691
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,370
那天他已經要離開了
He was on his way out of town that day.

692
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,560
是我阻止了他
I stopped him.

693
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,250
如果不是我  他早已遠離這是非之地
If it weren't for me, he'd be long gone.

694
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,940
這一切都不會發生
None of this would have happened.

695
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,200
是我親手將絞索套上了他的脖子
I might as well pull the rope myself in the morning.

696
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,300
我害死了約翰·奧登
I've as good as killed John Alden.

697
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:16,830
但你
But you...

698
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,560
你可以救他
You can save him.

699
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,970
不行  我做不到
I can't. I can't!

700
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:22,910
你是瑪麗
You're Mary.

701
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,490
你可是瑪麗
You're Mary.

702
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,740
在外人眼中  你是瑪麗·西布里
They all call you Mary Sibley.

703
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,110
可你知道在我心中
Do you know what I call you

704
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,610
我又是怎么看待你的嗎
in my head, to myself, in my heart?

705
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,740
"神奇的瑪麗"
"Magic Mary."

706
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,330
你總有一種魔力
You were always magic,

707
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:41,160
即使在我們小的時候
even back when we was just sprouts.

708
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,240
你可以做到任何事
And you could do anything --

709
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,710
一直都能
Always could.

710
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,590
只要你足夠渴望它
You just have to want it bad enough.

711
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,800
而你也有
And you do.

712
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,890
不是嗎
Don't you?

713
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,730
你渴望約翰·奧登能活下來
You do want John Alden to live.

714
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:27,140
你是怎么進來的
How did you get in here?

715
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,010
他們明天就會送你上絞刑架
They will hang you tomorrow.

716
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:32,010
他們
"They"?

717
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,780
你不也正是他們的一員嗎  西布里夫人
Well, aren't you one of them, Mrs. Sibley?

718
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:42,470
有時候  我都記不清自己到底是誰
Sometimes, I no longer remember who I am.

719
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,200
但我知道你是誰
But I know who you are --

720
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,100
一個無辜的人
An innocent man.

721
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,750
我不是
Hardly.

722
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,860
想來可笑
Now it's almost funny.

723
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,270
塞勒姆終于頭一遭
Salem finally sentenced someone to die

724
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,150
可以處死一個罪有應得的人
for something they've actually done.

725
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:01,680
回家吧  瑪麗
Go home, Mary.

726
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,450
繼續過你的人生  西布里夫人
Go back to your life, Mrs. Sibley.

727
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:09,950
你就是我的人生
You are my life.

728
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:16,080
現在才這么想或許有點太遲了
Well, it's a little late for that thought.

729
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,740
我不會讓他們吊死你的
I'll not let you hang.

730
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,600
我可以救你
I can save you.

731
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,270
塞勒姆的善良人們
The good people of salem,

732
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,630
那些我誓死捍衛的人們
the people I've been trying to save,

733
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:26,720
他們都恨不得我死
they all want me dead.

734
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,930
他們認為我就是惡魔
They think I'm the devil himself.

735
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,060
我不是
I'm no devil.

736
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,980
但我確實犯下了叛國
But I am guilty of treason...

737
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,060
及謀殺之罪
and murder.

738
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,970
因此我罪有應得
And I'm ready to hang for it.

739
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,170
再說
Besides...

740
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,810
我已經厭倦了
I'm awfully tired.

741
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,430
厭倦了沒有你的人生
Tired of living without you.

742
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,160
我們還有可能在一起
There's still a way for us to be together.

743
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,320
不可能了
It's over.

744
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:02,780
你到底是怎么了
What's wrong with you?

745
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,460
難道你跟鎮里其他人一樣都瘋了嗎
Have you gone mad like everyone else in this town?

746
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:08,110
約翰  我向你發誓
John, I promise you --

747
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:09,440
不  別這樣
No, don't.

748
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,920
你很清楚我們都不擅于遵守誓言
Neither of us is very good with promises, 

749
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,290
所以別再發誓了
so no more vows.

750
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:15,280
聽我說
Listen to me.

751
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,950
我在聽呢
I am listening to you,

752
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,880
可你說的根本不可能
and you aren't making any sense.

753
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:22,130
看看四周
Look around you.

754
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,900
這些堅固的石墻
These are stone walls.

755
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:29,280
裝有柵欄的窗戶
barred windows,

756
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,790
沉重的鐵門
An iron door.

757
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:35,610
而我們頭頂  是等待著我的絞索
Right above us, a thick rope awaiting my neck.

758
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,300
這都是鐵一般的事實
Those are the stubborn facts.

759
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:40,640
就算你有全世界的愛
And all the love in the world

760
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,540
也改變不了任何一切
can't change a single one of them.

761
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:43,470
你錯了
You're wrong.

762
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:45,690
愛遠比這一切強大
Love is stronger than fact, 

763
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,210
比任何事物都強大
stronger than everything.

764
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,570
但我告訴你  約翰
But I tell you, John,

765
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,850
這世上仍有你我的容身之處
there is still a place for us in this world.

766
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,440
只有在夢里
Only in dreams.

767
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:00,340
既然這樣
All right, then.

768
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,270
最后一次
One last time...

769
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:06,230
與我一起做個美夢吧
dream with me.

00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,840
《塞勒姆》前情提要
Previously on Salem.

16
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,750
我不走
I won't go.

17
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,930
審判的結局只有上絞刑架
But a trial will result with you in the gallows.

18
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,680
約翰·奧登是我的朋友  可能是我唯一的朋友
John Alden is my friend, perhaps my only one.

19
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,660
你會讓友情
And you would allow friendship

20
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,720
阻擋你自我提升的步伐嗎
to stand in the way of your own elevation?

21
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,110
他是無辜的
He is innocent.

22
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,320
你渴望約翰·奧登能活下來
You do want John Alden to live.

23
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,300
那個面具的能力
That the power of that mask

24
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,600
只能被一種人所激活
can only be accessed by those of one kind.

25
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,010
你是說我是...
Are you saying that I am...

26
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,060
是個巫師
A witch.

27
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,080
你曾發誓她們會安全的
You swore that they would be safe,

28
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,450
但是她們死了
but they're dead!

29
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,810
召集年輕人
Gather the young,

30
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,120
窮人  痛苦之人
the poor, the suffering.

31
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,100
他們將會作為我們的軍隊
They will be our army.

32
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,170
你知道要怎么做吧
You know what to do with it?

33
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,350
這世上仍有你我的容身之處
There is still a place for us in this world.

34
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,020
只有在夢里
Only in dreams.

35
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,010
與我一起做個美夢吧
Dream with me.

36
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,770
你是他們中的一員嗎
You're one of them?

37
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,890
現在你知道了
Now you know.

38
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,200
知道什么
Know what?

39
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,330
知道你是個巫師嗎
That you -- you're a witch?

40
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,790
是的  我是巫師
Yes. A witch.

41
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,620
現在你應該繼續前行
You should just keep going now.

42
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,520
我們時間不多了
We don't have much time.

43
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,190
我還是得知道
I still need to know. 

44
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,640
為什么
Why?

45
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,330
為了生存
Survival.

46
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,460
我只希望你好好活著  快走吧
All I want is for you to save yourself, so go.

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,590
你只要知道我仍然愛著你
Believe that I still love you enough

48
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,320
只要知道你活著我就滿足了
to simply be satisfied knowing you survive,

49
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,880
即使那意味著我可能再也見不到你
even if that means I'm never gonna see you again.

50
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,090
它又回到我手上了
It came back to me.

51
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,990
正如你又回到了我身邊
As you came back to me.

52
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,040
萬物歸宗
All things return,

53
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,690
就像每一滴眼淚最終歸于大海
like every salty tear returns to the sea.

54
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,300
這是我所學到的
This is something one learns.

55
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,640
作為巫師嗎
As a witch?

56
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,560
作為女人
As a woman.

57
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:42,720
我父親曾說
You know, my father said

58
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,620
這是重生之地
this was the land of second chances.

59
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,280
這是我們的重生之地
So this is ours.

60
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,300
我們可以重新開始
We could start again.

61
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,930
我們只需要離開這兒
All we have to do is walk away.

62
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,010
你不明白
You don't understand.

63
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,060
他們不會允許的  我...
They'd never let me. I --

64
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,890
那你就留下來
Then stay.

65
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,540
你可以選擇
You have a choice.

66
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,910
無論你不得不做的是什么
What you have to do, whatever it is,

67
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,670
你真的能開心嗎
will it really make you happy?

68
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,360
我不知道
I don't know.

69
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,580
我想你知道
I think you do.

70
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,610
我想你跟我一樣清楚
I think you know as well as I do

71
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:24,820
你的心里從未有過像今天一樣的平靜
that there'll be no peace in your heart like there is today.

72
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,140
我從不知道平靜是種什么感覺
My heart has never known peace.

73
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,960
也許吧  只是也許
Then maybe, just maybe,

74
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,770
我們會一起發現的
We'll find it together.

75
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,280
好  我跟你走
All right. I'll come.

76
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,280
但有件事兒我必須先去了結了
But there's something I must do first.

77
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,250
如果我不回去解決它
If I don't go back and fix it, 

78
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,650
會有大事兒發生的
terrible things will happen.

79
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,050
這是我的誓言
This is my vow.

80
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,800
月上樹梢頭之前
I will meet you here

81
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,300
我會來這找你
before the moon rises above those trees --

82
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,470
我發誓
I swear it.

83
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,260
好的
Okay.

84
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,250
但一旦時間過了
But when the moon goes, I go...

85
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,300
不管你回沒回來  我都會走
with or without you.

86
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,860
我會回來的
I shall be back.

87
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,480
好的
All right.

88
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,700
*擂我戰鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

89
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,810
*鼓鳴震天*
*Witch drums*

90
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,330
*擂我戰鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

91
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,660
*擂我戰鼓*
*Pound me the witch drums*

92
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,880
*鼓鳴震天*
*The witch drums*

93
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,390
*寧入地獄*
*Better pray for hell*

94
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:01,610
*不留人間*
*Not hallelujah*

95
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,600
給你的
A tribute.

96
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:35,650
貢品
For you.

97
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,020
給你的  我的女王
For you, my queen.

98
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,530
梅西
Mercy.

99
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,210
塞勒姆眾多迷失的靈魂中
Of all the lost souls in salem,

100
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,790
我最同情你
I pity yours most of all.

101
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,370
親愛的  我對你做了什么
My dear, what have I done to you?

102
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,890
你對我做了什么
What have you done to me?

103
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,200
你背叛了我
You have betrayed me.

104
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,350
我從未想背叛你  梅西
It was never my intention to betray you, Mercy.

105
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,270
我從你眼中看到了自己的影子
I saw myself in your eyes,

106
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,770
我知道一無所有  一無是處的感覺
knew what it was like to have nothing, be nothing,

107
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,370
我想讓你有更大的成就
and I wanted so much more for you.

108
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,700
所以我把你想要的給了你
So I gave you what you wished for,

109
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,520
但是我警告過你
but I warned you.

110
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,030
不  我沒想讓我的朋友被害死
No, I didn't wish for my friends to be killed.

111
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,870
我承諾保證她們的安全
I promised them that they would be safe...

112
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,100
都是因為你  你答應過我
Because you -- you promised me.

113
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,950
但是你欺騙了我
But you lied.

114
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,590
你說謊
You lied.

115
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,520
現在她們都死了
And now they are all dead.

116
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,490
你所說的一切都是謊言
Everything that comes from your lips is a lie.

117
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,470
是謊言
It's a lie.

118
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,950
謊言  謊言
Lies! Lies!

119
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,600
謊言
Lies!

120
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,680
謊言
Lies!

121
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,750
-梅西  -此時此地不要找我了
- Mercy? - Don't look for me now, not here.

122
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,800
你不會找到我的
You won't find me.

123
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,190
但是我會在你最不想被找到時找到你
But I will find you when you least want to be found.

124
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:15,920
艾薩克
Isaac.

125
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,140
你也是來幫他們摧毀我的思想嗎
Have you come to help dismantle my mind?

126
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,730
他們就是在干這個嗎
Is that what they're doing?

127
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,340
對  確實是
Yes...in effect.

128
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,940
受我父親之命
On my father's order --

129
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,920
這是他愿意重新接納我的條件
His condition for accepting me back into the flock.

130
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,700
我所有的收藏
All my collection,

131
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,530
所有無用之理的工具
all the tools of useless reason...

132
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,260
除了一樣
...all but one.

133
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,520
父親說我必須重回一切知識的開端
My father says I must return to the beginning of all knowledge.

134
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,380
作為我迷失和恥辱的獎賞
As a reward for my loss and my humiliation,

135
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,030
他允許我跟他一起回波士頓
I am to be allowed to return with him to Boston.

136
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,460
艾薩克啊
Oh, Isaac.

137
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,540
這會兒你來找我干什么
What do you want with me in this,

138
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,780
在我受辱的這一時刻
the hour of my abasement?

139
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,760
我不知道你的話是什么意思  先生
I don't know what that means, sir.

140
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,690
我是來跟你說奧登上尉的事
But I came to say something about captain Alden.

141
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,960
他今天就要被絞死了
He is to be hung today.

142
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,610
但你們兩個人是朋友
But you two were friends.

143
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,940
你可能從未這樣說過  但我知道
You might never have said so, but I know so.

144
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,230
而且我相信  今生今世
And I believe, in this life,

145
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,360
我們雖無力改變自己離去的時間和去處
we have no power to alter where or when we go,

146
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,210
但是我們可以對彼此說幾句話
but we can say things to each other.

147
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,600
有時我們剩下的就只剩語言了
Sometimes, words are all we have left.

148
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,000
你跟奧登上尉說再見了嗎
Have you said goodbye to captain Alden?

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,670
我不知道自己能否承受...
I'm not sure I can bear to...

150
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,960
尤其是考慮到...
Especially given how much --

151
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,510
此事我有多大的責任
How much blame may lie on my shoulders.

152
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,460
但是你一如既往地言語睿智
But, as usual, you speak with more wisdom

153
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,200
你的話比歷史上任何事都有道理
than all of the mathers in history combined.

154
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,850
再見  先生
Good day, sir.

155
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,900
-父親  -你去哪里了
- Father - Where have you been?

156
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,770
買東西去了
Shopping.

157
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,790
現在的東西應該能夠我們
I believe I have everything we shall need

158
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,430
存活一周有余了
to survive for a week or more.

159
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,030
存活  存活什么
Survive? Survive what?

160
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,300
過來
This way.

161
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,750
來  幫我一把  親愛的
Here. Give me a hand with this, dear.

162
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,040
怎么  以前沒拿過活鳥嗎
What's the matter? Haven't you ever held a live bird before?

163
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,380
是沒有
No, I-I haven't.

164
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,320
握緊一點
Well, a little -- little tighter.

165
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,890
來  能感受到鳥的心跳嗎
Here. Can you feel its heart beating?

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,360
能感受到
Yes, I can.

167
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,350
沒事  不用害怕
Don't worry. There's nothing to be frightened of.

168
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:32,980
來
Come.

169
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,630
不  不能再死人了
No! No more will die.

170
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,210
此事因我而起  就由我結束
This began with me, and I shall be the one to end it.

171
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,420
安靜
Silence!

172
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,450
否則我就讓你們跟蘿絲一個下場
Or I shall deal with you as I dealt with Rose.

173
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,320
你們以后不許妨礙我  永遠都不許
No longer will you stand in my way -- not now, not ever.

174
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,370
我要離開塞勒姆  我以后再也不回來了
I'm leaving Salem, and I am never coming back.

175
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,620
我走后你們怎樣隨你們
You may do as you like when I'm gone,

176
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,800
但是你們不準跟著我  以后也不許妨礙我
but you will not follow me or hinder me in the years ahead.

177
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,290
{\an8}不可能  你是被選中之人

178
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,910
那就換人
Then unchoose me.

179
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,750
換霍爾治安官掌權吧
Put magistrate Hale in charge.

180
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,750
他們家族歷史悠久  而且還有新的繼承人 
His line is ancient, and yet still springs green a new heir.

181
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,340
{\an8}但你是被選中之人  是我們創造之人

182
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,090
不  我不是
No, I'm not the one.

183
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,100
我只是你們半路選中的一個人而已
I was just a black rose you grafted to your vine,

184
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,860
現在我受夠了
and I've had enough --

185
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,070
受夠了鮮血和死亡
Enough blood and death --

186
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,170
我馬上就自由了
And I will be free.

187
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:53,360
{\an8}找到緹圖芭  告訴她是時候了

188
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,800
我的兒子
Ah, my son...

189
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,360
帶著他一如既往的
with his customary expression

190
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,280
宿醉不醒又疑惑不解的神情
of befuddlement and utter incomprehension.

191
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,480
怎么了  父親
What's happened, father?

192
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,280
你已經把他帶走處決了嗎
Have you taken him off and killed him already,

193
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,370
連最后的遺言和禱告都沒有
without the benefit of final words or prayers

194
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,230
更沒有目擊者
or -- or witnesses?

195
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,400
當然沒有
Of course not.

196
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,190
我會對一個無辜之人做這種事嗎
Would I do such a thing to an innocent man?

197
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,320
我從沒懷疑過約翰·奧登無辜與否
You see, I never doubted John Alden's innocence.

198
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,120
雖然我知道他是個載譽過度的人
Just as I know that he is a man of excessive personal honor,

199
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,340
但我從沒懷疑過
I never doubted the fact that

200
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,900
他一定有充足合理的理由殺死那些人
he had ample and good reason for killing whoever he did kill.

201
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,970
你這是諷刺我
You mock me, sir.

202
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,850
我沒有
No, I do not.

203
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,890
你以為我不明白
Do you think that I don't know that 

204
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:54,080
奧登不比你我多出什么邪術或者超能力嗎
Alden has no more malefic or sulfuric power than you or I?

205
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,010
奧登是個叛徒  殺人犯
Alden is a traitor, he is a murderer,

206
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,810
思想放縱的異教徒
he is a free-thinking heretic,

207
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,160
他是個酒鬼  道德敗壞
He is a drinker, a man of loose morals,

208
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,960
他犯有驕縱之罪
and he is guilty of the sin of pride,

209
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,400
但他絕不是巫師
but a witch -- not at all.

210
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,400
但是  他愛上了一個巫師
However, he is in love with a witch,

211
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,050
更重要的是  這個巫師也愛他
and more importantly, a witch is in love with him.

212
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,770
你是說瑪麗·西布里  她是巫師
You mean Mary Sibley? A witch?

213
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,880
信不信由你
Believe it or not, as you choose.

214
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,950
但這是真的
Nevertheless, it is true.

215
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,010
塞勒姆最重要的女人  竟是巫師嗎
The most important woman in Salem -- a witch?

216
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,080
你有任何證據嗎
Have you any proof, any evidence?

217
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,280
現在還沒有
At present, I have none.

218
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,380
然而  當她和那個被她施法
However, when she is apprehended with her lover,

219
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,560
越獄的愛人一起被逮捕之時
a man she has freed from a locked jail cell with magic,

220
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,730
我會抓她個正著
I'll have her dead to rights.

221
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,010
你
You. 

222
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,370
我吩咐的都辦好了嗎
Have you done as I told you?

223
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,900
是的先生  撕成兩半
Yes, sir. Tore it into two.

224
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,190
帶進牢房時  偷塞了半塊在他的口袋里
Snuck half into his pocket as I led him to his cell.

225
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,630
另一半在這兒
The other half, here.

226
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,150
讓獵狗嗅著血  追上他
Blood the hounds. Run him down.

227
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,920
千萬要小心
Heed me carefully --

228
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,300
有人與他同行  這兩人都極度危險
someone will be with him, and they're both very dangerous,

229
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,520
切勿試圖抓捕  或是把他們帶回來
so do not attempt to capture them or bring them back,

230
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,810
彼時彼刻就地正法
but execute them then and there,

231
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,280
兩人都是  就地正法
on the spot -- both of them.

232
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,720
-我授權予你  -先生
- You have my authority to do this. - Sir.

233
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,630
現在去吧  走吧
Now, off with you. Go on. 

234
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,540
我懇請您把他們帶回來公正審判
Sir, I plead with you to bring them back for a fair trial.

235
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,120
不必審判了
There's no need for a trial.

236
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,510
這是我們僅有唯一的機會
This is our one and only opportunity

237
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,860
能阻止他們企圖帶來的大規模死亡
to avert the great death that they intend for us.

238
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,760
我沒得選擇  巫師今晚必須死
I have no choice in this. The witch will die tonight.

239
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,670
這個地方存在多久了
How long has this been here?

240
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,900
自我建成這房子之日
Since I built the house.

241
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,590
除非你學會找個真正的藏身之所
You do not survive all that I have survived

242
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,630
否則你的歷練還是比不上我
without knowing how to keep a true hiding place.

243
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,400
這間屋子  只有血印可以開啟
This room, whose door only blood can open,

244
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,140
這是我們的避難所
is our sanctuary.

245
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,360
你在這里很安全
You'll be safe here.

246
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,560
我們得在這里待多久
How long must we stay inside?

247
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,350
至少一周  風才能吹凈空氣
I think at least a week before the winds cleanse the air.

248
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,710
它能告訴我們什么時候開始
And this is how we will know it has begun.

249
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,520
外面有什么大難當頭
What disaster unfolds outside

250
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,290
讓我們必須得躲在這里
that we must cower from in here?

251
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,090
今晚  塞勒姆附近會釋放瘟疫
Tonight, there will be a plague released near Salem,

252
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,200
瘟疫將降臨清教徒的家
A pox upon the puritan house.

253
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,670
只有體內流淌著巫師之血
Only those who carry the witch blood in their veins

254
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,670
或是沾染到巫師之血的人
or are touched by it

255
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,480
才能從瘟疫中幸存
will be safe from this pox.

256
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,530
那我也會死掉
Then I will die of it, too.

257
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,820
柯頓·麥哲檢查過  我不是巫師
Cotton Mather examined me. I'm no witch.

258
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,640
真的嗎
Really?

259
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,470
那他作為一個巫師獵手
Then he is an even more incompetent witchfinder

260
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,520
比我想像中更不稱職
than I thought.

261
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,140
四周看看  你認出什么來了嗎
Look around. Don't you recognize anything here?

262
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,610
你還很小的時候  我經常帶你來這兒
When you were very little, I brought you here often,

263
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,390
你生活的伊始并非是個該死的清教徒
that you might not begin your life as a damned puritan,

264
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,600
無法聆聽樂曲之聲
without the sounds, the music in your ears,

265
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,140
或是無法得見美術之彩的清教徒
or all the colors of art in your eyes.

266
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,230
這里
Here.

267
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,060
這是你三歲的時候畫的
You drew that when you were 3.

268
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,270
這個
This.

269
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,380
這是你的最愛
Well, that was your favorite.

270
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,430
我雕給你的
I carved it for you.

271
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:39,010
但為什么...為什么我不記得了
But why -- why can't I remember?

272
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,830
因為我得抹去你的記憶
Because I had to take away your memories

273
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,180
直到你做好準備  現在你準備好了
Until you were ready for them, but now you are.

274
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,410
是的  我記得
I do. I do remember.

275
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,330
可我記得它在跳舞
But...I remember it dancing.

276
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,070
它確實在為你而舞
It did dance for you.

277
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,510
是你令它起舞
You made it dance.

278
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,210
我
I?

279
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,700
看著它
Look at it.

280
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,420
用你的心靈之眼  你會看到它在跳舞
And in your mind's eye, see it dancing.

281
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,700
喬治  我要錯過
Oh, George, I shall miss

282
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,940
你的精彩演講了
The dazzle and wit of your conversation.

283
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,880
你知道今晚是什么日子嗎  喬治
Do you know what tonight is, George?

284
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,960
今晚是你此生最幸運的日子
It's the luckiest night of your life.

285
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,960
你不會知道你離毀滅有多近
You'll never know how close you all came to utter destruction.

286
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,640
你曾奪走了我所有重要的東西
You once took away from me everything that meant anything.

287
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,470
今晚  我終于能將其全部奪回
But tonight, I shall finally have it all back.

288
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,870
你說的一點沒錯
Truer than you know...

289
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,620
小姐
...mistress.

290
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,690
你來干什么  叛徒
What do you want here, traitor?

291
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,060
我  叛徒
I? Traitor?

292
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,440
我忍受了那個變態
I, who have endured the worst

293
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,050
施加給我的無數痛苦  只為了保護你
That sick man could inflict upon my flesh to protect you?

294
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,860
我可不這么認為
I think not.

295
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,120
是你背叛了那些養育過你的人
'tis you who have betrayed those who nurtured you,

296
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,400
你背棄了這么多年來
You who have turned your back

297
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,390
我們苦心計劃的一切
On everything we have planned these long years.

298
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,150
不
No.

299
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,050
我離開不是為了背叛  而是為了...
No, I'm leaving not to betray, but to be true...

300
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,950
可能是此生頭一次...做回我自己
Perhaps for the first time... to myself.

301
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,850
你哪也不準去
You are going nowhere.

302
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:43,140
七年前  兩個女孩走入了樹林
Seven years ago, two girls walked into the woods.

303
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,190
在那里  其中一人許下誓言
There, one of them made a vow.

304
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,900
為封印那個誓言  她奉獻了最為寶貴的東西
To seal that vow, she offered up a most precious thing...

305
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,070
她腹中的小生命
The life she carried within.

306
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,690
不用提醒我那個黑暗的夜晚
No need to remind me of that dark night.

307
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,630
我永遠無法將它從記憶中抹除
I shall never be free of its memory.

308
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,360
不
No.

309
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,610
你不可能忘記自己根本沒有全然了解的事
You cannot forget what you have never really known.

310
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,370
你就沒問過自己
Have you never asked yourself,

311
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,540
沒懷疑過那晚真正發生了什么
Never wondered what really happened that night,

312
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,270
沒想過你腹中的生命到底去哪了嗎
Where the life that swelled your belly went?

313
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,940
那晚沒有誕生
Nothing is created.

314
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,460
也沒有毀滅
Nothing is destroyed.

315
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,910
一切只是轉化而已
All is only ever transformed.

316
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,800
打開吧
Open it.

317
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,420
我的孩子
My child...

318
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,070
還活著
lives?

319
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,740
目前還活著  看你怎么選了
For now, depending on your choice.

320
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,030
這  這只是個為了控制我的邪惡詭計
This... this is some foul trick in order to control me.

321
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,530
不  那晚你并沒殺死那個孩子
No, you did not kill the child that night.

322
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,320
你把它交給了我們侍奉的暗夜之王
You gave him to the dark lord we serve,

323
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,070
這孩子一直被小心呵護著
And this child has been treasured

324
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,010
這是千年來的頭一遭
Like no other in a thousand years.

325
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,350
他什么也不缺  除了他的母親
He has lacked for nothing... except his mother.

326
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,890
你想要我怎樣
What do you want from me?

327
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,580
只要做你曾起誓要做的事
Only what you have vowed to do.

328
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,960
完成大祭典  一切就都會安好
Complete the grand rite, and all shall be well.

329
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,960
若我不肯呢
And if I do not?

330
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,700
延遲的犧牲會帶來更大的力量
A sacrifice deferred is yet more powerful...

331
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,970
尤其是血親的犧牲
Especially a blood sacrifice.

332
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,920
給我聽好  怪物
Hear me well, foul creature.

333
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,970
我將最后一次任你擺布
You have manipulated me for the last time.

334
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,540
我會完成大祭典
I will complete your grand rite.

335
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:49,010
等一切完成  我發誓  你會付出代價
But when it is done, I swear to you, you will pay.

336
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,990
我們都別無選擇  瑪麗
We must all live without choices, Mary.

337
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,470
你應該最有體會
You know that best of all.

338
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,090
他不見了
He's gone.

339
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,670
奧登上尉不見了
Captain Alden's missing.

340
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,590
是你干的嗎
Was it you?

341
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,110
我說過我不會讓他被絞死
I told you I would not let him hang.

342
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,560
謝謝  瑪麗
Thank you, Mary.

343
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,160
謝謝
Thank you.

344
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,490
真美
It's beautiful.

345
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,120
是啊
Yes. It is.

346
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,650
這是什么
What is it?

347
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,490
死亡
Death.

348
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,670
這是件不祥之物
It's a bad thing,

349
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,350
需要埋葬到不祥之地去
And it needs to go to a bad place.

350
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,790
我任你差遣
Then I'm your man.

351
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,590
給
Here.

352
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,630
這太多了
That's a fortune.

353
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,770
一點小錢
Several fortunes, actually...

354
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,180
親愛的艾薩克  你肯做這件事
Far less than you deserve, sweet Isaac,

355
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,820
其實應該得到更多
For doing such a job.

356
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,500
你可以用這些錢開始新的生活
You can start a new life with it,

357
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:30,150
一個與你的美好心靈相匹配的生活
One as good as your good heart deserves.

358
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,000
謝謝你
Thank you.

359
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,480
艾薩克  仔細聽著
Isaac, listen carefully.

360
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:39,200
最重要的事就是  一旦將它放下后
The most important thing is that, when you leave it,

361
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,680
你就繼續前行  遠走高飛  越快越好
you keep going -- far away and quickly.

362
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,640
波士頓  紐約  弗吉尼亞
Boston, New York, Virginia 

363
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,240
有多遠走多遠
just keep going.

364
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,430
還有一件事
And one more thing --

365
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,970
你離開小鎮之時
on your way out of town,

366
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,840
把這封信交給柯頓·麥哲
deliver this letter to Cotton Mather.

367
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,240
我再也不會見到您了  是嗎
I shall never see you again, will I?

368
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,990
不  我想不會了
No. No, I expect not.

369
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,440
我很難過
That makes me very sad. 

370
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,740
你和上尉是我僅有的
Y-you and the captain are the closest things 

371
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,290
最接近朋友的人
to friends I ever had...

372
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,970
除了我曾經知熟悉的一匹馬
Except for a horse I once knew, 

373
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,810
但是她死了
but she died.

374
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,660
你應該買一匹新馬
You shall buy a new horse, 

375
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,960
一整個馬隊
a whole team of them.

376
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,480
你應該結交新朋友
And you shall make new friends.

377
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,900
這是重生之地
This is the land of second chances.

378
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,570
就像你和約翰·奧登嗎
Like you and John Alden?

379
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,270
你們也會重獲新生嗎
W-will you get your second chance?

380
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,460
是的
Yes. 

381
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,620
是的  我想我們會的
Yes, I expect we will.

382
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,980
誰在這兒
Who is here?

383
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,180
是巴比倫大淫婦嗎
Is it the whore of Babylon?

384
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,920
親愛的英克里斯
Oh, dear Increase --

385
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,410
你是如此正確
So terribly right

386
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,530
又如此錯誤
and so terribly wrong.

387
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:18,120
我能親眼所見自己有多正確
I can see before my eyes how right I was.

388
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,040
你黑暗的光環越發明亮了
Your darkling glow burns brighter than ever...

389
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,460
女巫
witch.

390
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,780
先生
Sir.

391
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,540
給你的
For you.

392
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:37,770
是什么
What is it?

393
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,860
我不知道
No idea.

394
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,400
西布里夫人讓我交給你的
Mrs. Sibley asked me to give it you.

395
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,860
現在我得走了  因為路途遙遠
Now I must go, for the road is long,

396
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,400
而我的腿卻沒那么長
and...my legs are not.

397
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,430
告訴我  實話實說
Tell me, exactly. 

398
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,600
我錯在哪兒了
How was I wrong?

399
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,180
你以為愛情會是我的死穴
You thought love would be my undoing,

400
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,930
我會和情人在叢林里相會
that I would be in the woods with my lover,

401
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,840
然后你就在那兒不費吹灰之力干掉我
and you would kill me there without a trial,

402
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,180
我的大祭典就這樣結束了
thus ending my grand rite.

403
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,040
我跟你分享一個
I will share with you the secret

404
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,880
你和你等族類數世紀以來苦苦尋覓無果的秘密
that you and your kind have sought in vain for centuries --

405
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,950
無辜者的鮮血
innocent blood.

406
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,560
13個無辜的犧牲者
13 innocent sacrifices,

407
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,550
當最后一滴血流下來的時候
and when the last is spilled, 

408
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,550
惡靈就會打開
our malum opens,

409
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:31,150
釋放出它內藏的紅色死亡
unleashing the red death it contains within it.

410
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,260
但是在過去五百年間
And yet, not once in the last 500 years

411
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,580
我們竟沒有一次成功過
have we succeeded...

412
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,610
直到我出現他們才意識到
Until I came along and realized

413
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,380
我們根本不必親自動手來
we needn't spill a single drop of

414
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,810
獲取無辜者的鮮血
innocent blood ourselves --

415
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,820
至少當我們有恐懼又狂熱的清教徒時不必
not when we had fearful and fanatical puritans

416
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,210
他們十分樂意替我們代勞
all too ready to do it for us.

417
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,570
所以你給了我們吉爾斯·科里
So you gave us Giles Corey,

418
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,060
布里奇特·畢謝普
Bridget Bishop...

419
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,110
巴克一家還有其他人
the Barkers, and others,

420
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,580
當然了  還有那些可憐被騙的姑娘們
and of course, those poor, deceived girls --

421
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,890
成桶成桶的無辜者之血
innocent blood by the buckets.

422
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,460
現如今正值
And now here we are, 

423
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,490
狩獵滿月之夜
night of full hunter's moon.

424
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,840
12個無辜者已死
12 innocents dead,

425
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,440
落月之前只需再有一個無辜者犧牲
and only one more required before moonfall.

426
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,990
我先殺了你就不會有人犧牲
Not if I kill you first.

427
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,760
是啊  殺掉那個開始大祭典的女巫
Oh, yes, kill the witch who began this grand rite,

428
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,030
你就可以避免這場無盡的死亡
and you might yet avert the great death to come.

429
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,130
祝你好運
Good luck with that.

430
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,610
英克里斯
Oh, Increase.

431
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:58,320
這點能耐可不夠
You're gonna have to do so much better than that.

432
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,840
不過我向你保證
But I will make you a promise.

433
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,690
一切會在這里結束  就在這屋里  現在
It will end here, in this room, right now.

434
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,540
那邊的  站住
You there! Stop!

435
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:05,420
你做了正確的事  艾薩克
You've done the right thing, Isaac...

436
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,050
替她卸下了如此重負
taking such a load off her hand.

437
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,580
瑪麗說把它放在老樹這里
Mary said to put it here in the old tree.

438
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,580
這樣不對
This ain't right.

439
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,890
這樣不對
Oh, this ain't right.

440
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,240
任何一個傻瓜都可以感覺到
Any fool can feel that,

441
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,210
甚至是我這個傻瓜
even this fool.

442
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,300
她說過你是死神
She said you were death.

443
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,680
我要把你放在死人該去的地方
I'm gonna put you where the dead belong.

444
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,060
你比你所獵殺的好不到哪去
You are no better than those you hunt.

445
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,700
不  你更加的可惡
No, you're far worse.

446
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,990
一個女巫  就像頭狼
A witch, like a wolf, 

447
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,390
不會折磨她的獻祭者
doesn't torture her sacrifice.

448
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,780
只有牧師和審判官會這么做
Only priests and inquisitors do that.

449
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,580
也許你可以說服自己
Perhaps you can convince yourself

450
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,190
認為正與邪之間有那么一點區別
that there is scant difference between good and evil,

451
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,660
但那是不可能的
but I know better.

452
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,570
你有沒有想過
Did it ever occur to you

453
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,290
我們獲得的黑暗力量正是
that the dark power we gain is precisely that

454
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,350
你認為可以從自身驅除的那部分
which you think you can expel from yourself?

455
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,780
你什么都不懂  怪物
You know nothing, creature.

456
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,620
今天這里發生的一切只能證明
Whatever happens here today only proves

457
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:31,040
我所相信的  是正確的
that what I believe...is true.

458
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,820
父親
Father! 

459
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,520
父親
Father!

460
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,910
柯頓
Cotton.

461
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,480
感謝上帝  艾薩克找到了你
Thank god Isaac found you.

462
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:50,460
幫幫我  你父親  他瘋了
Help me. Your father -- he's gone mad!

463
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,520
父親  你做了什么
Father, what have you done?!

464
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,820
我  我什么都沒做
I? I've done nothing.

465
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,690
這妖婦自己找上門來的
This succubus has come to me.

466
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,990
她在玩弄你的理智
She's playing with your mind.

467
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,010
她自己坐上那把椅子的
She has put herself into that chair!

468
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:58,810
什么
What?! 

469
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,070
怎么會
How?

470
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,570
他是個惡魔
He is a devil.

471
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,020
他是個瘋狂的惡魔  先生
Oh, he's a mad devil, sir!

472
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,560
父親  你說瑪麗·西布里是女巫
Father, you said Mary Sibley was a witch.

473
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,360
她就是女巫
She is a witch.

474
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,390
那為什么她不在林子里  父親
Then why is she not in the woods, father,

475
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,690
沒去救奧登上尉  就像你說的那樣
saving Captain Alden, as you said she would be?!

476
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,680
我沒時間回答你愚蠢的問題
I have no time for your idiotic question

477
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,130
更不需要你可惡的質疑
and less for your infernal doubt!

478
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,250
你的偉大計劃其實根本什么都不是
Your great plan has proven nothing!

479
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,750
現在你又要折磨一位無辜的婦女
Now you resort to torturing an innocent woman

480
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,200
來從她口中逼出不實的供詞嗎
to obtain some kind of false confession from her?!

481
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,910
你瞎到看不到了嗎
Are you too blind to see?!

482
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,340
看啊  她都不在那里
Look -- she is not even there!

483
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,650
她不過是一個幻影
She is a mere phantasm!

484
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,680
父親
Father!

485
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,390
她是個幽靈
She is a specter!

486
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,390
父親  我恐怕您已經失去理性
Father, I fear you have lost your reason.

487
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,220
而你  孩子
And you, boy --

488
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:44,640
你從未有過理性  你個可憐的廢物
You have never had any reason, you pathetic failure.

489
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,240
這賤人現在就得死
This bitch dies now!

490
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,760
不  求你  不要
No, please, no, no.

491
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,780
柯頓  柯頓
Cotton. Cotton.

492
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,690
你做了什么
W-what have you done?

493
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,490
你這個蠢孩子
You foolish boy.

494
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:15,450
你  柯頓  柯頓
You -- Cotton. Cotton.

495
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,620
上帝
God.

496
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,960
看在上帝的份上
For god's sake...

497
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,070
殺了女巫
Kill the witch.

498
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,460
我殺了他
I have killed him.

499
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,680
我不  我不明白
I don't -- I don't understand.

500
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,390
那是怎么  你是怎么來到這的
How did it -- how do you come to be here?

501
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,530
他把我從屋里拖出來
He dragged me from my rooms.

502
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,640
他打算折磨我
He was going to torture me... 

503
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,010
至死
to death.

504
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,390
我必須去尋求幫助
I must call for help.

505
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,980
不不  現在尋找幫助已經沒用了
No. No, there's no help for it now.

506
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,350
但我必須告訴別人
But I must tell someone.

507
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,600
我必須告訴別人我所做的事情
I must tell someone what I've done.

508
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,440
不
No.

509
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,710
我必須告訴別人我所做的事情
I must tell someone what I've done!

510
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:35,160
不  你會毀了你的家族
No, you would ruin your family --

511
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,200
麥哲家族的名聲
the very name of Mather.

512
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,570
我不會告訴任何人他所要做的事
I will tell no one what he tried to do, 

513
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,850
或是你所做的事
nor what you did.

514
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,400
但是你必須離開了  柯頓
But you must leave, Cotton.

515
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:50,880
馬上去波士頓  就在今晚  立刻出發
Go to Boston now, tonight, immediately.

516
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,210
那  那他怎么辦
What -- what about him?

517
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,450
最好讓他們在你走了之后再發現他
Better they find him here after you are gone.

518
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:59,240
他們會認為是奧登的支持者干的
They will think those that support Alden got to him --

519
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,520
或者是巫師們
or even witches.

520
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,250
馬上走吧
Now go!

521
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,580
親愛的英克里斯
Oh, dear Increase.

522
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,980
我真希望你還活著  能知道
I hope you're alive enough to know

523
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:52,380
你被賦予了怎樣的殊榮
what an honor you've been granted.

524
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,300
這是多么的榮耀
Oh, such an honor...

525
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,860
成為我們第十三位受害者
...to be our 13th victim.

526
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,200
我們偉大的儀式現已完成
Our grand rite now is done.

527
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,200
血暗黎明即將到來
Blood-dim dawn now shall come.

528
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,930
月與日之力即將點燃
Powers of moon and sun ignite.

529
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,270
所有軀殼將在夜晚中發抖
All flesh trembles at the sight.

530
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,400
十三冤魂獻與大地
13 souls fed to hungry earth

531
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,330
開啟黑暗領主之誕生
Opens the way for our dark lord's birth.

532
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,680
開始了
It's begun.

533
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,970
我真心以為瑪麗會在最后一刻
I honestly didn't think Mary would be able

534
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,380
下不了手
 to do it in the end.

535
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,570
瑪麗
Mary? 

536
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,800
瑪麗·西布里嗎
Mary Sibley?

537
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,350
她也是你們的一員
She is one of you?

538
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,460
我們的一員
One of us?

539
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,330
不  遠不止這樣  親愛的
Oh, far more than that, dear.

540
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,690
無論是好是壞
For better or worse, 

541
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,050
她都是我們中的第一人
she is the first among us.

542
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,420
是她策劃的這一切
She is behind all this?

543
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,780
就是她這個女巫
She, a witch,

544
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,320
以巫師為名
killed all those innocents,

545
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,290
殺死了布里奇特
killed...Bridget, 

546
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,580
殺死了這么多無辜者
as a witch?

547
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,320
不錯  正是她的主意
Indeed, it was her idea

548
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,750
讓清教徒自己雙手奉上我們所需的獻祭
to use the puritans to sacrifice themselves for us --

549
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,330
一個危險卻富有創意的想法
an inspired, if dangerous idea.

550
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,770
為什么出太陽了
Why has the sun come out? 

551
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,610
外面到底在發生什么
What is going on outside?

552
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:15,140
死亡  死亡正在逼近
Death. Death is happening.

553
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,280
你為何不試著去阻止這一切發生
Then why aren't you trying to stop it?

554
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,750
為什么我們要躲在里面
Why are we in here,

555
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:24,750
而我們的朋友鄰居卻在外面慘死
while outside, our friends and neighbors perish?

556
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,460
一切都太遲了
It's too late for that.

557
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,500
現在我們只能靜候瘟疫散去  然后出去照料幸存者
Now we can only wait and then tend to the survivors.

558
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,840
幸存者
Survivors?

559
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,390
不  我受夠了
I will have none of this.

560
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,950
不管那是什么
Whatever it is, 

561
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,920
我更情愿跟那些受難者待在一起
I would rather be with those that suffer it,

562
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,090
而不是跟這些始作俑者
not those that perpetrate it.

563
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,330
把門打開
Open the door.

564
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,930
門已經被封印
It is sealed.

565
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,450
只有用更多的血才能打開
Only more blood will open it now.

566
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,270
快給我打開
Open!

567
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,960
我說過了  只有血祭
I told you -- only blood.

568
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,050
那就用我的血
Then my blood...

569
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,240
-安  住手  -不要
- Anne, stop! Stop! - No!

570
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,330
-停下  快停下  -不
- Stop! Stop it! - No!

571
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,860
讓我出去
Let me out!

572
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,450
我說了  給我停下
I said stop it!

573
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,200
我不是你
I am not you.

574
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,090
我也不像你
I am not like you.

575
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:37,770
我不是女巫
I am not a witch!

576
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,320
我不是你
I am not you!

577
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,870
去見你的地獄之主吧
Off to meet thy maker.

578
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,460
許多人相信  人死后靈魂仍會徘徊于世
Most agree the soul lingers for some time,

579
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,610
就在尸體不遠處
very close to where the body lies.

580
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:35,750
它能看見  聽見  并感受到一切發生之事
It sees and hears and feels keenly what happens.

581
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,370
我很高興
I'm glad of that --

582
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,570
你死后仍將為即將發生之事所困
glad you'll suffer through what's still about to happen.

583
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,550
你精心培育的這群禽獸
How good of you to train these fine animals

584
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,820
最終渴求的卻是你的鮮血
to lust for your own blood.

585
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,040
你會得到你應有的下場
It guarantees you the burial you deserve.

586
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,810
野狗會將你吞食殆盡
The dogs will eat their fill of you

587
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:05,810
然后將你的尸骨排泄在這亂葬崗
and shit your remains out in the crags.

588
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,600
你做到了
You did it,

589
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,200
很快  紅色死亡將籠罩塞勒姆
And soon, the red death will destroy Salem.

590
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,570
多虧了你
No thanks to you.

591
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,300
不得不說  我確實幫了你不少
I have been much help, I would say.

592
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,800
現在  我有更多的東西要給你
And now I have even more to give. 

593
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,380
跟我來
Come.

594
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,140
現在
Now...

595
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,720
現在
Now...

596
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,310
要知道  孩子們
...you see, children,

597
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,480
只有殺死羅斯
only by killing the rose

598
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,400
暗夜女王
will the queen of the night

599
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,770
才能成為真正的女王
really become the queen of the night.

600
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,560
但那全能的女王卻渾然不知
Little did that mighty queen know

601
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,000
她的一切計劃
that all her plans

602
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,100
即將被徹底逆轉
would be turned upside down.

603
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:27,410
是的  殺死蘿絲的
Yes, that wasn't really the true queen of the night

604
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:29,550
并不是真正的暗夜女王
who beheaded the rose.

605
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,870
是我
That was me.

606
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:37,140
是我殺死了蘿絲
I beheaded the rose.

607
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,960
盡管瑪麗·西布里還未察覺
Though Mary Sibley knows it not yet,

608
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,170
但我才是真正的暗夜女王
I am the queen of the night.

609
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,970
她會為她的一切所為付出代價
And she will pay for what she's done.

15
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,840
Previously on Salem.

16
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,750
I won't go.

17
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,930
But a trial will result with you in the gallows.

18
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,680
John Alden is my friend, perhaps my only one.

19
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,660
And you would allow friendship

20
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,720
to stand in the way of your own elevation?

21
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,110
He is innocent.

22
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,320
You do want John Alden to live.

23
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,300
That the power of that mask

24
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,600
can only be accessed by those of one kind.

25
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,010
Are you saying that I am...

26
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,060
A witch.

27
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,080
You swore that they would be safe,

28
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,450
but they're dead!

29
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,810
Gather the young,

30
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,120
the poor, the suffering.

31
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,100
They will be our army.

32
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,170
You know what to do with it?

33
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,350
There is still a place for us in this world.

34
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,020
Only in dreams.

35
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,010
Dream with me.

36
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,770
You're one of them?

37
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,890
Now you know.

38
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,200
Know what?

39
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,330
That you -- you're a witch?

40
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,790
Yes. A witch.

41
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,620
You should just keep going now.

42
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,520
We don't have much time.

43
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,190
I still need to know. 

44
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,640
Why?

45
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,330
Survival.

46
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,460
All I want is for you to save yourself, so go.

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,590
Believe that I still love you enough

48
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,320
to simply be satisfied knowing you survive,

49
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,880
even if that means I'm never gonna see you again.

50
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,090
It came back to me.

51
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,990
As you came back to me.

52
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,040
All things return,

53
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,690
like every salty tear returns to the sea.

54
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,300
This is something one learns.

55
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,640
As a witch?

56
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,560
As a woman.

57
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:42,720
You know, my father said

58
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,620
this was the land of second chances.

59
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,280
So this is ours.

60
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,300
We could start again.

61
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,930
All we have to do is walk away.

62
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,010
You don't understand.

63
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,060
They'd never let me. I --

64
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,890
Then stay.

65
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,540
You have a choice.

66
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,910
What you have to do, whatever it is,

67
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,670
will it really make you happy?

68
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,360
I don't know.

69
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,580
I think you do.

70
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,610
I think you know as well as I do

71
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:24,820
that there'll be no peace in your heart like there is today.

72
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,140
My heart has never known peace.

73
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,960
Then maybe, just maybe,

74
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,770
We'll find it together.

75
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,280
All right. I'll come.

76
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,280
But there's something I must do first.

77
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,250
If I don't go back and fix it, 

78
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,650
terrible things will happen.

79
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,050
This is my vow.

80
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,800
I will meet you here

81
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,300
before the moon rises above those trees --

82
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,470
I swear it.

83
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,260
Okay.

84
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,250
But when the moon goes, I go...

85
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,300
with or without you.

86
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,860
I shall be back.

87
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,480
All right.

88
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,700
*Pound me the witch drums*

89
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,810
*Witch drums*

90
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,330
*Pound me the witch drums*

91
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,660
*Pound me the witch drums*

92
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,880
*The witch drums*

93
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,390
*Better pray for hell*

94
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:01,610
*Not hallelujah*

95
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,600
A tribute.

96
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:35,650
For you.

97
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,020
For you, my queen.

98
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,530
Mercy.

99
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,210
Of all the lost souls in salem,

100
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,790
I pity yours most of all.

101
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,370
My dear, what have I done to you?

102
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,890
What have you done to me?

103
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,200
You have betrayed me.

104
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,350
It was never my intention to betray you, Mercy.

105
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,270
I saw myself in your eyes,

106
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,770
knew what it was like to have nothing, be nothing,

107
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,370
and I wanted so much more for you.

108
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,700
So I gave you what you wished for,

109
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,520
but I warned you.

110
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,030
No, I didn't wish for my friends to be killed.

111
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,870
I promised them that they would be safe...

112
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,100
Because you -- you promised me.

113
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,950
But you lied.

114
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,590
You lied.

115
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,520
And now they are all dead.

116
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,490
Everything that comes from your lips is a lie.

117
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,470
It's a lie.

118
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,950
Lies! Lies!

119
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,600
Lies!

120
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,680
Lies!

121
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,750
- Mercy? - Don't look for me now, not here.

122
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,800
You won't find me.

123
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,190
But I will find you when you least want to be found.

124
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:15,920
Isaac.

125
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,140
Have you come to help dismantle my mind?

126
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,730
Is that what they're doing?

127
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,340
Yes...in effect.

128
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,940
On my father's order --

129
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,920
His condition for accepting me back into the flock.

130
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,700
All my collection,

131
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,530
all the tools of useless reason...

132
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,260
...all but one.

133
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,520
My father says I must return to the beginning of all knowledge.

134
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,380
As a reward for my loss and my humiliation,

135
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,030
I am to be allowed to return with him to Boston.

136
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,460
Oh, Isaac.

137
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,540
What do you want with me in this,

138
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,780
the hour of my abasement?

139
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,760
I don't know what that means, sir.

140
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,690
But I came to say something about captain Alden.

141
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,960
He is to be hung today.

142
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,610
But you two were friends.

143
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,940
You might never have said so, but I know so.

144
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,230
And I believe, in this life,

145
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,360
we have no power to alter where or when we go,

146
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,210
but we can say things to each other.

147
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,600
Sometimes, words are all we have left.

148
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,000
Have you said goodbye to captain Alden?

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,670
I'm not sure I can bear to...

150
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,960
Especially given how much --

151
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,510
How much blame may lie on my shoulders.

152
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,460
But, as usual, you speak with more wisdom

153
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,200
than all of the mathers in history combined.

154
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,850
Good day, sir.

155
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,900
- Father - Where have you been?

156
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,770
Shopping.

157
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,790
I believe I have everything we shall need

158
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,430
to survive for a week or more.

159
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,030
Survive? Survive what?

160
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,300
This way.

161
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,750
Here. Give me a hand with this, dear.

162
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,040
What's the matter? Haven't you ever held a live bird before?

163
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,380
No, I-I haven't.

164
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,320
Well, a little -- little tighter.

165
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,890
Here. Can you feel its heart beating?

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,360
Yes, I can.

167
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,350
Don't worry. There's nothing to be frightened of.

168
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:32,980
Come.

169
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,630
No! No more will die.

170
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,210
This began with me, and I shall be the one to end it.

171
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,420
Silence!

172
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,450
Or I shall deal with you as I dealt with Rose.

173
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,320
No longer will you stand in my way -- not now, not ever.

174
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,370
I'm leaving Salem, and I am never coming back.

175
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,620
You may do as you like when I'm gone,

176
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,800
but you will not follow me or hinder me in the years ahead.

178
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,910
Then unchoose me.

179
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,750
Put magistrate Hale in charge.

180
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,750
His line is ancient, and yet still springs green a new heir.

182
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,090
No, I'm not the one.

183
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,100
I was just a black rose you grafted to your vine,

184
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,860
and I've had enough --

185
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,070
Enough blood and death --

186
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,170
And I will be free.

188
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,800
Ah, my son...

189
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,360
with his customary expression

190
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,280
of befuddlement and utter incomprehension.

191
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,480
What's happened, father?

192
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,280
Have you taken him off and killed him already,

193
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,370
without the benefit of final words or prayers

194
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,230
or -- or witnesses?

195
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,400
Of course not.

196
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,190
Would I do such a thing to an innocent man?

197
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,320
You see, I never doubted John Alden's innocence.

198
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,120
Just as I know that he is a man of excessive personal honor,

199
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,340
I never doubted the fact that

200
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,900
he had ample and good reason for killing whoever he did kill.

201
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,970
You mock me, sir.

202
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,850
No, I do not.

203
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,890
Do you think that I don't know that 

204
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:54,080
Alden has no more malefic or sulfuric power than you or I?

205
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,010
Alden is a traitor, he is a murderer,

206
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,810
he is a free-thinking heretic,

207
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,160
He is a drinker, a man of loose morals,

208
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,960
and he is guilty of the sin of pride,

209
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,400
but a witch -- not at all.

210
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,400
However, he is in love with a witch,

211
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,050
and more importantly, a witch is in love with him.

212
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,770
You mean Mary Sibley? A witch?

213
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,880
Believe it or not, as you choose.

214
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,950
Nevertheless, it is true.

215
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,010
The most important woman in Salem -- a witch?

216
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,080
Have you any proof, any evidence?

217
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,280
At present, I have none.

218
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,380
However, when she is apprehended with her lover,

219
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,560
a man she has freed from a locked jail cell with magic,

220
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,730
I'll have her dead to rights.

221
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,010
You. 

222
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,370
Have you done as I told you?

223
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,900
Yes, sir. Tore it into two.

224
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,190
Snuck half into his pocket as I led him to his cell.

225
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,630
The other half, here.

226
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,150
Blood the hounds. Run him down.

227
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,920
Heed me carefully --

228
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,300
someone will be with him, and they're both very dangerous,

229
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,520
so do not attempt to capture them or bring them back,

230
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,810
but execute them then and there,

231
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,280
on the spot -- both of them.

232
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,720
- You have my authority to do this. - Sir.

233
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,630
Now, off with you. Go on. 

234
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,540
Sir, I plead with you to bring them back for a fair trial.

235
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,120
There's no need for a trial.

236
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,510
This is our one and only opportunity

237
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,860
to avert the great death that they intend for us.

238
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,760
I have no choice in this. The witch will die tonight.

239
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,670
How long has this been here?

240
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,900
Since I built the house.

241
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,590
You do not survive all that I have survived

242
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,630
without knowing how to keep a true hiding place.

243
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,400
This room, whose door only blood can open,

244
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,140
is our sanctuary.

245
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,360
You'll be safe here.

246
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,560
How long must we stay inside?

247
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,350
I think at least a week before the winds cleanse the air.

248
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,710
And this is how we will know it has begun.

249
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,520
What disaster unfolds outside

250
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,290
that we must cower from in here?

251
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,090
Tonight, there will be a plague released near Salem,

252
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,200
A pox upon the puritan house.

253
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,670
Only those who carry the witch blood in their veins

254
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,670
or are touched by it

255
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,480
will be safe from this pox.

256
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,530
Then I will die of it, too.

257
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,820
Cotton Mather examined me. I'm no witch.

258
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,640
Really?

259
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,470
Then he is an even more incompetent witchfinder

260
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,520
than I thought.

261
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,140
Look around. Don't you recognize anything here?

262
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,610
When you were very little, I brought you here often,

263
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,390
that you might not begin your life as a damned puritan,

264
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,600
without the sounds, the music in your ears,

265
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,140
or all the colors of art in your eyes.

266
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,230
Here.

267
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,060
You drew that when you were 3.

268
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,270
This.

269
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,380
Well, that was your favorite.

270
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,430
I carved it for you.

271
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:39,010
But why -- why can't I remember?

272
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,830
Because I had to take away your memories

273
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,180
Until you were ready for them, but now you are.

274
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,410
I do. I do remember.

275
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,330
But...I remember it dancing.

276
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,070
It did dance for you.

277
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,510
You made it dance.

278
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,210
I?

279
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,700
Look at it.

280
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,420
And in your mind's eye, see it dancing.

281
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,700
Oh, George, I shall miss

282
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,940
The dazzle and wit of your conversation.

283
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,880
Do you know what tonight is, George?

284
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,960
It's the luckiest night of your life.

285
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,960
You'll never know how close you all came to utter destruction.

286
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,640
You once took away from me everything that meant anything.

287
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,470
But tonight, I shall finally have it all back.

288
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,870
Truer than you know...

289
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,620
...mistress.

290
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,690
What do you want here, traitor?

291
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,060
I? Traitor?

292
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,440
I, who have endured the worst

293
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,050
That sick man could inflict upon my flesh to protect you?

294
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,860
I think not.

295
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,120
'tis you who have betrayed those who nurtured you,

296
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,400
You who have turned your back

297
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,390
On everything we have planned these long years.

298
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,150
No.

299
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,050
No, I'm leaving not to betray, but to be true...

300
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,950
Perhaps for the first time... to myself.

301
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,850
You are going nowhere.

302
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:43,140
Seven years ago, two girls walked into the woods.

303
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,190
There, one of them made a vow.

304
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,900
To seal that vow, she offered up a most precious thing...

305
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,070
The life she carried within.

306
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,690
No need to remind me of that dark night.

307
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,630
I shall never be free of its memory.

308
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,360
No.

309
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,610
You cannot forget what you have never really known.

310
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,370
Have you never asked yourself,

311
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,540
Never wondered what really happened that night,

312
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,270
Where the life that swelled your belly went?

313
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,940
Nothing is created.

314
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,460
Nothing is destroyed.

315
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,910
All is only ever transformed.

316
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,800
Open it.

317
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,420
My child...

318
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,070
lives?

319
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,740
For now, depending on your choice.

320
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,030
This... this is some foul trick in order to control me.

321
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,530
No, you did not kill the child that night.

322
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,320
You gave him to the dark lord we serve,

323
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,070
And this child has been treasured

324
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,010
Like no other in a thousand years.

325
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,350
He has lacked for nothing... except his mother.

326
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,890
What do you want from me?

327
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,580
Only what you have vowed to do.

328
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,960
Complete the grand rite, and all shall be well.

329
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,960
And if I do not?

330
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,700
A sacrifice deferred is yet more powerful...

331
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,970
Especially a blood sacrifice.

332
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,920
Hear me well, foul creature.

333
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,970
You have manipulated me for the last time.

334
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,540
I will complete your grand rite.

335
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:49,010
But when it is done, I swear to you, you will pay.

336
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,990
We must all live without choices, Mary.

337
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,470
You know that best of all.

338
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,090
He's gone.

339
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,670
Captain Alden's missing.

340
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,590
Was it you?

341
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,110
I told you I would not let him hang.

342
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,560
Thank you, Mary.

343
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,160
Thank you.

344
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,490
It's beautiful.

345
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,120
Yes. It is.

346
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,650
What is it?

347
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,490
Death.

348
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,670
It's a bad thing,

349
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,350
And it needs to go to a bad place.

350
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,790
Then I'm your man.

351
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,590
Here.

352
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,630
That's a fortune.

353
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,770
Several fortunes, actually...

354
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,180
Far less than you deserve, sweet Isaac,

355
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,820
For doing such a job.

356
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,500
You can start a new life with it,

357
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:30,150
One as good as your good heart deserves.

358
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,000
Thank you.

359
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,480
Isaac, listen carefully.

360
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:39,200
The most important thing is that, when you leave it,

361
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,680
you keep going -- far away and quickly.

362
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,640
Boston, New York, Virginia 

363
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,240
just keep going.

364
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,430
And one more thing --

365
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,970
on your way out of town,

366
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,840
deliver this letter to Cotton Mather.

367
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,240
I shall never see you again, will I?

368
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,990
No. No, I expect not.

369
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,440
That makes me very sad. 

370
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,740
Y-you and the captain are the closest things 

371
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,290
to friends I ever had...

372
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,970
Except for a horse I once knew, 

373
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,810
but she died.

374
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,660
You shall buy a new horse, 

375
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,960
a whole team of them.

376
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,480
And you shall make new friends.

377
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,900
This is the land of second chances.

378
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,570
Like you and John Alden?

379
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,270
W-will you get your second chance?

380
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,460
Yes. 

381
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,620
Yes, I expect we will.

382
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,980
Who is here?

383
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,180
Is it the whore of Babylon?

384
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,920
Oh, dear Increase --

385
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,410
So terribly right

386
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,530
and so terribly wrong.

387
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:18,120
I can see before my eyes how right I was.

388
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,040
Your darkling glow burns brighter than ever...

389
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,460
witch.

390
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,780
Sir.

391
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,540
For you.

392
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:37,770
What is it?

393
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,860
No idea.

394
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,400
Mrs. Sibley asked me to give it you.

395
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,860
Now I must go, for the road is long,

396
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,400
and...my legs are not.

397
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,430
Tell me, exactly. 

398
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,600
How was I wrong?

399
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,180
You thought love would be my undoing,

400
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,930
that I would be in the woods with my lover,

401
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,840
and you would kill me there without a trial,

402
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,180
thus ending my grand rite.

403
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,040
I will share with you the secret

404
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,880
that you and your kind have sought in vain for centuries --

405
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,950
innocent blood.

406
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,560
13 innocent sacrifices,

407
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,550
and when the last is spilled, 

408
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,550
our malum opens,

409
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:31,150
unleashing the red death it contains within it.

410
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,260
And yet, not once in the last 500 years

411
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,580
have we succeeded...

412
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,610
Until I came along and realized

413
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,380
we needn't spill a single drop of

414
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,810
innocent blood ourselves --

415
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,820
not when we had fearful and fanatical puritans

416
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,210
all too ready to do it for us.

417
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,570
So you gave us Giles Corey,

418
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,060
Bridget Bishop...

419
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,110
the Barkers, and others,

420
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,580
and of course, those poor, deceived girls --

421
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,890
innocent blood by the buckets.

422
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,460
And now here we are, 

423
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,490
night of full hunter's moon.

424
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,840
12 innocents dead,

425
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,440
and only one more required before moonfall.

426
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,990
Not if I kill you first.

427
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,760
Oh, yes, kill the witch who began this grand rite,

428
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,030
and you might yet avert the great death to come.

429
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,130
Good luck with that.

430
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,610
Oh, Increase.

431
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:58,320
You're gonna have to do so much better than that.

432
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,840
But I will make you a promise.

433
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,690
It will end here, in this room, right now.

434
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,540
You there! Stop!

435
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:05,420
You've done the right thing, Isaac...

436
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,050
taking such a load off her hand.

437
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,580
Mary said to put it here in the old tree.

438
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,580
This ain't right.

439
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,890
Oh, this ain't right.

440
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,240
Any fool can feel that,

441
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,210
even this fool.

442
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,300
She said you were death.

443
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,680
I'm gonna put you where the dead belong.

444
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,060
You are no better than those you hunt.

445
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,700
No, you're far worse.

446
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,990
A witch, like a wolf, 

447
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,390
doesn't torture her sacrifice.

448
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,780
Only priests and inquisitors do that.

449
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,580
Perhaps you can convince yourself

450
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,190
that there is scant difference between good and evil,

451
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,660
but I know better.

452
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,570
Did it ever occur to you

453
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,290
that the dark power we gain is precisely that

454
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,350
which you think you can expel from yourself?

455
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,780
You know nothing, creature.

456
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,620
Whatever happens here today only proves

457
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:31,040
that what I believe...is true.

458
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,820
Father! 

459
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,520
Father!

460
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,910
Cotton.

461
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,480
Thank god Isaac found you.

462
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:50,460
Help me. Your father -- he's gone mad!

463
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,520
Father, what have you done?!

464
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,820
I? I've done nothing.

465
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,690
This succubus has come to me.

466
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,990
She's playing with your mind.

467
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,010
She has put herself into that chair!

468
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:58,810
What?! 

469
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,070
How?

470
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,570
He is a devil.

471
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,020
Oh, he's a mad devil, sir!

472
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,560
Father, you said Mary Sibley was a witch.

473
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,360
She is a witch.

474
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,390
Then why is she not in the woods, father,

475
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,690
saving Captain Alden, as you said she would be?!

476
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,680
I have no time for your idiotic question

477
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,130
and less for your infernal doubt!

478
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,250
Your great plan has proven nothing!

479
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,750
Now you resort to torturing an innocent woman

480
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,200
to obtain some kind of false confession from her?!

481
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,910
Are you too blind to see?!

482
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,340
Look -- she is not even there!

483
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,650
She is a mere phantasm!

484
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,680
Father!

485
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,390
She is a specter!

486
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,390
Father, I fear you have lost your reason.

487
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,220
And you, boy --

488
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:44,640
You have never had any reason, you pathetic failure.

489
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,240
This bitch dies now!

490
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,760
No, please, no, no.

491
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,780
Cotton. Cotton.

492
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,690
W-what have you done?

493
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,490
You foolish boy.

494
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:15,450
You -- Cotton. Cotton.

495
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,620
God.

496
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,960
For god's sake...

497
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,070
Kill the witch.

498
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,460
I have killed him.

499
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,680
I don't -- I don't understand.

500
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,390
How did it -- how do you come to be here?

501
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,530
He dragged me from my rooms.

502
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,640
He was going to torture me... 

503
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,010
to death.

504
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,390
I must call for help.

505
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,980
No. No, there's no help for it now.

506
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,350
But I must tell someone.

507
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,600
I must tell someone what I've done.

508
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,440
No.

509
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,710
I must tell someone what I've done!

510
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:35,160
No, you would ruin your family --

511
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,200
the very name of Mather.

512
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,570
I will tell no one what he tried to do, 

513
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,850
nor what you did.

514
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,400
But you must leave, Cotton.

515
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:50,880
Go to Boston now, tonight, immediately.

516
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,210
What -- what about him?

517
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,450
Better they find him here after you are gone.

518
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:59,240
They will think those that support Alden got to him --

519
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,520
or even witches.

520
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,250
Now go!

521
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,580
Oh, dear Increase.

522
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,980
I hope you're alive enough to know

523
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:52,380
what an honor you've been granted.

524
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,300
Oh, such an honor...

525
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,860
...to be our 13th victim.

526
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,200
Our grand rite now is done.

527
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,200
Blood-dim dawn now shall come.

528
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,930
Powers of moon and sun ignite.

529
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,270
All flesh trembles at the sight.

530
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,400
13 souls fed to hungry earth

531
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,330
Opens the way for our dark lord's birth.

532
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,680
It's begun.

533
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,970
I honestly didn't think Mary would be able

534
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,380
 to do it in the end.

535
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,570
Mary? 

536
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,800
Mary Sibley?

537
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,350
She is one of you?

538
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,460
One of us?

539
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,330
Oh, far more than that, dear.

540
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,690
For better or worse, 

541
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,050
she is the first among us.

542
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,420
She is behind all this?

543
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,780
She, a witch,

544
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,320
killed all those innocents,

545
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,290
killed...Bridget, 

546
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,580
as a witch?

547
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,320
Indeed, it was her idea

548
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,750
to use the puritans to sacrifice themselves for us --

549
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,330
an inspired, if dangerous idea.

550
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,770
Why has the sun come out? 

551
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,610
What is going on outside?

552
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:15,140
Death. Death is happening.

553
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,280
Then why aren't you trying to stop it?

554
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,750
Why are we in here,

555
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:24,750
while outside, our friends and neighbors perish?

556
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,460
It's too late for that.

557
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,500
Now we can only wait and then tend to the survivors.

558
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,840
Survivors?

559
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,390
I will have none of this.

560
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,950
Whatever it is, 

561
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,920
I would rather be with those that suffer it,

562
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,090
not those that perpetrate it.

563
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,330
Open the door.

564
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,930
It is sealed.

565
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,450
Only more blood will open it now.

566
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,270
Open!

567
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,960
I told you -- only blood.

568
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,050
Then my blood...

569
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,240
- Anne, stop! Stop! - No!

570
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,330
- Stop! Stop it! - No!

571
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,860
Let me out!

572
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,450
I said stop it!

573
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,200
I am not you.

574
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,090
I am not like you.

575
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:37,770
I am not a witch!

576
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,320
I am not you!

577
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,870
Off to meet thy maker.

578
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,460
Most agree the soul lingers for some time,

579
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,610
very close to where the body lies.

580
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:35,750
It sees and hears and feels keenly what happens.

581
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,370
I'm glad of that --

582
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,570
glad you'll suffer through what's still about to happen.

583
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,550
How good of you to train these fine animals

584
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,820
to lust for your own blood.

585
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,040
It guarantees you the burial you deserve.

586
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,810
The dogs will eat their fill of you

587
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:05,810
and shit your remains out in the crags.

588
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,600
You did it,

589
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,200
And soon, the red death will destroy Salem.

590
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,570
No thanks to you.

591
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,300
I have been much help, I would say.

592
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,800
And now I have even more to give. 

593
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,380
Come.

594
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,140
Now...

595
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,720
Now...

596
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,310
...you see, children,

597
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,480
only by killing the rose

598
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,400
will the queen of the night

599
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,770
really become the queen of the night.

600
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,560
Little did that mighty queen know

601
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,000
that all her plans

602
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,100
would be turned upside down.

603
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:27,410
Yes, that wasn't really the true queen of the night

604
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:29,550
who beheaded the rose.

605
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,870
That was me.

606
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:37,140
I beheaded the rose.

607
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,960
Though Mary Sibley knows it not yet,

608
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,170
I am the queen of the night.

609
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,970
And she will pay for what she's done.

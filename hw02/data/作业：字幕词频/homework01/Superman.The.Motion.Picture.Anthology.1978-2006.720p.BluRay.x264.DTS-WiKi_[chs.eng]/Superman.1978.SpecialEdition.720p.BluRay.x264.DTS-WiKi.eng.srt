1
00:00:40,782 --> 00:00:45,116
"In the decade of the 1930s
even the great city of Metropolis...

2
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,283
"...was not spared the ravages
of the world-wide depression.

3
00:00:49,457 --> 00:00:51,357
"In the times of fear and confusion...

4
00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:55,494
"...the job of informing the public
was the responsibility...

5
00:00:55,563 --> 00:00:56,996
"...of the Daily Planet.

6
00:00:57,065 --> 00:00:59,329
"A great metropolitan newspaper...

7
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:04,531
"...whose reputation for clarity and truth
had become a symbol of hope...

8
00:01:04,672 --> 00:01:06,640
"...for the city of Metropolis."

9
00:06:41,175 --> 00:06:43,370
This is no fantasy.

10
00:06:44,512 --> 00:06:47,640
No careless product of wild imagination.

11
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,273
No, my good friends...

12
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:54,016
...these indictments...

13
00:06:55,723 --> 00:06:57,691
...l've brought you today...

14
00:06:58,693 --> 00:07:02,720
...specific charges listed herein
against the individuals...

15
00:07:03,664 --> 00:07:07,600
...their acts of treason.
Their ultimate aim of sedition.

16
00:07:10,771 --> 00:07:11,863
These...

17
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,904
...are matters of undeniable fact.

18
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,380
I ask you now to pronounce judgment...

19
00:07:24,552 --> 00:07:26,213
...on those accused.

20
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,189
On this...

21
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,961
...this mindless aberration...

22
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:42,262
...whose only means of expression
are wanton violence and destruction.

23
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,004
On the woman Ursa...

24
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:50,638
...whose perversions
and unreasoning hatred of all mankind...

25
00:07:51,212 --> 00:07:54,613
...have threatened even the children
of the Planet Krypton.

26
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,315
Finally, General Zod.

27
00:08:06,894 --> 00:08:08,794
Once trusted by this Council...

28
00:08:09,096 --> 00:08:12,725
...charged with maintaining the defense
of the Planet Krypton itself.

29
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,298
Chief Architect of this intended revolution
and author of this insidious plot...

30
00:08:18,205 --> 00:08:20,673
...to establish a new order amongst us...

31
00:08:22,076 --> 00:08:24,874
...with himself as absolute ruler.

32
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,243
You have heard the evidence.

33
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:33,185
The decision of the Council
will now be heard.

34
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:34,050
Guilty!

35
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:37,284
Guilty!

36
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:39,848
Guilty!

37
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,161
The vote must be unanimous, Jor-EI.

38
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:48,497
It has therefore now become your decision.

39
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:51,094
You alone will condemn us if you wish...

40
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,033
...and you alone will be held responsible
by me!

41
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,846
Join us!

42
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,112
You have been known to disagree
with the Council before.

43
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,983
Yours could become an important voice
in the new order, second only to my own!

44
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:18,289
I offer you a chance for greatness, Jor-EI!

45
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:20,660
Take it! Join us!

46
00:09:22,503 --> 00:09:24,767
You will bow down before me, Jor-EI.

47
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:28,369
I swear it!
No matter that it takes an eternity!

48
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:31,311
You will bow down before me!

49
00:09:31,846 --> 00:09:34,246
Both you and then one day...

50
00:09:34,315 --> 00:09:35,577
...your heirs!

51
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:09,498
Forgive me, forgive me...

52
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:31,357
An unpleasant duty
has been masterly performed, Jor-EI.

53
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:34,529
They have received the fate they deserved.

54
00:11:35,135 --> 00:11:37,603
Isolation in the Phantom Zone...

55
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:39,832
...an eternal living death.

56
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:44,005
A chance for life, nonetheless.

57
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:46,171
As opposed to us.

58
00:11:47,815 --> 00:11:49,077
It's suicide.

59
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,378
No, it's worse, it's genocide.

60
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,451
Be warned, Jor-EI.

61
00:11:54,955 --> 00:11:58,914
The Council has already evaluated
this outlandish theory of yours.

62
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:03,624
My friends, you know me
to be neither rash nor impulsive.

63
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:08,857
I am not given
to wild unsupported statements...

64
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,233
...and I tell you that we must evacuate
this planet immediately.

65
00:12:14,575 --> 00:12:17,544
Jor-EI, you are one
of Krypton's greatest scientists.

66
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,575
Yes, but so is Vond-Ah.

67
00:12:24,885 --> 00:12:26,443
I don't question your data.

68
00:12:27,054 --> 00:12:28,578
The facts are undeniable.

69
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,891
It's your conclusions
we find unsupportable.

70
00:12:38,432 --> 00:12:40,923
This planet will explode within 30 days.

71
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:42,268
If not sooner.

72
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,571
I tell you Krypton
is simply shifting its orbit.

73
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,270
Jor-EI...

74
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:49,673
...be reasonable.

75
00:12:51,612 --> 00:12:52,772
My friend...

76
00:12:55,115 --> 00:12:58,676
...I have never been otherwise.
This madness is yours.

77
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:00,714
This discussion is terminated.

78
00:13:02,423 --> 00:13:04,857
The decision of the Council is final.

79
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:26,670
Any attempt by you to create...

80
00:13:27,214 --> 00:13:30,479
...a climate of fear and panic
among the populace...

81
00:13:30,617 --> 00:13:34,348
...must be deemed by us
an act of insurrection.

82
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:37,114
You would accuse me of insurrection?

83
00:13:38,392 --> 00:13:40,883
Has it now become a crime to cherish life?

84
00:13:42,229 --> 00:13:45,130
You would be banished
to endless imprisonment...

85
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,164
...in the Phantom Zone:

86
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:49,101
The eternal void...

87
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,229
...which you, yourself discovered.

88
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:57,773
Will you abide by the Council's decision?

89
00:14:03,283 --> 00:14:04,807
I will remain silent.

90
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:07,978
Neither I...

91
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:11,316
...nor my wife, will leave Krypton.

92
00:15:07,514 --> 00:15:08,640
Have you finished?

93
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:12,715
Nearly.

94
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,252
It's the only answer, Lara.

95
00:15:20,427 --> 00:15:22,190
If he remains here with us...

96
00:15:23,664 --> 00:15:25,689
...he will die as surely as we will.

97
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:27,163
But why Earth, Jor-EI?

98
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:30,035
They're primitives,
thousands of years behind us.

99
00:15:30,437 --> 00:15:32,735
He will need that advantage to survive.

100
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:36,836
Their atmosphere will...

101
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,703
...sustain him.

102
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:49,652
He will defy their gravity.

103
00:15:49,857 --> 00:15:51,757
He will look like one of them.

104
00:15:52,793 --> 00:15:54,658
He won't be one of them.

105
00:15:55,295 --> 00:15:56,125
No.

106
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,227
His dense molecular structure
will make him strong.

107
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:04,537
He'll be odd. Different.

108
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:09,801
He'll be fast. Virtually invulnerable.

109
00:16:11,378 --> 00:16:14,108
Isolated. Alone.

110
00:16:18,418 --> 00:16:19,783
He will not be alone.

111
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,721
He will never be alone.

112
00:16:37,571 --> 00:16:40,472
The energy input to Jor-EI's quarters
is now in excess.

113
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:43,870
Our data indicates the loss
is due to a misuse of energy.

114
00:16:44,745 --> 00:16:45,939
Investigate.

115
00:16:46,747 --> 00:16:49,716
And if the investigation proves correct?

116
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:54,012
He knew the penalty he faced.

117
00:16:55,622 --> 00:16:57,590
He even is a member of this Council.

118
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:01,927
The law will be upheld.

119
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,306
You will travel far, my little Kal-EI.

120
00:17:49,776 --> 00:17:51,334
But we will never leave you.

121
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,675
Even in the face of our death...

122
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:57,914
...the richness of our lives...

123
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,253
...shall be yours.

124
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:05,990
All that I have, all that I've learned,
everything I feel...

125
00:18:07,527 --> 00:18:09,085
...all this and more, I...

126
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,194
...I bequeath you, my son.

127
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,870
You will carry me inside you...

128
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:22,141
...all the days of your life.

129
00:18:24,077 --> 00:18:26,045
You will make my strength your own...

130
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,371
...see my life through your eyes...

131
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:32,449
...as your life will be seen through mine.

132
00:18:35,555 --> 00:18:38,183
The son becomes the father,
and the father...

133
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:40,590
...the son.

134
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:45,762
This is all I...

135
00:18:48,802 --> 00:18:52,533
...all I can send you, Kal-EI.

136
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,359
...which Einstein called his theory
of relativity.

137
00:23:15,302 --> 00:23:17,270
Embedded in the crystals before you...

138
00:23:17,804 --> 00:23:21,103
...is the total accumulation of all literature
and scientific fact...

139
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:23,206
...from dozens of other worlds...

140
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,574
...spanning the 28 known galaxies.

141
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:50,269
Early Chinese writings point out
the complex relationship between...

142
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:56,905
By carrying this complex equation
to its ultimate power, my son...

143
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,578
Chief among these powers
will be your sight...

144
00:24:03,683 --> 00:24:05,810
...your strength, your hearing...

145
00:24:06,086 --> 00:24:09,351
...your ability to propel yourself
at almost limitless speed.

146
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:15,350
The early history of our universe was
a bloody mosaic of interplanetary war.

147
00:24:15,995 --> 00:24:18,657
Each of the six galaxies
which you will pass through...

148
00:24:18,998 --> 00:24:21,728
...contain their own individual law
of space and time.

149
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:25,100
It is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history.

150
00:24:58,438 --> 00:24:59,905
- What!
- What was that?

151
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:27,257
Now wouldn't that beat all get out.
Well, you...

152
00:25:37,277 --> 00:25:38,301
Oh, Pa!

153
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,109
Oh, my.

154
00:26:13,813 --> 00:26:15,872
All these years, as happy as we've been...

155
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:19,612
...how I've prayed the good Lord
would see fit to give us a child.

156
00:26:21,988 --> 00:26:24,354
Honey, will you hand me that rag up there.

157
00:26:24,757 --> 00:26:26,247
You take things easy now.

158
00:26:26,326 --> 00:26:28,954
Remember what Doc Frye said
about that heart of yours.

159
00:26:34,868 --> 00:26:38,167
Now the first thing we've got to do
when we get home is find out...

160
00:26:38,938 --> 00:26:40,803
...who that boy's proper family is.

161
00:26:42,108 --> 00:26:44,576
He hasn't got any.
Not around here, anyway.

162
00:26:49,015 --> 00:26:51,415
Are you thinking
what I think you are thinking?

163
00:26:52,685 --> 00:26:56,314
We could say he's the child of my cousin
in North Dakota...

164
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,580
...and just now orphaned.

165
00:27:01,227 --> 00:27:03,286
Jonathan, he's only a baby.

166
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:07,125
Martha, now you saw how we found him.

167
00:27:10,537 --> 00:27:13,335
Martha Clark Kent,
are you listening to what I'm saying?

168
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,764
Come on, gang.

169
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,075
That was a great game.

170
00:27:54,314 --> 00:27:55,281
All right.

171
00:27:57,483 --> 00:28:00,247
Come on, hustle. Let's go.
Stack your helmets neatly.

172
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:03,981
Remember about those uniforms,
cleaned and washed by tomorrow...

173
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,957
...and looking like a football team.

174
00:28:06,192 --> 00:28:09,525
Clark, let's have those clothes washed
and ready for tomorrow's game.

175
00:28:09,596 --> 00:28:11,223
Got to beat Mount Vernon High.

176
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,096
Can you give me a lift?

177
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:20,770
Lana?

178
00:28:20,974 --> 00:28:24,774
Don't bother with these.
I'll take them in with the other equipment.

179
00:28:26,112 --> 00:28:28,307
- Thank you, Clark.
- Sure.

180
00:28:29,415 --> 00:28:32,384
Listen, a whole bunch of us are going up
to Mary Ellen's.

181
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:35,884
Play some records.
Would you like to come?

182
00:28:37,991 --> 00:28:38,821
Sure.

183
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:40,949
Sounds like it could be a lot of fun.

184
00:28:41,327 --> 00:28:43,591
Kent can't make it.
Still got a lot of work to do.

185
00:28:44,364 --> 00:28:47,094
What are you talking about?
I've just finished stacking...

186
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,267
All that?

187
00:28:49,268 --> 00:28:50,394
Oh, Brad!

188
00:28:51,571 --> 00:28:53,004
Hey, come on, Lana.

189
00:28:55,308 --> 00:28:56,240
Let's go.

190
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,210
- He has to clean up.
- 'Bye, Clark.

191
00:28:59,445 --> 00:29:01,470
- 'Bye, Lana.
- Clean this up, Clark.

192
00:29:04,183 --> 00:29:05,275
'Bye, Clark.

193
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,618
'Bye, Clark.

194
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:15,260
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

195
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:28,998
Mommy, I saw a boy out there
run as fast as the train!

196
00:30:29,168 --> 00:30:30,567
Faster even!

197
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:34,897
Lois Lane,
you have a writer's gift for invention.

198
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:36,998
- I'll say that for you.
- But...

199
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,471
Lois, please read your book.

200
00:30:40,546 --> 00:30:41,945
No one ever believes me.

201
00:31:14,013 --> 00:31:15,844
Hey, look, there's Clark!

202
00:31:18,885 --> 00:31:19,874
Clark?

203
00:31:20,953 --> 00:31:22,545
How did you get here so fast?

204
00:31:23,689 --> 00:31:24,621
I ran.

205
00:31:24,891 --> 00:31:26,119
Ran, huh?

206
00:31:26,325 --> 00:31:29,294
Told you he was an oddball.
Let's get out of here.

207
00:31:36,402 --> 00:31:38,529
Been showing off a bit, haven't you, Son?

208
00:31:51,517 --> 00:31:53,280
I didn't mean to show off, Pa.

209
00:31:57,056 --> 00:32:00,719
It's just that guys like that Brad,
I just want to tear them apart.

210
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:01,817
Yeah, I know.

211
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:04,296
Yeah, I know I shouldn't.

212
00:32:04,397 --> 00:32:07,195
Yeah, I know you can do
all these amazing things...

213
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,064
...and sometimes you think
that you will just go bust...

214
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:12,137
...unless you can tell people about it.

215
00:32:12,205 --> 00:32:13,467
- Yeah.
- That's right.

216
00:32:13,573 --> 00:32:16,542
I mean, every time I get the football
I can make a touchdown.

217
00:32:16,642 --> 00:32:18,439
- That's for sure.
- Every time.

218
00:32:18,778 --> 00:32:22,270
Is it showing off when somebody's doing
the things he's capable of doing?

219
00:32:22,448 --> 00:32:24,382
Is a bird showing off when it flies?

220
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,178
No, no. Now, you listen to me.

221
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,720
When you came to us, we thought
people would take you away...

222
00:32:32,391 --> 00:32:34,757
...when they found out
the things that you do.

223
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,825
It worried us a lot.

224
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:40,227
Then when a man gets older
and he thinks very differently.

225
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,267
And things get very clear.

226
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:47,735
And there's one thing I do know, Son,
and that is you are here for a reason.

227
00:32:48,474 --> 00:32:51,136
I don't know whose reason,
or whatever the reason is...

228
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,768
...maybe it's because...

229
00:32:56,883 --> 00:32:58,009
I don't know.

230
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:03,948
But I do know one thing.
It's not to score touchdowns.

231
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,552
Thanks, Dad.

232
00:33:10,229 --> 00:33:11,924
I'll race you to it. Yeah.

233
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,130
You will?

234
00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:15,467
Come on, Papa. Run. Come on. Move.

235
00:33:15,701 --> 00:33:18,499
Go, go. Come on. Hey, Baron.

236
00:33:49,969 --> 00:33:51,436
Jonathan!

237
00:33:57,777 --> 00:33:58,766
Dad.

238
00:34:49,895 --> 00:34:51,886
All those things I can do...

239
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:55,767
...all those powers...

240
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,161
...and I couldn't even save him.

241
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:02,120
Clark, get up.

242
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,389
Good morning, Smiley.

243
00:38:09,728 --> 00:38:11,821
Clark, breakfast.

244
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,829
Are you going to sleep all day?

245
00:38:19,705 --> 00:38:21,969
Clark, come on. Get up.

246
00:39:23,035 --> 00:39:24,229
I have to leave.

247
00:39:30,643 --> 00:39:32,702
I knew this time would come.

248
00:39:33,946 --> 00:39:36,642
We both knew it
from the day we found you.

249
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,619
I talked to Ben Hubbard yesterday.

250
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:56,795
He said that he'd be happy
to help out from now on.

251
00:40:05,844 --> 00:40:06,868
Mother!

252
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,672
I know, Son.

253
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,273
I know.

254
00:40:17,656 --> 00:40:20,454
Do you know where you're headed?

255
00:40:25,064 --> 00:40:26,053
North.

256
00:40:32,004 --> 00:40:33,266
Remember us, Son.

257
00:40:35,674 --> 00:40:37,107
Always remember us.

258
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,171
My son...

259
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:24,250
...you do not remember me.

260
00:46:25,857 --> 00:46:26,983
I am Jor-EI.

261
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,057
I am your father.

262
00:46:32,564 --> 00:46:35,192
By now you will have reached
your eighteenth year...

263
00:46:35,934 --> 00:46:37,526
...as it is measured on Earth.

264
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:40,237
By that reckoning...

265
00:46:41,373 --> 00:46:44,399
...I will have been dead
for many thousands of your years.

266
00:46:46,978 --> 00:46:48,172
The knowledge...

267
00:46:49,448 --> 00:46:52,611
...that I have of matters,
physical and historical...

268
00:46:53,118 --> 00:46:56,315
...I have given you fully on your voyage
to your new home.

269
00:46:57,556 --> 00:46:59,717
These are important matters to be sure...

270
00:47:00,592 --> 00:47:02,787
...but still matters of mere fact.

271
00:47:04,529 --> 00:47:06,360
There are questions to be asked...

272
00:47:07,499 --> 00:47:10,093
...and it is time for you to do so.

273
00:47:13,105 --> 00:47:14,299
Here, in this...

274
00:47:15,774 --> 00:47:18,299
...this fortress of solitude...

275
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,275
...we shall try to find the answers together.

276
00:47:24,382 --> 00:47:25,542
So, my son...

277
00:47:26,985 --> 00:47:27,815
...speak.

278
00:47:29,821 --> 00:47:30,617
Who am I?

279
00:47:32,023 --> 00:47:33,320
Your name is Kal-EI.

280
00:47:34,993 --> 00:47:38,087
You are the only survivor
of the Planet Krypton.

281
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:43,023
Even though you were raised
as a human, you are not one of them.

282
00:47:44,336 --> 00:47:48,067
You have great powers,
only some of which you have...

283
00:47:48,707 --> 00:47:50,106
...as yet discovered.

284
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,670
Come with me now, my son...

285
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:57,681
...as we break through the bars
of your earthly confinement.

286
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:59,876
Traveling through time and space.

287
00:48:01,486 --> 00:48:05,217
Your powers will far exceed
those of mortal men.

288
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:08,054
It is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history.

289
00:48:08,193 --> 00:48:11,356
Rather let your leadership stir others to.

290
00:48:13,298 --> 00:48:17,234
In the next year,
we shall examine the human heart.

291
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:20,395
It is more fragile than your own.

292
00:48:22,674 --> 00:48:26,633
As we pass through the flaming turmoil
which is the edge of your own galaxy...

293
00:48:27,345 --> 00:48:29,836
...we will enter the realm
of the red Krypton sun...

294
00:48:29,915 --> 00:48:32,247
...source of your strength
and nourishment...

295
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:34,850
...and cause of our eventual destruction.

296
00:48:36,321 --> 00:48:38,812
The Planet Krypton, my son...

297
00:48:39,691 --> 00:48:41,886
...your home as it was.

298
00:48:43,995 --> 00:48:47,795
This year we shall examine
the various concepts of immortality...

299
00:48:48,266 --> 00:48:50,234
...and their basis in actual fact.

300
00:48:51,403 --> 00:48:55,533
The total accumulation of all knowledge
spanning the 28 known galaxies...

301
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:59,204
...is embedded in the crystals
which I have sent along with you.

302
00:48:59,611 --> 00:49:01,238
Study them well, my son.

303
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:07,910
By the time you return to the confines
of your galaxy...

304
00:49:08,386 --> 00:49:10,581
...twelve of your years will have passed.

305
00:49:11,223 --> 00:49:12,986
For this reason, among others...

306
00:49:14,125 --> 00:49:16,093
...I have chosen Earth for you.

307
00:49:16,361 --> 00:49:19,159
It is now time for you to rejoin
your new world...

308
00:49:20,031 --> 00:49:22,329
...and to serve its collective humanity.

309
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:25,803
Live as one of them, Kal-EI...

310
00:49:26,671 --> 00:49:29,640
...and discover where your strength
and your power are needed.

311
00:49:30,141 --> 00:49:34,771
But always hold in your heart the pride
of your special heritage.

312
00:49:36,114 --> 00:49:38,810
They can be a great people, Kal-EI,
they wish to be.

313
00:49:39,885 --> 00:49:42,183
They only lack the light to show the way.

314
00:49:44,155 --> 00:49:47,283
For this reason, above all,
their capacity for good...

315
00:49:48,793 --> 00:49:50,283
...I have sent them you...

316
00:49:52,631 --> 00:49:53,723
...my only son.

317
00:50:30,135 --> 00:50:32,729
Okay, this is it, mac, the Daily Planet.

318
00:50:33,305 --> 00:50:37,105
Fresh fruit!
Hey, how about a tomato, lady?

319
00:50:37,709 --> 00:50:39,870
Hey, fresh fruit and vegetables.

320
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,209
Smile.

321
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,443
How many "T's" in "bloodletting"?

322
00:51:17,549 --> 00:51:18,447
Two.

323
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,321
What are you writing?

324
00:51:26,424 --> 00:51:28,688
An ode to spring.
How do you spell "massacre"?

325
00:51:29,728 --> 00:51:34,165
M-a-s-s-a-c-r-e.

326
00:51:34,866 --> 00:51:35,855
Thanks.

327
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:38,625
Golly, how come you get
all the great stories?

328
00:51:38,737 --> 00:51:40,864
A good reporter doesn't get great stories.

329
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,439
A good reporter makes them great.

330
00:51:42,507 --> 00:51:44,600
Chief, here's that story on the murder case.

331
00:51:44,676 --> 00:51:48,009
The way I see it, it's a headline
on the front page with my picture...

332
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,606
There's only one "P" in "rapist."
Lois Lane, say hello to Clark Kent.

333
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:53,540
Hello, Miss Lane, how are...

334
00:51:57,956 --> 00:52:00,117
How are you doing?
Jimmy Olsen, photographer.

335
00:52:00,191 --> 00:52:02,022
Hi. Clark Kent. Nice to meet you.

336
00:52:03,595 --> 00:52:06,189
It's got everything:
Sex, violence, the ethnic angle.

337
00:52:06,464 --> 00:52:08,864
So does a lady wrestler
with a foreign accent.

338
00:52:08,967 --> 00:52:11,094
- Kent, can you open this?
- Sure, Mr. White.

339
00:52:11,202 --> 00:52:13,466
This could be the basis
for a series of articles:

340
00:52:13,538 --> 00:52:16,302
"Making Sense of Senseless Killings"
by Lois Lane.

341
00:52:16,608 --> 00:52:19,236
We get psychologists,
sociologists, interviews...

342
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:22,746
Lois, you're pushing a bunch
of rinky-dink tabloid garbage.

343
00:52:23,081 --> 00:52:25,106
The Daily Planet has a tradition...

344
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:26,650
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

345
00:52:27,085 --> 00:52:29,553
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to shake it up like that.

346
00:52:30,155 --> 00:52:31,452
Of course not, Lois.

347
00:52:32,057 --> 00:52:35,185
Why would any one want to make
a total stranger look like a fool?

348
00:52:37,429 --> 00:52:38,487
I'll take that.

349
00:52:38,563 --> 00:52:40,428
Thanks. I'm sorry, Mr. White.

350
00:52:40,498 --> 00:52:44,059
Why do I pay you $40 a week when
I should have you arrested for loitering?

351
00:52:44,169 --> 00:52:45,659
- Go get Mr... a towel.
- Kent.

352
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:47,237
- Move, kid, move.
- Right, Chief.

353
00:52:47,338 --> 00:52:49,363
- Make mine black, no sugar.
- Right, Chief.

354
00:52:49,474 --> 00:52:50,941
And don't call me sugar.

355
00:52:52,277 --> 00:52:54,006
Right... Sugar.

356
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:56,840
Chief wants coffee, no sugar.
I'll take tea with lemon.

357
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:01,382
Lois, why don't you take Kent out
to meet everybody, huh?

358
00:53:01,453 --> 00:53:04,354
Just introduce him around.
He's starting on the paper today.

359
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,148
I'm giving him the City beat.

360
00:53:06,925 --> 00:53:07,721
Chief!

361
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:09,927
That's my beat!

362
00:53:10,328 --> 00:53:13,957
Lois, Clark Kent may seem like
just a mild-mannered reporter...

363
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:18,226
...but not only does he know how to treat
his Chief with the proper respect...

364
00:53:18,336 --> 00:53:21,066
...not only does he have a snappy,
punchy prose style...

365
00:53:21,139 --> 00:53:25,098
...but he is, in my 40 years in this business,
the fastest typist I have ever seen.

366
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:26,199
That's great.

367
00:53:26,978 --> 00:53:28,673
Here, you forgot my article.

368
00:53:32,383 --> 00:53:34,647
Excuse me, Mr. White. I was wondering...

369
00:53:34,752 --> 00:53:37,152
...if you could arrange for half my salary...

370
00:53:37,355 --> 00:53:39,755
...to be sent to this address
on a weekly basis.

371
00:53:40,225 --> 00:53:41,055
Your bookie, right?

372
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:41,921
My what?

373
00:53:42,026 --> 00:53:43,015
Don't tell me!

374
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:46,029
He sends a check every week
to his sweet, gray-haired mother.

375
00:53:46,164 --> 00:53:47,825
Actually, she's silver-haired.

376
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:51,568
I'll see what I can do.

377
00:53:52,303 --> 00:53:54,100
Thank you very much, Mr. White.

378
00:53:58,576 --> 00:53:59,270
Well?

379
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,712
Any more at home like you?

380
00:54:03,515 --> 00:54:04,641
Not really, no.

381
00:54:07,785 --> 00:54:09,082
I didn't think so.

382
00:54:10,688 --> 00:54:12,986
Well, get yourself a desk over here.

383
00:54:13,758 --> 00:54:14,747
Over here?

384
00:54:14,826 --> 00:54:17,590
Here, there's some paper
and a file right there.

385
00:54:17,762 --> 00:54:18,694
Sorry.

386
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:38,411
- Hi, Bill Breesen.
- Hi, Clark Kent.

387
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:40,815
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome aboard.

388
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:44,816
- Here's your towel, Mr. Clark.
- Kent.

389
00:54:44,889 --> 00:54:45,913
- What?
- Kent.

390
00:54:46,991 --> 00:54:48,891
- Clark Kent.
- Jimmy Olsen.

391
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,169
- I met this really great guy, you know.
- Hey, fabulous.

392
00:54:58,236 --> 00:55:01,672
We had this fabulous weekend.
I met him at this dude ranch.

393
00:55:01,739 --> 00:55:03,366
I haven't been since I was seven.

394
00:55:03,441 --> 00:55:06,308
- I got to mail these letters.
- Good luck tonight.

395
00:55:06,377 --> 00:55:07,867
- Hi, Clark.
- Hi, Lois.

396
00:55:07,946 --> 00:55:10,346
How did you like your first day on the job?

397
00:55:11,082 --> 00:55:13,642
The hours were sort of longer
than I expected...

398
00:55:13,718 --> 00:55:16,983
...but on the whole, meeting you
and Jimmy Olsen and Mr. White...

399
00:55:17,055 --> 00:55:19,216
Gosh, on a whole, I'd say it's been swell.

400
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:20,655
- "Swell"?
- Yup.

401
00:55:22,594 --> 00:55:23,754
You know, Clark...

402
00:55:25,129 --> 00:55:27,563
...there are very few people left
in the world...

403
00:55:27,632 --> 00:55:29,691
...who feel comfortable saying that word.

404
00:55:29,801 --> 00:55:31,029
- What word?
- Swell.

405
00:55:31,135 --> 00:55:33,626
Really? I always thought
it was kind of natural.

406
00:55:35,907 --> 00:55:37,602
- Sorry.
- Clark.

407
00:55:41,346 --> 00:55:42,870
- Sorry, Lois.
- Hi, Rex.

408
00:55:43,281 --> 00:55:46,148
- Did you see anything good today?
- Not until you came along.

409
00:55:46,417 --> 00:55:47,509
Rex, this is...

410
00:55:47,585 --> 00:55:49,553
- Clark Kent. How do...
- See you around.

411
00:55:51,823 --> 00:55:52,687
Lois?

412
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,056
Hey, where you going?

413
00:55:55,126 --> 00:55:56,525
Can I help you with your coat?

414
00:55:56,594 --> 00:55:58,391
- Thanks. Can you get that?
- Sure.

415
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,862
Did you like Mr. White?

416
00:55:59,931 --> 00:56:02,195
He was a nice guy
and Jimmy was fantastic.

417
00:56:03,067 --> 00:56:04,796
Come here. Come on.

418
00:56:04,902 --> 00:56:06,460
Get in here, hurry up. Come on.

419
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:09,802
- We'd better get out of here.
- We'd better do what he says, Lois.

420
00:56:10,074 --> 00:56:11,564
Come on, get in here, quick.

421
00:56:11,676 --> 00:56:14,577
Don't, don't do anything.
It's all right, I'm coming.

422
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:15,907
We're coming.

423
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,104
Excuse me.

424
00:56:17,482 --> 00:56:18,574
- Here?
- Yeah, yeah.

425
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:21,676
Don't point that at me, sir.
You could hurt somebody with that.

426
00:56:22,987 --> 00:56:24,579
Okay, okay. Hold it there.

427
00:56:24,822 --> 00:56:25,811
Just a minute.

428
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:27,352
Now I realize that...

429
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:30,724
...times are tough for some these days,
but this isn't the answer.

430
00:56:30,795 --> 00:56:34,162
You can't solve society's problems
with a gun.

431
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,824
You know, buddy, you're right.

432
00:56:37,201 --> 00:56:40,762
- I'm going to turn over a new leaf.
- Good for you, sir. That's the spirit.

433
00:56:40,905 --> 00:56:42,896
He doesn't really want to hurt anyone.

434
00:56:43,808 --> 00:56:45,935
Right after I rip off this lady's purse.

435
00:56:46,044 --> 00:56:46,874
Of course!

436
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:48,939
Now come on, lady, hand it over.

437
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,314
Lois, I think you'd better...

438
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,379
Lois! What are you doing?

439
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,206
Are you all right?

440
00:57:18,242 --> 00:57:19,300
What happened?

441
00:57:20,244 --> 00:57:23,407
- Golly, I guess I must have fainted.
- Fainted?

442
00:57:24,549 --> 00:57:26,312
- You fainted!
- I'm sorry.

443
00:57:40,264 --> 00:57:42,755
Really, Lois,
supposing that man had shot you?

444
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,859
Is it worth risking your life over $10...

445
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:47,335
...two credit cards,
a hairbrush and a lipstick?

446
00:57:48,172 --> 00:57:49,969
- How did you know that?
- Know what?

447
00:57:51,743 --> 00:57:54,075
You described the exact contents
of my purse.

448
00:57:58,416 --> 00:57:59,314
Wild guess.

449
00:58:03,254 --> 00:58:04,050
Taxi!

450
00:58:08,993 --> 00:58:10,358
- Hey!
- Hi, Otis.

451
00:58:21,806 --> 00:58:23,467
So, what's happening, partner?

452
00:58:23,674 --> 00:58:24,868
Look what we got.

453
00:58:25,443 --> 00:58:26,501
Let's take him.

454
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,178
Wait a minute.

455
00:58:28,246 --> 00:58:30,476
Maybe he'll lead us to the big man himself.

456
00:58:30,848 --> 00:58:31,837
Lex Luthor?

457
00:58:32,216 --> 00:58:33,478
You got it, Aramus.

458
00:58:34,752 --> 00:58:36,549
We'll make Captain by midnight.

459
00:58:38,623 --> 00:58:42,389
Hey, what do you read?
XK-101 rocket to be used.

460
00:58:43,294 --> 00:58:44,761
Hey, what do you read?

461
00:58:45,129 --> 00:58:46,858
- Hey, Matt.
- Hi, Otis.

462
00:58:46,931 --> 00:58:48,831
Just getting a Daily Planet here.

463
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,339
Okay. All right.

464
00:58:56,874 --> 00:58:59,206
See, I'm paying him,
and I got a pretzel, too.

465
00:58:59,277 --> 00:59:00,369
Thanks, Otis.

466
00:59:01,212 --> 00:59:02,474
How many bags, Shutzy?

467
00:59:05,483 --> 00:59:08,043
This is Metropolis 46. We're on foot.
Over and out.

468
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:09,251
Let's go.

469
00:59:14,325 --> 00:59:16,657
Your attention, please.

470
00:59:16,727 --> 00:59:18,524
Your attention, please.

471
00:59:18,629 --> 00:59:21,894
The Metropolis Flyer is now ready
for departure...

472
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,928
...on the upper level. Track 6.

473
00:59:26,838 --> 00:59:30,001
He's going down on a train platform.
I'm going after him.

474
00:59:30,074 --> 00:59:32,702
Okay, I'll call for backup.
Be careful now, will you?

475
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,472
All right, Aramus. All right.

476
00:59:36,547 --> 00:59:38,777
Now boarding on the lower level...

477
00:59:39,317 --> 00:59:44,050
Now 10 minutes, air-conditioned cars,
Mount Vernon, Poughkeepsie...

478
00:59:44,388 --> 00:59:45,912
Board now. All aboard.

479
00:59:46,224 --> 00:59:49,751
Metropolis Transportation
to Buffalo, Syracuse...

480
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:53,355
Smoking cars are forward,
move along now.

481
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,227
Luggage at the top.

482
00:59:55,766 --> 00:59:58,735
Smoking cars are forward.
All aboard, boarding.

483
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:29,064
Aramus, Aramus, make it Track 22.

484
01:00:29,534 --> 01:00:32,799
I've seen him and I'm right on him.
Lower level, Track 22.

485
01:01:09,907 --> 01:01:11,169
So that's it!

486
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:31,055
It's amazing that brain can generate
enough power to keep those legs moving.

487
01:02:13,237 --> 01:02:14,033
Harry...

488
01:02:16,641 --> 01:02:18,802
Harry, where are you? Harry?

489
01:02:39,163 --> 01:02:39,891
Sick!

490
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,767
Sick, you're really sick!

491
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:53,200
I'm sick, Ms. Teschmacher?

492
01:02:53,344 --> 01:02:56,336
Sick when we're days
from executing the crime of the century?

493
01:02:56,914 --> 01:02:59,212
No, no, no. Step away from that, please.

494
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:04,447
How do you choose to congratulate
the greatest criminal mind of our time?

495
01:03:04,955 --> 01:03:06,752
Do you tell me that I'm brilliant?

496
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:09,850
Oh, no, that would be too obvious,
I grant you.

497
01:03:10,094 --> 01:03:11,061
Charismatic?

498
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:12,959
Fiendishly gifted?

499
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:15,632
Try twisted!

500
01:03:21,472 --> 01:03:23,531
Get away from that, get away!

501
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:27,143
Tell me, Lex.

502
01:03:27,311 --> 01:03:30,303
Why do so many people have to die
for the crime of the century?

503
01:03:30,381 --> 01:03:31,678
Why? You ask why?

504
01:03:32,316 --> 01:03:35,149
Why does the phone always ring
when you're in the bathtub?

505
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:39,919
Why is the most brilliantly diabolical leader
of our time...

506
01:03:40,624 --> 01:03:42,922
...surrounding himself
with total nincompoops?

507
01:03:42,993 --> 01:03:44,290
I'm back, Mr. Luthor.

508
01:03:44,995 --> 01:03:46,963
I was just talking about you.

509
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,499
You were followed again.

510
01:03:53,971 --> 01:03:55,905
In spite of those cat-like reflexes.

511
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:02,641
Mr. Luthor, I'm sorry.

512
01:04:05,282 --> 01:04:07,216
Is that the newspaper
I asked you to get me?

513
01:04:08,285 --> 01:04:09,217
Yes.

514
01:04:10,154 --> 01:04:11,781
Then why am I not reading it?

515
01:04:13,691 --> 01:04:15,659
Because I haven't given it to you yet?

516
01:04:15,993 --> 01:04:16,789
Right.

517
01:04:22,032 --> 01:04:23,294
At last it's official.

518
01:04:24,401 --> 01:04:26,528
Thanks to the help of the US Government...

519
01:04:26,637 --> 01:04:30,437
...we are about to be involved in
the greatest real-estate swindle of all time.

520
01:04:30,775 --> 01:04:32,072
Lex, what is this...

521
01:04:32,143 --> 01:04:35,237
...obsession with real estate?
All the time, "land, land, land."

522
01:04:35,546 --> 01:04:38,413
When I was 6 years old,
my father said to me...

523
01:04:38,582 --> 01:04:39,412
"Get out!"

524
01:04:41,218 --> 01:04:44,847
Before that, he said,
"Son, stocks may rise and fall...

525
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:47,755
"...utilities and transportation systems
may collapse...

526
01:04:47,825 --> 01:04:50,919
"...people are no damn good,
but they'll always need land...

527
01:04:50,995 --> 01:04:53,327
"...they'll pay through the nose to get it."

528
01:04:53,397 --> 01:04:55,627
- "Remember," my father said...
- "Land."

529
01:04:58,969 --> 01:05:01,335
It's a pity that he didn't see...

530
01:05:01,405 --> 01:05:04,340
...from such humble beginnings
how I've created this empire.

531
01:05:04,408 --> 01:05:05,705
An empire. This?

532
01:05:06,977 --> 01:05:11,573
How many girls do you know
have a Park Avenue address like this?

533
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:15,411
Park Avenue address, 200 feet below?

534
01:05:15,753 --> 01:05:18,415
Do you realize
what people are shelling out up there...

535
01:05:18,689 --> 01:05:21,283
...for a few miserable rooms
off a common elevator.

536
01:05:21,859 --> 01:05:23,793
What more could anyone ask?

537
01:05:31,936 --> 01:05:34,905
Get this Loch Ness update
right into composing.

538
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:38,434
Yeah. No, that's it, Roth.
Put it to bed. Right.

539
01:05:39,243 --> 01:05:41,507
- Why are you standing here for?
- I'm not.

540
01:05:42,379 --> 01:05:44,006
- I wasn't going to say it.
- Go.

541
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:51,087
The sex maniac profile.

542
01:05:51,288 --> 01:05:54,553
Right. Nine to five it's
a Pulitzer Prize winner. What do you bet?

543
01:05:54,625 --> 01:05:56,252
There's no "Z" in "brassiere."

544
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:58,758
Nice job on that union scandal, Kent.

545
01:05:59,063 --> 01:06:00,462
Gosh, thanks, Mr. White.

546
01:06:05,269 --> 01:06:06,600
Hi, Clark. Good night.

547
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:09,468
- Here, let me carry that for you.
- Thanks a lot.

548
01:06:09,673 --> 01:06:11,641
Lois, have you got a minute?

549
01:06:12,142 --> 01:06:13,268
Excuse me, please.

550
01:06:14,545 --> 01:06:17,878
And these two go to the addresses
on the envelope, okay?

551
01:06:18,749 --> 01:06:21,013
I was wondering
if you'd have dinner with me?

552
01:06:21,085 --> 01:06:23,019
I'm sorry, I'm booked.

553
01:06:23,754 --> 01:06:27,554
Air Force One is landing at the airport.
This kid'll be there to make sure...

554
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:30,685
...you-know-who answers the questions
he would rather duck.

555
01:06:30,761 --> 01:06:32,126
Don't you ever let up?

556
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:35,264
What for? I mean I've seen
how the other half lives.

557
01:06:35,399 --> 01:06:39,233
My sister, for instance.
Three kids, two cats, and one mortgage.

558
01:06:39,803 --> 01:06:41,634
I would go bananas in a week.

559
01:06:41,772 --> 01:06:44,570
- Can I take you to the airport?
- Not unless you can fly.

560
01:06:47,845 --> 01:06:50,575
"Ladies." I have to change, thank you.
Goodbye.

561
01:06:50,648 --> 01:06:51,842
Maybe we could...

562
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:02,391
- Would you mail that for me? Thanks.
- Sure.

563
01:07:02,626 --> 01:07:03,615
Good night.

564
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:11,631
Going down, please, going down.

565
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:16,063
Going down?

566
01:07:16,173 --> 01:07:17,538
Going up. Up, up.

567
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:20,499
Good night.

568
01:07:32,589 --> 01:07:34,750
Daily Planet, Copter One. This is ground.

569
01:07:34,825 --> 01:07:36,190
Planet One, go ahead.

570
01:07:36,393 --> 01:07:40,762
Miss Lane is here for a ride to the airport
to meet Air Force One. It's a hurry flight.

571
01:07:41,165 --> 01:07:45,226
We're on our way over the river.
Have one aboard for transfer. Over.

572
01:07:45,602 --> 01:07:50,403
Roger, Planet One. You're clear to land.
Wind 0-2-0-1-5. Altimeter 2-9-8-9.

573
01:07:50,774 --> 01:07:52,071
Roger, Over and out.

574
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:54,895
A malfunction, can't get lift off.

575
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:57,473
- You've hooked a cable.
- What's happening?

576
01:08:59,043 --> 01:09:00,067
Set it down.

577
01:09:00,144 --> 01:09:01,941
My God, we've lost motor control.

578
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:03,070
I can't hold it.

579
01:09:09,753 --> 01:09:10,845
I can't hold it.

580
01:09:12,289 --> 01:09:13,256
He's lost it.

581
01:09:28,072 --> 01:09:28,970
Wake up.

582
01:09:32,142 --> 01:09:33,769
Help!

583
01:09:52,362 --> 01:09:53,659
Step back, folks.

584
01:09:54,398 --> 01:09:56,958
Get back. Move over
to the other side of the street.

585
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:02,803
Bring the canvas here. Get it up there.

586
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,564
There's helicopter up there.

587
01:10:10,948 --> 01:10:12,006
Help me.

588
01:10:20,858 --> 01:10:23,224
All right, folks. Let's move back.

589
01:10:24,194 --> 01:10:25,821
Let these firemen get in here.

590
01:10:28,699 --> 01:10:29,427
Help me!

591
01:10:35,739 --> 01:10:37,036
Hold it. Get back.

592
01:10:41,111 --> 01:10:43,079
Get off the street, folks.

593
01:10:57,594 --> 01:11:00,893
All right, get along there.
Get away from the side of the building.

594
01:11:03,667 --> 01:11:05,760
Hold these crowds back. Move.

595
01:11:08,338 --> 01:11:09,134
Help!

596
01:11:25,756 --> 01:11:26,723
Say, Jim...

597
01:11:27,391 --> 01:11:28,221
Excuse me.

598
01:11:28,292 --> 01:11:29,759
That's a bad outfit.

599
01:11:31,461 --> 01:11:32,928
Okay, move these people.

600
01:11:42,806 --> 01:11:44,273
Oh, my God! Look up there.

601
01:11:46,276 --> 01:11:47,538
What the hell's that?

602
01:11:49,646 --> 01:11:51,170
Easy, miss. I've got you.

603
01:11:51,281 --> 01:11:54,250
You've got me? Who's got you?

604
01:11:56,019 --> 01:11:59,978
I can't believe it, I just cannot believe it.
He got her.

605
01:12:44,835 --> 01:12:46,826
Gentlemen, this man needs help.

606
01:12:48,839 --> 01:12:51,831
I hope this little incident
hasn't put you off flying, miss.

607
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:57,011
Statistically speaking, of course,
it's still the safest way to travel.

608
01:12:58,215 --> 01:12:59,011
Right.

609
01:13:00,083 --> 01:13:01,072
Wait!

610
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:06,882
Who are you?

611
01:13:07,824 --> 01:13:08,791
A friend.

612
01:13:14,131 --> 01:13:15,120
'Bye.

613
01:14:28,672 --> 01:14:30,503
Something wrong with the elevator?

614
01:14:37,948 --> 01:14:38,880
Going down?

615
01:14:51,661 --> 01:14:52,559
Officer.

616
01:14:55,999 --> 01:14:58,297
Good evening, Officer Mooney.

617
01:14:59,069 --> 01:15:01,162
They say confession is good for the soul.

618
01:15:03,073 --> 01:15:06,042
I'd listen to this man. Take him away.

619
01:15:52,055 --> 01:15:53,750
Come on, let's get out of here.

620
01:16:04,334 --> 01:16:05,801
Move your ass! Come on!

621
01:16:06,603 --> 01:16:08,195
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

622
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:11,737
Drop your weapons. Drop your weapons.

623
01:16:11,975 --> 01:16:14,603
Bullshit! Come on, let's get out of here.

624
01:16:14,811 --> 01:16:16,745
Okay, hold it. Hold it right there.

625
01:16:17,047 --> 01:16:18,412
Okay, freeze, you turkeys.

626
01:16:18,482 --> 01:16:20,609
- Don't shoot!
- Keep your cool. You got us.

627
01:16:45,375 --> 01:16:46,501
Bad vibrations?

628
01:16:47,177 --> 01:16:50,271
Sergeant, you don't believe me.
I swear it, flying.

629
01:16:50,747 --> 01:16:53,272
With a big red cape
and bright red boots as well.

630
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:58,050
Quick as a wink he was gone. He flew up
in the air again, he did, like a big blue bird.

631
01:16:58,388 --> 01:17:00,288
- A big blue bird?
- You don't believe me!

632
01:17:00,357 --> 01:17:01,756
With bright red boots?

633
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:03,186
Take the night off.

634
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:05,888
Go back to Murphy's bar
and continue what you started.

635
01:17:06,162 --> 01:17:09,097
I'll be off in a few minutes
and I'll meet you there.

636
01:17:20,277 --> 01:17:22,643
The first bottle's on me.
Let me get my hat.

637
01:17:33,790 --> 01:17:36,020
Frisky, will you come down from there.

638
01:17:38,295 --> 01:17:39,762
Hi. I'll get him.

639
01:17:44,834 --> 01:17:46,392
Come on, it's all right.

640
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:50,905
- Here you go, miss.
- Gee, thanks, mister.

641
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:55,501
Goodbye, Frisky. So long now.

642
01:17:59,182 --> 01:17:59,978
'Bye.

643
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,148
Mommy, Mommy,
Frisky was stuck in the tree.

644
01:18:06,356 --> 01:18:09,154
Then this man swooped out of the sky
and gave him to me.

645
01:18:09,426 --> 01:18:12,190
Haven't I told you to stop telling lies.

646
01:18:17,267 --> 01:18:21,203
Metropolis Airport, this is Air Force One.
Could we have the latest weather report?

647
01:18:21,438 --> 01:18:25,340
Metropolis currently ceiling 500,
overcast 700 broken...

648
01:18:25,542 --> 01:18:29,638
...visibility one half in showers.
Wind 2-4-0-2-5. Altimeter 9-0-9-8.

649
01:18:29,846 --> 01:18:30,642
Roger.

650
01:18:32,115 --> 01:18:34,015
Doesn't look good. What do you think?

651
01:18:35,719 --> 01:18:39,086
- What the hell was that?
- You've lost power in number one.

652
01:18:39,189 --> 01:18:41,214
Lost power? We've lost the whole engine.

653
01:18:41,725 --> 01:18:43,818
- Pressure's going.
- Shut down number one.

654
01:18:43,893 --> 01:18:44,985
Bring up two and three.

655
01:18:45,061 --> 01:18:47,359
We haven't got enough pressure
to keep going.

656
01:18:48,932 --> 01:18:52,231
Mayday, mayday. Metropolis tower.
Air Force One.

657
01:18:52,569 --> 01:18:55,538
We have lost port outboard engine
and part of wing.

658
01:18:55,805 --> 01:18:58,638
Request emergency landing.
What's the position?

659
01:18:58,775 --> 01:19:00,936
Ten miles southwest of Metropolis Airport.

660
01:19:01,011 --> 01:19:02,535
Notify them the President's on board.

661
01:19:02,612 --> 01:19:06,480
Present position 10 miles, that's 10 miles
southwest of Metropolis Airport.

662
01:19:06,549 --> 01:19:09,985
Heading: 3-0-5, height: 6,000 feet.

663
01:19:29,606 --> 01:19:32,040
What the hell happened?
We got our engine back?

664
01:19:32,409 --> 01:19:34,343
What the hell's going on out there?

665
01:19:34,544 --> 01:19:37,638
Fly, don't look, just fly.

666
01:19:38,014 --> 01:19:39,538
We got something.

667
01:19:40,283 --> 01:19:43,548
I'm not saying what it is, just trust me.

668
01:19:56,132 --> 01:19:57,929
You enjoyed it.

669
01:20:01,738 --> 01:20:03,603
I don't know what to say, Father.

670
01:20:03,907 --> 01:20:05,704
I am afraid just got carried away.

671
01:20:06,810 --> 01:20:09,540
- I anticipated this, my son.
- You couldn't have.

672
01:20:10,747 --> 01:20:12,408
You couldn't have imagined...

673
01:20:13,817 --> 01:20:15,079
How good it felt?

674
01:20:17,887 --> 01:20:19,548
You are revealed to the world.

675
01:20:21,725 --> 01:20:22,692
Very well.

676
01:20:23,526 --> 01:20:24,288
So be it.

677
01:20:25,695 --> 01:20:28,323
But you still must keep
your secret identity.

678
01:20:29,032 --> 01:20:29,999
Why?

679
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:31,928
The reasons are two.

680
01:20:32,902 --> 01:20:35,837
First: You cannot serve humanity
28 hours a day.

681
01:20:37,407 --> 01:20:38,965
24.

682
01:20:40,376 --> 01:20:41,775
As it is, it won't happen.

683
01:20:43,646 --> 01:20:46,206
Your help will be called for endlessly.

684
01:20:46,282 --> 01:20:49,683
Even for those tasks that human beings
can solve themselves.

685
01:20:50,353 --> 01:20:53,789
They're happy to abuse the resources
of the world.

686
01:20:54,324 --> 01:20:55,382
And secondly?

687
01:20:55,458 --> 01:20:56,447
Secondly:

688
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:58,487
Your enemies will discover...

689
01:20:59,629 --> 01:21:01,392
...their only way to hurt you...

690
01:21:01,865 --> 01:21:03,833
...by hurting the people you care for.

691
01:21:05,401 --> 01:21:06,459
Thank you, Father.

692
01:21:06,836 --> 01:21:07,803
Lastly:

693
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:13,065
Do not punish yourself
with your feelings of vanity.

694
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:15,437
Simply learn to control them.

695
01:21:15,912 --> 01:21:18,779
It is an affliction common to all,
even on Krypton.

696
01:21:19,783 --> 01:21:23,116
Our destruction could have been avoided
but for the vanity of some...

697
01:21:23,186 --> 01:21:25,677
...who considered us indestructible.

698
01:21:26,656 --> 01:21:28,146
Were it not for vanity...

699
01:21:29,793 --> 01:21:31,488
...at this very moment...

700
01:21:35,865 --> 01:21:38,060
...I could embrace you in my arms...

701
01:21:42,772 --> 01:21:43,704
...my son.

702
01:22:14,904 --> 01:22:18,431
Reports are coming in
of a miraculous saving of Air Force One...

703
01:22:18,575 --> 01:22:21,009
...from almost certain destruction.

704
01:22:21,444 --> 01:22:25,540
Rescuing Miss Lois Lane, reporter
from the Daily Planet, with one hand...

705
01:22:26,749 --> 01:22:29,013
...and a crashed helicopter with the other.

706
01:22:31,821 --> 01:22:33,413
That'll be the day.

707
01:22:35,091 --> 01:22:37,252
That'll be the day when a guy could fly.

708
01:22:38,094 --> 01:22:40,426
I don't know. You would be surprised.

709
01:22:42,966 --> 01:22:44,593
Some sort of fantastic hoax.

710
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:47,803
Your guess is as good as anybody's.
True or false?

711
01:22:47,871 --> 01:22:49,930
Miracle or fraud? The answer...

712
01:22:50,106 --> 01:22:51,767
- Miss Teschmacher!
- Man or myth?

713
01:22:52,442 --> 01:22:53,534
Turn it off.

714
01:23:03,126 --> 01:23:06,926
What's the story on this guy?
Do you think it's the genuine article?

715
01:23:07,063 --> 01:23:08,928
If he is, he's not from this world.

716
01:23:09,632 --> 01:23:10,360
Why?

717
01:23:10,967 --> 01:23:14,733
If any human being was gonna perpetrate
such a hoax, it would have been me!

718
01:23:26,716 --> 01:23:27,512
My robe.

719
01:23:29,819 --> 01:23:31,446
Right away, Mr. Luthor.

720
01:23:32,722 --> 01:23:35,555
It all fits somehow,
this coming here to Metropolis...

721
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,757
...and at this particular time.

722
01:23:42,699 --> 01:23:45,065
There's a kind of cruel justice about it.

723
01:23:45,435 --> 01:23:49,701
To commit the crime of the century, a man
wants to face the challenge of the century.

724
01:23:52,542 --> 01:23:57,070
Listen, maybe this guy that flies
is just sort of passing through.

725
01:23:57,547 --> 01:23:58,639
Passing through?

726
01:23:59,549 --> 01:24:00,982
Not on your life, Otis...

727
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:03,382
...which I would gladly sacrifice
by the way...

728
01:24:04,053 --> 01:24:07,784
...for the opportunity of destroying
everything that he represents.

729
01:24:08,992 --> 01:24:13,793
And, Otis, by the way, next time
put my robe on after I'm out of the pool.

730
01:24:16,299 --> 01:24:17,129
Now look.

731
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:18,697
The Post, "It Flies."

732
01:24:19,169 --> 01:24:21,296
The News, "Look, Ma, No Wires."

733
01:24:21,538 --> 01:24:23,665
The Times,
"Blue Bomb Buzzes Metropolis."

734
01:24:24,007 --> 01:24:27,306
The Planet. We're sitting on top
of the story of the century here.

735
01:24:28,044 --> 01:24:30,239
I want the name
of this flying whatchamacallit...

736
01:24:30,313 --> 01:24:32,474
...to go with the Daily Planet
like bacon and eggs...

737
01:24:32,549 --> 01:24:35,575
...franks and beans, death and taxes,
politics and corruption.

738
01:24:35,818 --> 01:24:37,046
I don't think that he'd...

739
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,714
...lend himself
to any cheap promotion schemes.

740
01:24:39,923 --> 01:24:41,413
Exactly how would you know that?

741
01:24:44,627 --> 01:24:46,254
Just first impression.

742
01:24:46,362 --> 01:24:49,024
Who's talking cheap?
I'll make him a partner if I have to.

743
01:24:49,098 --> 01:24:50,395
- Right?
- Right, Chief.

744
01:24:52,435 --> 01:24:53,732
I want the real story.

745
01:24:54,103 --> 01:24:56,094
I want the inside dope on this guy.

746
01:24:56,706 --> 01:25:00,233
Has he got a family? Where does he live?
What does the "S" stand for?

747
01:25:00,343 --> 01:25:05,440
Tonight at 8:00. Your place.
Hopefully - A friend.

748
01:25:09,152 --> 01:25:11,382
Tony, who is he? Mike, what's his name?

749
01:25:11,621 --> 01:25:14,112
What's he got hidden under that cape?
Batteries?

750
01:25:14,190 --> 01:25:16,055
Why did he show up last night?

751
01:25:16,526 --> 01:25:18,050
Where does he come from?

752
01:25:18,194 --> 01:25:19,593
Does he have a girlfriend?

753
01:25:21,631 --> 01:25:23,531
What's his favorite ball team, Kent?

754
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,228
Now listen to me, I tell you,
boys and girls...

755
01:25:26,603 --> 01:25:28,662
...whichever one of you gets it out of him...

756
01:25:28,771 --> 01:25:32,263
...is going to wind up with the single,
most important interview since...

757
01:25:33,576 --> 01:25:34,975
...God talked to Moses!

758
01:25:38,581 --> 01:25:41,379
What are you standing around about for?
Move!

759
01:25:42,085 --> 01:25:43,450
Get on that story.

760
01:26:01,871 --> 01:26:05,272
"8:00," he said. Some friend!

761
01:26:06,976 --> 01:26:09,843
That's the story of my life,
"Cinderella Bites The Dust!"

762
01:26:22,225 --> 01:26:23,749
Good evening, Miss Lane.

763
01:26:28,598 --> 01:26:30,498
Did you have plans this evening?

764
01:26:31,834 --> 01:26:33,096
This old thing? No.

765
01:26:33,936 --> 01:26:35,494
- I could come back later.
- No!

766
01:26:35,938 --> 01:26:36,802
Don't move.

767
01:26:40,543 --> 01:26:41,908
Sure you can move.

768
01:26:43,079 --> 01:26:44,740
Just don't fly away, all right?

769
01:26:45,815 --> 01:26:48,750
Sorry to drop in on you like this,
but I've been thinking.

770
01:26:49,052 --> 01:26:52,544
There must be some questions
people'd like to know the answers to.

771
01:26:52,622 --> 01:26:53,611
Yes.

772
01:26:59,395 --> 01:27:01,056
You really shouldn't smoke.

773
01:27:02,932 --> 01:27:04,832
Don't tell me. Lung cancer, right?

774
01:27:07,770 --> 01:27:09,362
Well, not yet, thank goodness.

775
01:27:12,942 --> 01:27:14,569
Would you like a glass of wine?

776
01:27:14,811 --> 01:27:16,779
No, thanks. I never drink when I fly.

777
01:27:18,348 --> 01:27:19,440
Nice place.

778
01:27:19,849 --> 01:27:21,077
Thank you.

779
01:27:21,517 --> 01:27:22,677
Thank you.

780
01:27:23,086 --> 01:27:25,316
Shall we get started with the interview?

781
01:27:32,095 --> 01:27:34,825
Let's start with your vital statistics.
Are you married?

782
01:27:36,599 --> 01:27:37,657
No, I'm not.

783
01:27:38,735 --> 01:27:40,293
Do you have a girlfriend?

784
01:27:40,403 --> 01:27:41,700
No, I don't. But...

785
01:27:42,305 --> 01:27:44,603
If I did, you'd be the first to know about it.

786
01:27:51,114 --> 01:27:53,139
- How old are you?
- Over 21.

787
01:27:54,283 --> 01:27:56,444
I get it. You don't want anyone to know.

788
01:27:57,153 --> 01:27:59,553
And how big are you? How tall are you?

789
01:27:59,856 --> 01:28:00,948
About 6' 4".

790
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:04,284
6' 4". And how much do you weigh?

791
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:06,155
Around 225.

792
01:28:07,096 --> 01:28:08,961
225?

793
01:28:16,038 --> 01:28:17,699
I assume then that...

794
01:28:19,208 --> 01:28:22,905
...the rest of your bodily functions
are normal?

795
01:28:24,013 --> 01:28:25,105
I beg your pardon?

796
01:28:26,349 --> 01:28:28,180
Well, putting it delicately...

797
01:28:32,688 --> 01:28:33,814
...do you...

798
01:28:36,959 --> 01:28:37,721
...eat?

799
01:28:38,761 --> 01:28:41,525
Yes, I do, when I'm hungry.

800
01:28:42,365 --> 01:28:44,890
You do. Of course, you do.

801
01:28:45,635 --> 01:28:48,069
Well, then is it true...

802
01:28:48,871 --> 01:28:52,864
...that you can see through anything?

803
01:28:53,309 --> 01:28:55,038
Yes, I can, pretty much.

804
01:28:56,012 --> 01:28:59,175
And that you're totally impervious to pain?

805
01:28:59,749 --> 01:29:00,773
Well, so far.

806
01:29:02,552 --> 01:29:04,383
What color underwear am I wearing?

807
01:29:08,991 --> 01:29:10,253
Did I embarrass you?

808
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:11,825
- No.
- I did.

809
01:29:12,228 --> 01:29:14,822
No, it's just that
this planter must be made of lead.

810
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:16,896
Yes, it is. So?

811
01:29:16,966 --> 01:29:20,527
I sort of have a problem
seeing through lead.

812
01:29:21,637 --> 01:29:22,831
That's interesting.

813
01:29:23,739 --> 01:29:24,967
Problems with lead.

814
01:29:26,442 --> 01:29:29,502
- Do you have a first name?
- Like Ralph, or something?

815
01:29:29,612 --> 01:29:31,045
- No, I mean like...
- Pink.

816
01:29:32,582 --> 01:29:33,378
Pink!

817
01:29:36,419 --> 01:29:38,444
Sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you.

818
01:29:39,956 --> 01:29:41,355
You didn't embarrass me.

819
01:29:43,593 --> 01:29:45,754
What's your background?
Where are you from?

820
01:29:47,396 --> 01:29:49,455
It's kind of hard to explain, actually.

821
01:29:49,699 --> 01:29:52,862
You see, I'm from...
Well, from pretty far away.

822
01:29:53,336 --> 01:29:56,999
Another galaxy, as a matter of fact.
I come from a planet called Krypton.

823
01:29:58,307 --> 01:29:59,296
Krypton.

824
01:30:00,643 --> 01:30:03,942
Cripton! With a C-r-i...

825
01:30:05,314 --> 01:30:08,579
No, actually it's Krypton,
with a K-R-Y-P-T-O-N.

826
01:30:12,388 --> 01:30:13,650
Do you like pink?

827
01:30:19,061 --> 01:30:20,551
I like pink very much.

828
01:30:25,434 --> 01:30:26,332
Why are you?

829
01:30:27,003 --> 01:30:27,833
Sorry?

830
01:30:28,437 --> 01:30:31,964
I mean, why are you here?
There must be a reason for you to be here.

831
01:30:32,375 --> 01:30:35,811
Yes, I'm here to fight for truth and justice
and the American way.

832
01:30:37,179 --> 01:30:39,909
You'll end up fighting every official
in this country.

833
01:30:40,316 --> 01:30:41,783
You don't really mean that.

834
01:30:42,685 --> 01:30:44,209
- I don't believe this.
- Lois?

835
01:30:45,488 --> 01:30:46,512
I never lie.

836
01:30:55,498 --> 01:30:57,489
How fast do you fly, by the way?

837
01:30:58,067 --> 01:31:01,559
I don't know. I've never actually bothered
to time myself.

838
01:31:02,738 --> 01:31:03,397
Say?

839
01:31:05,041 --> 01:31:06,372
Why don't we find out?

840
01:31:07,109 --> 01:31:08,974
And how do you propose we do that?

841
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:12,842
- Take a ride with me.
- You mean I could fly?

842
01:31:12,915 --> 01:31:15,145
I'd be handling the flying, if that's okay.

843
01:31:15,384 --> 01:31:18,615
- This is utterly fantastic.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?

844
01:31:19,021 --> 01:31:20,886
- Are you serious?
- Sure.

845
01:31:21,624 --> 01:31:22,955
Don't you want to go?

846
01:31:24,594 --> 01:31:25,822
You won't need these.

847
01:31:25,895 --> 01:31:29,490
- I need a sweater. It must be kind of...
- No, you'll be warm enough.

848
01:31:36,205 --> 01:31:37,001
Ready?

849
01:31:37,406 --> 01:31:41,968
Clark said that you were just a figment
of somebody's imagination.

850
01:31:43,179 --> 01:31:44,237
Like Peter Pan.

851
01:31:44,847 --> 01:31:47,338
Clark, who's that? Your boyfriend?

852
01:31:47,617 --> 01:31:51,018
- Clark? No, he's nothing.
- Peter Pan?

853
01:31:53,489 --> 01:31:56,856
Peter Pan flew with children, Lois.
In a fairy tale.

854
01:35:13,956 --> 01:35:15,389
Can you read my mind?

855
01:35:21,063 --> 01:35:23,258
Do you know what it is that you do to me?

856
01:35:26,669 --> 01:35:28,136
I don't know who you are.

857
01:35:34,109 --> 01:35:36,304
Just a friend from another star.

858
01:35:40,749 --> 01:35:42,910
Here I am, like a kid out of school.

859
01:35:44,887 --> 01:35:46,479
Holding hands with a god.

860
01:35:48,557 --> 01:35:49,546
I'm a fool.

861
01:35:51,660 --> 01:35:52,854
Will you look at me?

862
01:35:53,562 --> 01:35:54,460
Quivering.

863
01:35:55,598 --> 01:35:57,429
Like a little girl shivering.

864
01:35:58,834 --> 01:36:00,734
You can see right through me.

865
01:36:06,075 --> 01:36:07,440
Can you read my mind?

866
01:36:11,447 --> 01:36:13,745
Can you picture the things I'm thinking of?

867
01:36:18,554 --> 01:36:20,351
Wondering why you are...

868
01:36:22,258 --> 01:36:24,852
...all the wonderful things you are.

869
01:36:27,796 --> 01:36:28,990
You can fly.

870
01:36:30,599 --> 01:36:32,123
You belong in the sky.

871
01:36:34,436 --> 01:36:35,403
You and I...

872
01:36:37,406 --> 01:36:39,067
...could belong to each other.

873
01:36:42,611 --> 01:36:44,044
If you need a friend...

874
01:36:47,650 --> 01:36:49,515
...I'm the one to fly to.

875
01:36:54,123 --> 01:36:55,920
If you need to be loved...

876
01:36:57,893 --> 01:36:58,917
...here I am.

877
01:37:00,763 --> 01:37:01,991
Read my mind.

878
01:37:24,353 --> 01:37:25,980
We forgot to time ourselves.

879
01:37:28,490 --> 01:37:29,718
Maybe next time.

880
01:37:39,268 --> 01:37:40,064
You okay?

881
01:37:44,306 --> 01:37:45,238
Good night.

882
01:37:46,642 --> 01:37:47,540
Good night.

883
01:37:53,315 --> 01:37:54,441
What a super man!

884
01:38:01,023 --> 01:38:02,285
Superman!

885
01:38:07,730 --> 01:38:08,754
Anybody home?

886
01:38:17,806 --> 01:38:19,671
- Hi. Can I come in?
- Oh, yeah.

887
01:38:22,111 --> 01:38:24,545
For goodness' sake,
didn't you hear me knocking?

888
01:38:25,314 --> 01:38:28,306
We did have a date tonight, remember?

889
01:38:32,054 --> 01:38:33,282
You haven't been?

890
01:38:35,057 --> 01:38:39,050
I should certainly hope not.
Well, let's push off, shall we?

891
01:38:39,928 --> 01:38:42,522
I'd better get a coat. It might be cold out.

892
01:38:42,731 --> 01:38:46,997
I mean, I need a purse,
and I have to fix my hair...

893
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:49,335
...put some blusher on.

894
01:39:07,956 --> 01:39:10,550
There's something I have to tell you.
I'm really...

895
01:39:13,796 --> 01:39:17,527
I was at first really nervous about tonight.

896
01:39:19,001 --> 01:39:22,937
But then I decided, darn it, I was going
to show you the time of your life.

897
01:39:23,172 --> 01:39:24,230
That's Clark nice.

898
01:39:27,476 --> 01:39:30,104
We could go for a hamburger
or whatever you want to do.

899
01:39:37,219 --> 01:39:38,186
Now then...

900
01:39:39,888 --> 01:39:42,857
...given the exact location
of the galaxy that he mentions...

901
01:39:43,625 --> 01:39:46,651
...and the proximity
to our own solar system...

902
01:39:49,431 --> 01:39:52,059
It's amazing. Amazing!

903
01:39:53,202 --> 01:39:54,328
Too good to be true.

904
01:39:54,403 --> 01:39:57,702
It's too good to be true.
6' 4", black hair, blue eyes...

905
01:39:57,806 --> 01:40:00,172
...doesn't drink or smoke
and tells the truth.

906
01:40:00,542 --> 01:40:03,033
Some people can read War and Peace...

907
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:05,806
...and think it was an adventure story.

908
01:40:06,315 --> 01:40:08,806
Others can read the ingredients
on a gum wrapper...

909
01:40:09,118 --> 01:40:11,279
...and unlock the secrets of the universe.

910
01:40:12,988 --> 01:40:16,617
Lex, what has chewing gum got to do
with the secrets of the universe?

911
01:40:19,661 --> 01:40:21,219
Right, Miss Teschmacher.

912
01:40:24,867 --> 01:40:26,357
"N."

913
01:40:27,035 --> 01:40:29,503
"M"? You want "M," Mr. Luthor?
Coming right up.

914
01:40:31,306 --> 01:40:32,864
So there you go, "M."

915
01:40:33,041 --> 01:40:35,032
"M" as in "moron," Otis? No.

916
01:40:35,344 --> 01:40:37,335
It's "N" as in "Neanderthal"...

917
01:40:37,713 --> 01:40:40,443
..."nincompoop," "nitwit,"
and "L" as in "ladder."

918
01:40:40,516 --> 01:40:42,279
Here's a ladder, coming right up.

919
01:40:42,384 --> 01:40:44,318
I didn't see...

920
01:40:44,887 --> 01:40:46,286
I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor.

921
01:40:48,157 --> 01:40:51,422
In the interview he says
that the Planet Krypton...

922
01:40:53,328 --> 01:40:55,193
...exploded in 1948.

923
01:40:55,831 --> 01:40:57,492
That ridiculous little freak...

924
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:00,668
...took three years in a rocket
to get to earth.

925
01:41:01,403 --> 01:41:03,030
- Ergo...
- Ergo.

926
01:41:03,338 --> 01:41:05,898
Ergo 1948, that's three years on.

927
01:41:06,842 --> 01:41:08,275
He's 6' 4", you know that?

928
01:41:08,477 --> 01:41:13,380
Do you know why the number 200 is
so vitally descriptive to both you and me?

929
01:41:13,882 --> 01:41:15,372
It's your weight and my I.Q.

930
01:41:15,484 --> 01:41:16,849
Think, people, think.

931
01:41:18,253 --> 01:41:21,188
Deductive reasoning.
That's the name of the game.

932
01:41:23,158 --> 01:41:25,092
Fragments from the Planet Krypton...

933
01:41:25,827 --> 01:41:27,920
...exploded and went into outer space.

934
01:41:28,096 --> 01:41:29,893
It is reasonable to assume...

935
01:41:29,998 --> 01:41:32,990
...that some of those particles of debris
drifted to Earth.

936
01:41:35,938 --> 01:41:36,836
Meteorites!

937
01:41:37,472 --> 01:41:38,404
Jawohl.

938
01:41:40,275 --> 01:41:40,969
Voila!

939
01:41:47,249 --> 01:41:48,113
Voila!

940
01:41:52,588 --> 01:41:55,022
A meteorite found in Addis Ababa?

941
01:41:56,225 --> 01:41:58,750
I know I'll get rapped
in the mouth for this, but...

942
01:41:58,827 --> 01:41:59,987
...so what?

943
01:42:00,529 --> 01:42:03,191
So what? You mean to us
they're just meteorites.

944
01:42:04,132 --> 01:42:05,099
Fair enough.

945
01:42:06,034 --> 01:42:08,559
But the level of specific radioactivity...

946
01:42:08,637 --> 01:42:11,299
...is so high to anyone
from the Planet Krypton...

947
01:42:11,406 --> 01:42:12,873
...this substance is lethal.

948
01:42:14,009 --> 01:42:15,476
Wait a minute, Mr. Luthor.

949
01:42:15,877 --> 01:42:18,505
Fire and bullets can't hurt this guy...

950
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:20,113
...but this stuff here...

951
01:42:20,182 --> 01:42:22,343
...will kill him.

952
01:42:25,821 --> 01:42:27,789
Doesn't it give you a kind of...

953
01:42:27,856 --> 01:42:31,553
...a shudder of electricity through you
to be in the same room with me?

954
01:42:32,995 --> 01:42:36,021
Not like the shudder you'll get
when you lay that rock on him.

955
01:42:36,265 --> 01:42:39,393
He can see you coming for miles
with those super peepers of his.

956
01:42:39,701 --> 01:42:43,068
O Lord, you gave them eyes,
but they cannot see...

957
01:42:43,772 --> 01:42:45,899
...nor can Superman, through lead.

958
01:42:47,809 --> 01:42:50,175
He can't see through lead?

959
01:42:50,746 --> 01:42:52,714
And Kryptonite will destroy him.

960
01:42:56,385 --> 01:42:57,716
Any questions, class?

961
01:42:59,121 --> 01:43:01,385
I wonder what they're wearing
in Addis Ababa?

962
01:43:01,823 --> 01:43:03,290
Looks like a burnoose.

963
01:43:03,659 --> 01:43:05,490
It's just a wraparound.

964
01:43:05,927 --> 01:43:08,657
Are we going to Addis Ababa, Mr. Luthor?

965
01:43:09,698 --> 01:43:11,757
Mother Bird to Missile Convoy, over.

966
01:43:12,234 --> 01:43:14,498
Missile Convoy to Mother Bird, go ahead.

967
01:43:14,736 --> 01:43:18,695
Everything looks good,
see you at the base. Over and out.

968
01:43:19,207 --> 01:43:21,573
Roger, Mother Bird. Over and out.

969
01:44:04,886 --> 01:44:05,853
Look at this!

970
01:44:06,621 --> 01:44:07,849
Looks pretty bad.

971
01:44:12,661 --> 01:44:13,787
Take her pulse.

972
01:44:24,272 --> 01:44:25,933
Get an ambulance down here.

973
01:44:26,041 --> 01:44:28,737
I don't want to hold this convoy up
more than I have to.

974
01:44:29,444 --> 01:44:31,912
She's having trouble breathing.
What do you think?

975
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:34,972
I suggest a vigorous chest massage.

976
01:44:35,050 --> 01:44:37,518
If that doesn't work, mouth-to-mouth.

977
01:44:37,619 --> 01:44:38,608
Yes, sir!

978
01:44:40,255 --> 01:44:43,588
I won't have my men do anything
I wouldn't be prepared to do myself.

979
01:44:43,825 --> 01:44:44,917
Get an ambulance.

980
01:44:45,293 --> 01:44:46,351
Gather around.

981
01:44:48,230 --> 01:44:49,288
Turn around!

982
01:45:17,492 --> 01:45:18,481
Hi.

983
01:45:19,227 --> 01:45:20,251
Somebody hurt?

984
01:45:36,611 --> 01:45:39,341
I did it, Mr. Luthor.

985
01:45:39,981 --> 01:45:41,676
Miss Teschmacher, I did it.

986
01:45:42,317 --> 01:45:45,115
- Just like you told me.
- All right, Otis.

987
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:47,279
It isn't that I don't trust you, but...

988
01:45:48,557 --> 01:45:50,821
I don't trust you, Otis. What did you do?

989
01:45:51,927 --> 01:45:55,590
I set the first directional vector...

990
01:45:56,031 --> 01:45:57,521
...to 38.

991
01:45:57,766 --> 01:46:01,668
The second one to 67.
And the third one to 117.

992
01:46:01,937 --> 01:46:03,370
What about the fourth one?

993
01:46:03,872 --> 01:46:05,066
What fourth one?

994
01:46:05,307 --> 01:46:08,674
Wait a minute. The third one to 117?

995
01:46:08,844 --> 01:46:12,473
- Yes. See, I wrote it down, Mr. Luthor.
- Otis!

996
01:46:13,615 --> 01:46:16,607
The third one was supposed to be 11,
and the fourth one, 7.

997
01:46:18,753 --> 01:46:20,914
Oh, gee, Mr. Luthor.

998
01:46:21,256 --> 01:46:23,918
I guess my arm wasn't long enough, see.

999
01:46:24,025 --> 01:46:26,152
Would you like to see a long arm?

1000
01:46:26,495 --> 01:46:29,953
Otis, would you like to see
a very, very, long arm?

1001
01:46:30,031 --> 01:46:31,225
No, Mr. Luthor.

1002
01:46:45,614 --> 01:46:48,742
- All right. Get it right.
- Yes, Mr. Luthor.

1003
01:46:51,386 --> 01:46:54,321
MacDonald, I thought you told me
this road would be blocked off?

1004
01:46:54,389 --> 01:46:57,620
- Jablowsky, didn't I tell you...
- I didn't asked him, I asked you.

1005
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:00,689
All right. Follow me, men.

1006
01:47:02,397 --> 01:47:05,628
Back that thing off the road.
Back it off the road.

1007
01:47:15,577 --> 01:47:18,512
You'll have to circle back.
I don't have time to argue.

1008
01:47:18,580 --> 01:47:20,241
It's a heck of a day, isn't it?

1009
01:47:27,889 --> 01:47:30,551
- Route 12? That's back there.
- No, sir, it's up there.

1010
01:47:33,628 --> 01:47:37,189
- Sergeant, we took the wrong road.
- I'm a Lieutenant. A Naval Officer.

1011
01:47:44,773 --> 01:47:48,038
Shut up! Now Route 12 is back that way.

1012
01:47:54,249 --> 01:47:56,308
This man is a diabetic, you see.

1013
01:48:07,596 --> 01:48:11,293
As you know, the Daily Planet
is very interested in that dam...

1014
01:48:11,666 --> 01:48:13,429
...but what I don't understand...

1015
01:48:13,501 --> 01:48:16,527
...is why you'd sell out to a faceless person
you've never met?

1016
01:48:16,638 --> 01:48:18,003
You don't know his name.

1017
01:48:21,843 --> 01:48:24,175
At the stupid high price he offered...

1018
01:48:24,245 --> 01:48:26,679
...for this worthless piece of desert...

1019
01:48:26,748 --> 01:48:28,613
...I hope it's Custer!

1020
01:48:30,752 --> 01:48:32,947
Perfect, just what I need. Thank you.

1021
01:48:33,722 --> 01:48:36,987
Reporting live from the launch site,
ground zero.

1022
01:48:38,426 --> 01:48:41,589
Today marks a historic occasion since...

1023
01:48:41,830 --> 01:48:46,028
...two XK-101 rockets will be
launched simultaneously.

1024
01:48:47,002 --> 01:48:49,732
One by the Army, and one by the Navy.

1025
01:48:49,838 --> 01:48:52,170
Hi, everybody.
Has anybody seen Lois today?

1026
01:48:52,273 --> 01:48:54,468
No, but the Chief wants to see you.

1027
01:48:54,576 --> 01:48:56,407
You're blocking the set, Clark.

1028
01:48:57,212 --> 01:48:59,840
Sorry, Gil. How's Judy today? Okay?

1029
01:48:59,914 --> 01:49:00,744
Good.

1030
01:49:01,650 --> 01:49:02,912
Excuse me, Mr. White.

1031
01:49:03,018 --> 01:49:05,953
You wanted to see me, sir?
Have you seen Lois today?

1032
01:49:06,888 --> 01:49:09,220
She's out West,
looking into a land-fraud deal.

1033
01:49:09,557 --> 01:49:12,185
I sent young Olsen with her
on his first assignment.

1034
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:15,559
Some unidentified clown
is buying thousands of acres...

1035
01:49:15,630 --> 01:49:17,860
...of worthless desert at incredible prices.

1036
01:49:17,999 --> 01:49:19,694
That doesn't seem to make sense.

1037
01:49:19,768 --> 01:49:22,396
The world doesn't make sense.
You ought to know that.

1038
01:49:22,937 --> 01:49:25,064
Look at this dispatch from Addis Ababa.

1039
01:49:25,473 --> 01:49:29,432
People break into a museum at night,
kill two people, and what do they take?

1040
01:49:29,544 --> 01:49:32,206
A worthless piece of meteorite.
How do you figure that?

1041
01:49:33,214 --> 01:49:35,876
I've never been able
to understand violence.

1042
01:49:36,484 --> 01:49:37,849
I know that about you.

1043
01:49:37,986 --> 01:49:39,920
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

1044
01:49:40,989 --> 01:49:43,787
I've been in this news game
40 years man and boy...

1045
01:49:44,426 --> 01:49:47,657
...and I got where I am
with guts, compassion...

1046
01:49:48,096 --> 01:49:51,122
...elbow grease and something
you're sadly lacking in, son.

1047
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:52,896
Humility?

1048
01:49:53,234 --> 01:49:55,794
Not humility, you've got bags of humility.

1049
01:49:56,304 --> 01:49:58,499
Aggression, confidence, that's the ticket.

1050
01:49:58,873 --> 01:50:00,966
Take charge.
Let people know who you are.

1051
01:50:09,584 --> 01:50:11,142
This is Lex Luthor.

1052
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:15,281
Only one thing alive with less than
four legs can hear this frequency.

1053
01:50:15,356 --> 01:50:16,345
That's you.

1054
01:50:16,758 --> 01:50:21,457
In five minutes, a poisoned gas pellet
containing propane lithium compound...

1055
01:50:22,097 --> 01:50:25,225
...will be released through thousands
of air ducts in this city...

1056
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:28,736
...effectively annihilating
half the population of Metropolis.

1057
01:50:28,803 --> 01:50:31,931
I was a reporter before most of my friends
were copy boys.

1058
01:50:32,373 --> 01:50:35,069
I want you to get Lois
to introduce you to Superman.

1059
01:50:35,310 --> 01:50:38,473
Find out who he is.
Where did he get that blue suit?

1060
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:41,410
Did he have it made?
Is it silk? Is it plastic?

1061
01:50:42,117 --> 01:50:43,846
I know it all seems a bit much...

1062
01:50:43,918 --> 01:50:46,352
...but how else was I going to meet you,
Superman?

1063
01:50:46,521 --> 01:50:49,718
I knew you'd never accept
an invitation to tea.

1064
01:50:51,092 --> 01:50:55,290
But a disaster, with people in danger,
people who need help...

1065
01:50:56,865 --> 01:51:00,995
I just knew you couldn't resist
that chance to sort of pitch in.

1066
01:51:01,803 --> 01:51:03,134
You know what I mean?

1067
01:51:36,504 --> 01:51:39,701
There's a strong streak of good in you,
Superman.

1068
01:51:40,875 --> 01:51:42,536
But then nobody's perfect.

1069
01:51:46,047 --> 01:51:47,412
Almost nobody.

1070
01:51:56,658 --> 01:51:57,989
- Oh, Superman!
- Gee!

1071
01:51:58,393 --> 01:52:01,328
Stand back, please.
Nothing to get worried about.

1072
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:09,033
Don't sit there like a numskull, get out!

1073
01:52:22,951 --> 01:52:25,419
Look at that overgrown boy scout,
Miss Teschmacher.

1074
01:52:26,254 --> 01:52:27,653
Tell me what you see?

1075
01:52:28,823 --> 01:52:30,620
Cuteness, dimples.

1076
01:52:31,459 --> 01:52:32,585
You like cuteness?

1077
01:52:33,761 --> 01:52:34,523
Dimples.

1078
01:52:35,563 --> 01:52:36,894
I'll give you dimples.

1079
01:53:11,633 --> 01:53:13,624
The pressure is still on you.

1080
01:53:14,369 --> 01:53:16,667
You know they say:
If you can't stand the heat...

1081
01:53:16,771 --> 01:53:18,238
...get out of the tunnel.

1082
01:53:41,696 --> 01:53:43,459
It's your last chance, Superman.

1083
01:53:44,499 --> 01:53:46,899
Why don't you do yourself a favor
and freeze.

1084
01:54:48,563 --> 01:54:50,258
I think he's coming, Mr. Luthor.

1085
01:55:01,476 --> 01:55:03,273
He's definitely coming.

1086
01:55:14,856 --> 01:55:16,118
It's open, come in.

1087
01:55:18,860 --> 01:55:22,091
My attorney will be in touch with you
about the damage to the door.

1088
01:55:22,330 --> 01:55:24,025
Otis, take the gentleman's cape.

1089
01:55:29,937 --> 01:55:31,734
I don't think he wants me to.

1090
01:55:31,839 --> 01:55:33,238
Where's the gas pellet?

1091
01:55:33,741 --> 01:55:34,605
Somewhere.

1092
01:55:37,045 --> 01:55:39,013
It's in the back of my mind, actually.

1093
01:55:40,181 --> 01:55:42,012
It's a little idea I was toying with.

1094
01:55:42,083 --> 01:55:44,677
Is that how a warped brain like yours
gets its kicks?

1095
01:55:44,752 --> 01:55:46,879
By planning the death of innocent people?

1096
01:55:47,088 --> 01:55:49,989
No. By causing the death
of innocent people.

1097
01:55:50,058 --> 01:55:51,047
Fire!

1098
01:55:53,995 --> 01:55:56,429
Navy Bird, we have a good launch.

1099
01:56:07,775 --> 01:56:10,243
As you may or may not know,
I am, as they say...

1100
01:56:11,112 --> 01:56:12,909
...very heavy into real estate.

1101
01:56:13,548 --> 01:56:17,780
To make money, you have to buy
for a little and sell for a lot, right?

1102
01:56:18,152 --> 01:56:19,119
Right.

1103
01:56:20,655 --> 01:56:22,145
So, the problem?

1104
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:26,552
How to make the land more valuable
between the time you buy it...

1105
01:56:26,627 --> 01:56:28,185
...and the time you sell it?

1106
01:56:29,097 --> 01:56:30,997
Now this is California.

1107
01:56:31,666 --> 01:56:33,930
The richest, most populous state
in the Union.

1108
01:56:34,001 --> 01:56:36,162
I don't need a geography lesson from you.

1109
01:56:37,038 --> 01:56:40,633
Of course, you've been there.
I do forget, you get around, don't you?

1110
01:56:41,442 --> 01:56:42,431
Where was I?

1111
01:56:43,010 --> 01:56:44,705
- California.
- California, right.

1112
01:56:44,779 --> 01:56:47,407
The San Andreas Fault,
maybe you've heard of it?

1113
01:56:47,482 --> 01:56:49,780
Yes. It's the joining together
of two land masses.

1114
01:56:49,851 --> 01:56:53,548
The fault line is shifting, which is why
you get earthquakes in California.

1115
01:56:54,288 --> 01:56:56,654
Wonderful!
Couldn't have said it better myself.

1116
01:56:57,525 --> 01:57:01,757
Everything west of this line is the richest,
most expensive real estate in the world.

1117
01:57:01,896 --> 01:57:04,490
San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco.

1118
01:57:04,565 --> 01:57:06,499
Everything on this side of the line...

1119
01:57:06,601 --> 01:57:09,627
...is just hundreds of miles
of worthless desert land...

1120
01:57:09,704 --> 01:57:11,763
...which just happens to be owned by...

1121
01:57:12,106 --> 01:57:14,199
Lex Luthor Incorporated.

1122
01:57:15,510 --> 01:57:18,968
Now, call me foolish, call me irresponsible.

1123
01:57:19,981 --> 01:57:23,007
It occurs to me that a 500-megaton bomb...

1124
01:57:23,351 --> 01:57:25,819
...planted at just the proper point would...

1125
01:57:26,120 --> 01:57:28,350
Would destroy most of California.

1126
01:57:29,891 --> 01:57:33,588
Millions of people would be killed
and the West Coast as we know it would...

1127
01:57:33,661 --> 01:57:36,960
Fall into the sea. Bye-bye, California.

1128
01:57:38,065 --> 01:57:40,659
Hello, new West Coast. My West Coast.

1129
01:57:43,304 --> 01:57:44,999
Costa Del Lex, Luthorville.

1130
01:57:45,606 --> 01:57:47,096
Marina Del Lex, Otisburg.

1131
01:57:50,144 --> 01:57:51,406
"Otisburg"?

1132
01:57:51,579 --> 01:57:53,911
Miss Teschmacher,
she's got her own place.

1133
01:57:53,981 --> 01:57:54,913
"Otisburg"?

1134
01:57:55,216 --> 01:57:56,649
It's a little bitty place.

1135
01:57:56,817 --> 01:57:57,806
Otisburg?

1136
01:57:59,153 --> 01:58:01,451
I'll just wipe it off, that's all.

1137
01:58:01,589 --> 01:58:03,318
You're a dreamer, Lex Luthor.

1138
01:58:03,391 --> 01:58:06,383
A sick, twisted dreamer.
Your plan couldn't possibly work.

1139
01:58:07,028 --> 01:58:09,087
I'll admit there were a few problems.

1140
01:58:09,564 --> 01:58:12,158
Adjusting the precise trajectory
of the missile.

1141
01:58:12,667 --> 01:58:15,761
Finding the optimum stress point
for the fault line itself...

1142
01:58:16,704 --> 01:58:20,037
...which, by the way, is target zero.
Right...

1143
01:58:20,875 --> 01:58:21,569
...here.

1144
01:58:46,968 --> 01:58:48,060
That's impossible!

1145
01:58:51,372 --> 01:58:53,067
What's happening, Lieutenant?

1146
01:58:53,174 --> 01:58:54,698
Trajectory malfunction, sir.

1147
01:58:57,044 --> 01:58:57,908
Abort.

1148
01:58:58,946 --> 01:59:00,413
All counter control units...

1149
01:59:00,481 --> 01:59:02,540
...remove vacuum pressure to maximum.

1150
01:59:04,952 --> 01:59:06,283
Function negative, sir.

1151
01:59:06,354 --> 01:59:07,719
Can't you knock them down?

1152
01:59:07,788 --> 01:59:12,122
Absolutely impossible, sir. They have
the new P-20 low-level avoidance systems.

1153
01:59:12,193 --> 01:59:13,660
Get me the Pentagon.

1154
01:59:21,002 --> 01:59:23,596
What do you think, super baby?
Interesting?

1155
01:59:24,105 --> 01:59:26,232
Your theory's quite impressive, Luthor.

1156
01:59:26,340 --> 01:59:28,604
Would you go to the viewing room, please?

1157
01:59:29,443 --> 01:59:32,310
But as for the rest,
it's nothing but a sick fantasy.

1158
01:59:32,446 --> 01:59:33,344
Fantasy?

1159
01:59:33,681 --> 01:59:34,613
No.

1160
01:59:35,650 --> 01:59:37,982
It's history. It's happening, Superman.

1161
01:59:38,786 --> 01:59:40,413
Miss Teschmacher!

1162
01:59:45,192 --> 01:59:46,454
Yes, Lex?

1163
01:59:46,827 --> 01:59:48,226
Where's the rocket now?

1164
01:59:48,462 --> 01:59:52,125
It's going like a bat over the Grand Canyon,
so is the other one.

1165
01:59:52,233 --> 01:59:53,291
The other one?

1166
01:59:53,601 --> 01:59:54,966
There are two of them?

1167
01:59:58,039 --> 02:00:00,303
Yes, Superman, double jeopardy.

1168
02:00:01,008 --> 02:00:03,943
Even you, with your great speed,
couldn't stop both of them.

1169
02:00:04,178 --> 02:00:07,238
While I, on the other hand,
could stop them with my detonator.

1170
02:00:07,715 --> 02:00:09,478
All right, Luthor, where is it?

1171
02:00:10,184 --> 02:00:11,583
Where's the detonator?

1172
02:00:25,099 --> 02:00:26,589
Diseased maniac!

1173
02:00:27,001 --> 02:00:29,993
Do you think you could hide it from me
by encasing it in lead?

1174
02:00:32,239 --> 02:00:34,639
I'll mold this box into your prison bars.

1175
02:00:34,709 --> 02:00:35,835
Don't touch that.

1176
02:00:42,650 --> 02:00:43,708
I told you.

1177
02:00:44,452 --> 02:00:45,714
It's Kryptonite.

1178
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:47,888
A little souvenir from your hometown.

1179
02:00:48,389 --> 02:00:50,857
I've spared no expense
to make you feel at home.

1180
02:00:58,366 --> 02:00:59,890
You were great in your day.

1181
02:01:01,035 --> 02:01:02,866
But it just stands to reason...

1182
02:01:03,237 --> 02:01:05,432
...when it came time
to cash in your chips...

1183
02:01:05,906 --> 02:01:10,400
...this old diseased maniac
would be your banker.

1184
02:01:14,915 --> 02:01:15,973
Mind over muscle.

1185
02:01:24,625 --> 02:01:28,755
You don't even care
where the other missile's headed, do you?

1186
02:01:29,230 --> 02:01:30,390
Certainly I do.

1187
02:01:31,899 --> 02:01:33,764
I know exactly where it's headed.

1188
02:01:33,901 --> 02:01:35,334
Hackensack, New Jersey.

1189
02:01:41,175 --> 02:01:45,578
I have to leave you now. No hard feelings.
We all have our little faults.

1190
02:01:46,347 --> 02:01:47,814
Mine's in California.

1191
02:02:02,663 --> 02:02:05,530
Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack.

1192
02:03:12,166 --> 02:03:13,929
Please, you can't...

1193
02:03:14,535 --> 02:03:16,196
...you can't just stand there.

1194
02:03:19,807 --> 02:03:24,267
You can't just stand
and let millions of innocent people die.

1195
02:03:25,179 --> 02:03:26,009
Maybe.

1196
02:03:27,882 --> 02:03:30,316
Please. Please, help me to save them.

1197
02:03:32,553 --> 02:03:35,044
Would you promise
to save my mother first?

1198
02:03:36,190 --> 02:03:38,158
But, Lois, and Jimmy...

1199
02:03:38,225 --> 02:03:39,886
But my mother comes first.

1200
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:43,418
If you promise, I'll believe you
because you always tell the truth.

1201
02:03:45,833 --> 02:03:47,460
I promise, I promise.

1202
02:04:42,890 --> 02:04:44,357
Why did you kiss me first?

1203
02:04:47,328 --> 02:04:49,558
I didn't think you'd let me later.

1204
02:04:50,864 --> 02:04:52,354
Thank you, Miss Teschmacher.

1205
02:04:52,967 --> 02:04:56,027
Why is it I can't get it on
with the good guys?

1206
02:05:02,109 --> 02:05:04,703
Stand aside now.
I wouldn't stay here, either.

1207
02:05:23,664 --> 02:05:25,427
Army Bird still heading due east.

1208
02:05:25,499 --> 02:05:27,262
Navy Bird still heading due west.

1209
02:05:27,334 --> 02:05:28,801
Losing radar contact.

1210
02:05:29,370 --> 02:05:31,167
Next radar contact after three seconds.

1211
02:05:52,593 --> 02:05:54,493
Army Bird still headed east, sir.

1212
02:06:49,416 --> 02:06:51,145
Army Bird gaining altitude.

1213
02:06:51,218 --> 02:06:52,708
Miss Teschmacher!

1214
02:06:52,986 --> 02:06:54,783
Radar contact strong.

1215
02:06:55,789 --> 02:06:57,120
Miss Teschmacher!

1216
02:06:57,458 --> 02:06:59,722
Radar report Navy Bird. San Andreas area.

1217
02:07:03,063 --> 02:07:05,361
Navy Bird heading down,
15 seconds to impact.

1218
02:07:05,899 --> 02:07:07,298
15 seconds and counting.

1219
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:09,625
A military missile has exploded
in the Southern California desert.

1220
02:08:10,063 --> 02:08:12,998
The force of the explosion has activated
the San Andreas fault.

1221
02:08:13,066 --> 02:08:15,330
California is suffering a major earthquake.

1222
02:09:01,348 --> 02:09:02,645
What's going on?

1223
02:09:04,818 --> 02:09:06,046
It's a quake! Look!

1224
02:10:14,821 --> 02:10:16,516
Okay, kids, it's all right now.

1225
02:10:17,324 --> 02:10:18,848
Hey, it's Superman!

1226
02:10:27,434 --> 02:10:29,061
Holy mackerel!

1227
02:10:30,304 --> 02:10:31,771
We're going off the tracks.

1228
02:11:08,008 --> 02:11:09,475
All personnel evacuate dam.

1229
02:11:21,855 --> 02:11:23,015
Watch that cable!

1230
02:11:30,731 --> 02:11:32,426
Someone try and pull the main.

1231
02:11:32,766 --> 02:11:34,631
It's impossible. It's red hot!

1232
02:11:43,276 --> 02:11:44,607
Is that man all right?

1233
02:11:44,745 --> 02:11:45,712
Yeah.

1234
02:12:09,569 --> 02:12:10,536
Hang on, Jim.

1235
02:12:21,481 --> 02:12:22,607
The dam broke.

1236
02:12:30,690 --> 02:12:31,987
You're safe here, son.

1237
02:12:33,693 --> 02:12:36,321
That's okay. Miss Lane
will be driving by any minute.

1238
02:12:45,672 --> 02:12:47,333
- Come on!
- Make it to the hill.

1239
02:12:54,948 --> 02:12:57,883
There has been major quake damage
to Southern California.

1240
02:12:58,151 --> 02:13:00,711
The San Andreas fault has miraculously
sealed itself.

1241
02:13:00,787 --> 02:13:04,780
Yet Southern California is suffering
an aftershock of a major earthquake.

1242
02:13:05,325 --> 02:13:07,623
The population is still warned
to be aware...

1243
02:13:09,696 --> 02:13:11,220
Please, come on, turn over.

1244
02:13:12,365 --> 02:13:13,161
Come on!

1245
02:13:40,794 --> 02:13:43,627
Help me. Help me, please.

1246
02:18:56,276 --> 02:18:58,335
It is forbidden for you to interfere...

1247
02:18:58,978 --> 02:19:02,937
There's one thing I do know, Son,
and that is you are here for a reason.

1248
02:19:04,517 --> 02:19:05,609
It is forbidden.

1249
02:19:05,685 --> 02:19:09,018
All those things I can do,
all those powers...

1250
02:19:09,556 --> 02:19:11,581
...but I couldn't even save him.

1251
02:19:15,528 --> 02:19:16,995
It is forbidden.

1252
02:20:42,415 --> 02:20:43,143
Hi.

1253
02:20:45,184 --> 02:20:46,674
Don't bother, it's dead.

1254
02:20:48,922 --> 02:20:49,946
Sure it's dead.

1255
02:20:51,791 --> 02:20:55,249
The problem with men of steel is
they're never around when you want one.

1256
02:20:55,328 --> 02:20:58,058
Do you know what happened
while you were off flying around?

1257
02:20:58,131 --> 02:21:01,931
I was almost in an earthquake.
A gas station blew up beside my car.

1258
02:21:02,001 --> 02:21:05,903
Telephone poles falling all over the road.
I was almost killed.

1259
02:21:06,005 --> 02:21:09,031
To top the whole thing off,
this stupid car runs out of gas.

1260
02:21:09,342 --> 02:21:10,536
I'm sorry about that, Lois.

1261
02:21:11,210 --> 02:21:13,201
But I've been kind of busy for a while.

1262
02:21:16,082 --> 02:21:18,209
I'm sorry, that's all right.

1263
02:21:30,330 --> 02:21:31,661
Thanks a lot, Superman.

1264
02:21:31,998 --> 02:21:34,432
Put me in the middle of nowhere
during an earthquake.

1265
02:21:34,500 --> 02:21:38,197
No food, no water, snakes everywhere.
I had no idea if you were coming back.

1266
02:21:40,873 --> 02:21:43,535
There's something I have to do.
I'll see you later.

1267
02:21:46,379 --> 02:21:47,937
He can't stay still for a second.

1268
02:21:50,984 --> 02:21:54,545
Golly, Miss Lane, it's too bad
Mr. Kent wasn't here to see all this.

1269
02:21:54,621 --> 02:21:57,351
Yeah, poor Clark.
He's never around when...

1270
02:21:58,825 --> 02:22:00,850
Clark... Wait a minute.

1271
02:22:01,361 --> 02:22:02,020
What?

1272
02:22:03,596 --> 02:22:05,564
Lois Lane, that is the silliest idea.

1273
02:22:06,032 --> 02:22:09,559
I'll tell you something, Miss Lane.
I think he really cares about you.

1274
02:22:09,869 --> 02:22:12,030
- Clark? Of course, he does.
- No, not Clark.

1275
02:22:16,409 --> 02:22:18,377
Superman cares about everybody, Jimmy.

1276
02:22:19,579 --> 02:22:22,946
But who knows. Someday, if he's lucky...

1277
02:22:36,329 --> 02:22:37,796
You're messing up my suit!

1278
02:22:42,201 --> 02:22:44,601
Otis! Watch the ground, you...

1279
02:22:45,605 --> 02:22:47,038
Good evening, Warden.

1280
02:22:47,106 --> 02:22:50,098
These two men should be safe here
'til they can get a fair trial.

1281
02:22:50,276 --> 02:22:51,538
Who is it, Superman?

1282
02:22:53,780 --> 02:22:54,678
Lex Luthor.

1283
02:22:55,448 --> 02:22:58,076
- The greatest criminal mind of our time.
- Of our time.

1284
02:22:58,184 --> 02:23:00,482
- I hereby serve notice...
- He's serving notice to you.

1285
02:23:00,553 --> 02:23:02,145
...that these walls...

1286
02:23:02,488 --> 02:23:04,479
Will you shut up, you fat little fool!

1287
02:23:04,657 --> 02:23:05,885
You, you nitwit!

1288
02:23:06,159 --> 02:23:07,285
Nincompoop!

1289
02:23:07,727 --> 02:23:08,955
This country...

1290
02:23:09,028 --> 02:23:11,622
...is safe again, Superman, thanks to you.

1291
02:23:12,131 --> 02:23:12,893
No, sir.

1292
02:23:12,965 --> 02:23:14,296
Don't thank me, Warden.

1293
02:23:14,667 --> 02:23:16,464
We're all part of the same team.

1294
02:23:16,969 --> 02:23:17,958
Good night.

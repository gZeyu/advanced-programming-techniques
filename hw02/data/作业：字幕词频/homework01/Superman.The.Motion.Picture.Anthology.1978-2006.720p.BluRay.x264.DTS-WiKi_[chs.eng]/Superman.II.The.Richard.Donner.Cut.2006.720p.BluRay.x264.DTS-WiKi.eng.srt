1
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:32,607
I ask you now to pronounce judgment...

2
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:34,299
...on those accused.

3
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:38,076
On this...

4
00:01:38,247 --> 00:01:42,411
This mindless aberration,
whose only means of expression...

5
00:01:42,584 --> 00:01:44,950
...are wanton violence and destruction.

6
00:01:46,221 --> 00:01:47,483
On the woman, Ursa...

7
00:01:47,956 --> 00:01:51,187
...whose perversions
and unreasoning hatred of all mankind...

8
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:55,255
...have threatened even the children
of the planet Krypton.

9
00:01:56,465 --> 00:01:59,195
Finally, General Zod.

10
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:01,598
Chief architect
of this intended revolution...

11
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,833
...and author of this insidious plot
to establish a new order amongst us...

12
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:10,736
...with himself as absolute ruler.

13
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,148
The decision of the council
will now be heard.

14
00:02:14,316 --> 00:02:15,613
Guilty.

15
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:17,812
- Guilty.
- Guilty.

16
00:02:19,788 --> 00:02:21,380
Guilty.

17
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,626
The vote must be unanimous, Jor-EI.

18
00:02:26,628 --> 00:02:29,062
It has therefore
now become your decision.

19
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:31,563
You alone will condemn us if you wish...

20
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,669
...and you alone
will be held responsible by me.

21
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:47,715
You will bow down before me, Jor-EI.

22
00:02:47,883 --> 00:02:49,077
I swear it.

23
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:54,245
No matter that it takes an eternity,
you will bow down before me!

24
00:02:54,423 --> 00:02:55,515
Both you...

25
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:56,883
...and then one day...

26
00:02:57,059 --> 00:02:58,959
...your heirs!

27
00:03:28,357 --> 00:03:31,918
You will bow down before me!

28
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:36,262
- Forgive me!
- I'll be back!

29
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:37,557
Forgive me!

30
00:04:10,632 --> 00:04:15,126
Your mother Lara has sent you
three blankets, of red, yellow and blue.

31
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:18,972
Their protection
will ensure your strength.

32
00:05:28,577 --> 00:05:32,513
It's kryptonite, Superman.
A little souvenir from the old hometown.

33
00:05:37,686 --> 00:05:42,248
You were great in your day, Superman.
But it just stands to reason...

34
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:44,858
...when it came time
to cash in your chips...

35
00:05:45,027 --> 00:05:48,463
...this old, diseased maniac...

36
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,564
...would be your banker.

37
00:05:54,002 --> 00:05:55,936
Mind over muscle.

38
00:06:29,705 --> 00:06:31,900
Why did you kiss me first?

39
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:36,201
Lt... I didn't think you'd let me later.

40
00:06:36,378 --> 00:06:38,175
Stand aside, now.

41
00:08:15,343 --> 00:08:17,368
Free!

42
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,906
Nice fresh melons.
Nice fresh melons. Get them fresh here.

43
00:12:06,074 --> 00:12:08,941
Good for the cooking, huh?
Look at this, the best.

44
00:12:10,712 --> 00:12:13,237
"Lex Luthor's scheme bombs.
Superman saves nation.

45
00:12:13,415 --> 00:12:16,851
Master criminal draws harsh sentence.
Exclusive story by Lois Lane.

46
00:12:17,018 --> 00:12:19,145
Photographs by James Olsen."

47
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,518
Luthor, you never looked lovelier.

48
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:23,851
Lois, terrific job.

49
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:25,993
- Thanks, chief.
- Great story, really great.

50
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:28,356
Hey, good morning, chief. You're late.

51
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,431
Yeah, Miss Lane, that's a great story.
One of the best.

52
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:35,933
Well, Jimmy, usually a picture isn't worth
a thousand words when I write the story...

53
00:12:36,104 --> 00:12:37,935
...but in this case, congratulations.

54
00:12:38,106 --> 00:12:39,471
- Yeah, thanks a lot.
- Yeah.

55
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:43,978
There's Mr. Kent. Bet he wishes
he'd been around when it all happened.

56
00:12:44,145 --> 00:12:46,670
Clark, he's never around
when Superman appears.

57
00:12:46,848 --> 00:12:48,338
Poor guy.

58
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:59,152
- You got a page in the front?
- Yeah.

59
00:13:02,263 --> 00:13:04,595
Miss Lane got the best story.

60
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:13,907
Good morning, Lois.

61
00:13:15,276 --> 00:13:16,573
Hi.

62
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:56,346
Lane, Kent, get in here!

63
00:13:56,518 --> 00:13:58,349
Now, see, Jimmy,
you got me in trouble.

64
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,683
- We were talking.
- So long. A big mistake.

65
00:14:02,524 --> 00:14:04,856
Next time, don't do that to me.

66
00:14:05,193 --> 00:14:08,822
- Good morning, Lois. How are you today?
- Oh, I'm just super. Thanks.

67
00:14:08,997 --> 00:14:10,658
- Good morning, Mr. White.
- I'm super.

68
00:14:10,832 --> 00:14:14,199
- Yeah, morning. You're late, Kent.
- I know. I'm sorry, Mr. White.

69
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:16,633
- I got stuck in traffic.
- Oh, that's a new one.

70
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:18,568
- Excuse me?
- I mean, as opposed to:

71
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,198
"I was stuck in a phone booth" or
"I got locked into the men's bathroom."

72
00:14:22,377 --> 00:14:25,005
Lois, what are you talking about?
I'm sorry I was late.

73
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,944
If you two wanna bicker,
I have just the assignment for you.

74
00:14:28,116 --> 00:14:32,109
You're gonna pose as a honeymoon couple
to get an expose on the newlywed racket.

75
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:35,984
Some of those hotels are bilking
those poor kids for every cent they can get.

76
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:39,388
Real human-interest stuff.
Make your Aunt Hattie cry her eyes out.

77
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:42,687
- Newlyweds?
- That is a great idea, Mr. White.

78
00:14:42,864 --> 00:14:46,493
- I'm sorry, but I'm in the middle of a series...
- I mean, it wouldn't take long.

79
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:51,162
We could just fly right up there
and zoom back down again.

80
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:53,603
No, Superman?

81
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:56,972
Yeah. If he'd give you two a ride,
maybe we could save a couple bucks.

82
00:14:57,245 --> 00:14:59,611
I gotta see young Olsen.
Six lousy photographs...

83
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:04,218
...and that kid's hitting me up for a raise.
- Excuse me. Mr. White? Could we talk?

84
00:15:04,385 --> 00:15:05,909
Darn.

85
00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:09,756
You look like the cat who swallowed
the canary this morning.

86
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:13,758
A canary? No, actually I was
thinking of something bigger...

87
00:15:13,928 --> 00:15:16,897
...something that flies,
something more in blue.

88
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:19,333
Lois, as usual, I'm totally in the dark...

89
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,732
Let me just turn on the lights
for you then.

90
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,402
Get the picture?

91
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:31,904
I didn't put this together until
this morning. Which is really strange...

92
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,379
...because a good reporter isn't supposed to
let anything slip by her.

93
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,984
Well, that's very amusing. Yes.

94
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:39,619
- Excuse me.
- Amusing?

95
00:15:39,787 --> 00:15:44,190
- Yes, sirree, that's... That's very amusing.
- Amusing, huh?

96
00:15:44,425 --> 00:15:48,521
Tall, broad shoulders...

97
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,955
...dark hair.

98
00:15:51,132 --> 00:15:54,067
Gotta give you credit,
you really had me fooled.

99
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:56,829
And I'm nobody's fool...

100
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:59,368
...Superman.

101
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:01,172
Superman?

102
00:16:01,342 --> 00:16:05,506
You mean you think I'm Superman?

103
00:16:06,147 --> 00:16:09,275
- Willing to bet my life on it.
- Lois, you know, you are priceless.

104
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,442
Really. That is the single most
ridiculous thing I've ever...

105
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:16,722
- Lois, what are you doing?
- You wouldn't let me die, Superman.

106
00:16:56,698 --> 00:17:00,361
- Oh, God.
- Help her out. Help her out.

107
00:17:00,768 --> 00:17:03,566
- Clark!
- Lois, what have you done?

108
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:06,600
Clark, the... You're not...

109
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,543
Hey, Clark, you seen Lois?

110
00:17:15,483 --> 00:17:17,280
She just stepped out for a minute.

111
00:17:34,702 --> 00:17:37,694
This is how it ends for
the greatest criminal mind of our time.

112
00:17:37,872 --> 00:17:40,136
Not with a whimper, not with a bang.

113
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:42,833
How do they choose
to reward Lex Luthor...

114
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:44,945
...the greatest genius in this world?

115
00:17:45,113 --> 00:17:49,015
Do they give him glory or treasure?
What, matter of fact, do they give him?

116
00:17:49,183 --> 00:17:53,279
Life plus 25, Luthor. Get to work.

117
00:17:57,592 --> 00:18:00,220
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor.
It almost worked.

118
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:03,228
I mean, California almost
fell down, right in the ocean.

119
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:05,195
Millions of people was almost killed.

120
00:18:05,366 --> 00:18:08,563
If it hadn't been for that guy
Superman, that overgrown Boy Scout.

121
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:11,967
- I want my Liberace record back tonight.
- Tonight?

122
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:17,203
What are you gonna do with a guy like that?
He flies around so fast and everything.

123
00:18:18,212 --> 00:18:21,409
I mean, they can't even trace
that guy on that radar they got.

124
00:18:21,616 --> 00:18:24,551
Every time they try, he just flies off.

125
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:26,084
- Where?
- North.

126
00:18:26,287 --> 00:18:28,084
Why?

127
00:18:28,256 --> 00:18:29,553
To ski?

128
00:18:29,724 --> 00:18:33,125
Otis, every man has his vulnerable point.

129
00:18:33,294 --> 00:18:36,525
Some, like you, Otis,
have more than one.

130
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,632
I didn't see Superman's in time.

131
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,429
But now, through patience,
invention, and skill...

132
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:46,565
...my little black box
is just about ready.

133
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:49,972
Oh, that little black box in our cell?

134
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,040
That little black box, Mr. Luthor...

135
00:18:57,585 --> 00:18:59,485
...what's it for?

136
00:18:59,654 --> 00:19:05,456
That little black box goes beyond
any normal, conventional radar.

137
00:19:05,626 --> 00:19:08,288
It tracks alpha waves.

138
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:13,460
Alpha waves. Yeah.

139
00:19:13,634 --> 00:19:16,364
I could've said it tracked pasta e fagioli,
couldn't I?

140
00:19:16,537 --> 00:19:20,166
Oh, with garlic, Mr. Luthor. And butter.

141
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:21,740
Boy.

142
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:30,475
Those alpha waves will
take me north to his secret.

143
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:35,384
And when I have his secret,
I'll have Superman.

144
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:41,023
Slasher Fogelstein's a bed wetter.

145
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:49,602
Slasher Fogelstein's a bed wetter.
Pass it.

146
00:19:55,076 --> 00:19:57,010
Hi, Mr. Fogelstein.

147
00:19:57,478 --> 00:20:00,003
- Too fast. Can you get the speed right?

148
00:20:00,181 --> 00:20:03,116
I told you, they installed those
three weeks ago.

149
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:05,040
Hey.

150
00:20:05,953 --> 00:20:10,151
You follow the bouncing ball for a while.
Thing's giving me a headache.

151
00:20:10,324 --> 00:20:13,418
Anyway, somebody's
gotta check up on those guys.

152
00:20:13,594 --> 00:20:16,427
Yeah, I keep on forgetting about them.

153
00:20:16,597 --> 00:20:19,361
How long they been up there, 45 days?

154
00:20:19,534 --> 00:20:22,469
The whole world's forgotten about it.

155
00:20:24,705 --> 00:20:26,866
Houston calling Artemis II.

156
00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:30,508
Houston calling Artemis II. Come in.

157
00:20:30,678 --> 00:20:33,238
Morning, Houston. Hold on, Nate.

158
00:20:33,414 --> 00:20:35,348
- Yo.
- How are things going?

159
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:38,585
All systems normal, Houston.

160
00:20:38,753 --> 00:20:41,654
Andy is out doing the geological survey.

161
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:44,121
More rocks. Nice.

162
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:47,386
And cosmonaut Boris
is getting some soil samples.

163
00:20:47,562 --> 00:20:50,122
By the way, Boris and I are engaged.

164
00:20:50,631 --> 00:20:53,759
I had a feeling about you guys
when I saw your Rorschach tests.

165
00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:56,233
Just a little detente
humor there, Houston.

166
00:20:56,404 --> 00:20:58,395
Surface conditions unchanged?

167
00:20:58,573 --> 00:21:01,599
Well, it's mighty
pretty out there. Mighty...

168
00:21:03,744 --> 00:21:05,803
...pretty.
- Mighty pretty.

169
00:21:06,013 --> 00:21:08,140
Right.

170
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:10,381
Look, Nate?

171
00:21:10,551 --> 00:21:12,143
Nate, wake up, will you?

172
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,880
That's it. I'm dreaming.

173
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:17,320
Artemis, come in.

174
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:21,586
Well, Houston, we seem to have
an unidentified flying object.

175
00:21:21,762 --> 00:21:23,161
Unidentified?

176
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:26,459
- What does it look like?
- Well...

177
00:21:26,634 --> 00:21:29,330
...a lot like a girl.

178
00:21:50,658 --> 00:21:52,455
You.

179
00:21:53,194 --> 00:21:56,686
- What kind of a creature are you?
- Just a man.

180
00:21:57,465 --> 00:21:59,558
A man?

181
00:22:56,324 --> 00:22:59,054
What a fragile sort of life form this is.

182
00:23:24,418 --> 00:23:27,080
Houston, come in. Come in, Houston.

183
00:23:35,596 --> 00:23:36,995
Come in, Houston. Come in.

184
00:23:37,164 --> 00:23:38,791
Attempting manual liftoff.

185
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,228
Can somebody hear me?

186
00:23:40,701 --> 00:23:42,532
Houston!

187
00:23:43,537 --> 00:23:44,663
Come on.

188
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:49,338
Come on, Houston!

189
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:52,645
Oh, no. No!

190
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,045
Somebody help me!

191
00:24:01,622 --> 00:24:04,614
- Artemis, Houston calling. Come in.
- What's going on?

192
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:08,228
- I don't know. We've lost contact.
- So?

193
00:24:08,396 --> 00:24:10,091
Well, we really...

194
00:24:10,698 --> 00:24:12,529
Artemis, come in, please.

195
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:18,566
All right, which one of you guys
is using the hair dryer?

196
00:24:20,908 --> 00:24:25,743
Strange. I tore those
metal fibers like paper.

197
00:24:25,913 --> 00:24:29,849
And what he did was amazing.

198
00:24:30,017 --> 00:24:34,454
- Something is happening.
- Yes, to all of us.

199
00:24:36,657 --> 00:24:40,855
The closer we come to an
atmosphere with only one sun...

200
00:24:41,028 --> 00:24:42,859
...a yellow sun...

201
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:46,989
...the more our molecular
density gives us unlimited powers.

202
00:24:47,168 --> 00:24:48,965
They come from there.

203
00:24:49,136 --> 00:24:51,127
A place called Houston.

204
00:24:51,305 --> 00:24:53,705
Then we will go there too...

205
00:24:53,874 --> 00:24:55,808
...to rule.

206
00:24:56,277 --> 00:24:58,939
Finally, to rule.

207
00:25:09,423 --> 00:25:11,152
Three-eighty-two, out.

208
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:14,425
Three-eighty-three, out.

209
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:17,460
Three-eighty-four, out.

210
00:25:18,432 --> 00:25:20,730
Three-eighty-five, out.

211
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,437
Lights out, Luthor.

212
00:25:27,007 --> 00:25:29,237
I said, lights out.

213
00:25:31,812 --> 00:25:35,509
You guys are about 10 seconds
away from solitary, you know that?

214
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:39,643
I told you to...

215
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,297
Freeze, freeze.

216
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,071
Mr. Luthor.

217
00:26:33,407 --> 00:26:35,898
- How we gonna get over that wall?
- How'd we get in?

218
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:39,270
- We flew in here, remember?
- That's how we'll get out.

219
00:26:39,446 --> 00:26:41,778
Oh, no, not that guy.

220
00:26:45,586 --> 00:26:47,315
Did you just go "psst"?

221
00:26:47,488 --> 00:26:50,651
I wish I had, Mr. Luthor, before we left.

222
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:54,557
Not that "psst," that "psst."

223
00:26:57,932 --> 00:27:00,730
- Don't go "psst" when I go "psst."
- You do it.

224
00:27:04,238 --> 00:27:06,399
Go out there and find it.

225
00:27:07,107 --> 00:27:11,567
- What am I looking for?
- You'll know when you see it.

226
00:27:22,756 --> 00:27:25,452
I think I found it.

227
00:27:30,631 --> 00:27:32,496
What is it?

228
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,367
It's a ladder, you dummy.

229
00:27:37,137 --> 00:27:38,570
Hi, Miss Teschmacher.

230
00:27:47,548 --> 00:27:48,708
Come on.

231
00:27:49,516 --> 00:27:53,145
Hurry up. Hurry up.

232
00:27:53,721 --> 00:27:55,951
Come on, hurry.

233
00:27:56,957 --> 00:27:59,323
Otis, hold that ladder. Hurry up.

234
00:27:59,493 --> 00:28:03,327
- Yard line, touchdown!
Oh, what a beautiful play.

235
00:28:03,497 --> 00:28:06,227
But there's a marker downfield.
It could be against...

236
00:28:11,805 --> 00:28:12,863
- Come up.
- Come on.

237
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,634
Here I come, Mr. Luthor.

238
00:28:17,411 --> 00:28:18,571
- Get off. Get off.
- Otis!

239
00:28:20,381 --> 00:28:23,077
- We're sinking!
- Get off, get off!

240
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,261
Very good,
Miss Teschmacher. Very good.

241
00:28:42,436 --> 00:28:45,132
- What am I doing here? Why am I here?
- Miss Teschmacher...

242
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,206
...is this a philosophy seminar?

243
00:28:47,374 --> 00:28:49,103
- No. This is a getaway.
- No.

244
00:28:49,276 --> 00:28:50,504
- Getaway.
- Right.

245
00:28:50,678 --> 00:28:53,670
It's ingenious. I don't know
where you got the inspiration from.

246
00:28:53,847 --> 00:28:55,576
I got it from you, Lex.

247
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:58,451
Hot air rises.

248
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,050
Would you like to take a trip?

249
00:29:02,222 --> 00:29:04,486
A trip? A vacation.

250
00:29:04,658 --> 00:29:07,525
Lex, I can go shopping.
I can buy a bikini.

251
00:29:07,695 --> 00:29:10,095
You thought about me in a bikini
while in prison?

252
00:29:10,431 --> 00:29:12,763
No, I didn't, actually.

253
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:16,198
I thought about you in a parka.

254
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,497
You thought about me in a parka?

255
00:29:18,672 --> 00:29:20,902
You are sick, Lex. You are really sick.

256
00:29:21,642 --> 00:29:23,132
That's possible.

257
00:29:26,947 --> 00:29:28,744
North, Miss Teschmacher.

258
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:30,110
Due north.

259
00:29:31,452 --> 00:29:32,976
Lex, north.

260
00:29:34,455 --> 00:29:36,650
That's what I said, due north.

261
00:29:37,157 --> 00:29:39,489
- That's what you said.
- I know I said I said that.

262
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,423
- I just heard it.
- Yes, Lex.

263
00:29:41,595 --> 00:29:43,961
Don't repeat what I say
when I say something.

264
00:29:44,131 --> 00:29:46,292
- I won't repeat what you say.
- Okay, don't.

265
00:29:46,467 --> 00:29:48,731
Well, stop repeating me.

266
00:30:16,196 --> 00:30:18,027
Excuse me.

267
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,765
Would you like to carry Mrs. Smith
over the threshold?

268
00:30:24,938 --> 00:30:26,701
It's sort of traditional.

269
00:30:26,874 --> 00:30:29,707
I can give you a hand
if you have trouble lifting.

270
00:30:29,877 --> 00:30:33,404
- No, of course not.
- Honey. Thanks, I'll walk.

271
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,979
Certainly, dear.

272
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:47,224
Mush! Mush!

273
00:30:47,394 --> 00:30:49,419
I am mushing.

274
00:30:52,733 --> 00:30:54,701
North, Miss Teschmacher.

275
00:30:54,868 --> 00:30:58,964
- North, north!
- Yes, Lex. North.

276
00:31:26,366 --> 00:31:29,631
Oh, you must be wrong, Lex.
This couldn't be his home way up here.

277
00:31:29,803 --> 00:31:31,498
"Wrong, Lex."

278
00:31:31,672 --> 00:31:35,233
Miss Teschmacher, those are two words
we do not use in the same sentence.

279
00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:38,310
Well, it's funny there's no front door.

280
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:43,280
Miss Teschmacher, "funny" is a person
trying to smile without any teeth.

281
00:31:45,786 --> 00:31:46,775
Right.

282
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,421
All right, come on, Lex. Come on.

283
00:31:55,596 --> 00:31:57,461
Move out of the way.

284
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,329
- This way.
- It's this way.

285
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,231
Lex, it's this way.

286
00:32:03,403 --> 00:32:05,303
It's this way, Lex.

287
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:08,834
- Come on. Come on.
- Get off!

288
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,071
Come on.

289
00:32:25,993 --> 00:32:27,984
- Fantastic.
- Fantastic.

290
00:32:28,762 --> 00:32:31,162
It's fantastic!

291
00:32:35,002 --> 00:32:38,768
The construction goes far beyond
any known architectural theory.

292
00:32:42,009 --> 00:32:44,307
- It's beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

293
00:32:44,845 --> 00:32:46,210
- Lex.
- I'll be all right.

294
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,075
No, me.

295
00:32:51,852 --> 00:32:53,786
Why can't you be more careful?

296
00:32:56,189 --> 00:32:57,850
- It's beautiful.
- Beautiful.

297
00:32:58,025 --> 00:33:00,459
- It has everything.
- Wrong.

298
00:33:01,895 --> 00:33:06,025
- Why didn't you go before we left?
- That was two days ago.

299
00:33:09,603 --> 00:33:11,195
Be careful, Lex.

300
00:33:14,074 --> 00:33:15,371
Get...!

301
00:33:16,376 --> 00:33:20,210
Frankly, I think this place
is a little boring. It's all white.

302
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,678
Why doesn't the guy
put up some pictures?

303
00:33:22,849 --> 00:33:25,374
Maybe some bullfighting posters.

304
00:33:29,389 --> 00:33:31,823
- Don't touch anything.
- Don't touch anything.

305
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,420
- Ice.
- I said, don't touch it.

306
00:33:37,164 --> 00:33:39,530
- It's not ice.
- It looks like a crystal.

307
00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:07,724
The virtuous spirit has no need
for thankful approval...

308
00:34:07,928 --> 00:34:10,089
- What the...?
...owning a certain conviction...

309
00:34:10,263 --> 00:34:13,096
...that what has been done is right.

310
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,427
That's the old man.
He looks just like the kid.

311
00:34:15,602 --> 00:34:18,469
- Are you the old man?
- Ask him where the bathroom is.

312
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,073
Develop such conviction in yourself.

313
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:22,569
Are you here?

314
00:34:22,776 --> 00:34:26,769
- The human heart on your planet...
- He's not here.

315
00:34:26,947 --> 00:34:31,281
It's a voice from the past.
That's cute. That's really cute. Nice.

316
00:34:31,451 --> 00:34:33,442
Lies, monstrous deceptions.

317
00:34:36,823 --> 00:34:39,291
So much for moral rearmament.

318
00:34:39,459 --> 00:34:41,324
Give me another crystal.

319
00:34:51,204 --> 00:34:54,731
Education crystal 108. Earth culture.

320
00:34:55,509 --> 00:34:59,536
<i>A typical ode much loved by the people
you will live among, Kal-EI.</i>

321
00:34:59,713 --> 00:35:02,307
<i>Trees by Joyce Kilmer.</i>

322
00:35:02,883 --> 00:35:04,714
I think that I shall never see

323
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:07,786
A poem as lovely as a tree.

324
00:35:09,723 --> 00:35:11,213
Come on, I like trees.

325
00:35:11,391 --> 00:35:13,825
So does your average cocker spaniel.
Give me another.

326
00:35:13,994 --> 00:35:15,689
Cute.

327
00:35:22,169 --> 00:35:23,295
My son...

328
00:35:23,637 --> 00:35:25,468
- The man never ages.
- Never ages.

329
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:30,770
<i>...the time has come to tell you of
the darkest episode in Krypton history.</i>

330
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,674
- Now, this I wanna hear.
- Unfortunately...

331
00:35:33,847 --> 00:35:37,146
...even on our peaceful planet...

332
00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:39,681
...there have appeared
once in a great while...

333
00:35:39,853 --> 00:35:43,118
...certain antisocial elements.

334
00:35:43,457 --> 00:35:44,856
Deviants...

335
00:35:45,025 --> 00:35:46,959
...what you call on Earth "criminals."

336
00:35:47,227 --> 00:35:48,455
Criminals.

337
00:35:48,628 --> 00:35:51,119
Deviants. He was right in the first place.

338
00:35:51,298 --> 00:35:54,267
Though of course, we are not
a penalty planet like Earth...

339
00:35:54,434 --> 00:35:57,995
...and these unhappy souls were almost
always successfully transformed...

340
00:35:58,171 --> 00:36:01,072
...into productive citizens.
- You never heard of Lex Luthor?

341
00:36:01,241 --> 00:36:04,574
There were, however, three exceptions...
Only three.

342
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:07,441
- Who proved impossible to rehabilitate.

343
00:36:08,181 --> 00:36:09,273
There's hope.

344
00:36:09,449 --> 00:36:11,610
Non, the destroyer.

345
00:36:11,785 --> 00:36:16,085
Unreasoning violence
in the shape of a being.

346
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:20,824
Ursa. Vicious, cruel, obsessed
by a single-minded hatred...

347
00:36:20,994 --> 00:36:23,019
...which could never be determined.

348
00:36:23,196 --> 00:36:25,164
And the one force
that could unite them...

349
00:36:25,332 --> 00:36:29,894
...the only one whose warped genius
could harness these forces of evil:

350
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,332
<i>General Zod.</i>

351
00:36:31,505 --> 00:36:34,372
- He looks kind of cute.
- His intended insurrection...

352
00:36:34,608 --> 00:36:38,874
...was the most painful episode
our people ever had to endure.

353
00:36:39,312 --> 00:36:41,371
But after a long and terrible battle...

354
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:44,644
...peace and harmony
were once again restored.

355
00:36:44,818 --> 00:36:46,342
Kind of an anticlimax.

356
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,887
We had, of course, no death penalty.

357
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,848
Sensible enough.

358
00:36:52,392 --> 00:36:55,418
<i>And so they were placed
in the Phantom Zone...</i>

359
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,428
...to be imprisoned for all eternity.

360
00:37:03,136 --> 00:37:06,367
I do not know what could be done
if they were to escape.

361
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,301
<i>On Krypton, these
villains were uncontrollable.</i>

362
00:37:09,476 --> 00:37:14,209
On Earth, each of them
would have the identical powers...

363
00:37:15,115 --> 00:37:16,878
...that you have.

364
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:21,746
Think of it. Three super villains.

365
00:37:21,922 --> 00:37:24,823
All three with the same power he has.

366
00:37:24,991 --> 00:37:29,155
All three totally dedicated
to corruption, violence, evil.

367
00:37:31,064 --> 00:37:33,965
They need a contact on Earth.

368
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:36,965
Someone who felt the same as they did,
someone who...

369
00:37:37,137 --> 00:37:41,574
...had the same wonderful contempt for
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

370
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:44,536
Too true to be good.

371
00:37:45,745 --> 00:37:47,144
Right?

372
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,418
- Miss Teschmacher?
- I found it.

373
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,687
I think.

374
00:37:59,025 --> 00:38:02,324
- Where's Jimmy Olsen when I need him?
- Golly, isn't it beautiful?

375
00:38:02,495 --> 00:38:05,362
Yeah, it's gorgeous. Gorgeous.

376
00:38:05,565 --> 00:38:06,827
- Lois?
- Yeah?

377
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,835
Look. Everybody's holding hands.
Maybe we should hold hands too, huh?

378
00:38:12,005 --> 00:38:15,099
- Here's my hand, Clark. Hold it.
- Thanks.

379
00:38:15,942 --> 00:38:18,502
You know what? They're afraid to let go.

380
00:38:18,678 --> 00:38:21,613
- Why?
- They let go, straight to the lawyer.

381
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:24,648
Oh, I don't know about that.
They look kind of happy to me.

382
00:38:24,818 --> 00:38:27,184
That's because you're blind, Clark.

383
00:38:27,621 --> 00:38:29,213
- Oh, yeah.
- Here.

384
00:38:29,389 --> 00:38:31,220
- No, I've got it. No, l...
- Yeah. Clark.

385
00:38:31,391 --> 00:38:34,485
You've gotta look after yourself.
You've only got one pair of eyes.

386
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:36,322
- God.
- Lois?

387
00:38:36,496 --> 00:38:37,656
- Now, here.
- Right.

388
00:38:37,831 --> 00:38:40,698
- Don't say I never did anything for you.
- Thank you.

389
00:38:44,404 --> 00:38:45,803
Son! Excuse me, please.

390
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:47,470
- Be careful.
- What are you doing?

391
00:38:47,641 --> 00:38:49,666
Get down! Get down!

392
00:38:52,345 --> 00:38:55,837
You embarrass me
here in front of everybody.

393
00:38:58,251 --> 00:39:01,709
Lois, did you see what almost
happened there? That little boy...

394
00:39:02,555 --> 00:39:05,581
Hey, I'm hungry. You hungry?

395
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:08,091
- Lois, you're amazing.
- Why, because I'm hungry?

396
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:12,095
No. Here you are standing in front of one
of nature's most awesome spectacles...

397
00:39:12,265 --> 00:39:15,234
...and you're thinking about
food. Aren't you impressed?

398
00:39:15,402 --> 00:39:18,838
Clark, once a girl's seen
Superman in action...

399
00:39:19,005 --> 00:39:21,496
...Niagara Falls kind of
leaves you cold, you know?

400
00:39:21,675 --> 00:39:23,438
Him again, huh?

401
00:39:24,511 --> 00:39:25,944
Oh, I'm sorry.

402
00:39:26,146 --> 00:39:28,410
I have a one-track mind, don't I?

403
00:39:28,581 --> 00:39:31,778
Well, my one-track mind is
telling me that I'm hungry.

404
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,044
- Hot dog?
- Hot dog.

405
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:34,618
Hot dog.

406
00:39:34,788 --> 00:39:36,346
Could I have some orange juice?

407
00:39:36,523 --> 00:39:38,582
- Freshly squeezed.
- Freshly squeezed, I know.

408
00:39:45,899 --> 00:39:47,890
Hey, Mom. Look!

409
00:39:48,068 --> 00:39:50,059
Yeah, honey. That's nice.

410
00:39:52,906 --> 00:39:56,137
Okay, it's two mustard and relish, and...

411
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,570
Oh, my God!

412
00:40:02,682 --> 00:40:04,240
Help!

413
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:06,180
Help!

414
00:40:07,387 --> 00:40:09,617
Somebody help!

415
00:40:11,024 --> 00:40:12,889
Do something!

416
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,419
Good.

417
00:40:19,766 --> 00:40:21,063
Hey, Superman!

418
00:40:22,836 --> 00:40:24,599
Way to go, Superman!

419
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,066
We got a great shot.

420
00:40:29,242 --> 00:40:32,234
What a nice man.
Of course he's Jewish.

421
00:40:35,882 --> 00:40:37,372
Incredible.

422
00:40:44,924 --> 00:40:47,222
- There you go.
- Again, again!

423
00:40:47,394 --> 00:40:50,625
No, I'm sorry.
Only one ride to a customer.

424
00:40:50,797 --> 00:40:54,756
- Superman. Superman, it's me, it's Lois!
- Bye.

425
00:40:54,934 --> 00:40:57,129
Come here. You're gonna get it!

426
00:40:57,303 --> 00:41:00,739
- Give me a heart attack here.
- It's me. It's Lois.

427
00:41:00,907 --> 00:41:03,068
It's Lois Lane.

428
00:41:03,643 --> 00:41:06,203
Well, hello and goodbye.

429
00:41:31,671 --> 00:41:34,970
So this is planet Houston.

430
00:41:37,177 --> 00:41:39,338
A very strange surface.

431
00:42:07,707 --> 00:42:09,436
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, that's all right.

432
00:42:09,609 --> 00:42:12,601
- I just didn't hear you knock, that's all.
- Lois...

433
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:16,271
...the door wasn't even locked.
Just anybody can walk in here.

434
00:42:16,449 --> 00:42:19,077
- There you go putting yourself down again.
- Very funny.

435
00:42:19,252 --> 00:42:21,345
No, really, I'm serious.

436
00:42:22,455 --> 00:42:24,150
Well, anyway...

437
00:42:24,324 --> 00:42:27,555
...here, a little something for
the newlyweds' dinner tonight.

438
00:42:27,727 --> 00:42:30,389
Pansies. Clark, how...
How different.

439
00:42:30,563 --> 00:42:32,963
Would you believe
they grow wild all around here?

440
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,431
You should see what they
charge for roses at the gift shop.

441
00:42:35,602 --> 00:42:37,365
I'll bet, huh?

442
00:42:38,972 --> 00:42:40,496
- You know something, Lois?
- What?

443
00:42:40,673 --> 00:42:45,167
Well, you know, in spite of
the unreality of all this...

444
00:42:45,345 --> 00:42:48,610
Well, you know, posing as newlyweds
for the sake of a newspaper story.

445
00:42:48,781 --> 00:42:50,840
Well, in spite of myself even...

446
00:42:51,017 --> 00:42:53,747
...l'm kind of starting to
feel like one in a way.

447
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,515
- A newlywed, you?
- I don't see why that should be so strange.

448
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:59,317
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

449
00:42:59,492 --> 00:43:02,620
I mean, I'm sure there's
thousands of girls who'd...

450
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,926
Well, a few girls anyway.

451
00:43:05,098 --> 00:43:07,089
- Go ahead and say it.
- Say what?

452
00:43:07,267 --> 00:43:12,728
That somehow you're not satisfied
being here with me.

453
00:43:13,773 --> 00:43:18,608
That in some way I don't seem to
shape up very well in your eyes.

454
00:43:18,778 --> 00:43:21,611
I don't have anything to apologize for.
I'm a good reporter.

455
00:43:21,781 --> 00:43:25,842
No, I'm a very good reporter.
And an even better friend to you.

456
00:43:26,853 --> 00:43:28,320
- Stand up.
- Stand up?

457
00:43:28,621 --> 00:43:30,088
Yeah, stand up, just for fun.

458
00:43:32,592 --> 00:43:36,221
Now, come here. Look at yourself.
Just look at yourself.

459
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:41,394
What we have here is
a potentially aggressive, dynamite guy...

460
00:43:41,568 --> 00:43:43,195
...who can do anything he wants.

461
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:46,031
I mean, it's not my fault
you keep putting yourself down.

462
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,231
- Oh, yeah? How?
- Well, for starters...

463
00:43:48,408 --> 00:43:50,876
...you slouch all the time.
Here, stand up straight.

464
00:43:51,044 --> 00:43:52,636
There, that's better.

465
00:43:52,812 --> 00:43:56,270
And get yourself a jacket with a vent
and shoes that don't lace up...

466
00:43:56,449 --> 00:44:00,249
...and a shirt with a little color
or a pattern or something.

467
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,014
And a bow tie that doesn't look
like a letter opener.

468
00:44:03,189 --> 00:44:05,453
All right, Lois. All right.

469
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:09,061
- We've been through this, haven't we?
- Yes.

470
00:44:09,862 --> 00:44:12,797
I know where this is all leading to.

471
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,998
And I'm sorry. I mean, I'm sorry...

472
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:20,037
...but no matter how hard I try, I just...

473
00:44:20,206 --> 00:44:22,766
Just... Just never will be him.

474
00:44:22,942 --> 00:44:24,307
Him who?

475
00:44:24,477 --> 00:44:28,004
"Him who"? Him Superman.

476
00:44:28,181 --> 00:44:31,378
Now, I can't help the fact that
you seem to think that you love him.

477
00:44:31,551 --> 00:44:35,214
That's something I'll have to live with.
But darn it, Lois, that's enough now.

478
00:44:36,356 --> 00:44:38,916
Maybe I just can't stand
the competition anymore.

479
00:44:39,092 --> 00:44:42,425
And just maybe you've been
the competition all along.

480
00:44:42,595 --> 00:44:44,995
Lois, I've never been
particularly good at riddles.

481
00:44:45,164 --> 00:44:47,428
Let me make this one really easy for you.

482
00:44:47,667 --> 00:44:51,603
Why, with thousands of children
potentially falling off something lethal...

483
00:44:51,771 --> 00:44:55,639
...all around the world, would Superman
be in Niagara Falls today?

484
00:44:55,808 --> 00:44:57,207
Why not the Grand Canyon?

485
00:44:57,377 --> 00:45:01,211
- Ask the child's family. I'm sure they know.
- Why is it always when I'm with you...

486
00:45:01,381 --> 00:45:04,839
...until Superman appears?
And then you seem to disappear.

487
00:45:05,018 --> 00:45:08,749
- Very conveniently, it seems to me.
- I was out for hot dogs. For Pete's sake...

488
00:45:08,921 --> 00:45:11,617
When Superman appeared,
I looked at that hot dog stand...

489
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:13,019
...and you were gone.

490
00:45:13,192 --> 00:45:14,386
- I was...
- Nowhere.

491
00:45:15,962 --> 00:45:17,896
I can't help it if I had to go to the...

492
00:45:18,731 --> 00:45:20,961
You are Superman, aren't you?

493
00:45:21,134 --> 00:45:24,626
Lois, look, we've been through
these hallucinations of yours before.

494
00:45:24,804 --> 00:45:26,601
Can't you see what you almost did?

495
00:45:26,773 --> 00:45:29,037
Throwing yourself off a building
30 stories high?

496
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:31,438
Can't you see the tragic mistake
you almost made?

497
00:45:31,611 --> 00:45:35,547
Yeah, I made a mistake.
I made a mistake because...

498
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:39,408
...I risked my life instead of yours.

499
00:45:39,585 --> 00:45:41,644
Lois, don't be insane.

500
00:45:41,821 --> 00:45:45,018
And don't fall down because
you're just gonna have to get up again.

501
00:45:45,191 --> 00:45:47,250
Lois, now, don't be crazy now. Lois!

502
00:46:00,139 --> 00:46:01,333
It is you.

503
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,606
I guess I've known this
for the longest time.

504
00:46:13,486 --> 00:46:15,283
You realize, of course...

505
00:46:15,455 --> 00:46:18,447
...if you'd been wrong,
Clark Kent would have been killed.

506
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,588
With a blank?

507
00:46:25,965 --> 00:46:27,159
Gotcha.

508
00:46:51,491 --> 00:46:54,187
A primitive sort of life form.

509
00:47:03,336 --> 00:47:04,564
Did you see that?

510
00:47:05,872 --> 00:47:08,067
Did you see what I did?

511
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:10,801
I have powers beyond reason here.

512
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:12,941
We all have them, my dear.

513
00:47:55,354 --> 00:47:58,482
- Wow, this is your home?
- No.

514
00:47:58,658 --> 00:48:01,718
Actually, I live in the city,
about three blocks from you.

515
00:48:03,196 --> 00:48:05,528
No, this is a very special place for me.

516
00:48:05,698 --> 00:48:07,996
I wanted you to see it.

517
00:48:08,401 --> 00:48:10,596
Listen, you warm enough?

518
00:48:11,871 --> 00:48:13,930
I guess I should be freezing, but I'm not.

519
00:48:14,106 --> 00:48:15,733
Good.

520
00:48:15,908 --> 00:48:18,069
Come on, let me show you.

521
00:48:37,029 --> 00:48:38,223
I don't know.

522
00:48:39,165 --> 00:48:42,362
From the look of them,
I'll bet $ 10 they're from Los Angeles.

523
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:55,579
Hey, you hippies,
get your butts off the road!

524
00:48:55,948 --> 00:48:59,042
I like the globe. It flashes
red like our Krypton sun.

525
00:48:59,452 --> 00:49:01,647
But not this irritating noise.

526
00:49:02,321 --> 00:49:04,152
Make way.

527
00:49:05,024 --> 00:49:06,787
Did I hear right?

528
00:49:06,959 --> 00:49:08,756
That son of a bitch give me an order?

529
00:49:09,295 --> 00:49:11,286
Duane, you take care of it.

530
00:49:16,335 --> 00:49:19,099
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing here?

531
00:49:19,272 --> 00:49:21,297
What is this symbol?

532
00:49:21,474 --> 00:49:23,271
Do you follow another leader?

533
00:49:23,442 --> 00:49:25,774
Follow the leader?

534
00:49:26,946 --> 00:49:29,312
Holy skunk sweat.

535
00:49:29,482 --> 00:49:31,677
- All right.
- A weapon of some sort.

536
00:49:41,527 --> 00:49:43,256
How the hell did you do that?

537
00:49:50,903 --> 00:49:52,336
Jesus H. Christ.

538
00:49:54,874 --> 00:49:58,275
- That was good.
- I thought we might...

539
00:49:59,745 --> 00:50:02,339
...abandon the orange juice for once.

540
00:50:09,722 --> 00:50:12,384
- Here, cheers.
- Cheers.

541
00:50:16,696 --> 00:50:19,790
Must be tough being Clark Kent, isn't it?

542
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:22,896
No. No, I really...

543
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:25,230
I really like it sometimes.

544
00:50:25,404 --> 00:50:27,565
Even though I do
make a fool of myself.

545
00:50:29,275 --> 00:50:33,712
But, you know, if it weren't for him,
I never would have met you.

546
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:39,051
But he is you.

547
00:50:39,819 --> 00:50:43,152
- It's kind of confusing.
- Not to me, it isn't.

548
00:50:45,591 --> 00:50:47,024
Everything's clear.

549
00:50:51,697 --> 00:50:55,463
Until yesterday, a middle-American town
that Middle America had forgotten.

550
00:50:55,635 --> 00:51:00,038
But today, the population...
Exaggerated reports put it at 123.

551
00:51:00,206 --> 00:51:01,639
- Has increased by three.

552
00:51:01,807 --> 00:51:04,833
And these three new arrivals
bring destruction in their wake.

553
00:51:05,011 --> 00:51:07,707
As I look west into
East Houston this morning...

554
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,077
...I see a town gripped with fear.
- Who's the guy?

555
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:13,218
Get that guy. Follow the guy.

556
00:51:13,386 --> 00:51:15,013
Who's the big guy?

557
00:51:15,821 --> 00:51:17,721
Okay, yeah, we've got a...

558
00:51:18,057 --> 00:51:19,752
- You got that?
- No.

559
00:51:24,063 --> 00:51:25,860
- That's fine.
- Try to wiggle it.

560
00:51:26,032 --> 00:51:27,966
Who else is seeing this?

561
00:51:28,134 --> 00:51:32,002
Well, with this satellite linkup,
just about everybody. The whole planet.

562
00:51:32,171 --> 00:51:34,366
The whole planet Houston?

563
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:37,907
Earth. The whole planet Earth.

564
00:51:40,212 --> 00:51:42,271
You may continue.

565
00:51:42,448 --> 00:51:46,111
As the extraordinary story continues...

566
00:51:47,153 --> 00:51:49,178
- Enough of this man.
- As this extraordinary...

567
00:51:49,355 --> 00:51:52,791
If the whole planet is watching,
let's show them something interesting.

568
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:55,688
Throw down your arms and surrender!

569
00:51:56,262 --> 00:51:58,730
This is an order.

570
00:52:00,766 --> 00:52:04,327
General Zod does not
take orders. He gives them.

571
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,718
He was in the line of that fire
and nothing happened to him.

572
00:52:29,895 --> 00:52:32,159
I haven't seen the likes
of this since Superman.

573
00:52:33,065 --> 00:52:34,794
Yes? Yes.

574
00:52:34,967 --> 00:52:39,700
The Newsbeat control room has informed
me that a fleet of helicopter gunships is...

575
00:52:39,872 --> 00:52:43,399
- Mr. President, sir, can't we...?
- There's nothing anybody can do.

576
00:52:43,576 --> 00:52:45,874
They have such powers,
nothing can stop them.

577
00:52:46,045 --> 00:52:47,478
Where's Superman?

578
00:52:47,646 --> 00:52:50,706
Where is he?
Why doesn't he do something?

579
00:53:03,129 --> 00:53:04,323
Fire again.

580
00:53:06,632 --> 00:53:08,099
Fire again.

581
00:53:11,337 --> 00:53:14,795
Look. They need machines to fly.

582
00:53:15,608 --> 00:53:18,270
- Banking now.
- What bravery.

583
00:53:18,611 --> 00:53:22,570
Be nice to them, my dear.
Blow them a kiss.

584
00:53:25,484 --> 00:53:28,180
Rockets ready. Coming in on target.
Wait, wait.

585
00:53:30,322 --> 00:53:31,516
We're out of control.

586
00:53:33,626 --> 00:53:36,925
We're coming in, coming down.
Can't control it!

587
00:53:37,096 --> 00:53:38,358
We're coming down.

588
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:46,270
I win.

589
00:53:47,673 --> 00:53:49,766
I always win.

590
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:54,243
Is there no one on
this planet to even challenge me?

591
00:54:14,233 --> 00:54:15,700
Come forward.

592
00:54:16,035 --> 00:54:17,935
Your general wishes to speak.

593
00:54:18,204 --> 00:54:22,436
I am General Zod, your ruler.

594
00:54:23,776 --> 00:54:27,803
Yes, today begins a new order!

595
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,548
Your lands, your possessions...

596
00:54:30,716 --> 00:54:35,676
...your very lives will gladly be
given in tribute to me.

597
00:54:36,222 --> 00:54:38,383
In return for your obedience...

598
00:54:38,557 --> 00:54:41,219
...you will enjoy my generous protection.

599
00:54:41,393 --> 00:54:45,261
In other words,
you will be allowed to live.

600
00:54:47,766 --> 00:54:50,758
So you are a general?

601
00:54:51,804 --> 00:54:53,965
And who is your superior?

602
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:59,871
- I answer only to the president.
- And he will answer to me.

603
00:55:01,146 --> 00:55:04,946
Or all of his cities
will end up like this one.

604
00:55:10,956 --> 00:55:14,585
Thousands of hours to create,
and they defaced it in seconds.

605
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,888
Imagine what they'll do
to the world if we resist.

606
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:25,133
<i>The people of your planet
are well-pleased with you, Kal-EI.</i>

607
00:55:25,304 --> 00:55:29,035
You have served them faithfully,
and they are grateful for it.

608
00:55:30,943 --> 00:55:35,971
And yet you have returned
to reason with me once again.

609
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:41,419
My son, I have tried to anticipate
your every question.

610
00:55:41,587 --> 00:55:43,418
This was one I'd...

611
00:55:44,857 --> 00:55:46,791
I'd hoped you would not ask.

612
00:55:49,962 --> 00:55:51,930
My attachment...

613
00:55:53,966 --> 00:55:59,268
...the feelings which I have developed
for a certain human being...

614
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:01,903
...have deeply affected me, Father.

615
00:56:02,074 --> 00:56:06,534
You cannot serve humanity by investing
your time and emotion in one human being...

616
00:56:06,712 --> 00:56:08,839
...at the expense of the rest.

617
00:56:09,048 --> 00:56:13,849
- The concepts are mutally exclusive.
- And...

618
00:56:15,654 --> 00:56:19,852
...if I no longer wish
to serve humanity...

619
00:56:20,793 --> 00:56:24,229
Is this how you repay their gratitude?

620
00:56:24,396 --> 00:56:28,196
By abandoning the weak,
the defenseless, the needy...

621
00:56:28,367 --> 00:56:30,995
...for the sake of your selfish pursuits?

622
00:56:31,203 --> 00:56:34,639
Selfish? After all I've done for them?

623
00:56:34,807 --> 00:56:37,401
Will there ever come a time
when I've served enough?

624
00:56:37,576 --> 00:56:40,136
At least they get a chance for happiness.

625
00:56:40,312 --> 00:56:42,940
I only ask as much, no more.

626
00:56:43,682 --> 00:56:46,378
Yours is a higher happiness.

627
00:56:46,552 --> 00:56:50,921
The fulfillment of your mission,
an inspiration you must have felt.

628
00:56:51,523 --> 00:56:54,458
You must have felt
that happiness within you.

629
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,888
My son, surely you cannot
deny that feeling.

630
00:56:58,263 --> 00:57:01,596
No, I cannot...

631
00:57:02,301 --> 00:57:06,135
...any more than I can deny the other,
which is stronger in me, Father.

632
00:57:07,573 --> 00:57:08,801
So much stronger.

633
00:57:14,813 --> 00:57:16,940
Is there no way then, Father?

634
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:21,542
Must I finally be denied
the one thing in life which I truly desire?

635
00:57:23,222 --> 00:57:26,020
<i>If you will not be Kal-EI...</i>

636
00:57:26,392 --> 00:57:28,326
...if you will live as one of them...

637
00:57:28,894 --> 00:57:30,885
...love their kind as one of them...

638
00:57:31,463 --> 00:57:33,658
...then it follows that you must...

639
00:57:34,366 --> 00:57:36,459
...become one of them.

640
00:58:04,963 --> 00:58:10,799
<i>This crystal chamber has in it the
harnessed rays of the red sun of Krypton.</i>

641
00:58:11,303 --> 00:58:12,702
Once exposed to them...

642
00:58:12,871 --> 00:58:16,398
...all your great powers
on Earth will disappear.

643
00:58:17,342 --> 00:58:18,832
Forever.

644
00:58:19,511 --> 00:58:21,536
Once this is done, there's no going back.

645
00:58:23,015 --> 00:58:25,415
You will feel like an ordinary man.

646
00:58:26,452 --> 00:58:29,512
And you can be harmed
like an ordinary man.

647
00:58:31,723 --> 00:58:33,588
<i>Think, Kal-EI.</i>

648
00:58:35,027 --> 00:58:36,688
I beg you.

649
00:58:37,763 --> 00:58:39,390
Father...

650
00:58:40,632 --> 00:58:41,860
...I love her.

651
00:58:59,918 --> 00:59:01,408
<i>Think, Kal-EI.</i>

652
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,898
Come on. Come on.

653
01:01:10,782 --> 01:01:11,976
Look out!

654
01:02:03,201 --> 01:02:05,101
You are the one they call president?

655
01:02:05,871 --> 01:02:07,498
I am.

656
01:02:09,574 --> 01:02:13,442
I see you are practiced
in worshipping things that fly.

657
01:02:14,813 --> 01:02:16,508
Good.

658
01:02:17,382 --> 01:02:19,543
Rise before Zod.

659
01:02:23,522 --> 01:02:26,491
Now, kneel before Zod.

660
01:02:40,706 --> 01:02:42,230
You are not the president.

661
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:47,308
No one who leads so many
could possibly kneel so quickly.

662
01:02:47,479 --> 01:02:49,276
I am the man they are protecting.

663
01:02:50,615 --> 01:02:52,480
I am the president.

664
01:02:53,418 --> 01:02:55,648
I'll kneel before you
if it will save lives.

665
01:02:56,088 --> 01:02:57,817
It will.

666
01:02:57,989 --> 01:03:00,549
Starting with your own.

667
01:03:04,262 --> 01:03:07,459
What a backward planet this must be...

668
01:03:07,899 --> 01:03:10,732
...where the men wear the ribbons...

669
01:03:11,269 --> 01:03:12,896
...and the jewelry.

670
01:03:26,351 --> 01:03:28,251
What I do now...

671
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:31,617
...I do for the sake of
the people of the world.

672
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:35,783
But there is one man here on Earth
who will never kneel before you.

673
01:03:36,094 --> 01:03:39,359
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?

674
01:03:39,531 --> 01:03:41,522
I wish I knew.

675
01:03:45,871 --> 01:03:47,236
Oh, God.

676
01:03:47,739 --> 01:03:49,263
Zod.

677
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:53,343
Hey.

678
01:03:53,512 --> 01:03:56,037
You're awfully quiet over there.

679
01:03:57,749 --> 01:04:01,048
Yeah, I was just thinking...

680
01:04:01,219 --> 01:04:04,746
...I can't believe what
you've given up for me.

681
01:04:05,557 --> 01:04:09,084
Are you kidding? I didn't do
it for you, Lois, I did it for us.

682
01:04:09,694 --> 01:04:12,754
See, I told you there'd be
a hot dog place somewhere.

683
01:04:12,931 --> 01:04:16,867
Okay. It sure takes longer
when you can't fly.

684
01:04:17,035 --> 01:04:18,764
Hurry up.

685
01:04:18,937 --> 01:04:20,837
- Come on.
- Okay.

686
01:04:24,042 --> 01:04:26,374
Come on, it's my treat. Come on.

687
01:04:30,115 --> 01:04:32,481
Oh, boy, it's Mr. Wonderful.

688
01:04:34,119 --> 01:04:36,383
Thank you.

689
01:04:38,623 --> 01:04:41,353
- Do you have a men's room?
- Yeah. Right in the corner.

690
01:04:41,526 --> 01:04:44,051
- Want to sit down?
- Yeah.

691
01:04:46,031 --> 01:04:47,521
Hi, what would you folks like?

692
01:04:47,699 --> 01:04:51,294
I'd like a cheeseburger with
everything on it, and a Coke...

693
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:55,133
...an order of fries
and a side salad, please.

694
01:04:56,174 --> 01:04:59,166
- And for you, sir?
- I'll think about it when I get back.

695
01:04:59,344 --> 01:05:00,868
Right. That's one cheeseburger...

696
01:05:01,112 --> 01:05:03,774
- Steak and eggs, over easy, coffee.
- Can I have my Coke?

697
01:05:03,949 --> 01:05:05,712
Coming right up.

698
01:05:06,084 --> 01:05:09,576
- I'm sorry, that seat's taken.
- It is now, sweetheart.

699
01:05:10,722 --> 01:05:12,690
Can I buy you something to eat?

700
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:15,053
No, thank you.

701
01:05:15,961 --> 01:05:18,259
Excuse me. I think
you're sitting in my seat.

702
01:05:19,097 --> 01:05:21,588
Your seat's in there, four-eyes.

703
01:05:24,603 --> 01:05:28,471
Gee, I think perhaps somebody
ought to teach you some manners, sir.

704
01:05:29,608 --> 01:05:32,099
Yeah? Well, let me
know when he comes in.

705
01:05:32,277 --> 01:05:34,768
- Look, Clark, we can just...
- Honey.

706
01:05:36,081 --> 01:05:38,481
Excuse me, sir, would
you care to step outside?

707
01:05:38,683 --> 01:05:41,413
I said, excuse me, sir,
would you care to step outside?

708
01:05:44,689 --> 01:05:47,419
Now, listen, Rocky,
your steak's coming right up.

709
01:05:47,993 --> 01:05:51,759
Keep it on the flame, Ron.
This is just a minute steak.

710
01:05:52,998 --> 01:05:54,556
After you.

711
01:05:55,233 --> 01:05:57,098
- Clark.
- It's all right, honey.

712
01:06:00,405 --> 01:06:01,497
Clark!

713
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:05,141
You all right, fella?

714
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:08,074
He's gonna be fine,
just give me that.

715
01:06:08,413 --> 01:06:11,940
- Clark?
- Blood. It's my blood.

716
01:06:12,784 --> 01:06:16,982
I think maybe we ought to
hire a bodyguard from now on.

717
01:06:17,155 --> 01:06:20,613
I don't want a bodyguard.
I want the man I fell in love with.

718
01:06:20,792 --> 01:06:22,919
I know that, Lois.

719
01:06:23,094 --> 01:06:25,324
I wish he were here.

720
01:06:31,002 --> 01:06:32,731
Clark.

721
01:06:34,105 --> 01:06:37,336
Boy, you just don't have
enough sense to stay down, do you?

722
01:06:44,316 --> 01:06:48,514
You... You... You are no good.

723
01:06:49,254 --> 01:06:51,449
Settle down!

724
01:06:52,023 --> 01:06:54,457
I don't like your meat anyway.

725
01:06:56,628 --> 01:06:58,493
Oh, God.

726
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:08,539
Clark? Clark?

727
01:07:08,707 --> 01:07:10,504
Clark, can you get up?

728
01:07:10,709 --> 01:07:13,371
- All right. Come on. I got you.
- Go slow. Go slow.

729
01:07:13,578 --> 01:07:15,341
Try and get up in that chair.

730
01:07:17,182 --> 01:07:19,844
- Sit down.
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

731
01:07:21,286 --> 01:07:24,881
Okay, everybody, he's all right.
Just relax. We'll have some fresh coffee.

732
01:07:25,056 --> 01:07:27,354
I'll turn the box on.

733
01:07:28,193 --> 01:07:31,026
We interrupt this program
for an urgent message...

734
01:07:31,196 --> 01:07:34,097
...from the President
of the United States.

735
01:07:34,332 --> 01:07:36,664
This is your president.

736
01:07:36,935 --> 01:07:41,770
On behalf of my country, and in the
name of the other leaders of the world...

737
01:07:42,273 --> 01:07:45,003
...with whom I have today consulted...

738
01:07:45,543 --> 01:07:48,307
...I hereby abdicate...

739
01:07:48,546 --> 01:07:52,812
...all authority and
control over this planet...

740
01:07:53,351 --> 01:07:54,875
<i>...to General Zod.</i>

741
01:07:55,687 --> 01:07:56,881
Zod.

742
01:07:57,055 --> 01:08:00,582
Only by strict compliance
with all his directions...

743
01:08:01,393 --> 01:08:05,352
...will the lives of
innocent millions be spared.

744
01:08:05,897 --> 01:08:07,489
Superman, can you hear me?

745
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:11,432
- Superman, where...?
- Who is this Superman?

746
01:08:11,603 --> 01:08:17,667
- You'll find out. And when you do...
- Come to me, Superman, if you dare.

747
01:08:17,842 --> 01:08:19,434
I defy you.

748
01:08:19,611 --> 01:08:23,069
<i>Come! Come and kneel before Zod.</i>

749
01:08:25,517 --> 01:08:26,950
<i>Zod!</i>

750
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,283
- Here? When?
- When?

751
01:08:30,455 --> 01:08:34,221
Where the hell have you been, Mac?
On a desert island?

752
01:08:36,961 --> 01:08:38,690
I have to go back.

753
01:08:38,863 --> 01:08:40,831
You can't go back.

754
01:08:40,999 --> 01:08:43,524
- There's no way now.
- I have to.

755
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:46,899
I've gotta try, damn it. I've
gotta try something, anything.

756
01:08:47,072 --> 01:08:49,939
It's not your fault.

757
01:08:50,108 --> 01:08:53,509
You didn't know this was gonna happen.

758
01:08:54,913 --> 01:08:56,744
He knew.

759
01:08:56,915 --> 01:08:59,179
I heard him.

760
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:01,614
I just didn't listen.

761
01:09:18,269 --> 01:09:20,863
You're master of all you survey.

762
01:09:21,072 --> 01:09:23,006
And so I was yesterday.

763
01:09:23,174 --> 01:09:25,665
And the day before.

764
01:09:39,624 --> 01:09:40,818
Hello, there.

765
01:09:42,393 --> 01:09:44,293
Lex Luthor.

766
01:09:46,698 --> 01:09:48,825
Lex Luthor.

767
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:52,201
You've heard the name?
The greatest criminal mind on Earth.

768
01:09:52,737 --> 01:09:55,365
I told you this was a puny planet.

769
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:57,167
Wait just a moment.

770
01:09:57,342 --> 01:10:00,470
Wait until you get to know
me better. Will you, please?

771
01:10:00,645 --> 01:10:04,342
Wait. Look, I can give
you anything you want.

772
01:10:04,516 --> 01:10:06,507
I can give you the brass ring...

773
01:10:06,684 --> 01:10:11,417
...the unlimited freedom
to maim, kill, destroy.

774
01:10:11,923 --> 01:10:16,519
Plus, Lex Luthor's keen mind.
Lex Luthor's savvy.

775
01:10:16,694 --> 01:10:21,028
Lex Luthor's career guidance.
Lex Luthor's School of Better...

776
01:10:22,934 --> 01:10:25,402
We have all of this without you.

777
01:10:26,204 --> 01:10:28,365
You cannot bargain
with what you don't have.

778
01:10:29,073 --> 01:10:31,234
Magnificent One...

779
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:35,611
...what I am bargaining with
is what you do not have.

780
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:37,145
The son of Jor-EI.

781
01:10:40,952 --> 01:10:43,250
The son of Jor-EI?

782
01:10:43,621 --> 01:10:45,111
I said that, didn't I?

783
01:10:45,623 --> 01:10:48,285
Jor-EI, our jailer?

784
01:10:48,526 --> 01:10:50,687
No, Jor-EI, the baseball player.

785
01:10:50,862 --> 01:10:52,853
Yes, Jor-EI, your jailer.

786
01:10:53,164 --> 01:10:56,656
- The son of Jor-EI? On this planet?
- Aye.

787
01:10:56,835 --> 01:10:59,429
Possibly you know him better
by his nom de voyage...

788
01:10:59,604 --> 01:11:02,698
...or his name he travels under:

789
01:11:02,874 --> 01:11:04,671
Superman.

790
01:11:06,978 --> 01:11:08,639
So this is Superman.

791
01:11:09,981 --> 01:11:11,278
How do you know of Jor-EI?

792
01:11:11,449 --> 01:11:15,886
My Fullness, as I
explained to you before...

793
01:11:16,955 --> 01:11:18,445
...l'm about the best there is.

794
01:11:18,623 --> 01:11:19,920
Revenge.

795
01:11:20,091 --> 01:11:22,082
We will kill the son of our jailer.

796
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:25,229
- Revenge.
- Revenge! Now we're cooking.

797
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:27,421
- He flies, then?
- Constantly.

798
01:11:27,599 --> 01:11:29,624
- He has powers as we do?
- Certainly.

799
01:11:29,801 --> 01:11:34,135
But, Magnificent One...

800
01:11:34,305 --> 01:11:37,138
...he's just one...

801
01:11:37,308 --> 01:11:39,868
...where you are three.

802
01:11:40,612 --> 01:11:44,013
- Or four, if you count him twice.
- We will bring him to his knees.

803
01:11:44,282 --> 01:11:45,943
Wait!

804
01:11:47,518 --> 01:11:48,780
First, you must find him.

805
01:11:49,087 --> 01:11:52,386
And Lex Baby is the only
one who knows where he is.

806
01:11:53,925 --> 01:11:56,416
What do you want?

807
01:11:56,628 --> 01:11:58,755
Well, general...

808
01:11:58,930 --> 01:12:01,490
...the world is a big place.

809
01:12:01,666 --> 01:12:04,100
Thank goodness...

810
01:12:04,269 --> 01:12:06,237
...my needs are small.

811
01:12:07,672 --> 01:12:13,508
As it turns out, I have this
affinity for beachfront property.

812
01:12:15,246 --> 01:12:17,737
What do you want?

813
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:19,679
Australia.

814
01:12:51,215 --> 01:12:52,739
Hey.

815
01:12:55,486 --> 01:12:59,946
Listen... Hey, come on,
where are you...? Please!

816
01:13:37,528 --> 01:13:39,120
Father?

817
01:13:41,733 --> 01:13:43,792
If you can hear me...

818
01:13:45,503 --> 01:13:47,403
...I failed.

819
01:13:49,807 --> 01:13:51,707
I failed you...

820
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,773
...I failed myself...

821
01:13:55,646 --> 01:13:57,739
...and all humanity.

822
01:14:00,651 --> 01:14:02,812
I've traded my birthright...

823
01:14:03,921 --> 01:14:08,722
...for a life of submission in a world
that's now ruled by your enemies.

824
01:14:10,428 --> 01:14:12,919
There's nobody left to help them now...

825
01:14:13,731 --> 01:14:15,665
...the people of the world.

826
01:14:16,734 --> 01:14:18,759
Not since I...

827
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:22,798
Father!

828
01:15:33,868 --> 01:15:38,464
Listen carefully, my son,
for we shall never speak again.

829
01:15:40,341 --> 01:15:42,935
If you hear me now...

830
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:46,136
...then you have made use
of the only means left to you:

831
01:15:47,047 --> 01:15:50,983
The crystal source through which
our communications begun.

832
01:15:51,952 --> 01:15:54,352
The circle is now complete.

833
01:15:54,722 --> 01:15:57,919
<i>You have made a dreadful mistake, Kal-EI.</i>

834
01:16:01,328 --> 01:16:04,855
You did this of your own free will...

835
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:08,197
...in spite of all I could say
to dissuade you.

836
01:16:10,504 --> 01:16:12,096
I...

837
01:16:12,273 --> 01:16:16,767
Now you have returned to me
for one last chance to redeem yourself.

838
01:16:16,944 --> 01:16:21,847
This too finally I have anticipated,
my son.

839
01:16:24,518 --> 01:16:26,679
<i>Look at me, Kal-EI.</i>

840
01:16:29,123 --> 01:16:33,719
Once before when you were small,
I died...

841
01:16:34,962 --> 01:16:37,931
...while giving you a chance for life.

842
01:16:39,066 --> 01:16:43,025
And now, even though it will exhaust
the final energy left within me...

843
01:16:43,737 --> 01:16:45,568
Father, no.

844
01:16:47,074 --> 01:16:49,542
<i>Look at me, Kal-EI.</i>

845
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:57,080
<i>The Kryptonian prophecy
will be at last fulfilled.</i>

846
01:16:57,384 --> 01:17:02,913
The son becomes the father,
the father becomes the son.

847
01:17:07,428 --> 01:17:11,330
<i>Farewell forever, Kal-EI.</i>

848
01:17:14,602 --> 01:17:17,070
Remember me, my son.

849
01:17:47,101 --> 01:17:48,693
My son.

850
01:18:04,285 --> 01:18:05,980
Father!

851
01:18:19,633 --> 01:18:23,091
Harold. Coffee, black, no sugar.

852
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:26,364
Black, no sug... Yeah. Yeah.

853
01:18:27,241 --> 01:18:28,799
Who's paying, huh?

854
01:18:29,843 --> 01:18:32,573
No, no! There's three of them.
That cockamamie general...

855
01:18:32,746 --> 01:18:36,876
...and a big truck with hair on it and a broad
that looks like the queen of the runway.

856
01:18:37,051 --> 01:18:41,784
They can fly, they can see through things.
Anything Superman can do, they can do.

857
01:18:42,256 --> 01:18:44,554
Where is he, anyway?

858
01:18:44,758 --> 01:18:46,749
Maybe he hasn't heard
about it yet, chief.

859
01:18:46,927 --> 01:18:49,088
- Maybe...
- Maybe he's just run out of guts.

860
01:18:49,263 --> 01:18:51,891
- No sugar. And don't call me "chief."
- He'll be here.

861
01:18:52,066 --> 01:18:55,593
- Lf there's any way at all, he'll be here.
- Yeah, he'll be here.

862
01:18:58,138 --> 01:19:00,402
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

863
01:19:01,108 --> 01:19:03,008
- Hey, Charlie, you feel that?
- Yeah.

864
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:04,709
Sounds like an earthquake.

865
01:19:06,814 --> 01:19:08,372
Oh, my!

866
01:19:14,488 --> 01:19:17,150
- It's those three.
- Stop!

867
01:19:17,324 --> 01:19:20,623
- Oh, my God, they're here now!
- Oh, no!

868
01:19:32,206 --> 01:19:33,434
This is scary!

869
01:20:22,523 --> 01:20:24,650
You all right, chief?

870
01:20:25,159 --> 01:20:26,558
Hi.

871
01:20:28,495 --> 01:20:31,396
You should see the White House.
They'll be cleaning for months.

872
01:20:31,565 --> 01:20:32,896
Lex Luthor.

873
01:20:33,467 --> 01:20:34,695
Wouldn't you know it?

874
01:20:35,335 --> 01:20:38,168
This is the son of Jor-EI?

875
01:20:38,338 --> 01:20:40,238
- No, but I bet you're a son of a...
- Jimmy!

876
01:20:41,475 --> 01:20:44,467
You promised me the son of Jor-EI.

877
01:20:45,946 --> 01:20:47,106
Yes, Your Grace.

878
01:20:47,714 --> 01:20:51,309
But what I've given
you is the next best thing.

879
01:20:51,485 --> 01:20:54,511
You just hold on to that
little lady, and he'll be along.

880
01:20:54,688 --> 01:20:56,246
See, they have this relationship.

881
01:20:56,423 --> 01:21:00,757
She does all his public relations,
and he gives her every exclusive.

882
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:03,590
They're the best of friends.
You know what I mean?

883
01:21:03,931 --> 01:21:07,162
What an undemanding
male this Superman must be.

884
01:21:07,601 --> 01:21:10,229
You could use a tuck
here and there yourself, sister.

885
01:21:10,737 --> 01:21:12,329
Wait!

886
01:21:12,506 --> 01:21:13,871
- I'm sorry!
- She lives for now.

887
01:21:14,808 --> 01:21:17,174
Kill the rest, starting with him.

888
01:21:19,713 --> 01:21:22,204
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

889
01:21:22,382 --> 01:21:23,940
Wait. Wait.

890
01:21:24,117 --> 01:21:28,213
Don't you remember the White House?
The Oval Room? We had a few laughs there.

891
01:21:28,789 --> 01:21:30,347
You ought to have that fixed.

892
01:21:41,935 --> 01:21:43,129
General...

893
01:21:44,037 --> 01:21:46,164
...haven't you heard
of freedom of the press?

894
01:21:46,373 --> 01:21:48,398
- Superman!
- Superman, thank God.

895
01:21:49,376 --> 01:21:50,741
I mean, get him!

896
01:21:51,144 --> 01:21:52,975
Come to me, son of Jor-EI!

897
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:56,313
Kneel before Zod!

898
01:22:10,931 --> 01:22:12,922
Watch out. You all right?

899
01:22:32,519 --> 01:22:34,077
Son of Jor-EI.

900
01:22:34,555 --> 01:22:37,115
We were beginning to
think you were a coward.

901
01:22:37,491 --> 01:22:38,753
I'm not a coward, Zod.

902
01:22:39,026 --> 01:22:42,086
It is extremely likely
you are merely a fool.

903
01:22:42,262 --> 01:22:44,628
Like father, like son.

904
01:23:00,914 --> 01:23:02,313
Look out!

905
01:23:05,385 --> 01:23:08,149
Then die as you deserve to!

906
01:23:18,298 --> 01:23:20,493
Come on, come on, Superman! Get him!

907
01:23:20,767 --> 01:23:22,826
Man, this is gonna be good.

908
01:23:58,839 --> 01:24:00,431
Superman.

909
01:24:21,461 --> 01:24:23,827
- Hey, that's the chief's.
- The chief's got it.

910
01:24:32,539 --> 01:24:34,507
What, you hit a woman?

911
01:24:57,631 --> 01:25:00,794
Oh, my God! My baby!

912
01:25:01,168 --> 01:25:03,602
Help my baby!

913
01:25:06,473 --> 01:25:08,168
Thank you.

914
01:25:09,743 --> 01:25:13,304
This Superman is nothing of the kind.

915
01:25:13,513 --> 01:25:15,913
- I've discovered his weakness.
- Yes.

916
01:25:16,083 --> 01:25:17,482
He cares.

917
01:25:17,751 --> 01:25:21,016
He actually cares
for these Earth people.

918
01:25:21,188 --> 01:25:24,351
- Like pets?
- I suppose so.

919
01:25:32,532 --> 01:25:34,432
I'll draw his fire...

920
01:25:34,601 --> 01:25:36,535
...with some of my own.

921
01:26:04,097 --> 01:26:05,758
What's happening to those cars?

922
01:26:09,202 --> 01:26:10,669
Get out of the way!

923
01:27:25,846 --> 01:27:26,938
Superman.

924
01:28:12,492 --> 01:28:13,891
Oh, thank you!

925
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:16,620
I never thought this thing
would go the distance.

926
01:28:30,844 --> 01:28:32,937
No! Don't do it!

927
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:35,041
The people!

928
01:28:39,686 --> 01:28:41,483
Throw it!

929
01:29:02,709 --> 01:29:06,008
- Get away from there. Get away from there.
- Let's help them out!

930
01:29:09,549 --> 01:29:13,007
- I got her. I got her. Don't worry.
- He's dead.

931
01:29:14,654 --> 01:29:16,645
Superman is dead.

932
01:29:19,893 --> 01:29:21,155
They've killed Superman.

933
01:29:22,595 --> 01:29:24,893
- He's dead.
- Let's go get them!

934
01:29:25,065 --> 01:29:27,659
- Come on, we'll show them!
- I know some judo. Let's go!

935
01:29:28,201 --> 01:29:29,725
Come on!

936
01:30:00,166 --> 01:30:02,794
I'm holding it, I'm holding it!

937
01:30:02,969 --> 01:30:05,369
What can you do if
you can't see what's happening?

938
01:30:10,343 --> 01:30:13,471
- Hold on!
- Oh, my God!

939
01:31:22,382 --> 01:31:24,850
You can't leave us!

940
01:31:29,556 --> 01:31:33,856
So he is a coward after all.

941
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:35,784
He's gone.

942
01:31:35,962 --> 01:31:37,486
Come back, Superman!

943
01:31:42,569 --> 01:31:44,230
Don't leave us!

944
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:49,131
He chickened out.

945
01:31:49,642 --> 01:31:50,700
Phony!

946
01:31:52,045 --> 01:31:53,979
Superman didn't even do nothing.

947
01:31:54,247 --> 01:31:56,374
Come on, let's go.

948
01:32:03,389 --> 01:32:07,189
- There they are.
- Get away from here. Jimmy.

949
01:32:16,202 --> 01:32:18,033
Our victory is complete.

950
01:32:18,204 --> 01:32:19,967
The son of Jor-El has fled.

951
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:22,836
- Superman fled?
- I don't believe you.

952
01:32:23,009 --> 01:32:27,070
You heard him. Three against one,
you should've taken two ears and a tail.

953
01:32:27,247 --> 01:32:30,341
- He fled in fear of us.
- He'll be back.

954
01:32:30,517 --> 01:32:32,883
As long as he's alive,
he's gonna try again.

955
01:32:33,052 --> 01:32:36,488
- The next time, we will kill him.
- The next time?

956
01:32:37,524 --> 01:32:39,583
The next time?

957
01:32:40,326 --> 01:32:42,419
What am I gonna do with you people?

958
01:32:42,595 --> 01:32:45,189
I held up my end.
I delivered you the blue boy.

959
01:32:45,365 --> 01:32:47,663
What do I get from my triple threat?

960
01:32:47,834 --> 01:32:52,168
"Bow, yield, kneel."
That kind of stuff closes out a town.

961
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:57,540
Why do you say this to me
when you know I will kill you for it?

962
01:32:57,744 --> 01:33:01,544
Kill me? Lex Luthor?

963
01:33:01,981 --> 01:33:04,745
Extinguish the greatest
criminal flame of our age?

964
01:33:04,918 --> 01:33:09,048
- Eradicate the only man on earth with...
- Let me kill him!

965
01:33:09,522 --> 01:33:11,114
- Superman's address?

966
01:33:14,994 --> 01:33:20,330
What more do you want?
I can see the greed written on your face.

967
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:23,367
A small incentive, O Fullest One.

968
01:33:23,536 --> 01:33:26,562
A mere bauble to jog the memory.

969
01:33:27,173 --> 01:33:28,367
What more?

970
01:33:29,342 --> 01:33:30,536
Cuba.

971
01:33:38,551 --> 01:33:44,786
I trust you are not wasting my time,
Lex Luthor.

972
01:33:44,991 --> 01:33:47,221
Of course not, Your Turbulence.

973
01:34:33,406 --> 01:34:35,499
Show yourself, coward!

974
01:34:38,411 --> 01:34:40,606
Son of a coward!

975
01:34:46,986 --> 01:34:48,283
I'm here, Zod.

976
01:34:48,688 --> 01:34:51,714
- Let Miss Lane go, step inside. We'll talk.
- No, don't, Superman!

977
01:34:51,891 --> 01:34:53,859
Please don't listen to him. He's just...

978
01:34:54,294 --> 01:34:55,556
Stop.

979
01:34:55,728 --> 01:34:57,719
Your powers are identical to mine.

980
01:34:57,897 --> 01:35:01,128
But we are three.
We could tear you limb from limb.

981
01:35:01,434 --> 01:35:02,662
Do it, Your Grace.

982
01:35:03,036 --> 01:35:05,197
Just grab a leg and just make a wish.

983
01:35:06,706 --> 01:35:09,106
But you are victim
to another fatal weakness...

984
01:35:09,542 --> 01:35:10,975
...your compassion.

985
01:35:11,144 --> 01:35:13,612
The death of others
means more to you than your own.

986
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:15,247
Yes, with rare exceptions.

987
01:35:15,682 --> 01:35:21,211
Your father condemned us to an eternal
living death. Your fate will be the same.

988
01:35:21,487 --> 01:35:23,546
You will live, Kal-EI, forever...

989
01:35:23,723 --> 01:35:28,717
...as my slave. If not, then others
will pay for your obstinate attitude.

990
01:35:28,895 --> 01:35:34,424
Innocent people, millions if necessary,
beginning with this Lois person.

991
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:36,227
- Don't, Superman, don't!
- Stop it!

992
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:42,670
All right, Zod.

993
01:35:43,343 --> 01:35:44,776
It's over.

994
01:35:47,613 --> 01:35:51,379
Your Grace, don't believe him!
You don't know him the way that I do.

995
01:35:53,586 --> 01:35:55,781
I sense the presence of Jor-El here.

996
01:35:57,790 --> 01:35:59,655
We will destroy this place.

997
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:01,558
And then kill him.

998
01:36:03,863 --> 01:36:05,728
Him.

999
01:36:06,899 --> 01:36:09,834
Him? Me?

1000
01:36:11,237 --> 01:36:13,171
General, this is Lex Luthor.

1001
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:17,401
Remember...?
I helped you through the tough times.

1002
01:36:17,577 --> 01:36:19,442
I filled your inside straight.

1003
01:36:19,979 --> 01:36:24,040
You came to me with nothing.
I gave you Superman.

1004
01:36:24,217 --> 01:36:25,684
Silence!

1005
01:36:25,852 --> 01:36:27,444
Well, look...

1006
01:36:29,956 --> 01:36:31,480
Guy's a clod.

1007
01:36:32,091 --> 01:36:34,150
You think you know people, right?

1008
01:36:34,761 --> 01:36:37,889
Promises were made,
gifts were exchanged.

1009
01:36:38,064 --> 01:36:41,465
I gotta hand it to you, you know.
You always told the truth.

1010
01:36:41,667 --> 01:36:44,465
A guy always knew
where he stood with you.

1011
01:36:46,572 --> 01:36:49,439
Try to get them all
into this molecule chamber here.

1012
01:36:49,609 --> 01:36:51,736
It takes away their powers, see...

1013
01:36:51,911 --> 01:36:54,505
...and turns them into
ordinary human beings.

1014
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:55,874
Now, if you could...

1015
01:36:59,051 --> 01:37:02,248
- Don't go in there. It's a trap.
- Luthor, you poisonous snake!

1016
01:37:02,622 --> 01:37:04,112
That's a molecule chamber.

1017
01:37:04,323 --> 01:37:08,157
It makes people like
you into people like me.

1018
01:37:08,594 --> 01:37:10,789
- You've done well, Lex Luthor.
- I thought so.

1019
01:37:11,998 --> 01:37:13,590
Seize him.

1020
01:37:15,268 --> 01:37:17,395
- Kill her.
- No! Superman, no!

1021
01:37:17,570 --> 01:37:19,697
All right! All right, leave her alone, Zod!

1022
01:37:20,239 --> 01:37:21,900
You win.

1023
01:37:25,111 --> 01:37:29,673
General, the crystal there
activates the mechanism.

1024
01:37:29,849 --> 01:37:32,682
Lex Luthor, ruler of Australia...

1025
01:37:32,852 --> 01:37:34,547
...activate the machine.

1026
01:37:45,731 --> 01:37:47,722
With your permission.

1027
01:39:00,873 --> 01:39:03,740
And now, finally...

1028
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:09,607
Kneel.

1029
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:16,520
Take my hand...

1030
01:39:16,722 --> 01:39:22,490
...and swear eternal loyalty to Zod.

1031
01:40:02,568 --> 01:40:03,933
He switched it.

1032
01:40:04,570 --> 01:40:06,504
He did it to them.

1033
01:40:07,239 --> 01:40:12,643
The lights were on out here
while he was safe in there.

1034
01:40:14,013 --> 01:40:16,004
Hey, you know something?

1035
01:40:16,349 --> 01:40:18,476
You're a real pain in the neck!

1036
01:40:28,427 --> 01:40:30,224
Are you all right?

1037
01:40:31,397 --> 01:40:35,128
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor.
A lying weasel like you couldn't resist.

1038
01:40:35,601 --> 01:40:37,466
Who, me? Are you kidding?

1039
01:40:37,637 --> 01:40:41,698
Hey, I was with you all the
time. That was beautiful.

1040
01:40:41,874 --> 01:40:44,035
Did you see the way
they fell into our trap?

1041
01:40:44,276 --> 01:40:46,710
Too late, Luthor. Too late.

1042
01:40:46,979 --> 01:40:50,176
Look. Look, Superman.

1043
01:40:50,616 --> 01:40:52,584
I got a proposition for you.

1044
01:40:52,752 --> 01:40:55,084
Now, don't stop me
till you've heard this...

1045
01:40:55,254 --> 01:40:58,519
...because I know I owe you one,
but we're in the North Pole, right?

1046
01:42:15,735 --> 01:42:17,293
Look, Lois...

1047
01:42:18,437 --> 01:42:20,735
No regrets, okay? I did it.

1048
01:42:20,906 --> 01:42:23,500
I got the man I loved to love me.

1049
01:42:26,412 --> 01:42:30,075
- Didn't I?
- Oh, yeah.

1050
01:42:32,251 --> 01:42:34,981
Well, okay then. Those people need you.

1051
01:42:35,154 --> 01:42:37,554
Do you think I don't understand that?

1052
01:42:42,027 --> 01:42:46,430
We can still see each other, you know.
I mean, all the time.

1053
01:42:48,801 --> 01:42:51,065
But it just can't be...

1054
01:43:13,526 --> 01:43:15,756
Just don't forget, that's all.

1055
01:43:16,595 --> 01:43:17,960
Don't ever forget.

1056
01:43:42,454 --> 01:43:45,617
- Well, here we are.
- Home sweet home.

1057
01:43:46,826 --> 01:43:50,284
- See you at work in the morning.
- Bright and early, huh?

1058
01:43:50,462 --> 01:43:54,364
- The same old Clark and the same old Lois.
- Yup.

1059
01:43:55,167 --> 01:44:00,195
Except... maybe I won't be
quite so mean to you from now on.

1060
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:09,142
You don't have to worry.

1061
01:44:09,715 --> 01:44:11,307
Your secret's safe with me.

1062
01:44:12,585 --> 01:44:16,146
I know. I know that, Lois.

1063
01:44:41,380 --> 01:44:43,780
Well, there he goes, kid.

1064
01:44:44,717 --> 01:44:46,685
Up, up and away.

1065
01:46:12,137 --> 01:46:14,935
- No!
- No!

1066
01:46:42,301 --> 01:46:44,428
- Hey, is Mr. White free?
- On the telephone.

1067
01:46:44,603 --> 01:46:48,539
- He's in conference at the moment.
- Yeah, that's what he says.

1068
01:47:04,890 --> 01:47:07,085
All right, give me three carbons of that.

1069
01:47:07,259 --> 01:47:09,591
- Hi.
- It's gonna be an insert in the paper.

1070
01:47:09,762 --> 01:47:11,491
That's what they said.

1071
01:47:13,032 --> 01:47:15,500
Good morning. Hi.

1072
01:47:21,173 --> 01:47:22,800
Good morning, Lois.

1073
01:47:28,514 --> 01:47:30,345
- Good morning, Lois.
- Hi, Clark.

1074
01:47:30,516 --> 01:47:33,246
Jeepers, I have seen
some faraway looks in my time...

1075
01:47:33,419 --> 01:47:36,650
...but with that look, you might as well
be on the North Pole.

1076
01:47:37,623 --> 01:47:39,818
The North Pole.

1077
01:47:41,026 --> 01:47:42,618
No, that's too silly.

1078
01:47:43,595 --> 01:47:49,192
Did you ever feel like you knew something
that was so important that...

1079
01:47:49,535 --> 01:47:51,366
No, you never did.

1080
01:47:52,171 --> 01:47:57,871
I mean, I feel like I'm sitting on the single
most important story of my career...

1081
01:47:58,043 --> 01:48:00,136
...and I can't remember what it is.

1082
01:48:00,679 --> 01:48:04,274
Well, knowing you,
it must have been about Superman.

1083
01:48:04,450 --> 01:48:07,715
Maybe how he saved the city or
saved the world or saved the universe.

1084
01:48:07,886 --> 01:48:11,822
Clark, Clark. Listen.
Jealousy's really counterproductive.

1085
01:48:11,990 --> 01:48:14,686
Now, there's some things
that you can do too.

1086
01:48:15,694 --> 01:48:17,286
Oh, yeah?

1087
01:48:17,463 --> 01:48:20,227
Really? Like what?

1088
01:48:21,733 --> 01:48:22,927
Get us a pizza.

1089
01:48:23,702 --> 01:48:27,433
- A pizza. Now?
- Yeah, I'm hungry.

1090
01:48:27,906 --> 01:48:30,431
Actually, I don't think
Mr. White would like it if...

1091
01:48:30,609 --> 01:48:32,543
I'll pay for half of it, all right?

1092
01:48:32,711 --> 01:48:34,144
I'm going.

1093
01:48:39,318 --> 01:48:40,751
Lois?

1094
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:42,517
You know, about the pizza?

1095
01:48:43,789 --> 01:48:47,225
It's okay. I'll pay for the whole thing.

1096
01:48:49,428 --> 01:48:51,419
You know, you're really super.

1097
01:49:13,118 --> 01:49:15,518
- Hey, Ron.
- Yeah?

1098
01:49:15,687 --> 01:49:17,484
Give me another
plate of this garbage.

1099
01:49:17,656 --> 01:49:20,420
Garbage? That's my
number-one special, Rocky.

1100
01:49:20,626 --> 01:49:24,255
All right. Get me some
more coffee too, will you?

1101
01:49:25,564 --> 01:49:29,898
Gee, that's funny. I've never
seen garbage eat garbage before.

1102
01:49:37,943 --> 01:49:41,845
Excuse me, sir. I think
you're sitting in my favorite seat.

1103
01:49:42,014 --> 01:49:43,345

Now cool it, Rocky.

1105
01:49:50,923 --> 01:49:52,049
Take it easy, will you?

1106
01:49:52,224 --> 01:49:55,660
I just had this joint fixed.
It cost me a fortune.

1107
01:50:12,277 --> 01:50:14,370
Oh, God!

1108
01:50:26,091 --> 01:50:28,218
This order's to go.

1109
01:50:35,968 --> 01:50:39,836

01:50:42,207 --> 01:50:46,109
I've been working out.

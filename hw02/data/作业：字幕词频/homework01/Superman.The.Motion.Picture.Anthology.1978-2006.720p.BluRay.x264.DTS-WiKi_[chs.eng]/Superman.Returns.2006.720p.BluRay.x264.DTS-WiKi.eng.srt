1
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,663
You will travel far, my little Kal-EI.

2
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,408
But we will never leave you...

3
00:01:19,836 --> 00:01:22,505
...even in the face of our deaths.

4
00:01:23,756 --> 00:01:26,294
You will make my strength your own.

5
00:01:27,635 --> 00:01:30,921
You will see my life through your eyes...

6
00:01:31,889 --> 00:01:34,641
...as your life will be seen through mine.

7
00:01:35,977 --> 00:01:42,145
The son becomes the father,
and the father the son.

8
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,262
In spite of your past...

9
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,225
...I know you're a good man.

10
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,525
And all good men...

11
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,560
...deserve a second chance.

12
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,705
From the moment
I received your first letter...

13
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,709
...I knew you were not like the rest.

14
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:41,167
You came from nothing...

15
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,634
...and you worked so hard
to get where you are.

16
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,430
You might have made a few mistakes.

17
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,593
- Gertrude, for God's sake!
- Damn it, Gertrude, let us in now!

18
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:57,397
You said that if I helped you
get out of prison...

19
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,062
...you'd take care of me.

20
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:04,227
And you have.

21
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:09,826
You've shown me pleasures
that I've never known.

22
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,743
That's why you deserve...

23
00:06:13,914 --> 00:06:15,823
...everything.

24
00:06:19,294 --> 00:06:20,788
I love you...

25
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:23,377
...Lex Luthor.

26
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:42,097
Gertrude, let us in. He's a crook.

27
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:44,314
He doesn't love you, Gertrude!

28
00:06:44,485 --> 00:06:45,861
He's a monster! Gertrude!

29
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:05,710
- You can keep that.
- Oh, God.

30
00:07:05,881 --> 00:07:07,162
The rest is mine.

31
00:07:13,597 --> 00:07:15,305
We're done.

32
00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:46,994
Bye, Martha.

33
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,900
Oh, Clark.

34
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,664
Oh, my boy.

35
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,381
Will you get that thing out of my face!

36
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:31,047
Lex, your friends give me the creeps.

37
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,097
Prison is a creepy place, Kitty.

38
00:11:33,267 --> 00:11:35,722
One needs to make creepy friends
in order to survive.

39
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:38,385
Even a man with my vast talents
is won'th less inside...

40
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:42,431
...than a can'ton of cigarettes and
a sharp piece of metal in your pocket.

41
00:11:46,112 --> 00:11:49,279
Do you know the story of Prometheus?
No, of course you don't.

42
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:53,494
Prometheus was a god who stole
the power of fire from the other gods...

43
00:11:53,661 --> 00:11:55,405
...and gave control of it to mortals.

44
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,249
In essence, he gave us technology.
He gave us power.

45
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,951
So we're stealing fire? In the Arctic.

46
00:12:02,128 --> 00:12:05,746
Actually, sort of. You see, whoever
controls technology controls the world.

47
00:12:05,923 --> 00:12:08,593
The Roman Empire ruled the world
because they built roads.

48
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:11,713
The British Empire ruled the world
because they built ships.

49
00:12:11,887 --> 00:12:15,387
America, the atom bomb,
and so on and so forth.

50
00:12:15,558 --> 00:12:17,218
I just want what Prometheus wanted.

51
00:12:17,601 --> 00:12:21,219
Sounds great, Lex, but you're not a god.

52
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:27,311
Gods are selfish beings
who fly around in little red capes...

53
00:12:27,486 --> 00:12:29,775
...and don't share their power
with mankind.

54
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:31,571
Hey, boss.

55
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:33,823
We found something.

56
00:12:38,747 --> 00:12:41,452
No, I don't wanna be a god.

57
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,709
I just wanna bring fire to the people.

58
00:12:45,795 --> 00:12:49,461
And I want my cut.

59
00:13:32,174 --> 00:13:34,499
Was this his house?

60
00:13:35,302 --> 00:13:37,875
You might think so. Most would.

61
00:13:38,055 --> 00:13:41,091
This is more of a monument
to a long dead...

62
00:13:41,266 --> 00:13:43,840
...and extremely powerful civilization.

63
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:46,688
This is where he learned who he was.

64
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:49,858
This is where he came for guidance.

65
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:02,825
Possibilities.

66
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:07,076
Endless possibilities.

67
00:14:52,043 --> 00:14:55,044
You act like you've been here before.

68
00:15:21,113 --> 00:15:22,940
My son...

69
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:27,859
...you do not remember me.

70
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:30,952
I am Jor-EI.

71
00:15:31,373 --> 00:15:33,449
I'm your father.

72
00:15:33,626 --> 00:15:37,706
By now, I will have been dead
many thousands of your years.

73
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,379
- He thinks I'm his son.
- You are the only survivor of Krypton.

74
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:47,216
Embedded in the crystals before you is
the total accumulation of all literature...

75
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:50,259
...and scientific fact
from dozens of other worlds...

76
00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:53,849
...spanning the 28 known galaxies.

77
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,810
There are questions to be asked.

78
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,100
Here in this...

79
00:15:59,276 --> 00:16:01,767
This Fortress of Solitude...

80
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,819
...we shall try to find
the answers together.

81
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,485
Can he see us?

82
00:16:08,243 --> 00:16:09,867
No, he's dead.

83
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:12,407
So, my son...

84
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,827
...Kal-EI...

85
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:23,378
...speak.

86
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,008
Tell me everything...

87
00:16:27,178 --> 00:16:29,799
...starting with crystals.

88
00:19:26,644 --> 00:19:28,103
Hey, boy.

89
00:19:54,213 --> 00:19:56,205
- On Tuesday, between support...

90
00:19:56,381 --> 00:19:58,707
- hindered the firefighting efforts
for all those...

91
00:19:58,884 --> 00:20:03,546
Police have finally arrived and it's
still complete mayhem down here.

92
00:20:04,931 --> 00:20:07,304
Fighting broke out in the
southernmost region...

93
00:20:07,476 --> 00:20:09,883
...with border fire
and small-arms attacks prevalent.

94
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:11,805
Don't worry, I buried it this morning.

95
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,064
- It was futile trying to force him
to testify before a grand jury.

96
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:16,727
Mom?

97
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:20,145
Five years.

98
00:20:22,073 --> 00:20:25,442
If your father was alive,
he never would have let you go.

99
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,738
I almost gave up hope.

100
00:20:27,912 --> 00:20:31,162
I just thought
I would never see you again.

101
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,489
Oh, Clark.

102
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,428
Did you find what you were looking for?

103
00:20:45,262 --> 00:20:48,963
I thought, hoped...

104
00:20:49,808 --> 00:20:51,600
...it might still be there.

105
00:20:52,311 --> 00:20:54,102
Your home?

106
00:20:56,607 --> 00:20:58,932
That place was a graveyard.

107
00:21:00,402 --> 00:21:01,861
I'm all that's left.

108
00:21:04,114 --> 00:21:07,649
Clark, the universe is a big place.

109
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:10,443
And you don't know who's out there.

110
00:21:12,247 --> 00:21:14,703
And even if you are the last...

111
00:21:17,294 --> 00:21:19,120
...you're not alone.

112
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:25,544
I know.

113
00:21:47,156 --> 00:21:48,319
- Sorry.
- Look out!

114
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:49,736
Watch out, will you?

115
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,403
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

116
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:54,323
Sorry.

117
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:58,832
Great. Would you be careful?

118
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:03,334
- Jimmy.
- Mr. Clark! I mean, Kent! Mr. Kent!

119
00:22:03,505 --> 00:22:05,581
Welcome back! Oh, my God!

120
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:09,506
Hey, come... Wait right there.
I'll be right back.

121
00:22:18,979 --> 00:22:22,430
Oh, hey, sorry, guys,
I'm still looking for a place to live...

122
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,351
...if you know of anything reasonable.

123
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:28,191
Behind you, Mr. Kent.
I made it myself. It's a cake.

124
00:22:30,073 --> 00:22:31,567
Oh, it looks...

125
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:33,815
...delicious.

126
00:22:33,993 --> 00:22:38,322
Olsen! Where are the photos
of that birthday-clown-massacre thing?

127
00:22:38,498 --> 00:22:41,071
I'm on it, chief. Hey, look who's back.

128
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:42,876
- Kent?
- Hey, chief.

129
00:22:43,044 --> 00:22:45,535
- Thank you for giving me my job back.
- Don't thank me.

130
00:22:45,713 --> 00:22:47,041
Thank Norm Palmer for dying.

131
00:22:48,924 --> 00:22:50,882
It was his time.

132
00:22:52,178 --> 00:22:55,760
- Let's get you set up, huh?
- Olsen!

133
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:57,176
Okay, so I gotta run...

134
00:22:57,349 --> 00:23:00,635
...but I will be back to check on you
in a sec, Mr. Kent.

135
00:23:00,811 --> 00:23:04,974
Oh, hey, do you know
where I can find Lois?

136
00:23:18,912 --> 00:23:21,284
The timing of this
automated-ignition countdown...

137
00:23:21,456 --> 00:23:23,615
...is the most precarious part
of the launch.

138
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:25,417
Lois Lane, Daily Planet.

139
00:23:25,585 --> 00:23:28,835
You also stated that the shuttle
will usher in a new era of travel...

140
00:23:29,005 --> 00:23:32,041
...enabling the average person
to afford transcontinental flights.

141
00:23:32,217 --> 00:23:34,293
But can you tell us the exact price...

142
00:23:34,469 --> 00:23:37,042
...an "average person"
will be expected to pay?

143
00:23:37,263 --> 00:23:39,932
The answer to that question
is in your press packet.

144
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:42,851
The Earth is surrounded
by a blanket of air...

145
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:45,391
...which we call the atmosphere.

146
00:23:45,563 --> 00:23:49,146
It reaches over...

147
00:24:35,195 --> 00:24:37,982
Yeah. He looks just like his mom.

148
00:24:38,156 --> 00:24:42,153
Already takes after her too, especially
when it comes to getting into trouble.

149
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:43,821
Mother?

150
00:24:45,663 --> 00:24:50,325
Oh, yeah, well, I guess you've been gone.
Fearless reporter Lois Lane is a mommy.

151
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,955
Oh, you know, I'll just...
I'll take that. That's good.

152
00:24:56,132 --> 00:24:59,049
- Sorry.
- No. She's got plenty.

153
00:24:59,218 --> 00:25:01,175
- Wait, she's married?
- Yes.

154
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,723
No. Not really. It's more like
a prolonged engagement.

155
00:25:05,891 --> 00:25:08,347
But don't ask Miss Lane
when they're tying the knot...

156
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:12,053
...because she hates that question.

157
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:16,691
- Like this follow the same stringent
safety guidelines set by NASA?

158
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,482
Since this is a joint venture
with the Air Force...

159
00:25:19,655 --> 00:25:23,154
You all right? You look like
you could use a drink.

160
00:25:25,577 --> 00:25:28,827
This place is so tacky.
Why are we back here?

161
00:25:28,997 --> 00:25:32,615
Kitty, while you were doing your nails
and ordering fur coats online...

162
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:34,536
...I was busy unlocking the secrets...

163
00:25:34,711 --> 00:25:37,581
...of one of the most advanced
civilizations in the universe.

164
00:25:37,756 --> 00:25:39,001
Werert there two of those?

165
00:25:39,174 --> 00:25:43,420
You see, unlike our clunky
earthbound forms of construction...

166
00:25:43,595 --> 00:25:46,050
...the technology on Krypton,
Supermars home world...

167
00:25:46,222 --> 00:25:48,630
...was based on manipulating
the growth of crystals.

168
00:25:48,808 --> 00:25:50,183
Sounds like hocus-pocus to me.

169
00:25:50,351 --> 00:25:54,100
Well, naturally, to the primitive mind,
any sufficiently advanced technology...

170
00:25:54,272 --> 00:25:56,395
...would be indistinguishable from magic.

171
00:25:56,566 --> 00:26:00,943
But imagine: Cities, vehicles, weapons...

172
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:03,153
...entire continents...

173
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:06,241
...all grown.

174
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:17,249
To think that one could create
a new world...

175
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:20,420
...with such a simple little object.

176
00:26:22,132 --> 00:26:24,421
It's like a seed.

177
00:26:24,593 --> 00:26:26,835
And all it needs is water.

178
00:26:27,012 --> 00:26:28,471
Like...

179
00:26:29,264 --> 00:26:31,257
...Sea-Monkeys.

180
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:35,223
Exactly, Kitty.

181
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,430
Like Sea-Monkeys.

182
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:44,228
Clark has been doing a little
soul-searching for the last couple years.

183
00:26:44,404 --> 00:26:46,396
- He saw Ilamas.
- Yeah?

184
00:26:46,573 --> 00:26:48,612
- Yeah.
- Must be tough coming back.

185
00:26:50,326 --> 00:26:52,485
- Coming back?
- To work.

186
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:54,871
Yeah.

187
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:57,863
Well, you know, things change.

188
00:26:58,042 --> 00:27:00,082
I mean, of course things change...

189
00:27:00,253 --> 00:27:06,125
...but sometimes things that you didn't
think would change could change.

190
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:08,170
Take Lois.

191
00:27:08,344 --> 00:27:12,293
A woman like her,
I never thought she'd settle down.

192
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:16,430
You know, if you ask me...
Because she'll never tell you this...

193
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:21,477
...but if you ask me,
she's still in love with you-know-who.

194
00:27:29,823 --> 00:27:33,690
The original space shuttle
generated 7.5 million pounds of thrust...

195
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:35,577
...just in the initial launch phase.

196
00:27:35,745 --> 00:27:40,491
But, by piggybacking
on this Boeing 777... Yes?

197
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:42,706
If this launch is as pivotal as you claim...

198
00:27:42,877 --> 00:27:45,166
...why is it being covered
by one news network?

199
00:27:45,338 --> 00:27:48,541
Why don't we save those questions
for the post-launch briefing.

200
00:27:48,716 --> 00:27:50,341
How about that, Miss Lane?

201
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:53,961
When we hit 40,000 feet,
the shuttle will detach, ascend...

202
00:27:54,138 --> 00:27:57,839
...and then fire the first of two propellant
systems, the liquid fuel boosters.

203
00:27:58,017 --> 00:28:00,057
When the shuttle
reaches the stratosphere...

204
00:28:00,228 --> 00:28:02,351
...the secondary
insertion booster will fire...

205
00:28:02,522 --> 00:28:05,890
...propelling the craft
at 4gs into the mesosphere.

206
00:28:09,737 --> 00:28:11,895
- Careful.
- I know.

207
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,741
- Careful. Careful.
- I know.

208
00:28:42,978 --> 00:28:45,433
Wow, that's really something, Lex.

209
00:28:45,605 --> 00:28:47,894
Wait for it.

210
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:54,071
Wow, that's really something, Lex.

211
00:28:56,532 --> 00:28:59,237
It's freaking Gone With the Wind.

212
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:01,950
- Shut off the camera.
- But I'm getting it.

213
00:29:02,121 --> 00:29:04,161
I said, shut off the damn camera.

214
00:29:10,546 --> 00:29:12,254
I think I did something wrong.

215
00:29:12,423 --> 00:29:16,752
No. That wasrt you.

216
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:47,994
Ignition is at T minus one minute
and we are prepping for separation.

217
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,660
CDR, start the clock.

218
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:52,618
Three minutes and counting.

219
00:29:52,796 --> 00:29:55,037
Body signs normal. Crew is looking good.

220
00:29:55,215 --> 00:29:56,875
Shuttle readouts are holding steady.

221
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:59,291
- We're still a go for launch.
- Roger.

222
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:09,680
- Houston, you copy?
- Houston, do you copy?

223
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:14,680
Oh, God.

224
00:30:16,152 --> 00:30:17,895
Electrical variance.

225
00:30:21,699 --> 00:30:23,241
What the...?

226
00:30:30,124 --> 00:30:32,163
Please, there's nothing to worry about.

227
00:30:32,334 --> 00:30:36,581
It seems that we are experiencing
a slight power outage.

228
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:44,002
- What did you do?
- It wasrt me. It just cycled back up.

229
00:30:45,555 --> 00:30:47,215
Genesis, radio check from Houston.

230
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,341
There we have it.
We were experiencing a power outage.

231
00:30:53,772 --> 00:30:56,345
- Climbing to 40,000 feet.
- Roger, 40,000 feet.

232
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:10,538
And it's gone! A blazing fastball...

233
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:33,215
Is that it?

234
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:41,766
I don't think so.

235
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:33,697
Dual engine failure,
but they're up and running again.

236
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:37,736
Genesis, I hate to say this, but it looks
like we're gonna have to scrub the launch.

237
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:41,449
- Aborting booster ignition.
- Roger. Aborting booster ignition.

238
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,420
Boosters are non-responsive.
We're still counting down for ignition.

239
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,298
- Platform, we have a problem.
- Go.

240
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,874
Looks like something faulted
during the power outage.

241
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,378
Both boosters are
counting down for ignition.

242
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,512
Platform, you have 30 seconds.

243
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,927
- What?
- Release couplings.

244
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,475
We can 't shut down boosters.

245
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:02,094
We should be able to manage the launch
and recover to the emergency field.

246
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:03,814
T minus 23 seconds to ignition.

247
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,389
Genesis, you're a go
for evac procedures.

248
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:09,403
Twenty-one, 20...

249
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,148
...19...

250
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,825
Couplings are non-responsive.

251
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:17,903
- We're still attached.
- Seventeen.

252
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:22,033
- Platform, couplings are jammed.
- Fifteen.

253
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,999
Fourteen.

254
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,670
Don't be alarmed. It's absolutely normal.

255
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,497
We're still attached.
Couplings are non-responsive.

256
00:33:32,676 --> 00:33:35,250
- Nine, eight...
- Houston, can you do a remote override?

257
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,049
...seven...

258
00:33:38,223 --> 00:33:40,893
- Remote override is unresponsive.
...six, five...

259
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,345
- I repeat, remote override is unresponsive.
...four, three...

260
00:33:46,523 --> 00:33:50,687
And if you're lucky, you may hear
the faint pop of the sonic boom.

261
00:33:56,616 --> 00:33:59,451
- Houston, we have ignition.
- Roger, ignition.

262
00:34:02,205 --> 00:34:05,906
- This is Python 21, she's pulling away.
- Okay, all flight control is on the...

263
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:08,836
This is not a drill.
Clear nonessential personnel.

264
00:34:09,003 --> 00:34:11,245
Switch to emergency band frequencies.

265
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:16,211
Warning, warning.

266
00:34:21,474 --> 00:34:23,632
Oh, no! Oh, no!

267
00:34:24,685 --> 00:34:25,883
Can I get a little help?

268
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:34,104
This is UPV breaking news.
From Washington, Frank Jacobs.

269
00:34:34,278 --> 00:34:35,523
We've just received word...

270
00:34:35,696 --> 00:34:38,448
...that the inaugural flight
of the Genesis space shuttle...

271
00:34:38,616 --> 00:34:40,822
...is experiencing a midair emergency.

272
00:34:40,993 --> 00:34:44,029
- A problem with the launch
of the new orbital shuttle, Genesis.

273
00:34:44,204 --> 00:34:47,407
The reports are telling us
the shuttle failed to disengage...

274
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:50,500
...sending both crafts
rocketing towards space.

275
00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:54,287
We're now going live to Cape Canaveral
for the latest update on this story.

276
00:34:54,464 --> 00:34:55,793
Jim, all we know right now...

277
00:34:55,966 --> 00:34:58,753
...is that the couplings
which hold the shuttle to the 777...

278
00:34:58,927 --> 00:35:01,085
...malfunctioned
and did not release as planned.

279
00:35:01,263 --> 00:35:02,805
- We're uncertain...
- I should do...

280
00:35:02,973 --> 00:35:05,594
...why the ignition sequence
continued and boosters fired.

281
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:08,638
However, there's speculation here
that the blackout, which...

282
00:35:24,994 --> 00:35:26,821
Help me sit up.

283
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:33,782
Mach one.
Still tied to the shuttle at 42,000 feet.

284
00:35:33,961 --> 00:35:37,626
- Houston, we need some help. Houston!
- Running diagnostics check. Stand by.

285
00:35:42,636 --> 00:35:45,803
Insertion booster ignition in five seconds.

286
00:35:55,482 --> 00:35:57,309
Warning, warning.

287
00:36:03,698 --> 00:36:05,241
What the hell is that?

288
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:09,994
There's some kind of unidentified bogey
coming from the north.

289
00:36:10,163 --> 00:36:12,321
- Roger that.
- And it's coming in fast.

290
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:18,740
Declaring an emergency.

291
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,699
Overspeed, overspeed.

292
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,871
Altitude...

293
00:39:29,732 --> 00:39:31,392
Do you see that?

294
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:07,802
Fly up, fly up.

295
00:40:16,403 --> 00:40:18,479
Is everyone all right?

296
00:40:32,544 --> 00:40:33,742
Are you okay?

297
00:40:43,221 --> 00:40:47,432
Well, I hope this experience
hasn't put any of you off flying.

298
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,601
Statistically speaking,
it's still the safest way to travel.

299
00:40:55,441 --> 00:40:58,146
Superman! Superman! Superman!

300
00:41:06,827 --> 00:41:08,072
Superman!

301
00:42:31,076 --> 00:42:33,068
Okay, everybody, listen up.

302
00:42:33,244 --> 00:42:34,869
I wanna know it all, everything.

303
00:42:35,038 --> 00:42:39,082
Olsen, I wanna see photos of him
everywhere. No, I want the photos.

304
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,037
Sports, how are they gonna get
that plane out of the stadium?

305
00:42:42,211 --> 00:42:45,746
Travel, where did he go?
Was he on vacation? If so, where?

306
00:42:45,923 --> 00:42:49,968
Gossip, has he met somebody?
Fashion, is that a new suit?

307
00:42:50,303 --> 00:42:52,710
Health, has he gained weight?
What's he been eating?

308
00:42:52,889 --> 00:42:56,471
Business, how is this gonna affect
the stock market? Long-term, short-term.

309
00:42:56,642 --> 00:43:01,387
Politics, does he still stand for truth,
justice, all that stuff? Lifestyle:

310
00:43:03,816 --> 00:43:05,725
"Superman Returns."

311
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:11,484
Come on.

312
00:43:15,661 --> 00:43:17,369
Gil, how many F's in "catastrophic"?

313
00:43:17,538 --> 00:43:20,159
None. What's the usage?

314
00:43:20,332 --> 00:43:23,535
"This mysterious electromagnetic pulse
knocked out portable devices...

315
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:26,664
...and entire power grids,
causing a catastrophic event during..."

316
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:28,380
- Lois!
- Yes.

317
00:43:28,548 --> 00:43:30,173
In my office.

318
00:43:31,968 --> 00:43:33,427
This goes for everyone.

319
00:43:33,595 --> 00:43:37,213
The story isn't the blackout,
it's Superman!

320
00:43:38,558 --> 00:43:40,218
The story is the EMP, chief.

321
00:43:40,393 --> 00:43:43,892
Every electronic device
on the East Coast goes dark.

322
00:43:44,063 --> 00:43:46,186
- First, are you okay?
- Yes, thank you.

323
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:49,358
Lois, three things sell papers:
Tragedy, sex and Superman.

324
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:53,110
People are sick of tragedy, we know
you can't write won'th a damn about sex.

325
00:43:53,281 --> 00:43:56,863
That means one thing. That one thing
is Superman. And you know it, Lois.

326
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:58,904
Lois?

327
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:01,779
- Are you all right? You sure?
- Yeah.

328
00:44:01,956 --> 00:44:04,625
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Thank God.

329
00:44:04,792 --> 00:44:07,461
- Where's Jason?
- I don 't know. Isn 't he with you?

330
00:44:07,628 --> 00:44:08,956
- No.
- Well, where is he?

331
00:44:09,129 --> 00:44:10,707
Hi.

332
00:44:14,134 --> 00:44:15,676
Hello.

333
00:44:21,391 --> 00:44:23,051
Who are you?

334
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:27,390
I'm Clark Kent, an old friend of
your mom's from before you were born.

335
00:44:27,939 --> 00:44:30,477
Really? She never mentioned you.

336
00:44:31,193 --> 00:44:32,901
Really? Never?

337
00:44:33,069 --> 00:44:34,350
- No.
- Jason.

338
00:44:35,488 --> 00:44:38,193
- What are you doing here, honey?
- Daddy's office is boring.

339
00:44:38,366 --> 00:44:40,193
Daddy's office is boring?

340
00:44:40,368 --> 00:44:43,037
Clark, hey! Welcome back.

341
00:44:46,332 --> 00:44:49,582
- I see you've already met the munchkin.
- Yeah, we were just talking...

342
00:44:49,752 --> 00:44:51,792
- Did you take vitamins? Eye drops?
- Yes. Yes.

343
00:44:51,963 --> 00:44:54,169
- Albuterol? Poly-Vi-Flor?
- Yes. Yes, Mom.

344
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:57,341
Good boy. He's a little fragile,
but he's gonna grow up...

345
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:59,835
...to be big and strong
like his dad, won't you?

346
00:45:00,012 --> 00:45:01,257
- Yes?
- Yes.

347
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:02,759
Oh, I saw you on the...

348
00:45:02,932 --> 00:45:04,971
Oh, yeah. That was nothing.

349
00:45:05,768 --> 00:45:09,101
- Hey, can I borrow your stapler?
- Oh, yeah.

350
00:45:11,148 --> 00:45:12,773
Thanks.

351
00:45:13,651 --> 00:45:17,518
Congratulations on the Pulitzer.
That's incredible.

352
00:45:17,696 --> 00:45:19,855
Yeah. Can you believe it? It's...

353
00:45:21,784 --> 00:45:23,741
So I wanna hear all about your trip.

354
00:45:23,911 --> 00:45:26,580
Where did you go? What did you see?
Meet anyone special?

355
00:45:26,747 --> 00:45:29,202
Well, there's so much. Where to begin?

356
00:45:29,374 --> 00:45:31,865
Where's the little guy? Hey, kiddo.

357
00:45:33,045 --> 00:45:34,289
- How are you?
- Good.

358
00:45:34,463 --> 00:45:36,539
Can you work some magic
to get your uncle...

359
00:45:36,715 --> 00:45:39,336
...to stop giving me
such a hard time on this article?

360
00:45:39,926 --> 00:45:41,420
- Please?
- Again?

361
00:45:41,595 --> 00:45:43,717
- Again.
- You got it.

362
00:45:44,764 --> 00:45:46,971
- How are you, kiddo?
- Good.

363
00:45:47,142 --> 00:45:48,933
Oh, this is Clark.

364
00:45:50,395 --> 00:45:52,601
- Clark, Richard. Richard, Clark.
- Richard White.

365
00:45:52,772 --> 00:45:54,017
Hi.

366
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:58,567
Richard's an assistant editor here who's
basically saved our International section.

367
00:45:58,736 --> 00:46:01,571
He's also a pilot
and he loves horror movies.

368
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,483
Clark is...

369
00:46:05,117 --> 00:46:07,075
Well, he's Clark.

370
00:46:08,287 --> 00:46:11,122
Well, it's great to finally meet you.
I've heard so much.

371
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:14,244
- Oh, you have?
- Yeah, Jimmy won't shut up about you.

372
00:46:15,294 --> 00:46:16,753
- Gotta run.
- Where?

373
00:46:16,921 --> 00:46:21,167
You heard Perry. Supermars back, and
he thinks I'm the only one equipped to...

374
00:46:21,342 --> 00:46:22,919
To what?

375
00:46:23,093 --> 00:46:25,465
- I don't know, you know.
- So don't listen to him.

376
00:46:25,637 --> 00:46:28,424
I'm not. Going to the power plant
to check out the blackout.

377
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:29,974
Okay.

378
00:46:31,101 --> 00:46:32,429
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

379
00:46:34,271 --> 00:46:36,809
- Bye, Lois.
- And she's gone.

380
00:46:36,982 --> 00:46:39,936
No matter how close we are,
that woman will always be a mystery.

381
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:43,611
If you need anything,
I'm right over there.

382
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,358
Nice to finally meet you.

383
00:46:45,532 --> 00:46:48,735
Where do you wanna go?
Wanna go to the park?

384
00:46:53,957 --> 00:46:57,824
And he's got the whole world
In his hands

385
00:46:58,002 --> 00:47:00,161
He's got the whole world

386
00:47:00,338 --> 00:47:02,911
And he's got the whole world in his...

387
00:47:04,467 --> 00:47:06,756
Oh, he's cute.

388
00:47:25,863 --> 00:47:27,191
Run into trouble?

389
00:47:27,364 --> 00:47:29,606
- Should see the other guy.
- What are we gonna do?

390
00:47:29,783 --> 00:47:31,443
Modify it, attach it to the stern.

391
00:47:31,618 --> 00:47:33,492
I don't care if the instructions
are Russian.

392
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:03,600
- Lois?
- Hey, Clark.

393
00:48:03,775 --> 00:48:05,518
How does it feel to be back at work?

394
00:48:05,693 --> 00:48:09,940
Pretty good. You know,
kind of like riding a bike, I guess.

395
00:48:12,783 --> 00:48:15,701
- A bike?
- Yeah, you know...

396
00:48:16,078 --> 00:48:17,323
Never mind.

397
00:48:17,496 --> 00:48:18,741
But I was wondering...

398
00:48:18,914 --> 00:48:22,117
...since I've gotten back, we haven't
really had a chance to catch up.

399
00:48:22,293 --> 00:48:25,210
I thought maybe, if you'd like,
we could go grab some food...

400
00:48:25,379 --> 00:48:27,502
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

401
00:48:27,673 --> 00:48:31,042
Have you ever met someone and it's like
you're from different worlds...

402
00:48:31,218 --> 00:48:34,918
...but you shared such a connection you
knew you were destined to be together?

403
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:37,589
Then he just takes off
without explaining why...

404
00:48:37,766 --> 00:48:39,509
...or without even saying goodbye?

405
00:48:39,685 --> 00:48:40,883
Sounds cheesy, I know.

406
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,725
- Well, maybe...
- Taxi!

407
00:48:44,898 --> 00:48:47,733
...it was hard to say goodbye
because he had to go...

408
00:48:47,901 --> 00:48:51,270
...and he wanted to say goodbye,
but maybe it was too difficult for him.

409
00:48:51,446 --> 00:48:54,815
Difficult? What's so difficult about it?
"Goodbye." It's easy.

410
00:48:54,991 --> 00:48:57,660
What's so hard about saying goodbye?

411
00:48:57,827 --> 00:48:59,405
Who are we talking about?

412
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:02,414
Nobody, just forget I said anything.

413
00:49:02,582 --> 00:49:04,574
Taxi! Hey!

414
00:49:05,418 --> 00:49:07,042
Taxi!

415
00:49:11,841 --> 00:49:13,584
Wow, thanks.

416
00:49:16,804 --> 00:49:18,631
312 Riverside Drive, please.

417
00:49:19,515 --> 00:49:21,306
Good night, Clark.

418
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:36,196
Superman!

419
00:50:51,104 --> 00:50:52,349
I want egg rolls.

420
00:50:52,522 --> 00:50:56,686
Nice try, kiddo. Only steamed chicken
and snow peas for you.

421
00:50:58,028 --> 00:50:59,937
Why do we order Chinese if he's allergic?

422
00:51:00,113 --> 00:51:01,904
Because he loves the peas...

423
00:51:02,073 --> 00:51:05,442
...and I think we all prefer egg rolls
over macrobiotic shakes.

424
00:51:06,244 --> 00:51:08,153
It's a good point.

425
00:51:21,175 --> 00:51:24,211
So I noticed you've been acting
a little different lately.

426
00:51:24,387 --> 00:51:26,011
Have I?

427
00:51:28,391 --> 00:51:32,519
You know, Lois,
that article that you wrote.

428
00:51:32,686 --> 00:51:34,596
"Why the World
Doesrt Need Superman"?

429
00:51:34,772 --> 00:51:38,639
No, no, no. No, the other one,
from years ago, before we met.

430
00:51:38,817 --> 00:51:42,352
Which article? I wrote dozens about him.
I was practically his press agent.

431
00:51:42,529 --> 00:51:44,438
"I Spent the Night With Superman."

432
00:51:48,744 --> 00:51:50,535
Richard, come on.

433
00:51:50,704 --> 00:51:52,661
It was the title of an interview.

434
00:51:52,998 --> 00:51:54,825
Plus, it was your Uncle Perry's idea.

435
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,036
- No, I know, I know. It's okay, it's okay.
- Richard.

436
00:51:58,628 --> 00:52:00,668
It was a long time ago.

437
00:52:02,757 --> 00:52:04,252
Were you in love with him?

438
00:52:06,511 --> 00:52:10,259
He was Superman.
Everyone was in love with him.

439
00:52:11,558 --> 00:52:12,756
But were you?

440
00:52:21,692 --> 00:52:23,103
No.

441
00:52:23,277 --> 00:52:25,436
Lois, I shouldn 't have brought it up.

442
00:52:46,133 --> 00:52:48,624
Even though you've been
raised as a human being...

443
00:52:48,802 --> 00:52:50,878
...you are not one of them.

444
00:52:55,058 --> 00:52:58,308
They can be a great people, Kal-EI.
They wish to be.

445
00:52:59,354 --> 00:53:02,640
They only lack the light
to show the way.

446
00:53:03,066 --> 00:53:06,815
For this reason above all,
their capacity for good...

447
00:53:06,987 --> 00:53:08,979
...I have sent them you...

448
00:53:09,155 --> 00:53:11,112
...my only son.

449
00:54:25,563 --> 00:54:26,726
Load them up.

450
00:54:54,425 --> 00:54:55,456
Holy sh...

451
00:56:49,203 --> 00:56:51,824
Attention, the Metropolis
Museum of Natural History...

452
00:56:51,997 --> 00:56:54,702
...will be closing in 10 minutes.
We hope that you've...

453
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:56,749
Sir, we're closing in 10 minutes.

454
00:56:56,919 --> 00:56:58,627
We only need five.

455
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,801
You're done, the museum's closed.
Thank you.

456
00:59:09,923 --> 00:59:11,168
Are you all right, miss?

457
00:59:11,341 --> 00:59:14,011
- My heart. L... l...
- I'm sorry?

458
00:59:14,386 --> 00:59:19,463
I have a palpitation,
a heart palpitation. And a murmur.

459
00:59:19,641 --> 00:59:23,010
Please, take me to the hospital.

460
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,227
Take me to the hospital.

461
00:59:36,241 --> 00:59:38,862
Just hold on tight.

462
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,607
Bingo.

463
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:46,683
- There you are, ma'am.
- My heart.

464
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,727
My palpitations, they're gone.
What did you do?

465
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,474
I didn't do anything.

466
01:00:52,648 --> 01:00:54,890
Call me Katherine.

467
01:00:55,067 --> 01:00:58,234
Katherine. I'm glad you're feeling better.

468
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:02,354
- You have places to go, people to save?
- Yes.

469
01:01:06,036 --> 01:01:08,159
Would you like to get
a cup of coffee sometime?

470
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:10,868
- I know that's forward. Or a drink?
- Good night.

471
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:12,701
Good night.

472
01:01:31,561 --> 01:01:33,186
It's like this on every channel.

473
01:01:33,355 --> 01:01:36,225
He was in Manila at 10:55 p.m.
And then spotted...

474
01:01:36,399 --> 01:01:40,148
- Hey, Kent, chief wants to see you.
- Oh, thanks.

475
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:44,269
But as this security footage
from a simple deli robbery proves...

476
01:01:44,449 --> 01:01:47,568
...there's really no feat too big
or too small for the Man of Steel.

477
01:01:47,744 --> 01:01:50,994
Reports are flooding in from Metropolis,
Houston, Gotham and as far...

478
01:01:51,164 --> 01:01:53,915
Satellites have proven
most ineffective at tracking him.

479
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:57,618
He might literally be moving
near the speed of light.

480
01:02:10,849 --> 01:02:13,720
- Our map is illuminated with sightings...
- Kent!

481
01:02:13,894 --> 01:02:16,930
- The chief is waiting.
...on every continent, giving citizens...

482
01:02:20,818 --> 01:02:24,518
These are iconic, and they were taken
by a 12-year-old with a camera phone.

483
01:02:24,696 --> 01:02:27,863
- What do you got, Olsen?
- I got those.

484
01:02:30,118 --> 01:02:31,862
- Look, in the sky, chief.
- It's a bird.

485
01:02:32,037 --> 01:02:33,614
- It's a plane.
- No, look, it's...

486
01:02:34,372 --> 01:02:35,570
You wanted to see me?

487
01:02:36,499 --> 01:02:38,207
Yeah, Kent, come on in. Sit down.

488
01:02:38,376 --> 01:02:41,377
I wanna talk a little strategy. Okay.

489
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,549
First off, Lois, I don't understand
what you're doing...

490
01:02:44,716 --> 01:02:48,001
...sneaking around covering the blackout.
- It wasrt just a blackout.

491
01:02:48,178 --> 01:02:50,170
Cell phones, pagers,
automobiles, airplane...

492
01:02:50,346 --> 01:02:52,802
Every other paper in town
has got a female reporter...

493
01:02:52,974 --> 01:02:56,390
...a good-Iooking female reporter,
stashed on the roof covering Superman.

494
01:02:56,561 --> 01:03:00,226
- And you two are the ones with history.
- Chief, I've done Superman.

495
01:03:01,899 --> 01:03:03,939
Covered him. You know what I mean.

496
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:06,268
Yeah, that makes you an expert.
Do him again.

497
01:03:06,445 --> 01:03:09,232
- There are a dozen other stories out there.
- Yeah? Name one.

498
01:03:09,407 --> 01:03:11,980
Well, there was a museum robbery
last night.

499
01:03:12,493 --> 01:03:15,944
Even Superman missed that one.
He was too busy saving this hooker.

500
01:03:16,121 --> 01:03:18,791
Why don't you guys
track down Lex Luthor?

501
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,741
Well, no one's seen him
since his fifth appeal.

502
01:03:21,919 --> 01:03:24,077
He's got more history
with Superman than anyone.

503
01:03:24,254 --> 01:03:25,748
Maybe he's got something to say.

504
01:03:25,923 --> 01:03:29,671
- Luthor's yesterday's news.
- No, I like that idea.

505
01:03:30,636 --> 01:03:35,178
Perry, Lex Luthor is a career criminal
who nearly killed him, for God's sakes.

506
01:03:35,348 --> 01:03:37,590
Jimmy, how did Lex Luthor
get out of prison?

507
01:03:37,767 --> 01:03:41,765
Well, the appeals court called Superman
as a witness and he wasrt around.

508
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,603
How much do you think
that pisses off Superman?

509
01:03:44,774 --> 01:03:46,399
- Give him to someone else.
- A lot.

510
01:03:46,568 --> 01:03:48,477
- A lot.
- Polly. Give him to Polly.

511
01:03:53,616 --> 01:03:55,158
Lois, Superman.

512
01:03:55,326 --> 01:03:57,533
- What about the blackout?
- Kent, blackout.

513
01:04:00,123 --> 01:04:02,448
Great. Thanks, chief.

514
01:04:05,586 --> 01:04:10,414
Lois, I'm sorry. I'd hate if this
damaged our relationship.

515
01:04:11,759 --> 01:04:12,874
Relationship?

516
01:04:13,636 --> 01:04:15,046
- Yeah.
- Hi, Mommy.

517
01:04:15,221 --> 01:04:17,094
- Hi, you.
- Hey, guys.

518
01:04:17,264 --> 01:04:21,048
He got an A in science, but a D in gym,
so we're doing something right.

519
01:04:21,226 --> 01:04:23,219
- Yeah, at least one of us is.
- What?

520
01:04:23,395 --> 01:04:26,230
It's Perry. He just shoved Superman
back into my life.

521
01:04:26,398 --> 01:04:29,352
Well, honey, I'm sure you can
find a way to interview Superman...

522
01:04:29,526 --> 01:04:31,519
...without bringing him
back into your life.

523
01:04:31,695 --> 01:04:35,989
There's really no way around it, folks.
Superman is back in all of our lives.

524
01:04:37,451 --> 01:04:39,242
We're coming to you from Sydney...

525
01:04:39,411 --> 01:04:43,195
...where people have gathered
on these rooftops to scour the sky...

526
01:04:43,373 --> 01:04:46,576
Okay, how about this?
We'll stay late. We'll get dinner.

527
01:04:46,751 --> 01:04:50,369
I'll help with Superman, and you and
Clark can work on the blackout together.

528
01:04:50,547 --> 01:04:53,501
- Is that all right with you, Clark?
- Swell.

529
01:05:17,406 --> 01:05:21,451
I was gonna pretend
the brakes were out.

530
01:05:21,619 --> 01:05:24,738
Pretend. Like we talked about.

531
01:05:24,913 --> 01:05:27,701
You didn't actually have to cut them!

532
01:05:27,875 --> 01:05:29,155
Of course I did.

533
01:05:29,334 --> 01:05:34,162
A man can always tell when a woman
is pretending, especially Superman.

534
01:05:39,052 --> 01:05:41,424
So did you get your rock?

535
01:05:42,806 --> 01:05:44,715
I did.

536
01:05:46,101 --> 01:05:50,145
U.S. Coast Guard issuing a small-craft
advisory for the Metropolis ocean area.

537
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:52,140
High-wind advisory is in effect...

538
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:55,186
...ocean currents and tides
becoming increasingly dangerous.

539
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:58,563
All warnings lasting
until later this evening.

540
01:05:58,738 --> 01:05:59,983
Security, security.

541
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:05,612
This is U.S. Coast Guard issuing
a small-craft advisory for northeast seas.

542
01:06:05,787 --> 01:06:10,247
Winds reaching 50 miles per hour,
high tides in the morning.

543
01:06:10,416 --> 01:06:12,243
Waves reaching 20 to 30 feet.

544
01:06:12,418 --> 01:06:16,416
This warning is in effect for
all small crafts for the next four hours.

545
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:42,153
Weird. If these times are right...

546
01:06:42,322 --> 01:06:45,406
...the blackout spread
from a specific origin point.

547
01:06:45,575 --> 01:06:46,951
Where?

548
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:48,910
I'm not sure yet.

549
01:06:49,621 --> 01:06:53,286
With the super-hearing, does he hear each
sound by itself or everything at once?

550
01:06:53,667 --> 01:06:54,912
Both.

551
01:06:55,085 --> 01:06:57,291
- He's certainly taller than I thought.
- 6'4".

552
01:06:57,462 --> 01:07:01,210
I love that he can see through anything.
I'd have fun with that.

553
01:07:01,591 --> 01:07:03,299
Anything but lead.

554
01:07:06,554 --> 01:07:07,799
- I bet he's...
- 225 pounds...

555
01:07:07,972 --> 01:07:09,632
...faster than a speeding bullet...

556
01:07:09,807 --> 01:07:13,259
...draws his power from the sun,
invulnerable to anything but kryptonite...

557
01:07:13,436 --> 01:07:15,475
...and he never lies.
- Kryptonite?

558
01:07:15,646 --> 01:07:17,971
Radioactive pieces of his home world.

559
01:07:18,149 --> 01:07:20,355
It's deadly. To him.

560
01:07:24,947 --> 01:07:28,316
Lois, how tall would you say Clark is?

561
01:07:29,868 --> 01:07:31,861
About 6'3", 6'4".

562
01:07:32,037 --> 01:07:34,824
About 200, 215 pounds?

563
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:48,797
Jimmy, Jason, let's go get these intrepid
reporters something to keep them going.

564
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:50,844
- Burritos!
- Come here, canead.

565
01:07:52,349 --> 01:07:56,298
We're going this way. Do they have
anything other than burritos?

566
01:07:57,187 --> 01:07:59,512
I think they have fries and burgers.

567
01:07:59,689 --> 01:08:02,180
So have you found a place to live yet?

568
01:08:02,358 --> 01:08:03,936
No. I'm still looking.

569
01:08:04,694 --> 01:08:07,185
You know, Lois, I wanted to ask you
about that artic...

570
01:08:07,363 --> 01:08:10,863
Hey, I'm gonna run downstairs
for some fresh air. Great!

571
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:26,338
Thanks.

572
01:08:34,139 --> 01:08:36,891
- Let's talk when I get back.
- Sure.

573
01:09:30,403 --> 01:09:33,154
You know, you really
shouldn't smoke, Miss Lane.

574
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:38,941
- Sorry. Didrt mean to startle you.
- I'm fine. Really.

575
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,199
I just wasrt expecting you.

576
01:09:44,875 --> 01:09:46,453
With all the press on the plane...

577
01:09:46,627 --> 01:09:49,034
...I wasrt sure it was
the best time for us to talk.

578
01:09:49,213 --> 01:09:52,379
Well, there's no press around now.
Except for me, of course.

579
01:09:54,593 --> 01:09:57,048
I know people are asking questions
now that I'm back.

580
01:09:57,429 --> 01:10:00,964
I think it's only fair
that I answer those people.

581
01:10:02,642 --> 01:10:05,976
So you're here for an interview?

582
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:08,261
Okay, then.

583
01:10:12,152 --> 01:10:14,144
- Where did I put that thing?
- Right pocket.

584
01:10:20,284 --> 01:10:22,989
Let's start with the big question.

585
01:10:23,162 --> 01:10:25,653
- Where'd you go?
- To Krypton.

586
01:10:25,832 --> 01:10:28,204
But you told me it was destroyed.
Ages ago.

587
01:10:28,376 --> 01:10:29,834
It was.

588
01:10:30,002 --> 01:10:32,374
But when astronomers
thought they found it...

589
01:10:33,839 --> 01:10:36,211
...I had to see for myself.

590
01:10:39,845 --> 01:10:43,677
Well, you're back, and everyone
seems to be pretty happy about it.

591
01:10:46,894 --> 01:10:48,352
Not everyone.

592
01:10:49,521 --> 01:10:51,929
- I read the article, Lois.
- So did a lot of people.

593
01:10:52,107 --> 01:10:55,061
- Tomorrow they're giving me the Pulitzer...
- Why did you write it?

594
01:10:56,737 --> 01:10:58,776
How could you leave us like that?

595
01:11:00,282 --> 01:11:02,689
I moved on. So did the rest of us.

596
01:11:03,201 --> 01:11:04,695
That's why I wrote it.

597
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:07,657
The world doesn't need a savior.

598
01:11:08,081 --> 01:11:09,990
And neither do I.

599
01:11:25,139 --> 01:11:26,218
Lois.

600
01:11:27,934 --> 01:11:30,389
Will you come with me?

601
01:11:32,146 --> 01:11:33,724
Why?

602
01:11:34,106 --> 01:11:36,229
There's something I wanna show you.

603
01:11:42,489 --> 01:11:44,281
Please.

604
01:11:55,294 --> 01:11:57,452
I can't be gone long.

605
01:11:57,629 --> 01:11:59,538
You won't be.

606
01:12:11,935 --> 01:12:14,686
Clark said the reason you left
without saying goodbye...

607
01:12:14,854 --> 01:12:17,143
...is because it was
too unbearable for you.

608
01:12:17,315 --> 01:12:19,936
Personally, I think that's a load of crap.

609
01:12:20,527 --> 01:12:23,693
- Clark?
- He's just a guy I work with.

610
01:12:24,781 --> 01:12:26,904
Maybe Clark's right.

611
01:12:30,286 --> 01:12:32,409
You know, my...

612
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:37,621
Richard, he's a pilot.
He takes me up all the time.

613
01:12:38,794 --> 01:12:40,787
Not like this.

614
01:12:55,644 --> 01:12:58,052
I forgot how warm you were.

615
01:13:28,676 --> 01:13:30,170
Listen.

616
01:13:31,054 --> 01:13:32,963
What do you hear?

617
01:13:33,681 --> 01:13:34,926
Nothing.

618
01:13:38,853 --> 01:13:40,596
I hear everything.

619
01:13:44,066 --> 01:13:46,688
You wrote that the world
doesn't need a savior...

620
01:13:48,028 --> 01:13:51,362
...but every day
I hear people crying for one.

621
01:14:04,211 --> 01:14:06,880
I'm sorry I left you, Lois.

622
01:14:10,759 --> 01:14:12,798
I'll take you back now.

623
01:16:25,932 --> 01:16:27,557
Richard's a good man.

624
01:16:30,979 --> 01:16:33,185
And you've been gone a long time.

625
01:16:35,858 --> 01:16:37,436
I know.

626
01:16:42,198 --> 01:16:43,526
L...

627
01:16:48,746 --> 01:16:50,739
So will I see you around?

628
01:16:51,749 --> 01:16:53,742
I'm always around.

629
01:16:55,044 --> 01:16:56,752
Good night, Lois.

630
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:19,598
We're having beef, honey. Do you want
the tofu wrap or the veggie wrap?

631
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:24,982
You all right?

632
01:17:26,825 --> 01:17:28,236
Where have you been?

633
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:38,251
I was up on the roof, getting some air.

634
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,877
Tell the truth now.

635
01:17:47,428 --> 01:17:48,591
Were you smoking?

636
01:17:51,224 --> 01:17:52,967
No.

637
01:18:01,775 --> 01:18:02,974
Is this real?

638
01:18:04,028 --> 01:18:05,901
- Where'd you find him?
- He found me.

639
01:18:06,071 --> 01:18:08,858
Oh, this is great. I can't wait to read it.

640
01:18:09,033 --> 01:18:11,440
So, Mr. White, about the blackout...

641
01:18:11,618 --> 01:18:14,109
Lois, this is the biggest night
of your life.

642
01:18:14,288 --> 01:18:16,446
Have you picked out a dress?
Something snazzy?

643
01:18:17,457 --> 01:18:20,162
It just feels a little weird
winning for that article.

644
01:18:20,335 --> 01:18:23,372
- It just doesn't seem right.
- What doesn't seem right?

645
01:18:23,547 --> 01:18:27,129
Winning an award for an article called
"Why the World Doesrt Need Superman."

646
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:29,756
When, according
to this newspaper, they do.

647
01:18:29,928 --> 01:18:32,845
Lois, Pulitzer Prizes
are like Academy Awards.

648
01:18:33,014 --> 01:18:36,134
Nobody remembers what you got one for.
It's just that you got one.

649
01:18:36,309 --> 01:18:39,429
- But...
- This is your night. You enjoy it.

650
01:18:39,604 --> 01:18:42,142
I'm sure Kent's on the blackout.

651
01:19:42,796 --> 01:19:45,002
Department of Water and Power, please.

652
01:19:45,716 --> 01:19:46,996
7782, great.

653
01:19:48,468 --> 01:19:49,962
Metropolis Public Works.

654
01:19:50,137 --> 01:19:52,628
Hi, Stephen, Lois Lane
from the Daily Planet. Blackout?

655
01:19:52,806 --> 01:19:55,511
I just need a little info
on a few outstanding power grids.

656
01:19:55,684 --> 01:19:57,308
Yeah, I do have it here, actually.

657
01:19:57,477 --> 01:20:01,475
So the uptown grid went dark at 12:36
and midtown 10 seconds before.

658
01:20:01,648 --> 01:20:03,142
Which grid was hit first?

659
01:20:03,316 --> 01:20:04,645
It just reads Vanderwon'th.

660
01:20:04,818 --> 01:20:07,190
- Across the river?
- 6 Springwood Drive.

661
01:20:07,362 --> 01:20:09,604
6 Springwood Drive.
A residence or a business?

662
01:20:09,781 --> 01:20:11,524
- Residence.
- Sure? Nothing before that?

663
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:14,025
- That's all it shows.
- Thank you very much.

664
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:17,151
Oh, Jason.

665
01:20:23,962 --> 01:20:27,165
- There's your mom, Jason.
- You're late, Mommy.

666
01:20:35,390 --> 01:20:38,225
Where are we? Is this the Pulitzer?

667
01:20:38,393 --> 01:20:42,686
Nope. I've just gotta ask these people
a few questions and then we can go.

668
01:20:56,994 --> 01:20:59,367
Can I stay in the car?

669
01:20:59,914 --> 01:21:01,492
No, honey.

670
01:21:08,172 --> 01:21:12,549
- Are we trespassing?
- No. Yes.

671
01:21:27,274 --> 01:21:29,101
Hello?

672
01:22:00,599 --> 01:22:02,141
Hello?

673
01:22:13,236 --> 01:22:15,810
I like the curly one.

674
01:22:23,121 --> 01:22:25,956
Let's go. This was a bad idea.

675
01:22:41,681 --> 01:22:43,473
Lex Luthor.

676
01:22:45,477 --> 01:22:47,600
Lois Lane?

677
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:54,730
You're bald.

678
01:23:14,839 --> 01:23:16,214
And what is your name?

679
01:23:16,382 --> 01:23:18,838
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

680
01:23:19,343 --> 01:23:21,301
- Cute kid, and smart.
- Thanks.

681
01:23:21,471 --> 01:23:24,674
We're not really strangers, are we?
This is kind of a little reunion.

682
01:23:24,849 --> 01:23:26,888
Heck, I'm a fan.

683
01:23:27,059 --> 01:23:28,554
I love your writing...

684
01:23:29,395 --> 01:23:31,222
...and your dress.
- I love your boat.

685
01:23:31,397 --> 01:23:34,018
How'd you get it?
Swindle some widow out of her money?

686
01:23:35,359 --> 01:23:37,601
That's funny. Didrt you win
the Pulitzer Prize...

687
01:23:37,778 --> 01:23:41,361
...for my favorite article of all time, " Why
the World Doesrt Need Superman"?

688
01:23:41,532 --> 01:23:45,446
Didrt you have a few more years to go
on that double life sentence?

689
01:23:45,619 --> 01:23:47,861
Yes, well, we can thank
the Man of Steel for that.

690
01:23:48,039 --> 01:23:51,324
I mean, he's really good at swooping in
and catching the bad guys...

691
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:55,035
...but he's not so hot at the little things,
like Miranda rights...

692
01:23:55,212 --> 01:23:59,921
...due process, making your court date.

693
01:24:00,092 --> 01:24:02,548
Did you have anything to do
with the blackout?

694
01:24:05,556 --> 01:24:07,762
Are you fishing for an interview,
Miss Lane?

695
01:24:07,933 --> 01:24:10,092
It's been a while
since you've been a headline.

696
01:24:10,269 --> 01:24:12,427
Maybe it's time
people knew your name again.

697
01:24:13,105 --> 01:24:17,055
How about we turn this boat around,
call a cab for my son...

698
01:24:17,609 --> 01:24:20,231
...and then you can do
whatever you want with me.

699
01:24:20,946 --> 01:24:23,484
No, I don't think we'll be
turning around, Miss Lane...

700
01:24:23,657 --> 01:24:26,278
...which means that
we do have some time to kill.

701
01:24:28,453 --> 01:24:30,327
How about that interview?

702
01:24:31,248 --> 01:24:34,581
Yeah, just call me if you hear anything.
Okay. Thank you.

703
01:24:34,751 --> 01:24:36,459
So, what did the school say?

704
01:24:36,628 --> 01:24:38,122
She picked him up at 3: 15.

705
01:24:42,384 --> 01:24:45,669
- Hi, I heard about Lois.
- Yes, come in, Clark, come in.

706
01:24:45,846 --> 01:24:48,337
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yeah, you're a reporter.

707
01:24:48,515 --> 01:24:51,267
- Help Richard track her down.
- I'll check her computer.

708
01:24:51,435 --> 01:24:52,680
Excuse me, Clark.

709
01:25:06,408 --> 01:25:09,492
What do you know about crystals?

710
01:25:09,661 --> 01:25:11,369
They make great chandeliers.

711
01:25:11,955 --> 01:25:16,949
This crystal may seem unremarkable,
but so is the seed of a redwood tree.

712
01:25:17,127 --> 01:25:20,542
It's how our mutual friend in tights
made his Arctic getaway spot.

713
01:25:20,714 --> 01:25:22,587
Cute. It's a little small for my taste.

714
01:25:22,757 --> 01:25:24,299
You're building an island?

715
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:28,843
You're not seeing
the big picture here, Miss Lane.

716
01:25:29,013 --> 01:25:31,302
Let me enlarge it for you.

717
01:25:33,893 --> 01:25:37,309
Not just an island,
an entirely new continent.

718
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:40,730
An extinct world, reborn on our own.

719
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:42,311
Why?

720
01:25:45,321 --> 01:25:47,230
Land, Miss Lane.

721
01:25:47,407 --> 01:25:50,158
I mean... Kitty, what did my father
used to say to me?

722
01:25:50,326 --> 01:25:51,737
"You're losing your hair"?

723
01:25:52,745 --> 01:25:54,654
- Before that.
- "Get out"?

724
01:25:56,207 --> 01:25:58,496
He said, " You can print money...

725
01:25:58,668 --> 01:26:01,289
...manufacture diamonds,
and people are a dime a dozen...

726
01:26:01,462 --> 01:26:04,546
...but they'll always need land."

727
01:26:04,715 --> 01:26:07,550
It's the one thing
they're not making any more of.

728
01:26:08,094 --> 01:26:10,466
But the United States...

729
01:26:12,181 --> 01:26:15,680
Will be underwater.

730
01:26:16,102 --> 01:26:17,679
It's simple physics, Miss Lane.

731
01:26:17,853 --> 01:26:20,640
Two objects cannot occupy
the same space at the same time.

732
01:26:20,815 --> 01:26:23,353
And the rest of the world
will just let you keep it?

733
01:26:23,526 --> 01:26:25,732
- They'Il...
- They'II...

734
01:26:26,237 --> 01:26:27,695
...what?

735
01:26:27,863 --> 01:26:30,734
I'll have advanced alien technology...

736
01:26:30,908 --> 01:26:33,944
...thousands of years beyond
what anyone could throw at me.

737
01:26:34,119 --> 01:26:36,159
Bring it on!

738
01:26:37,164 --> 01:26:39,073
And eventually...

739
01:26:39,249 --> 01:26:41,575
...the rest of the world
will be begging me...

740
01:26:41,752 --> 01:26:44,373
...for a piece of high-tech
beachfront property.

741
01:26:44,546 --> 01:26:46,872
In fact, they'll pay
through the nose for it.

742
01:26:47,299 --> 01:26:49,043
But millions of people will die.

743
01:26:49,218 --> 01:26:51,839
Billions! Once again,
the press underestimates me.

744
01:26:52,012 --> 01:26:54,384
This is front-page news.

745
01:26:55,057 --> 01:26:57,049
Come on, let me hear you say it
just once.

746
01:26:57,226 --> 01:27:01,722
- You're insane.
- No! Not that. No, the other thing.

747
01:27:01,897 --> 01:27:05,562
It's dangling off the tip of your tongue.
Let me hear it just once, please?

748
01:27:05,734 --> 01:27:08,735
- Superman will never...
- Wrong!

749
01:27:21,958 --> 01:27:23,583
What is that?

750
01:27:24,795 --> 01:27:27,582
I think you know exactly what this is.

751
01:27:33,595 --> 01:27:36,465
Mind over muscle, Miss Lane.

752
01:27:37,599 --> 01:27:39,390
Mind...

753
01:27:46,941 --> 01:27:48,934
Who is that boy's father?

754
01:27:50,445 --> 01:27:52,319
Richard.

755
01:27:52,781 --> 01:27:56,280
Mr. Luthor, we're approaching
the coordinates.

756
01:27:56,868 --> 01:27:58,446
Are you sure?

757
01:27:58,620 --> 01:28:03,958
Yes, sir. Latitude 40 degrees north,
longitude 73 degrees west.

758
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:27,638
Don't let them leave this room.

759
01:28:27,982 --> 01:28:30,555
Kitty, come with me.
You're not gonna want to miss this.

760
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:45,015
- Damn it.
- What?

761
01:29:45,183 --> 01:29:46,381
She has a password.

762
01:29:48,395 --> 01:29:49,972
"Jason."

763
01:29:52,065 --> 01:29:53,773
"Richard."

764
01:29:55,694 --> 01:29:57,271
Try "Superman."

765
01:30:02,409 --> 01:30:04,816
"Superman." Great.

766
01:30:13,169 --> 01:30:15,245
Don't touch that, honey.

767
01:30:19,509 --> 01:30:21,965
Why don't you go play the piano.

768
01:32:19,211 --> 01:32:21,702
Come on, come on, come on.

769
01:34:08,777 --> 01:34:11,814
Lex, this isn't like the train set.

770
01:34:13,741 --> 01:34:15,484
I know.

771
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:23,331
Come on, come on.

772
01:34:23,959 --> 01:34:25,157
Come on.

773
01:35:53,089 --> 01:35:54,963
- Honey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

774
01:35:55,133 --> 01:35:57,125
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

775
01:35:58,344 --> 01:36:01,096
Open this door! Open it!

776
01:36:16,445 --> 01:36:18,817
Could you help Mommy open the door?

777
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:23,444
I'm sorry.

778
01:36:26,539 --> 01:36:28,615
It's gonna be okay.

779
01:36:28,791 --> 01:36:31,116
Okay? It's gonna be okay.

780
01:36:50,813 --> 01:36:54,264
We had a little problem downstairs.

781
01:36:54,817 --> 01:36:56,975
Brutus is dead.

782
01:36:57,653 --> 01:37:00,903
He got hit with the piano.

783
01:37:05,494 --> 01:37:07,368
Where's the boy?

784
01:37:07,537 --> 01:37:11,666
With the mother,
locked up in the pantry.

785
01:37:13,835 --> 01:37:15,994
Oh, it's time for us to go.

786
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:24,501
My camera's not working.

787
01:37:25,305 --> 01:37:27,428
And my phone's not working.

788
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:35,230
- Okay, I'm good.
- That was weird.

789
01:37:50,205 --> 01:37:52,530
Hey, guys.
This just came through the fax.

790
01:37:52,707 --> 01:37:54,996
It's Lois' handwriting,
I'd recognize it anywhere.

791
01:37:55,168 --> 01:37:56,995
I just... No idea
what the numbers mean.

792
01:37:57,170 --> 01:37:58,913
- They're coordinates.
- Coordinates.

793
01:38:01,049 --> 01:38:02,247
That's just off the coast.

794
01:38:02,425 --> 01:38:05,545
Jimmy, tell Perry I'm taking the seaplane.
Keep trying her cell.

795
01:40:09,718 --> 01:40:11,176
What are these, lottery numbers?

796
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:13,712
I think they're coordinates, chief.

797
01:40:52,427 --> 01:40:53,589
Chief...

798
01:41:20,496 --> 01:41:22,785
Come on! Move it!

799
01:43:46,474 --> 01:43:48,217
Chief!

800
01:43:59,361 --> 01:44:01,769
Great Caesar's ghost.

801
01:46:08,739 --> 01:46:10,862
- Daddy.
- Oh, my God.

802
01:46:24,463 --> 01:46:25,874
How did you get here?

803
01:46:26,048 --> 01:46:27,708
I flew.

804
01:46:31,387 --> 01:46:33,214
Look out!

805
01:46:46,068 --> 01:46:47,776
Mom!

806
01:46:47,945 --> 01:46:50,068
Mom! Mom!

807
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:51,614
Jason, come here! Jason!

808
01:46:54,493 --> 01:46:56,402
Come here! Watch your head!
Come here!

809
01:47:56,930 --> 01:47:58,721
Mommy! Mom!

810
01:48:00,642 --> 01:48:01,887
Jason!

811
01:48:05,355 --> 01:48:06,849
Jason, hold on!

812
01:48:09,984 --> 01:48:12,654
- Have you got him?
- I got him! Go!

813
01:48:15,073 --> 01:48:16,650
Hold on! Hold on!

814
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:32,709
- Mommy!
- Give him to me!

815
01:48:32,882 --> 01:48:34,459
Mommy!

816
01:48:35,092 --> 01:48:37,002
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Come on, Jason! Come on!

817
01:48:40,848 --> 01:48:43,683
- Lois! Lois!
- Mommy!

818
01:49:48,165 --> 01:49:50,241
Jason, get on my back.

819
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:21,940
Give me your hand.

820
01:50:29,372 --> 01:50:31,661
- Have you got them?
- Yeah.

821
01:50:50,768 --> 01:50:52,677
Get buckled in!

822
01:51:11,706 --> 01:51:13,579
She'll be fine.

823
01:51:16,335 --> 01:51:17,711
I can't take off in this.

824
01:51:17,878 --> 01:51:21,828
- I'll point you in the right direction.
- Thank you.

825
01:52:21,108 --> 01:52:22,899
See anything familiar?

826
01:52:28,907 --> 01:52:31,315
I see an old mars sick joke.

827
01:52:31,827 --> 01:52:35,242
Really? Because I see
my new apartment...

828
01:52:35,413 --> 01:52:38,450
...and a place for Kitty,
one for my friends...

829
01:52:38,625 --> 01:52:41,579
...and that place over there, I'll rent out.

830
01:52:46,091 --> 01:52:50,302
But, you know, maybe you're right.
You know, maybe it is a little cold.

831
01:52:50,470 --> 01:52:54,420
It's... What's the word I'm searching for?
It's a little...

832
01:52:55,058 --> 01:52:56,766
...alien.

833
01:52:57,769 --> 01:53:01,601
It lacks that human touch.

834
01:53:04,567 --> 01:53:07,272
You have something that belongs to me.

835
01:53:24,796 --> 01:53:28,081
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

836
01:53:28,257 --> 01:53:29,835
Do you copy?

837
01:53:30,676 --> 01:53:34,176
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

838
01:53:34,347 --> 01:53:36,672
Do you copy? Damn it!

839
01:53:36,849 --> 01:53:40,467
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

840
01:53:40,645 --> 01:53:42,471
Do you copy?

841
01:53:44,357 --> 01:53:47,026
Lois! Are you all right?

842
01:53:47,443 --> 01:53:50,812
Yeah. What happened?

843
01:53:51,947 --> 01:53:54,569
- Superman.
- Where is he?

844
01:53:56,076 --> 01:53:57,321
He went back.

845
01:53:59,955 --> 01:54:02,162
- Richard, we have to turn around.
- What? No.

846
01:54:02,333 --> 01:54:04,954
- We have to turn around!
- We barely made it out of there.

847
01:54:05,127 --> 01:54:07,700
- Now you want me to go back?
- Yes, please!

848
01:54:08,464 --> 01:54:10,291
He'll die.

849
01:54:13,302 --> 01:54:15,176
All right, hold on.

850
01:54:32,696 --> 01:54:34,523
Kryptonite.

851
01:54:39,661 --> 01:54:41,618
You're asking yourself, "How?"

852
01:54:43,415 --> 01:54:48,373
Didrt your dad ever teach you
to look before you leap?

853
01:54:52,424 --> 01:54:55,378
Crystals. They're amazing, aren't they?

854
01:54:55,552 --> 01:54:58,802
They inerit the traits
of the minerals around them...

855
01:54:58,972 --> 01:55:03,764
...kind of like a son
ineriting the traits of his father!

856
01:55:06,563 --> 01:55:11,557
You took away five years of my life,
I'm just returning the favor!

857
01:55:15,071 --> 01:55:18,108
I'm still Superman!

858
01:55:26,749 --> 01:55:30,165
Get up! Come on!

859
01:57:02,219 --> 01:57:04,212
Now, fly.

860
01:58:05,323 --> 01:58:08,277
So long, Superman.

861
01:58:10,745 --> 01:58:13,829
Your leadership can stir others...

862
01:58:13,998 --> 01:58:16,157
...to their own capacities
for moral betterment.

863
01:58:16,334 --> 01:58:19,288
The human heart is still subject
to monstrous deceits.

864
01:58:22,924 --> 01:58:25,794
Our destruction could have been avoided.
At this very moment...

865
01:58:25,968 --> 01:58:27,593
...I could embrace you in my arms.

866
01:58:27,762 --> 01:58:30,169
Your help would be called for endlessly.
Remember me.

867
01:58:30,348 --> 01:58:33,681
Even for those tasks which human beings
could solve themselves.

868
01:58:44,111 --> 01:58:46,946
Remember me, Kal-EI.

869
01:58:47,114 --> 01:58:49,023
Remember me.

870
01:58:57,917 --> 01:58:59,660
Supermars down there.

871
01:59:00,669 --> 01:59:03,042
- You sure?
- Yeah.

872
01:59:13,515 --> 01:59:16,137
- Richard!
- Yeah, I saw him. Strap in.

873
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:46,671
Lois!

874
01:59:48,008 --> 01:59:49,799
Don't move.

875
02:00:35,889 --> 02:00:37,928
Come on, come on, come on.

876
02:00:41,686 --> 02:00:43,394
Richard!

877
02:00:43,563 --> 02:00:44,938
I'm trying! It's too choppy!

878
02:00:54,073 --> 02:00:55,651
Oh, my God.

879
02:02:43,348 --> 02:02:45,341
How did you find me?

880
02:02:50,855 --> 02:02:52,480
Thank you.

881
02:03:07,455 --> 02:03:09,364
What are you doing?

882
02:03:12,543 --> 02:03:13,788
I have to go back.

883
02:03:16,506 --> 02:03:18,249
You're hurt!

884
02:03:28,726 --> 02:03:30,386
Goodbye, Lois.

885
02:04:40,797 --> 02:04:43,123
The technology on Krypton,
Superman 's home world...

886
02:04:43,300 --> 02:04:45,625
...was based on manipulating
the growth of crystals.

887
02:04:45,802 --> 02:04:47,178
Sounds like hocus-pocus to me.

888
02:04:47,346 --> 02:04:51,177
Well, naturally, to the primitive mind,
any sufficiently advanced technology...

889
02:04:51,349 --> 02:04:53,307
...would be indistinguishable from magic.

890
02:04:53,477 --> 02:04:56,892
But imagine: Cities, vehicles, weapons...

891
02:04:57,063 --> 02:04:59,554
...entire continents, all grown.

892
02:04:59,733 --> 02:05:01,476
Lex?

893
02:05:03,320 --> 02:05:06,439
Are billions of people really going to die?

894
02:05:12,954 --> 02:05:14,662
Yes.

895
02:05:42,025 --> 02:05:43,353
Lex, what's happening?

896
02:05:49,323 --> 02:05:50,948
Go, go, go. Get to the helicopter.

897
02:05:53,828 --> 02:05:56,200
Go! Out, out! Now!

898
02:05:59,375 --> 02:06:02,542
No, no, no, take nothing!
Take nothing! Go, go!

899
02:06:04,463 --> 02:06:06,041
Got it.

900
02:06:50,175 --> 02:06:51,753
Here.

901
02:07:15,659 --> 02:07:17,616
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry!

902
02:07:17,786 --> 02:07:19,364
No!

903
02:07:38,932 --> 02:07:42,515
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry!

904
02:11:42,089 --> 02:11:43,583
Watch it.

905
02:11:44,967 --> 02:11:47,173
- Clear a path.
- Clear the way.

906
02:11:47,720 --> 02:11:49,344
- Move!
- Trauma One.

907
02:11:50,723 --> 02:11:53,048
- Where we going?
- Trauma One. Here it is.

908
02:11:58,897 --> 02:12:00,605
Watch it!

909
02:12:08,448 --> 02:12:09,824
Got him!

910
02:12:13,495 --> 02:12:14,870
Okay, I think I got it.

911
02:12:19,459 --> 02:12:22,294
Penetrating side wound
to right part of lower back.

912
02:12:23,630 --> 02:12:24,793
No hemorrhage.

913
02:12:29,469 --> 02:12:30,798
Shock at 200.

914
02:12:30,971 --> 02:12:32,797
Is that enough? He's not human.

915
02:12:32,973 --> 02:12:34,633
All right, charge to three, 360.

916
02:12:34,808 --> 02:12:36,385
Clear!

917
02:13:07,048 --> 02:13:08,328
It's kind of morbid, Perry.

918
02:13:09,175 --> 02:13:11,631
Always be prepared.

919
02:13:14,013 --> 02:13:15,721
How is she?

920
02:13:35,243 --> 02:13:38,243
Thank you. Thanks, baby.

921
02:13:41,040 --> 02:13:42,285
- Lois?
- Yeah.

922
02:13:44,460 --> 02:13:46,369
We can leave whenever you're ready.

923
02:13:46,545 --> 02:13:48,123
I mean...

924
02:13:49,715 --> 02:13:51,708
...you don't have to be here.

925
02:13:52,927 --> 02:13:54,754
Where else would I be?

926
02:13:54,929 --> 02:13:58,463
Police have surrounded the area in order
to control thousands of visitors...

927
02:13:58,641 --> 02:14:00,550
...who have arrived
to show their support.

928
02:14:00,726 --> 02:14:02,517
Many are carrying signs and banners...

929
02:14:02,686 --> 02:14:04,097
I could drive.

930
02:14:04,271 --> 02:14:06,727
- No official announcements
over the past few hours...

931
02:14:06,899 --> 02:14:09,472
...but unconfirmed reports
from inside tell us...

932
02:14:09,652 --> 02:14:11,443
...the Man of Steel lies in a coma...

933
02:14:11,612 --> 02:14:16,155
...his condition unchanged
since he was admitted late yesterday.

934
02:14:21,330 --> 02:14:24,580
- Doctors have been vigilant in their...
- Foreign exchange markets...

935
02:14:25,042 --> 02:14:28,078
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.

936
02:14:28,253 --> 02:14:31,124
I'd be careful down there, guys.
It's a madhouse.

937
02:14:40,849 --> 02:14:43,969
- So much for parking.
- Do you think I can get in?

938
02:14:44,728 --> 02:14:47,599
You're Lois Lane. They'll let you in.

939
02:14:48,565 --> 02:14:51,400
I wanna go with Mommy.

940
02:15:12,589 --> 02:15:14,249
Taxi.

941
02:15:14,424 --> 02:15:15,883
I'll be right here.

942
02:15:23,183 --> 02:15:25,306
Watch your head, okay? Here we go.

943
02:15:57,383 --> 02:15:59,340
This way, Miss Lane.

944
02:16:21,532 --> 02:16:24,533
Mommy? Is he gonna get better?

945
02:16:26,579 --> 02:16:29,200
- I don't know.
- I want him to.

946
02:16:30,666 --> 02:16:32,872
I like him.

947
02:16:35,588 --> 02:16:37,248
Me too.

948
02:17:08,412 --> 02:17:11,199
I don't know if you can hear me.

949
02:17:13,834 --> 02:17:17,333
They say sometimes
that when people are...

950
02:17:20,340 --> 02:17:23,092
That sometimes they can hear you.

951
02:17:29,391 --> 02:17:31,633
I don't know if you can hear me.

952
02:17:40,610 --> 02:17:43,184
I wanted to tell you...

953
02:18:38,501 --> 02:18:40,410
Come on, honey.

954
02:19:24,129 --> 02:19:26,205
Step back, please!

955
02:19:43,398 --> 02:19:47,147
Lex, we only have six of those!

956
02:19:49,029 --> 02:19:50,309
Six?

957
02:19:54,117 --> 02:19:58,447
I would trade 300,000 coconuts...

958
02:19:58,622 --> 02:20:00,947
...and every ounce of your blood...

959
02:20:01,124 --> 02:20:05,751
...for a quart of gasoline!

960
02:20:06,504 --> 02:20:09,174
But what will we have to eat?

961
02:22:45,328 --> 02:22:47,368
You will be different.

962
02:22:51,042 --> 02:22:53,996
Sometimes, you will feel like an outcast.

963
02:22:55,171 --> 02:22:57,876
But you'll never be alone.

964
02:23:00,260 --> 02:23:02,929
You will make my strength your own.

965
02:23:05,890 --> 02:23:09,591
You will see my life through your eyes...

966
02:23:10,478 --> 02:23:15,852
...as your life will be seen through mine.

967
02:23:27,453 --> 02:23:31,498
The son becomes the father...

968
02:23:33,209 --> 02:23:37,954
...and the father becomes the son.

969
02:24:29,681 --> 02:24:31,508
Good night!

970
02:24:41,360 --> 02:24:42,770
L...

971
02:24:51,620 --> 02:24:53,577
Will we see you?

972
02:24:55,624 --> 02:24:57,284
Around?

973
02:24:59,795 --> 02:25:01,953
I'm always around.

974
02:25:07,010 --> 02:25:08,718
Good night, Lois.

1
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:13,756
The power is out.
The power is out on the bridge.

2
00:01:41,038 --> 00:01:46,351
I'm going there now. The lights
were out for 45 seconds.

3
00:01:46,518 --> 00:01:49,794
I'll go take a look.
- Okay. Over and out.

4
00:04:13,478 --> 00:04:17,357
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.
- Copenhagen Police.

5
00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:20,430
Do you know who she is?
- Yes.

6
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:23,438
Excuse me, Saga.

7
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:28,388
A woman is there to talk
with the person in charge.

8
00:04:29,718 --> 00:04:32,710
Is she in Sweden or Denmark?

9
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:35,073
I don't know.

10
00:04:35,238 --> 00:04:40,870
She is from Sweden and a Swede
brought her here. I have the lead.

11
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:48,826
Saga Norén, Malmö CID. Go ahead.

12
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:52,877
When can we go?
-Maybe in two hours.

13
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:58,510
Two hours? I don't have two hours.
-Is there someone in danger?

14
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:06,266
My husband is in the ambulance. He's getting
a heart transplant in Copenhagen.

15
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:10,272
He must wait a little longer.
I can't let anyone through.

16
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:26,189
Can I go through?

17
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:41,352
Traffic heading to Denmark on the
Øresund bridge is obstructed.

18
00:05:41,518 --> 00:05:44,316
Police said it will continue ...

19
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:09,038
Stefan Lindberg.
-Hi, Veronika.

20
00:06:09,198 --> 00:06:15,273
Sorry to call so late. Were you sleeping?
-No, you know. How are you?

21
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:22,435
I can't sleep. Pain in my belly.
-Understandable. How are the boys?

22
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:26,591
They're asleep. I don't think
they know what's happening.

23
00:06:26,758 --> 00:06:28,396
What can I do for you?

24
00:06:28,558 --> 00:06:31,470
Can we meet?
-Now?

25
00:06:31,638 --> 00:06:34,471
Yes. If you can.

26
00:06:36,118 --> 00:06:41,033
Of course I can.
Shall I come to you?

27
00:06:41,198 --> 00:06:42,677
No.

28
00:06:44,118 --> 00:06:49,272
It's better if I come to you.
-I can be in the office in one hour.

29
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:51,110
See you there.

30
00:07:01,438 --> 00:07:05,351
I want everything on the car
that transported the body.

31
00:07:05,518 --> 00:07:10,069
The recording was started manually.
Non-automaticly?

32
00:07:10,238 --> 00:07:14,948
No, but maybe
my colleague recorded something.

33
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:21,197
Hey, there. Hold it. Hold it.

34
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,428
I've given permission.

35
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:27,147
But this is a crime scene.
-I know.

36
00:07:27,318 --> 00:07:30,390
Why did you do that?
-One corpse is enough.

37
00:07:30,558 --> 00:07:34,597
He wasn't dying.
-Are you also a doctor?

38
00:07:34,758 --> 00:07:37,033
No. I'm a detective.

39
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:41,557
What's your name?
-Martin.

40
00:07:41,718 --> 00:07:47,236
And beyond?
-Rohde. R-O-H-D-E.

41
00:07:47,398 --> 00:07:49,787
Can you show
me some identification?

42
00:07:51,078 --> 00:07:52,909
It was an ambulance.

43
00:07:53,078 --> 00:07:59,153
We have the chair of Malmö city council.
She was probably murdered.

44
00:07:59,318 --> 00:08:02,867
What evidence did I destroy
by letting him go?

45
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:05,836
Probably not. Thank you.

46
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:36,707
Finally.

47
00:08:36,878 --> 00:08:42,669
Charlotte, I'm not going to operate on Göran.
I drank some wine at dinner.

48
00:08:42,838 --> 00:08:48,196
When did you eat? Probably hours ago
already. Are you drunk?

49
00:08:48,358 --> 00:08:54,308
We'd take this path together,
you said. So that wasn't true?

50
00:08:54,478 --> 00:08:58,471
Morten Krag is a good surgeon.
-Better than you?

51
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:05,589
It's my husband, so I decide. I'll never
forgive you if someone else messes it up.

52
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:08,226
And if I were to blow it?

53
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:14,913
Then I'll never forgive myself,
as I gave you no choice.

54
00:09:30,438 --> 00:09:35,228
We're ready. Can she go now?
-You can take her.

55
00:09:43,798 --> 00:09:45,390
Holy shit.

56
00:10:03,118 --> 00:10:08,715
The faction is committed to Kerstin
Ekwall. What about the videos?

57
00:10:08,878 --> 00:10:12,791
They'll arrive in the morning.
How's the press?

58
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:19,397
They know we found the body of
a woman, but not who she is.

59
00:10:19,558 --> 00:10:22,026
And her family?
-That's something I'll do.

60
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:24,632
Send Gry and Navid.

61
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:30,714
The family is still sleeping. She has children.
Go a bit cautiously.

62
00:10:30,878 --> 00:10:37,067
What? I can really say. There
aren't many ways to say it.

63
00:10:37,238 --> 00:10:39,388
Just do it gently.

64
00:10:39,558 --> 00:10:44,916
Hans, wait a bit. She was sliced
in two. Above the hips.

65
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:47,353
What are you saying?

66
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:55,675
She had a conference in
Copenhagen tomorrow morning.

67
00:10:56,998 --> 00:11:01,276
Do you have more computers in the house?
-No.

68
00:11:01,438 --> 00:11:04,953
Please note that?
Those are the children's?

69
00:11:05,118 --> 00:11:10,317
When did you speak to her last?
She called yesterday, when I was cooking.

70
00:11:10,478 --> 00:11:14,630
Can you give an exact time of the call?
-I don't know.

71
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:18,108
Six thirty? We usually called
after breakfast.

72
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,587
Had she been threatened?

73
00:11:20,758 --> 00:11:22,157
By whom?

74
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:27,267
I didn't say she was threatened,
I asked if she was threatened.

75
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:32,637
She was a politician. That includes
some phone calls and e-mails.

76
00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:38,350
She kept herself in politics doing things
that didn't sit well with some people?

77
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:44,347
She wanted to introduce user fees
in libraries. Not everyone liked that.

78
00:11:44,518 --> 00:11:47,191
No, that's stupid.
-Excuse me?

79
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:52,148
Then read a little elitist.
It increases the gap in society.

80
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:56,027
Do you think that has to do
with what happened?

81
00:11:56,198 --> 00:12:02,387
We don't know why she was murdered,
but I don't think it was because of user fees.

82
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:06,437
Why would anyone do that?

83
00:12:06,598 --> 00:12:09,874
Could the reason be personal?

84
00:12:10,038 --> 00:12:14,793
Debts? Did she use drugs?
Was she unbalanced?

85
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:33,712
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.

86
00:12:35,398 --> 00:12:37,707
Can't you call?

87
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:43,394
I'll be there in twenty
minutes. Thank you.

88
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:30,996
August.

89
00:14:23,638 --> 00:14:26,755
Were you at the bridge?
-Yes.

90
00:14:26,918 --> 00:14:30,991
What was it?
-A murder. The Swedes took control.

91
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:34,427
Have you looked in on August?
-Yes.

92
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:36,395
Is he asleep?
-Yes.

93
00:14:36,558 --> 00:14:38,116
Really?
-Yes.

94
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:42,396
You promised to talk
to him about gambling.

95
00:14:42,558 --> 00:14:46,676
You want me to wake him
so I can talk to him?

96
00:14:46,838 --> 00:14:49,591
Today he was on for only three hours.

97
00:14:50,878 --> 00:14:52,948
I'm going to talk to him tomorrow.

98
00:15:04,318 --> 00:15:06,115
Does it hurt?

99
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:35,513
Do you know the cause of death?
-I have a suspicion.

100
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:41,514
But give me some time. I can already
say she's been dead for 6 to 8 hours.

101
00:15:41,678 --> 00:15:43,031
That is true.

102
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:48,226
She called home at half past six and
was found after midnight on the bridge.

103
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:51,674
But there is something else.
That's why I asked you to come.

104
00:15:51,838 --> 00:15:54,477
What then?
-But just look at her.

105
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:25,672
No body spots on the outer ear.

106
00:16:25,838 --> 00:16:32,789
This is consistent with her bleeding.
Reddening in the white of the eyes.

107
00:16:35,718 --> 00:16:38,186
Swelling of the face.

108
00:16:42,478 --> 00:16:47,552
I'd say she was strangled
and split in half after her death.

109
00:16:47,718 --> 00:16:49,674
And the other half?

110
00:16:55,398 --> 00:17:00,108
The abdomen is much paler
then the upper body. Much paler.

111
00:17:02,598 --> 00:17:07,797
This isn't explained by the
blood loss or the position of the corpse.

112
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:16,435
Brownish skin discoloration. Freezing?

113
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:19,589
It feels different.

114
00:17:21,198 --> 00:17:25,157
Freezing?
-No freezing. She was frozen.

115
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:30,028
Approximately one year, I'd say.
I've never seen anything like it.

116
00:17:30,198 --> 00:17:36,034
I don't know who's leg that is,
but it isn't Kerstin Ekwall.

117
00:17:57,878 --> 00:18:00,790
All three of you have come then.

118
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:03,157
Hey, Sebastian.

119
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:13,109
I don't know what to do.
I just keep thinking about tomorrow.

120
00:18:13,278 --> 00:18:17,908
I had to say.
You can't pay the rent?

121
00:18:18,078 --> 00:18:21,388
Where are the children
to go, on the street?

122
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:24,152
They have their friends and everything.

123
00:18:24,318 --> 00:18:29,073
I gave you money for the rent.
Where did you spent it?

124
00:18:30,278 --> 00:18:34,715
Why did you bring the kids?
-Sören's not home.

125
00:18:35,478 --> 00:18:37,389
I can't pay it.

126
00:18:38,678 --> 00:18:42,114
Can't you make an exception?
Just once.

127
00:18:42,278 --> 00:18:45,111
You know I can't.
-Please.

128
00:18:45,278 --> 00:18:47,792
Rules are rules. I'm sorry.

129
00:19:04,318 --> 00:19:10,314
Charlotte Söringer? Frederik Henriksen.
I'm in charge here.

130
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:15,188
Göran was given heart
defibrillation on arrival.

131
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:19,476
But that's been resolved.
-Göran is too weak for surgery.

132
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:23,153
Too weak? But there is
a new heart for him.

133
00:19:23,318 --> 00:19:26,674
That's going to someone else.
I'm so sorry.

134
00:19:27,718 --> 00:19:31,597
I know you are in need
of a new CT scanner.

135
00:19:31,758 --> 00:19:37,993
My husband will donate a scanner to
the hospital that gives him a healthy heart.

136
00:19:38,158 --> 00:19:44,233
We won't operate. He's too weak.
-Without a new heart, he'll die.

137
00:19:44,398 --> 00:19:48,835
Everyone can be helped by my offer,
but if you refuse ...

138
00:19:48,998 --> 00:19:53,514
can you ensure it helps
the right person?

139
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:18,791
Hello? Can I speak to Martin Rohde?

140
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:22,109
Saga Norén, here.
I met you on the bridge.

141
00:20:22,278 --> 00:20:25,827
I remember, yes.
-Were you asleep?

142
00:20:25,998 --> 00:20:30,230
It's half past three. Usually I lie down
dozing about that time.

143
00:20:30,398 --> 00:20:33,788
There were two women on the bridge.
-Was there one?

144
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:37,587
The bottom half
wasn't the politician.

145
00:20:37,758 --> 00:20:41,307
Did you find a half body
in Denmark?

146
00:20:41,478 --> 00:20:42,877
I don't know.

147
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:47,987
The case is more than one year old.
The legs have been frozen.

148
00:20:48,158 --> 00:20:49,750
Can you check it out?

149
00:20:49,918 --> 00:20:51,909
Of course.
-Now?

150
00:20:52,078 --> 00:20:54,831
I'll do it first thing tomorrow morning.

151
00:20:54,998 --> 00:20:58,593
Give me a name of
someone who can do it now?

152
00:21:01,878 --> 00:21:04,312
I'll call you back.
-When?

153
00:21:13,198 --> 00:21:15,758
Are you going back out?
-Yes.

154
00:21:43,358 --> 00:21:48,955
Missing woman, white, one year
or more ago. Do you know her age?

155
00:21:49,118 --> 00:21:50,471
Adult.

156
00:21:51,598 --> 00:21:55,876
In addition,  are you all right?
-Sure. And you?

157
00:21:56,038 --> 00:21:57,630
Fine.

158
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,908
I hear you've had
a vasectomy.

159
00:22:03,078 --> 00:22:07,788
Does the staff paper say that?
-Is everything as it should be?

160
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,677
It's probably succeed, yes.

161
00:22:10,838 --> 00:22:15,787
But it's not cool, huh?
-What do you mean?

162
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:19,428
Think of a tom cat
who's lost his balls.

163
00:22:19,598 --> 00:22:25,150
He changes from a wild predator
to a slow fat man. It happens very quickly.

164
00:22:27,398 --> 00:22:30,390
Being castrated.
That's different.

165
00:22:34,518 --> 00:22:37,237
Well, look what I can find.

166
00:22:40,238 --> 00:22:45,392
Two women, murdered one year
apart. One has been frozen.

167
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:51,747
The parts were joined on the
Øresund bridge. Around midnight.

168
00:22:51,918 --> 00:22:54,512
Someone wants to tell us something.

169
00:23:02,718 --> 00:23:05,437
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.
-Martin, here.

170
00:23:05,598 --> 00:23:11,309
The abdomen may be Monique
Brammer. She's been missing for 13 months.

171
00:23:11,478 --> 00:23:15,153
Can you email me the info?
-I'm coming over to you now.

172
00:23:15,318 --> 00:23:17,468
Over here? Why?

173
00:23:17,638 --> 00:23:20,630
Because she is Danish
and I was first on the scene.

174
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:26,191
There's nothing to discuss.
Do you have something to give me?

175
00:23:26,358 --> 00:23:31,557
Make sure I can get inside.
You have my data.

176
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:37,674
That was Martin Rohde.
He may know whose belly is.

177
00:23:37,838 --> 00:23:39,874
Nice.
-He's coming here.

178
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:42,472
Have you got a problem with that?

179
00:23:47,198 --> 00:23:51,396
If half of the body is Danish,
we must work together.

180
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:53,037
Logical.

181
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:59,592
I'll call his boss. We'll call a meeting
for half past five. Will that work?

182
00:24:28,518 --> 00:24:30,634
Finally it's going to happen.

183
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,470
What was that paper
you signed?

184
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:45,075
A formality.

185
00:24:46,998 --> 00:24:48,829
Whose is it?

186
00:24:50,438 --> 00:24:51,837
What?

187
00:24:51,998 --> 00:24:58,028
The heart. Whose is it?
-A man of 25 or 26. Motorcycle Accident.

188
00:25:01,598 --> 00:25:07,707
What's his name?
-I don't know. Does it matter?

189
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:13,506
No, you know. It doesn't.

190
00:25:17,478 --> 00:25:19,196
I'm scared.

191
00:25:21,078 --> 00:25:22,955
It'll work out well.

192
00:25:24,478 --> 00:25:28,073
Someone else will operate on you.
They're all so cleaver.

193
00:25:28,238 --> 00:25:33,551
It will surely go well. I can't
imagine my life without you.

194
00:25:36,878 --> 00:25:38,027
I'll take him.

195
00:25:38,198 --> 00:25:43,477
Don't worry, honey. They know
what they do. You'll be saved.

196
00:25:50,838 --> 00:25:54,308
Hello. An early breakfast.
-No, thank you.

197
00:25:54,478 --> 00:25:59,791
It'd come quicker through e-mail.
-But this is more fun.

198
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:05,788
What are you going?
-Inside with you.

199
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:07,391
Why?

200
00:26:08,438 --> 00:26:12,750
If the other half of
Monique Brammer appears to be ...

201
00:26:12,918 --> 00:26:16,354
both you and me will take
the lead in this matter.

202
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:22,666
Then you have register first
at the reception.

203
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:46,268
Martin Rohde. I'm working with Saga on
the Øresund bridge case.

204
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:50,192
Then fill it in.
-I'd also like a pass.

205
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:54,510
My name is Felicia.
-Nice.

206
00:26:56,478 --> 00:27:01,506
Good. Welcome.
-Thank you. Then you should like this.

207
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:06,230
Danish.

208
00:27:09,198 --> 00:27:11,792
Goodbye.
-I hope so.

209
00:27:21,238 --> 00:27:25,197
Where's Saga Norén?
-Right there.

210
00:27:42,838 --> 00:27:46,148
Sit down.
-No, I don't want to.

211
00:27:50,998 --> 00:27:56,311
You're making me nervous.
-Then I sit a moment.

212
00:27:56,478 --> 00:28:01,506
Why can't you sit down?
-Because I have pain down here.

213
00:28:03,518 --> 00:28:06,749
I was sterilized yesterday.

214
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:13,351
I have five children by three women,
So it is enough.

215
00:28:13,518 --> 00:28:17,636
Do you have children?
-Why should I have?

216
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:19,629
What an original question.

217
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,870
I know a lot
who had to ask it.

218
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:30,631
Not you. You are undoubtedly
a great dad.

219
00:28:40,078 --> 00:28:43,115
Why can't you sign off sick?
-I can't.

220
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:49,069
August is living with Mette and me again.
But it's not about the money.

221
00:28:49,238 --> 00:28:52,708
It was a minor procedure
and it's better if I can work.

222
00:28:52,878 --> 00:28:55,392
But you can't sit.

223
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:58,709
Well. I drove here
by car.

224
00:28:58,878 --> 00:29:01,870
Pretend that's a car seat
and sit down.

225
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:23,996
Nobody wanted to resolve this matter, huh?
-What do you mean?

226
00:29:24,158 --> 00:29:26,956
Monique was reported missing.

227
00:29:27,118 --> 00:29:32,067
After interviewing two other
prostitutes, the investigation was closed.

228
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:37,431
The case ended up in a vacuum.

229
00:29:37,598 --> 00:29:42,274
She was either killed or disappeared.
Because they never found a corpse ...

230
00:29:44,078 --> 00:29:47,195
It was never seriously investigated.

231
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:51,770
I'd be surprised if it
lasted two weeks. Come.

232
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:09,410
Senior politician found dead
the Øresund bridge

233
00:30:14,098 --> 00:30:16,407
The press now know who she is.

234
00:30:16,578 --> 00:30:20,287
Hans, Saga will lead the investigation?
- Nice.

235
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:23,530
Together with the Danish police.

236
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:30,570
Does he know she is a bit unusual?
- Otherwise, he will find out.

237
00:30:35,618 --> 00:30:38,052
Good morning.

238
00:30:39,618 --> 00:30:42,815
This is Martin Rohde from Copenhagen.

239
00:30:42,978 --> 00:30:48,098
It's Rohde.
As if you say 'road, toad, or flowed'.

240
00:30:48,258 --> 00:30:50,488
Road. Flowed.

241
00:30:53,098 --> 00:30:57,694
Have you read the material?
-Not the latest.

242
00:30:57,858 --> 00:31:01,976
We have two half bodies.
One is Kerstin Ekwall.

243
00:31:02,138 --> 00:31:06,131
The other, the one frozen
for a year ... Martin.

244
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:09,847
It's probably Monique
Brammer, 23 years old.

245
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:15,331
Prostitute and junkie. She disappeared
13 months ago without a trace.

246
00:31:17,858 --> 00:31:22,295
Shall I repeat that?
- But just a bit slower?

247
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:26,610
Monique Brammer, 23 years.
Prostitute and junkie.

248
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:31,249
She disappeared 13 months
ago without a trace.

249
00:31:31,418 --> 00:31:36,367
That came from the Danish
investigation, which was rather poor.

250
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:45,886
Don't you agree?
-Yes. It was pitiful.

251
00:31:46,058 --> 00:31:50,210
But traces of blood were
found in her apartment.

252
00:31:50,378 --> 00:31:55,054
Samples of those will be compared
with the lower body.

253
00:31:55,218 --> 00:32:00,417
Someone remotely interrupted the power
to the bridge for 48 seconds.

254
00:32:00,578 --> 00:32:04,810
The company wants to find the source
of the problem. Gry, can you help?

255
00:32:04,978 --> 00:32:08,527
How was it done?
-Someone hacked into the computer.

256
00:32:08,698 --> 00:32:13,931
Can you get pictures of it?
One, two, three and four.

257
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:20,617
Gry, here's Kerstin's mobile number.
Request a list of all calls.

258
00:32:20,778 --> 00:32:24,817
And search the contents
from the work and home computers.

259
00:32:24,978 --> 00:32:28,493
Anne, we have to find out
where she was kidnapped.

260
00:32:28,658 --> 00:32:33,527
She left her work bu car
at half past six. Check it out.

261
00:32:33,698 --> 00:32:39,409
Were the bodies transported in it?
-No, in a black Cadillac Escalade.

262
00:32:39,578 --> 00:32:41,170
A picture from above.

263
00:32:41,338 --> 00:32:44,933
The license plate is covered
with reflective tape ...

264
00:32:45,098 --> 00:32:49,569
but John knows how we can
get the number. Can't we, John?

265
00:32:49,738 --> 00:32:51,569
Sure.
-What are you doing?

266
00:32:51,738 --> 00:32:56,858
I thought when I saw the picture. There was
an orange stripe where the corpse lay.

267
00:32:57,018 --> 00:33:00,931
We know
exactly where they lay.

268
00:33:01,098 --> 00:33:04,090
These are the coordinates
of the border.

269
00:33:04,258 --> 00:33:10,208
One half is located in Sweden, the other in
Denmark. Almost down to the millimeter.

270
00:33:10,378 --> 00:33:15,532
Gry, take a sample of the stripe.
Perhaps it'll give a lead on the paint.

271
00:33:15,698 --> 00:33:21,375
Power failures, half bodies, a politician.
All eyes will be on us.

272
00:33:55,618 --> 00:33:57,131
Good day, Sören.

273
00:33:58,218 --> 00:34:00,778
ls Veronika home?

274
00:34:01,818 --> 00:34:05,208
What is it?
-I just wanted to talk to her.

275
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:10,088
You can also talk to me.
-Not if you're under the influence.

276
00:34:12,058 --> 00:34:15,573
I'm sober.
-Good day, Veronika.

277
00:34:15,738 --> 00:34:18,491
What do you want?
To kick us out of our house?

278
00:34:18,658 --> 00:34:22,367
I won't do it.
The homeowner will.

279
00:34:22,538 --> 00:34:28,454
You're offering to help help?
-I've tried. Very often.

280
00:34:28,618 --> 00:34:34,693
If you had taken a little
responsibility, this wouldn't happen.

281
00:34:38,298 --> 00:34:41,256
That's pretty stupid of you, huh?

282
00:34:42,018 --> 00:34:43,610
Let me go.

283
00:35:00,938 --> 00:35:03,657
Hold it, asshole.

284
00:35:11,138 --> 00:35:13,208
Come out, you.

285
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:31,491
Stop it.
-I hate that dirty bastard.

286
00:35:33,658 --> 00:35:38,891
He's ruined everything
Since he came into our life.

287
00:35:39,058 --> 00:35:40,889
Let me go.

288
00:35:41,938 --> 00:35:46,136
You can go to hell,
bunch of idiots.

289
00:36:23,978 --> 00:36:27,288
How's the surgery?
-It hasn't started yet.

290
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:30,018
He was preped hours ago.

291
00:36:30,178 --> 00:36:34,569
I don't know what's happening.
Sorry, but I have to go.

292
00:36:34,738 --> 00:36:40,608
Don't you know where he went?
-You know his actions better than me.

293
00:36:40,778 --> 00:36:45,056
I'll let you know
when we find him.

294
00:36:48,658 --> 00:36:50,330
Sorry for all this.

295
00:36:50,498 --> 00:36:53,888
You must stop
making excuses for him.

296
00:36:56,338 --> 00:37:01,253
He is grown up. He has to take
responsibility for his actions.

297
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:07,414
You have to too.
Sören's placed you in this situation.

298
00:37:08,698 --> 00:37:14,489
I know you can manage,
but not if you have no money.

299
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:19,811
I know you take good
care of your children.

300
00:37:21,618 --> 00:37:26,134
I know he hits you.
-Almost never the children.

301
00:37:26,298 --> 00:37:30,007
Almost never. It is still too much.

302
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:35,570
He mustn't strike me at all,
and not even you.

303
00:37:35,738 --> 00:37:38,172
You can put your life in order.

304
00:37:39,418 --> 00:37:42,888
You and the children,
but only you and the kids.

305
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:50,532
You have to break with your husband,
otherwise nothing will ever change.

306
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,130
Think about it.

307
00:38:07,738 --> 00:38:12,573
Anders, what's going on?
Why hasn't he had surgery?

308
00:38:12,738 --> 00:38:14,376
We have a problem.

309
00:38:14,538 --> 00:38:20,295
A nurse had a conversation
with the father of the donor.

310
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:25,930
He changed his mind. We
can't use the heart. That's Göran.

311
00:38:51,098 --> 00:38:53,054
Shouldn't we turn off here?

312
00:38:55,698 --> 00:39:00,169
Stefan, shouldn't we turn off here?
-No, not today.

313
00:39:02,578 --> 00:39:06,253
Where are we going?
-You can still see it.

314
00:39:35,818 --> 00:39:40,096
The old man named Johan
who used to lived there,

315
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:43,295
died one month ago.

316
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:47,610
No wife, no children,
no debts, no money.

317
00:39:47,778 --> 00:39:50,087
The house was all he had.

318
00:39:51,378 --> 00:39:53,846
It belongs to the community.

319
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,769
It's Sören.

320
00:40:46,658 --> 00:40:48,376
Go inside.

321
00:40:49,418 --> 00:40:53,889
And the children?
-They can stay out a bit.

322
00:40:59,778 --> 00:41:03,771
Where are we? Tell me
in any case, why we are here.

323
00:41:03,938 --> 00:41:06,088
I'll do so. Now go inside.

324
00:41:17,578 --> 00:41:20,172
Crime scene and meeting place.

325
00:41:20,338 --> 00:41:23,216
Have you worked here long?
-What's long?

326
00:41:23,378 --> 00:41:25,528
More than ten years?
-Yes.

327
00:41:25,698 --> 00:41:28,610
You come from here?
- From Malmö? No.

328
00:41:30,058 --> 00:41:32,856
I'm from Copenhagen.
-I know.

329
00:41:33,018 --> 00:41:36,977
No, I was born in Copenhagen.
- Yeah

330
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:43,246
It's not by accident
that Sweden ...

331
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,888
the land is lngmar Bergman
and Lars Norén.

332
00:41:47,698 --> 00:41:51,486
Are you a member of the playwright
Lars Norén's family?   - No!

333
00:41:52,658 --> 00:41:56,890
We have to find the place,

334
00:41:57,058 --> 00:42:01,529
where the offender
met the victim.

335
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:21,135
I've talked to colleagues in Copenhagen.
You're heading this case together.

336
00:42:21,298 --> 00:42:25,132
This is the protocol
of your rights in each country.

337
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:29,655
I know how it is in Denmark.
-Good.

338
00:42:31,978 --> 00:42:34,697
Saga, can I talk to you?

339
00:42:40,898 --> 00:42:43,366
That message you sent.

340
00:42:43,538 --> 00:42:47,247
About Martin. On the bridge.
-I know what you're talking about.

341
00:42:47,418 --> 00:42:51,297
What should I do about it?
-You must work together.

342
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:55,212
It may have an impact
on your collaboration?

343
00:42:56,258 --> 00:43:00,376
Do you think so?
-It seems possible, yes.

344
00:43:00,538 --> 00:43:04,816
So he will blame me.
-That's a risk.

345
00:43:04,978 --> 00:43:08,937
That message shouldn't affect
the consideration of the case.

346
00:43:09,098 --> 00:43:11,168
Not necessarily.

347
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:15,297
He had no urgent need
of an ambulance.

348
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:20,088
I had to mention it.
-I have to process your report.

349
00:43:20,258 --> 00:43:21,976
Nice.

350
00:43:22,138 --> 00:43:26,051
Saga, I have the license plate of the car.

351
00:43:26,218 --> 00:43:31,451
He is Daniel Ferbé from Malmö.
-The journalist?

352
00:43:31,618 --> 00:43:33,688
Yes, he is a journalist.

353
00:43:40,778 --> 00:43:42,734
You know him?
-Yes.

354
00:43:43,898 --> 00:43:45,729
I always read him.

355
00:43:48,738 --> 00:43:51,013
He writes very entertaining.

356
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:49,057
I'm scared stiff.
I thought I was the first in.

357
00:44:49,218 --> 00:44:55,009
I've worked through the night. I am
ready. Now Berlin and the blogging.

358
00:44:55,178 --> 00:44:59,808
Work at night, partying in Berlin.
How do you keep up?

359
00:44:59,978 --> 00:45:03,573
"Partying"? I have no ...
How many children do you have?

360
00:45:03,738 --> 00:45:09,529
... two children who suck the life
out of me. I have no children.

361
00:45:10,578 --> 00:45:15,208
And nowadays no one says
"partying" any more. No one.

362
00:45:16,818 --> 00:45:19,616
Have fun.
-That'll be fine.

363
00:45:19,778 --> 00:45:24,215
I downloaded
"Elephants in the Desert".

364
00:45:24,378 --> 00:45:29,008
What do you want from me, Åke?
Do you want a hug? A prize?

365
00:45:29,178 --> 00:45:32,056
Applause?

366
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:38,691
They are really good. I like them.
-Yes, they were good.

367
00:45:38,858 --> 00:45:44,057
How is that possible? Two weeks ago
you thought they were super.

368
00:45:44,218 --> 00:45:46,049
And now you like them.

369
00:45:48,098 --> 00:45:50,328
My daughter ...

370
00:45:54,898 --> 00:45:58,811
dancing all afternoon ...
-I really recording. Sorry.

371
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,896
I'll talk to you later.

372
00:46:11,658 --> 00:46:15,173
You and your sons vanish.

373
00:46:15,338 --> 00:46:18,933
Your papers have disappeared
and I resolved your debts.

374
00:46:21,058 --> 00:46:23,049
You can start again.

375
00:46:24,658 --> 00:46:26,330
Do you understand?

376
00:46:27,378 --> 00:46:29,175
You can start again.

377
00:46:30,658 --> 00:46:35,174
Here is start up money
and a new mobile.

378
00:46:36,498 --> 00:46:41,572
But you have to break with your husband.
You can't ever see him again. Otherwise?

379
00:46:43,378 --> 00:46:47,815
He's their father. What'll I say to them?
They need their father.

380
00:46:47,978 --> 00:46:49,457
Why?

381
00:46:50,498 --> 00:46:52,250
Why should they?

382
00:46:54,818 --> 00:46:56,809
To continue to get beaten?

383
00:46:58,778 --> 00:47:04,011
To always be afraid of a man
who spends all the money on drugs?

384
00:47:04,178 --> 00:47:07,170
He'll ruin everything.

385
00:47:08,578 --> 00:47:11,217
That's what he does. Ruin things.

386
00:47:14,218 --> 00:47:17,927
You don't even know me.
Why are you doing this?

387
00:47:27,538 --> 00:47:29,176
Because I can.

388
00:48:50,898 --> 00:48:55,926
Here is my car.
-Could he be the man we're looking for?

389
00:48:56,098 --> 00:49:01,775
A murderer who cuts power
on the bridge, doesn't use his own car.

390
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:03,849
Nice car.
-Yes.

391
00:49:04,018 --> 00:49:07,169
Do you really deserve this?
-Just like you.

392
00:49:07,338 --> 00:49:09,090
I don't have such a beautiful car.

393
00:49:09,258 --> 00:49:14,696
You can't  draw conclusions
about my salary from my car.

394
00:49:14,858 --> 00:49:19,932
I could've bought it, inherited it,
sure saved for it.

395
00:49:20,098 --> 00:49:24,808
I hope you draw better
conclusions in the investigation.

396
00:49:24,978 --> 00:49:30,257
Read this.
An article by Daniel Ferbé.

397
00:49:30,418 --> 00:49:35,731
The man who writes well?
-I said he wrote entertainingly.

398
00:49:35,898 --> 00:49:37,934
Are you coming?

399
00:50:30,698 --> 00:50:34,407
What's up?
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.

400
00:50:34,578 --> 00:50:38,127
I have a guy in a Cadillac
and a bomb in the garage.

401
00:50:38,298 --> 00:50:40,573
A black Escalade?
-Yes. Why?

402
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:46,017
It's involved in a double murder.
-And the man? Trying to commit suicide?

403
00:50:46,178 --> 00:50:49,648
I think he's innocent,
but I'll ask.

404
00:50:49,818 --> 00:50:53,777
You don't come inside.
You don't even come close.

405
00:51:23,818 --> 00:51:25,490
Help.

406
00:51:26,898 --> 00:51:31,016
Help. Help me anyway.

407
00:51:31,178 --> 00:51:32,770
Help.

408
00:51:33,818 --> 00:51:36,651
Get me out of here.
-Take it easy.

409
00:51:42,258 --> 00:51:44,089
Help me.

410
00:51:44,258 --> 00:51:49,093
Front and rear doors linked to
the bomb, the windows don't open.

411
00:51:49,258 --> 00:51:53,137
Can we open them?
-We don't know what's in the doors.

412
00:51:53,298 --> 00:51:55,175
There are wires everywhere.

413
00:52:03,698 --> 00:52:06,166
We have his contact information.

414
00:52:23,378 --> 00:52:26,529
What are you doing?
-My mobile.

415
00:52:28,898 --> 00:52:33,449
Saga Norén , Malmö CID.
I'm standing outside the garage.

416
00:52:33,618 --> 00:52:39,250
I want to know if you were driving
your car on the bridge at midnight.

417
00:52:39,418 --> 00:52:42,774
What do you mean?
-Were you on the Øresund bridge.

418
00:52:42,938 --> 00:52:46,726
No, I was up all night
Here at work.

419
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:50,732
How will you get me out of here?

420
00:52:50,898 --> 00:52:54,732
No idea, I'm not involved in that.
Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?

421
00:52:54,898 --> 00:52:57,093
Who?
-Kerstin Ekwall.

422
00:52:57,258 --> 00:53:01,012
Did you do anything else
when you turned the key?

423
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:06,889
No. I turned it on and then
everything locked and the timer started.

424
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:10,095
I'm talking to the explosives man.

425
00:53:10,258 --> 00:53:15,571
ls there's a connection between you and
Kerstin Ekwall? Have you written about her?

426
00:53:15,738 --> 00:53:21,973
Talked to anyone about her? Has
anyone given you tips about her?

427
00:53:22,138 --> 00:53:26,017
What is this? Get me out of here.
Please.

428
00:53:26,178 --> 00:53:30,808
Do others have keys to your car?
Did someone just borrow it?

429
00:53:30,978 --> 00:53:35,051
No, I don't know.
-Can you reach?

430
00:53:35,218 --> 00:53:40,087
Can you think of anyone who's
used your car? It's important.

431
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:45,332
I don't want to die.
-Daniel, you have to talk to me.

432
00:53:49,978 --> 00:53:53,414
It skipped.
What have you done?

433
00:53:54,618 --> 00:53:59,089
It skipped. It stood at three
and then it skipped to two.

434
00:54:00,218 --> 00:54:02,049
It was at three.

435
00:54:08,818 --> 00:54:10,376
What are you doing?

436
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:14,416
Stay here. Please.

437
00:54:16,098 --> 00:54:18,407
Please.

438
00:54:18,578 --> 00:54:22,287
Come back. Where you going?

439
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:38,694
You should talk to me.

440
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:44,569
ls it a big bomb?

441
00:54:48,658 --> 00:54:50,489
I think so.

442
00:54:50,658 --> 00:54:56,688
I've read many of your pieces. You're
not religious. You're an atheist, right?

443
00:54:56,858 --> 00:55:02,376
Then that's just.
Your body won't register the pain.

444
00:55:07,218 --> 00:55:12,531
Are you sure?
-Don't look at the time, and listen to me.

445
00:55:12,698 --> 00:55:18,295
Can you think why your car would
have been used to dump two bodies?

446
00:55:22,418 --> 00:55:24,648
Think about it. Concentrate.

447
00:55:24,818 --> 00:55:30,097
Who did this?
-I've written so much shit.

448
00:55:42,538 --> 00:55:45,006
Daniel, are you still there?

449
00:56:14,378 --> 00:56:16,016
No fingerprints.

450
00:56:23,898 --> 00:56:28,767
Sorry for the drama. It is so difficult
to drown the noise of the media.

451
00:56:28,938 --> 00:56:32,089
I suppose now I have
your full attention.

452
00:56:32,258 --> 00:56:38,447
Our place on earth can be so beautiful,
but only if we solve our problems.

453
00:56:38,618 --> 00:56:45,137
I point to five problems. The women
on the bridge are therefore only "the beginning".

454
00:56:45,298 --> 00:56:49,337
This is an interesting time
for all of us.

1
00:00:00,728 --> 00:00:03,242
Presiously...

2
00:00:05,808 --> 00:00:08,880
The power on the bridge failed.

3
00:00:11,368 --> 00:00:14,724
The lights were
out for 45 seconds.

4
00:00:27,008 --> 00:00:32,128
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.
She is in Sweden or Denmark?

5
00:00:32,288 --> 00:00:34,563
Two women were killed.

6
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:40,246
The parts were placed on the Øresund
bridge. Someone wants to say something.

7
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:44,321
May I know whose heart it is.
-There's a problem.

8
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:49,960
The father's changed his mind.
We can't use the heart.

9
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:54,078
I got the license plate of the car.

10
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:58,082
He is Daniel Ferbé from Malmö .
-Journalist?

11
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:11,801
Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?
-Who?

12
00:01:11,968 --> 00:01:14,163
It skipped.

13
00:01:14,328 --> 00:01:16,717
Please.

14
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:20,642
Come back. Where you going?

15
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:28,958
Daniel, are you still there?

16
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:38,524
Sorry for the drama. It's so difficult
to drown the noise of the media.

17
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:41,919
I suppose
I now have your full attention.

18
00:01:42,088 --> 00:01:44,727
The women on the bridge
were just the beginning.

19
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:48,119
This is an exciting time
for all of us.

20
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:07,240
What are you doing?

21
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:54,206
Can it wait?
We're on our way.

22
00:04:55,608 --> 00:05:00,841
What is the address? Okay, thanks.
There is information on www.sanningnu.se.

23
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:04,045
What's that?
-A web address.

24
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:08,281
Someone knows more than us
about what happened on the bridge.

25
00:05:08,448 --> 00:05:12,043
What'd you have done
if you had a bomb in the car ...

26
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,245
and you knew you had
only five minutes to live?

27
00:05:15,408 --> 00:05:17,126
That wasn't the case.

28
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:21,327
Let's pretend you thought
you had only five minutes.

29
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:25,720
I'd try to get out.
-Then it would've exploded.

30
00:05:25,888 --> 00:05:30,120
Five minutes more or less ...
-You know what I'd have done?

31
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,404
I got it.

32
00:05:32,568 --> 00:05:37,437
"Equality before the law, a myth."
in the Danish and Swedish.

33
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:41,567
"Equality  before the law, a myth."
"The women on the bridge"...

34
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:45,880
'Women'. Did we announce
there were more than one?

35
00:05:46,048 --> 00:05:49,085
"The women on the bridge
were just the beginning."

36
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:53,685
"A message to the police.
Listen here."

37
00:05:58,008 --> 00:06:02,877
Sorry for the drama. It is so difficult
to drown the noise of the media.

38
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:05,278
I guess I ...

39
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:30,722
You don't eat breakfast?
-Sometimes.

40
00:06:31,728 --> 00:06:35,437
Have you eaten today?
-I eat if I am hungry.

41
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:40,762
There's a website.
-Two. www.Sandhednu.dk. Same content.

42
00:06:40,928 --> 00:06:45,046
This is from Daniel Ferbé's car.
Look what's on it.

43
00:06:53,608 --> 00:06:57,123
Can't we eat before we
interrogate Daniel?

44
00:06:57,288 --> 00:06:59,597
We won't.
-Why not?

45
00:06:59,768 --> 00:07:04,922
We have special people.
Interrogation experts.

46
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:07,124
So you don't talk to him?

47
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:13,078
You don't know what he
has to say? What room is he in?

48
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:18,166
Room 3.
- Come on.

49
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,880
Hello.
-What am I doing here?

50
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:37,881
Your car was used last night
for a murder.

51
00:07:38,048 --> 00:07:40,039
I was working all night.

52
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:45,239
Call my editors.
-We've done that.

53
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:51,404
We don't believe your car was involved
with what happened. That's why you're here.

54
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:55,925
I don't know anything about Kerstin Ekwall
or what happened at the bridge.

55
00:07:56,088 --> 00:07:58,761
Maybe you don't think you know.

56
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:06,842
Sorry, but I can't help you.
I got a ticket to Berlin ...

57
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:10,159
You're not going anywhere
without our permission.

58
00:08:10,328 --> 00:08:14,401
Is that a joke?
-No, that's no joke.

59
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:18,527
Come on.
I almost died in that car.

60
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:20,360
You didn't.

61
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:24,400
But there was dynamite in the back seat.

62
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:28,326
Go grab the person who did it.

63
00:08:28,488 --> 00:08:31,844
That's precisely what we doing.
-I don't know anything.

64
00:08:34,768 --> 00:08:39,125
I just want to leave. Please.

65
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:48,078
If a fool steals my car,
It isn't my problem.

66
00:08:48,248 --> 00:08:51,957
Your problem is the stuff
we found at your home.

67
00:09:00,128 --> 00:09:01,800
Private use.
-What?

68
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:05,563
For private use.
-It is still allowed.

69
00:09:09,728 --> 00:09:15,246
We want to know why your car
was used in a double murder.

70
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:17,717
I have no idea.

71
00:09:18,728 --> 00:09:21,765
Shall we try to find
out together?

72
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:29,679
Interrogators never lie.
-They don't, no.

73
00:09:29,848 --> 00:09:36,003
He'll never confide in us again.
-He doesn't trust us anyway.

74
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:38,921
How do you know?
-I know the type.

75
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:43,400
From the article you read in the car?
-I'm just fine.

76
00:09:43,568 --> 00:09:48,926
Have I irritated you?
-No, not yet. Why?

77
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:55,004
I want a search warrant request.
Or, we'll just take a look now?

78
00:09:55,168 --> 00:09:58,558
You'll get ten minutes in the cafeteria.

79
00:10:10,848 --> 00:10:15,000
Pardon me. Room 32-34?

80
00:10:28,648 --> 00:10:30,479
Christian?

81
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:40,637
I'm Charlotte Söringer.
-I 'm Ole. Are you a psychologist?

82
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:44,357
No, but my husband is very ill.

83
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:49,363
He is in another department.
Without a new heart, he'll die.

84
00:10:52,888 --> 00:10:54,560
The heart of your son.

85
00:11:00,248 --> 00:11:07,006
My son still breathes.
His heart still beats. You can see.

86
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:12,447
I understand you very well ...
-I want to keep him here. Do you understand?

87
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:14,644
I understand very well.

88
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:21,160
But he isn't here anymore. Everything
that made your son who he was, is gone.

89
00:11:26,248 --> 00:11:28,921
You can't use his heart.

90
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:37,400
It is dramatic for you
to lose a child, but I love my husband.

91
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:41,356
Unless he gets your son's heart,
he's also dies.

92
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:46,244
So be it.

93
00:11:59,968 --> 00:12:06,567
Hey, come here.
Listen to this. Johan.

94
00:12:08,448 --> 00:12:12,805
Jørgen, I have a question for you.
Actually, my name isn't Jørgen.

95
00:12:12,968 --> 00:12:18,964
Have you heard, two half
bodies were found on the bridge?

96
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:22,643
One of them was Monique Brammer,
junkie and prostitute.

97
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,958
I killed her.

98
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:31,442
The police dropped the case after two
weeks. Does it go so easily in Sweden?

99
00:12:31,608 --> 00:12:34,406
This isn't the right forum ...

100
00:12:34,568 --> 00:12:40,916
You know what the right forum is?
www.sandhednu.dk. Wake up.

101
00:12:43,448 --> 00:12:46,281
This just aired on Danish radio.

102
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:48,518
Was it tracked?
-Prepaid card.

103
00:12:48,688 --> 00:12:51,964
The voice on the CD sounded different.
-Is it a group?

104
00:12:52,128 --> 00:12:55,882
He keeps saying 'I '
"I killed them."

105
00:12:56,048 --> 00:13:00,678
A group claims they're more than
one, because it increases the terror.

106
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:04,045
I'm going to reopen
Monique's case.

107
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:08,201
Daniel Ferbé is allowed to leave
after the search of his house.

108
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:11,565
We're going to shadow him.
And the websites?

109
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:17,166
We try to locate the server,
but it doesn't even show an lP address.

110
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:21,719
Both links are available
on the websites of most newspapers.

111
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:26,245
There are things
only the killer could know.

112
00:13:26,408 --> 00:13:27,966
Does he brag?

113
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:32,485
On the radio, he had
a clear message:

114
00:13:32,648 --> 00:13:36,163
"Not everyone is equal before the law."
-That is correct.

115
00:13:36,328 --> 00:13:41,243
You won't repeat that.
-That doesn't make it any less true.

116
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,156
What do we think?

117
00:13:45,328 --> 00:13:48,320
He says those women
were just the beginning.

118
00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:51,719
And he will point out five problems.

119
00:13:51,888 --> 00:13:57,645
If inequality was the first,
there are four left. The question is what.

120
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:06,842
According to a website the other corpse
on the bridge was a Danish prostitute.

121
00:14:07,008 --> 00:14:10,284
The police have confirmed this.

122
00:14:10,448 --> 00:14:15,647
The motive for the murder, according to
the website is "Inequality before the law".

123
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:21,280
You've talked to the donor's father.

124
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:24,758
He had to know
his son could save my husband.

125
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:28,887
That wasn't a good idea.
-Do you think I liked it?

126
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:31,039
Nothing happened.

127
00:14:32,528 --> 00:14:36,840
He is brain dead.
Just pull the plug out.

128
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:41,559
Your husband isn't the only patient.
Suppose it was your son.

129
00:14:41,728 --> 00:14:45,084
Hypothetical situations
don't interest me.

130
00:14:45,248 --> 00:14:49,719
I have no children. I have Göran
and I don't want to lose him.

131
00:14:51,128 --> 00:14:54,325
The coroner wants
to be ready today.

132
00:14:54,488 --> 00:14:59,357
And I'll see how Daniel's
car is. Do you have an address?

133
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:03,521
Hi, honey. I'm in Malmö ,
but I'll be right back.

134
00:15:03,688 --> 00:15:09,126
That's tonight, because I still
in the office. Can you help August.

135
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:13,406
Because it was already after midnight,
so go in and wake him.

136
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:17,277
I promise tonight
I'll talk to him.

137
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:20,599
Hi, honey.
Sending greetings from Saga.

138
00:15:22,968 --> 00:15:27,598
That was my wife. Do you have a boyfriend?
-No. Do you have an address?

139
00:15:29,488 --> 00:15:33,766
It's August.
He lives back home with Mette and me.

140
00:15:33,928 --> 00:15:39,082
I know where the server is.
ln Copenhagen. Here's the address.

141
00:15:40,928 --> 00:15:44,045
That can't be good.
-Yes.

142
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:48,645
With the lP address you can track
the server. It really is good.

143
00:15:48,808 --> 00:15:53,279
What happens at that address?
-It's the police headquarters.

144
00:16:05,128 --> 00:16:08,359
But that's impossible.
It can't be.

145
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:12,077
That's what I said,
but the Swedes are certain.

146
00:16:13,488 --> 00:16:16,958
He shut the power on the bridge.
-That's true.

147
00:16:20,728 --> 00:16:23,322
God's Holy shit.
-What is it?

148
00:16:23,488 --> 00:16:27,561
He does use our server.
-Why?

149
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:32,677
Via a Trojan horse, or he can
change the code.

150
00:16:32,848 --> 00:16:36,841
And even if I knew,
you still wouldn't understand.

151
00:16:37,008 --> 00:16:40,398
Can we track him?
-I can try.

152
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:45,160
He's gone.

153
00:16:53,048 --> 00:16:57,280
Saga Norén. Have you closed him down?
-He did that himself.

154
00:16:57,448 --> 00:17:02,203
Can you still trace him?
-Can we still find him?

155
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:06,680
Maybe, but even if I
find the computer, he'll be gone.

156
00:17:06,848 --> 00:17:10,523
We can find the computer ...
-I heard it.

157
00:17:14,488 --> 00:17:19,243
He wanted us to come so far, huh?
-He was certainly aware.

158
00:17:19,408 --> 00:17:22,047
To close the site
before we could trace it ...

159
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,597
he works towards his goal.

160
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:28,556
He wants to bring out everything .
-That's already happened.

161
00:17:28,728 --> 00:17:33,756
Everything's already on the net.
He needed no sources.

162
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:39,241
Saga, a visitor. He says he
narrated the message on the net.

163
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:49,406
Turn around
and up against the wall.

164
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:54,918
Why? I just come here to ...
-Against the wall.

165
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:56,919
I didn't do anything.

166
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:08,080
When I heard the message on the radio,
it scared me badly. I narrated that.

167
00:18:08,248 --> 00:18:12,241
Why is that?
-I work sometimes for Ljudgrottan.

168
00:18:12,408 --> 00:18:15,639
I do voices for radio ads
and cartoons.

169
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:18,163
I also work in the City Theatre.

170
00:18:18,328 --> 00:18:23,118
Are you an actor?
-Perhaps you may have seen me.

171
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:29,079
No. Recording so ...
-Ljudgrottan called me.

172
00:18:29,248 --> 00:18:35,084
A customer had a job for someone
who speaks Standard Swedish.

173
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:39,161
Did you meet the client?
-No. The text came in the mail.

174
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:42,764
The cassette had to be
sent to a mailbox address.

175
00:18:43,808 --> 00:18:47,517
We joked
it was for a spy movie.

176
00:18:47,688 --> 00:18:51,158
Wasn't it strange
for something to say?

177
00:18:51,328 --> 00:18:57,437
Actually, no. I thought it for a
play or one part or something.

178
00:18:57,608 --> 00:19:03,717
It had a sinister sound, but I didn't know
it'd be used for this.

179
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:06,880
Do you have the text?
-No.

180
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:10,245
The studio would have
the mailbox number?

181
00:19:10,408 --> 00:19:14,162
You can always call
but it'd surprise me.

182
00:19:14,328 --> 00:19:15,727
Why?

183
00:19:16,888 --> 00:19:20,324
I recorded it three and a half years ago.

184
00:20:06,368 --> 00:20:10,566
You stay here with my son.

185
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,483
I've never seen you before.

186
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:28,883
It is important
to take good care of yourself.

187
00:21:29,048 --> 00:21:33,678
It's damned important
make a good impression.

188
00:21:36,488 --> 00:21:39,958
Last year I
got two new teeth.

189
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:43,484
A beautiful smile
opens most doors.

190
00:21:45,648 --> 00:21:48,481
Charlie walked down the street and found ...

191
00:21:48,648 --> 00:21:54,564
What do you say?
-Charlie walked down the street and found ...

192
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:56,446
Charlie?

193
00:22:05,488 --> 00:22:09,720
In any case, you have nice legs.
May I say that?

194
00:22:24,448 --> 00:22:27,406
It was fun,
but now I must go.

195
00:22:36,928 --> 00:22:39,681
Charlie walked down the street and found ...

196
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:56,799
Did you sell her dope?

197
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:02,607
Look again to do your best.

198
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:05,760
May have. Long time ago.

199
00:24:05,928 --> 00:24:08,158
Who did it?
-I don't know.

200
00:24:08,328 --> 00:24:11,923
You know.
-I can't remember.

201
00:24:12,088 --> 00:24:16,684
I'm tired, I'm hungry
and I have pain in my dick.

202
00:24:16,848 --> 00:24:18,804
So I have a short fuse.

203
00:24:18,968 --> 00:24:23,041
I wish I could help.
-My fuse is getting shorter.

204
00:24:25,448 --> 00:24:27,359
Her name is Monique.

205
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:33,077
She disappeared one year ago.
And then you now?

206
00:24:33,248 --> 00:24:36,923
Did she say anything to you
before she disappeared?

207
00:24:37,088 --> 00:24:41,559
She is dead.
Did she take customers home?

208
00:24:42,768 --> 00:24:45,521
That would be stupid of her, right?

209
00:24:45,688 --> 00:24:48,839
We suspect
she was murdered in her home.

210
00:24:49,008 --> 00:24:52,284
Did a customer threaten
or abuse her?

211
00:24:52,448 --> 00:24:53,801
Not that I know of.

212
00:24:53,968 --> 00:24:56,880
Where did she work?
-On Absalonsgade.

213
00:24:57,048 --> 00:25:01,519
ls there someone I can talk?
-Pernille. I'll call her.

214
00:25:01,688 --> 00:25:06,045
How old are you?
-She's old enough. Want her to blow you?

215
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,080
Thanks for the help.

216
00:25:10,288 --> 00:25:13,200
I care about her,
So let me know how it goes.

217
00:25:13,368 --> 00:25:17,646
You get all my attention
when I'm done with this case.

218
00:26:07,848 --> 00:26:14,720
I know you're going to Berlin ...
-I 'm not. The police don't like it.

219
00:26:14,888 --> 00:26:20,087
He called Danish Radio, and confessed
to the murders. The man of the bridge.

220
00:26:20,248 --> 00:26:24,958
It is a great story. With you
We'll have a unique perspective.

221
00:26:25,128 --> 00:26:29,121
I've finally got time off.
-We can talk about that.

222
00:26:32,768 --> 00:26:36,761
Daniel's negotiating his salary.
Can I call back?

223
00:26:38,008 --> 00:26:39,566
Who is this?

224
00:26:46,448 --> 00:26:51,158
Can you understand my Danish, Daniel?
-Prima. Who are you?

225
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:53,967
Someone who stands up for truth.

226
00:26:55,288 --> 00:26:59,406
Why are you calling me?
-We need each other, Daniel.

227
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:03,356
Oh yeah? I don't need anyone
a bomb in my car plant.

228
00:27:03,528 --> 00:27:08,158
I have one voice. They want
to silence me all the time.

229
00:27:08,328 --> 00:27:12,116
Why do I need you?
-Don't you want higher wages?

230
00:27:12,288 --> 00:27:14,085
I'm not for sale.
-No?

231
00:27:14,248 --> 00:27:19,242
What do you mean?
-I give you facts. Do with it what you want.

232
00:27:19,408 --> 00:27:21,319
What facts?

233
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:38,723
What is this?
-Those are crime statistics.

234
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:45,764
"How different crimes
are solved ...

235
00:27:45,928 --> 00:27:48,806
depending on where they are committed."

236
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:55,960
"Social Groups."
"Percent Solution."

237
00:27:56,128 --> 00:27:59,882
"Distribution police budget."
What are we talking about?

238
00:28:00,048 --> 00:28:01,766
What do you do?

239
00:28:25,088 --> 00:28:31,766
This is to protect Veronika
Holmgrens' identity. Do you approve it?

240
00:28:31,928 --> 00:28:33,646
Super. Thank you.

241
00:29:21,848 --> 00:29:24,601
She was here a lot. She needed the money.

242
00:29:26,128 --> 00:29:29,006
She was on speed.
-I know.

243
00:29:37,168 --> 00:29:38,726
Was that the reason?

244
00:29:40,288 --> 00:29:41,721
What?

245
00:29:41,888 --> 00:29:45,198
Why she was murdered?
Because she owed them money?

246
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:47,359
That wasn't the reason.

247
00:29:49,368 --> 00:29:53,600
She wanted to quit. She had
met a man she loved.

248
00:29:53,768 --> 00:29:58,364
Who was he?
Jørgen-something. He came here.

249
00:29:58,528 --> 00:30:01,645
And this was her room?
-No, that was there.

250
00:30:01,808 --> 00:30:06,836
But I had her things removed.
-What stuff was that?

251
00:30:28,168 --> 00:30:29,999
This is her diary.

252
00:30:32,408 --> 00:30:38,119
Why wasn't it taken by the police?
-They never came here.

253
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:49,041
Thank you.
I'll make sure everything gets back.

254
00:31:13,768 --> 00:31:19,559
Only the owner's fingerprints.
-Have other people never been in it?

255
00:31:19,728 --> 00:31:25,405
No idea. It was completely clean.
Too little fiber and other materials.

256
00:31:25,568 --> 00:31:31,245
Someone has already cleaned it.
-Very thoroughly. I think with steam.

257
00:31:31,408 --> 00:31:35,287
Have you really gone
all the way through it?

258
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,798
Well?

259
00:31:41,408 --> 00:31:45,003
Who are you?
-Someone who stands up for the truth.

260
00:31:45,808 --> 00:31:49,960
Why are you calling me?
-We need each other, Daniel.

261
00:31:50,128 --> 00:31:53,165
I don't need anyone
who puts a bomb in my car.

262
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:59,606
What is that?
-He's a reporter called. Listen.

263
00:31:59,768 --> 00:32:03,477
Why do I need you?
-Don't you want higher wages?

264
00:32:03,648 --> 00:32:05,764
I'm not for sale.
-No?

265
00:32:11,368 --> 00:32:14,963
Why didn't you call?
-No idea.

266
00:32:15,128 --> 00:32:19,599
He is a criminal.
-I just got busy.

267
00:32:19,768 --> 00:32:24,523
If he contacts you again,
call us immediately.

268
00:32:26,088 --> 00:32:29,160
What is that?
-The law on the subject.

269
00:32:29,328 --> 00:32:32,559
Possible prosecution
for violation thereof.

270
00:32:32,728 --> 00:32:36,960
I said I'd call you.
-I don't believe you.

271
00:32:37,128 --> 00:32:40,916
Where is your boss?
I gave her a copy.

272
00:32:41,088 --> 00:32:45,001
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.
-We have Ekwall's car.

273
00:32:45,168 --> 00:32:49,525
It was in the garage
in town.

274
00:32:53,008 --> 00:32:54,964
He avoids the cameras.

275
00:33:01,888 --> 00:33:06,598
Is there only one camera in the garage?
-Two, but on the other one, you see nothing.

276
00:33:08,048 --> 00:33:09,640
The window is covered.

277
00:33:16,488 --> 00:33:21,687
And when he drove in?
-He backed in to the parking garage.

278
00:33:23,008 --> 00:33:25,966
Can there be another way?

279
00:33:44,248 --> 00:33:46,398
Do you know this woman?

280
00:33:49,248 --> 00:33:51,967
I'll pay anyone
who knows something about her.

281
00:33:58,928 --> 00:34:01,123
The guy there knows where she is.

282
00:34:21,608 --> 00:34:27,046
The surgery went well. A few
complications, but he's fine.

283
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:31,963
He's in the recovery room. We
let you know if you can see him.

284
00:34:43,288 --> 00:34:44,767
Thank you, Anders.

285
00:34:53,848 --> 00:34:57,443
Ekwall was indeed smuthered
and then cut in half.

286
00:34:57,608 --> 00:35:01,647
The cause of death of the other
woman can't be determined.

287
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:07,678
We have traces of amphetamines,
but not in lethal doses.

288
00:35:07,848 --> 00:35:10,282
She was cut in half
too after her death.

289
00:35:10,448 --> 00:35:14,999
They were both cut in half using
great force, I don't think, manually.

290
00:35:15,168 --> 00:35:20,925
The cut is basically perfect.
-A saw?

291
00:35:21,088 --> 00:35:25,923
Probably the blade wasn't used
to cut wood.

292
00:35:26,088 --> 00:35:29,603
You can see the fine tooth marks.

293
00:35:29,768 --> 00:35:35,126
I think he has the right tool
for the job. A meat saw.

294
00:35:36,448 --> 00:35:41,078
So a slaughterhouse.
-Maybe. ln any case, a meat saw.

295
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:15,683
Watch out. Come inside
to eat. Take a bag each.

296
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:20,559
Very clever, yes.

297
00:36:22,688 --> 00:36:26,124
No, not that. Hi, honey.

298
00:36:28,128 --> 00:36:30,517
Did you see August?
-Where is he?

299
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,407
He's pruning the hedge.

300
00:36:45,768 --> 00:36:49,841
We're eating. Thanks.

301
00:36:52,568 --> 00:36:56,402
It is important to eat well
if you exercise so much.

302
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:03,359
August, pack it in. Food's on the table.
We're all waiting for you.

303
00:37:03,528 --> 00:37:08,363
I want to eat together as a family.
Is that asking too much?

304
00:37:08,528 --> 00:37:11,201
I haven't eaten with a family for 15 years.

305
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:20,164
What's this all about? Your comment?
You're coming with me.

306
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:22,766
Turn that thing off.

307
00:37:26,408 --> 00:37:28,160
Stop it now. Come on.

308
00:37:44,808 --> 00:37:47,402
But we aren't equal before
the law. That's a lie.

309
00:37:47,568 --> 00:37:51,800
So you stand behind him.
-Of course not. He has that point right ...

310
00:37:53,368 --> 00:37:55,199
It is increasing.

311
00:37:55,368 --> 00:37:59,327
If one thing's been planned
for 3.5 years, it must be noted.

312
00:37:59,488 --> 00:38:03,481
Ekwall's computers and
telephones yielded nothing.

313
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:06,560
The websites are not traceable.

314
00:38:06,728 --> 00:38:10,846
He has his voice is distorted.
Johan can't do anything with it.

315
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:15,404
Martin has
Monique Brammer's diary.

316
00:38:15,568 --> 00:38:19,880
She had met a guy named Jørgen.
That's the name he used on the radio.

317
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,608
How is Martin?
-Good.

318
00:38:27,368 --> 00:38:31,998
Do you ever call Karin?
-On occasion, yes. Why?

319
00:38:32,168 --> 00:38:37,003
Martin's wife called today.
She wanted nothing from him.

320
00:38:37,168 --> 00:38:40,524
She called just to hear his voice.

321
00:38:40,688 --> 00:38:42,838
Want a ride?
-I have my car.

322
00:39:35,568 --> 00:39:38,958
"Equality Before the Law"

323
00:40:43,248 --> 00:40:46,126
Are you waiting for someone?
-No.

324
00:40:46,288 --> 00:40:48,518
Do you want some of my drink?

325
00:40:49,568 --> 00:40:51,126
No.

326
00:41:06,848 --> 00:41:10,602
Hello. Why did you go away?

327
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:14,158
I only said
I wanted something to drink.

328
00:41:17,528 --> 00:41:20,565
Do you want to make love
with me at my place?

329
00:41:27,728 --> 00:41:29,958
You bet.

330
00:43:33,888 --> 00:43:37,244
What are you reading?
-A diary.

331
00:43:38,448 --> 00:43:40,120
Do you regret it?

332
00:43:45,728 --> 00:43:47,684
It was a long day.

333
00:43:51,568 --> 00:43:54,685
And there is something in that case ...

334
00:43:54,848 --> 00:43:59,968
The women on the bridge
and the man who called.

335
00:44:00,128 --> 00:44:02,517
What then?
-I don't know.

336
00:44:02,688 --> 00:44:04,519
It's just a feeling.

337
00:44:08,168 --> 00:44:12,605
Now go to sleep. It was a long day.
Tomorrow's another day.

338
00:45:49,608 --> 00:45:51,439
Hi, sweetheart.

339
00:45:58,328 --> 00:46:00,364
We did it.

340
00:46:03,328 --> 00:46:05,842
So the father changed his mind?

341
00:46:07,048 --> 00:46:12,486
The son was in the donor registry.
It didn't matter what the father wanted.

342
00:46:13,928 --> 00:46:16,647
It didn't matter.

343
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:28,798
As I lay there ...

344
00:46:28,968 --> 00:46:31,960
and thought I was going to die ...

345
00:46:33,968 --> 00:46:37,005
I told myself
if I survived ...

346
00:46:38,808 --> 00:46:41,766
I'd have more life
to enjoy.

347
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,879
We'll fix it together.

348
00:46:50,088 --> 00:46:53,842
I can't any longer and I won't any longer.

349
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:59,720
It hasn't been good since ...

350
00:47:02,208 --> 00:47:04,768
It's been so bad for so long.

351
00:47:07,608 --> 00:47:11,396
Life is too short
not to be happy.

352
00:47:12,848 --> 00:47:14,566
I am happy.

353
00:47:15,728 --> 00:47:17,400
But I'm not.

354
00:47:18,488 --> 00:47:20,444
Very long time.

355
00:47:21,888 --> 00:47:23,480
Do you want a divorce?

356
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:31,838
But I love you.
-I know.

357
00:47:32,008 --> 00:47:37,036
Don't you realize what I've
done for you? For us?

358
00:47:44,848 --> 00:47:48,124
What's happening? What's happening?

359
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:25,846
Sonja?

360
00:48:54,928 --> 00:48:56,247
Listen to me.

361
00:48:58,528 --> 00:49:01,964
I'm. Stefan.

362
00:49:04,848 --> 00:49:07,646
Charlie walked down the street and found ...

363
00:49:08,648 --> 00:49:11,481
Charlie walked down the street and found ...

364
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:15,084
A bag. He thought filled with tobacco,
but it was gunpowder.

365
00:49:15,248 --> 00:49:19,844
When Charlie lit his pipe, it exploded,
This story was out.

366
00:49:20,008 --> 00:49:24,365
We sang that the whole summer.
Remember, little sister?

367
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:29,158
Do you remember?
It hadn't rained for days.

368
00:49:33,128 --> 00:49:36,359
You and I killed him
again and again.

369
00:49:37,448 --> 00:49:41,919
But he came back,
because he lives here inside.

370
00:50:35,008 --> 00:50:36,919
Did you talk?

371
00:50:40,408 --> 00:50:42,603
We talked about the future.

372
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:47,602
About the time we had together.

373
00:50:49,888 --> 00:50:52,561
How happy we were together.

374
00:50:57,688 --> 00:50:59,883
He really loved me, Anders.

375
00:51:02,368 --> 00:51:03,926
I know.

376
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:06,803
What is that?
My work.

377
00:52:09,848 --> 00:52:16,367
Where do you work?
-The police. Malmö CID.

378
00:52:20,768 --> 00:52:22,724
Do you want me to go?

379
00:52:25,888 --> 00:52:27,606
Do you want to stay?

380
00:52:29,568 --> 00:52:32,719
Do you want me to stay?

381
00:52:33,888 --> 00:52:35,640
Go back to sleep.

382
00:52:41,928 --> 00:52:45,204
What the hell is that thing?

383
00:52:46,528 --> 00:52:51,124
That's a corpse.
-Okay. I think I'll have ...

384
00:53:02,608 --> 00:53:07,124
Well ... See you then.

385
00:53:11,008 --> 00:53:12,646
Thank you.

386
00:53:21,968 --> 00:53:25,165
S-T-E-A-B.

387
00:53:42,568 --> 00:53:46,163
Does "Staeb" mean anything in Danish?
-Jesus.

388
00:53:46,328 --> 00:53:50,321
When the coroner examined
Monique for a tattoo ...

389
00:53:50,488 --> 00:53:54,766
I believe it is a print
or a stamp or something.

390
00:53:54,928 --> 00:53:58,477
Maybe her body
pressed against something.

391
00:53:58,648 --> 00:54:04,359
Doesn't "staeb" mean anything to you? 
It's not a word, but part of the word.

392
00:54:04,528 --> 00:54:05,881
Think ...

393
00:54:07,048 --> 00:54:12,441
an autopsy room, meat ...
-Kødbyen.

394
00:54:12,608 --> 00:54:16,840
What's that?
-It's an abattoir in Vesterbro.

395
00:54:17,008 --> 00:54:21,445
There's a large abattoir on
Staebogade. I'm going there right away.

396
00:54:21,608 --> 00:54:23,166
I'll see you there.

397
00:54:37,968 --> 00:54:40,084
Can you let us in?

398
00:54:46,728 --> 00:54:48,207
Turn on the lights?

399
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:51,838
Martin.
One of the dogs smells something.

400
00:54:52,488 --> 00:54:53,967
No one.

401
00:54:55,808 --> 00:54:57,560
No one.

402
00:54:58,888 --> 00:55:00,401
No one.

403
00:55:01,648 --> 00:55:05,561
I want a list of everyone
here in the evening.

404
00:55:05,728 --> 00:55:07,559
Do you have a camera?

405
00:55:07,728 --> 00:55:09,878
A surveillance camera.
-No.

406
00:55:10,048 --> 00:55:14,405
Do you have an alarm system? I want
a list of everyone who has the code.

407
00:55:14,568 --> 00:55:18,481
And the access logs for yesterday.

408
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,240
No one.

409
00:55:52,288 --> 00:55:55,883
info@sandhednu.dk
visible but invisible

410
00:56:01,848 --> 00:56:05,807
What have you found?
-The other half. The abdomen.

411
00:56:05,968 --> 00:56:09,005
Ekwall.
-This was on the body.

412
00:56:09,168 --> 00:56:15,243
"... There were no casualties."

413
00:56:15,408 --> 00:56:21,085
He knew we'd find the mark.
He knew we'd find it.

414
00:56:21,248 --> 00:56:25,036
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.
-Daniel Ferbé, here.

415
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:28,200
He emailed me back.
-What did he want?

416
00:56:28,368 --> 00:56:32,839
ln the subject line state
'Visible but invisible.

417
00:56:33,008 --> 00:56:37,047
The email only reads:
If you were concerned about youself.

418
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:40,484
"Then there were
no victims."

419
00:56:40,648 --> 00:56:43,685
What did you say?
-Nothing. Go on.

420
00:56:43,848 --> 00:56:47,841
It's a lot of attachments.
Just like last time.

421
00:56:48,008 --> 00:56:52,798
What are they?
-Weather statistics.

422
00:56:52,968 --> 00:56:56,756
The increase last year 
in Copenhagen and Malmö.

423
00:56:56,928 --> 00:56:58,998
What has increased?

424
00:57:00,488 --> 00:57:02,160
"Low budget ..."

425
00:57:06,248 --> 00:57:08,159
definition of homelessness

426
00:57:08,328 --> 00:57:10,205
Homeless.

427
00:57:11,968 --> 00:57:14,084
These are the homeless.

428
00:57:15,208 --> 00:57:17,483
He contacted Daniel again.

429
00:57:17,648 --> 00:57:25,202
Six people were admitted to the 
hospital in life-threatening condition.

430
00:57:25,368 --> 00:57:29,725
He wants to kill the homeless.
-He's already begun.

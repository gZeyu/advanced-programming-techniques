1
00:00:01,038 --> 00:00:03,393
previously...

2
00:00:06,078 --> 00:00:09,514
The power is out on the bridge.

3
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:14,587
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.

4
00:00:14,758 --> 00:00:17,318
Two women were killed.

5
00:00:17,478 --> 00:00:22,552
They were placed on the Øresund bridge.
Someone wants to leave us a message.

6
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:27,394
Can you understand my Danish, Daniel?
-Fine. Who are you?

7
00:00:27,558 --> 00:00:30,231
Someone who stands up for the truth.

8
00:00:31,318 --> 00:00:32,717
Why are you calling me?

9
00:00:42,398 --> 00:00:47,756
It's so hard to hear your voice.
The women on the bridge were the beginning.

10
00:00:47,918 --> 00:00:54,391
When I heard the message, I was shocked.
I narrated it 3.5 years ago.

11
00:00:55,438 --> 00:01:00,717
Where do you work?
-The police. That's a corpse.

12
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:09,226
Can I turn on the lights?
Martin, one of the dogs smells something.

13
00:01:09,398 --> 00:01:15,587
When I thought I was going to die,
I thought I can't and won't go on.

14
00:01:15,758 --> 00:01:18,192
Do you want a divorce?
What's happening?

15
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:21,156
He's contacted Daniel again.

16
00:01:21,318 --> 00:01:23,627
Homeless. The homeless.

17
00:01:23,798 --> 00:01:27,029
Six people were admitted to
hospital in serious condition.

18
00:01:27,198 --> 00:01:31,669
Everything points to poisoning.
They were hospitalized.

19
00:01:31,838 --> 00:01:35,433
Sonja, I am.

20
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:39,193
He wants to murder the homeless.
-He's already begun.

21
00:02:21,678 --> 00:02:27,071
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.
Do you know anything about the poisoning?

22
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:42,909
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.
Do you know anything about the poisoning?

23
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,752
Come. There.

24
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,148
Inside?
Go there, over there.

25
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:48,553
I'm going to Malmö.
-Is it the same case?

26
00:04:48,718 --> 00:04:50,151
Yes, that's for sure.

27
00:04:50,318 --> 00:04:54,436
Two murdered women, a car bomb,
nine dead and homeless.

28
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:56,828
Ten. They've found another.

29
00:04:56,998 --> 00:05:00,957
Is your Swedish colleague good?
-Saga Norén?

30
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:04,996
They do tremendous things
to solve crimes.

31
00:05:05,158 --> 00:05:09,436
She is very effective.
-She's filed a complaint against you.

32
00:05:09,598 --> 00:05:14,274
I love you too. But try
her to persuade her to withdraw it.

33
00:05:14,438 --> 00:05:16,713
I'll try.
-Keep it neat.

34
00:05:16,878 --> 00:05:18,789
Neat? Why?

35
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:24,237
That means you're only
colleagues. And nothing more.

36
00:05:24,398 --> 00:05:28,073
Did you bring me here for that?
-No.

37
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:34,108
This is a growing region. We're trying
to attract businesses and families.

38
00:05:34,278 --> 00:05:37,953
We feed the homeless.
But to murder ...

39
00:05:38,118 --> 00:05:40,313
We'll do our best to solve this problem.

40
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,949
Then there's Monique Brammer
and the trial of five policemen.

41
00:05:45,118 --> 00:05:49,316
I wasn't on the Brammer case.
I had nothing to do with it.

42
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:52,515
I know.
-What do you mean?

43
00:05:52,678 --> 00:05:57,798
My first priority is to fix this.
-And your second priority?

44
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:02,873
Danish police can use
some good PR. Sometime?

45
00:07:07,318 --> 00:07:13,154
It seemed to go well. He woke
and we talked. And then ...

46
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:21,594
I wasn't there when Mom died.

47
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:26,189
Your father loved you very much, Maya.

48
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:32,628
A lot.

49
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:54,912
Can I help you?
-Stefan Lindberg.

50
00:07:55,078 --> 00:07:57,069
Come with me.

51
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:04,754
We don't know
what she ingested.

52
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:09,514
There wasn't much life in her.
Should we notify anyone?

53
00:08:09,678 --> 00:08:13,273
No. She's just got me.

54
00:08:13,438 --> 00:08:14,951
Thank you.

55
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,676
Forgive me.

56
00:08:29,638 --> 00:08:31,947
Forgive me, Sonja.

57
00:09:02,838 --> 00:09:04,476
That's mine.

58
00:09:05,518 --> 00:09:07,349
Let go.

59
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:13,908
What are you doing?

60
00:09:15,758 --> 00:09:18,750
They've come to pick us up.
-Who?

61
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:22,467
Social workers.
There is a bus outside.

62
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:27,191
Won't you join?
-I'll save myself.

63
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,394
Come on.

64
00:09:48,718 --> 00:09:50,470
What do you want?

65
00:10:04,238 --> 00:10:08,197
Are there any survivors?
-Two in Denmark, one in Sweden.

66
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,633
It doesn't look good.

67
00:10:10,798 --> 00:10:14,632
Nobody knows who passed out the wine?
-Apparently not.

68
00:10:14,798 --> 00:10:17,232
We don't know what poison it is.

69
00:10:17,398 --> 00:10:21,755
We haven't heards anything
from forensics.

70
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:26,070
Severe cramps and tightness
indicates an alkaloid.

71
00:10:26,238 --> 00:10:29,310
It would be strychnine.

72
00:10:29,478 --> 00:10:32,948
But the bleeding
not consistent with that.

73
00:10:33,118 --> 00:10:35,427
You have to find a hobby.
-What?

74
00:10:35,598 --> 00:10:37,748
You have to find a hobby.

75
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:43,429
Nothing on the bottles and boxes?
-Of course not.

76
00:10:43,598 --> 00:10:48,956
So we haven't anything?
-He's like a fucking ghost.

77
00:10:49,118 --> 00:10:51,473
We'll review everything again.

78
00:11:54,838 --> 00:11:59,787
ln the studio is Daniel Ferbé, a
journalist with the 'Aftonpost' in Malmö ...

79
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:03,109
he's had contact with the perpetrator.

80
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:05,951
Or perpetrators. What about it, Daniel?

81
00:12:06,118 --> 00:12:09,906
We don't know.
I've had contact with one man.

82
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,674
Twelve were killed in one day.
What does he want?

83
00:12:14,838 --> 00:12:19,195
He wants, if he wishes,
to high light five problems.

84
00:12:19,358 --> 00:12:24,990
Five truths about our society.
He's a kind of truth terrorist.

85
00:12:25,158 --> 00:12:29,276
It started with the question
whether we are equal before the law.

86
00:12:29,438 --> 00:12:31,349
What is this offensive?

87
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:35,113
Actually it's crazy
we're so worry about it.

88
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,475
Every year as many people
die from the cold.

89
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:41,948
But that doesn't agitate anyone.

90
00:12:42,118 --> 00:12:44,268
Those are his words.

91
00:12:44,438 --> 00:12:51,310
Why did he decide to contact you?
-He has faith in me.

92
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:55,517
What are the three other problems
he wants to point out?

93
00:12:55,678 --> 00:13:00,308
No idea. He'll get back in touch
if anything new happens.

94
00:13:00,478 --> 00:13:06,030
He determines what you write?
-A journalist should be independent.

95
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:09,554
You know it.
I decide what I write.

96
00:13:09,718 --> 00:13:12,186
The circulation of the 'Aftonpost' ...

97
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:16,033
Saga? Gry, congratulations.
-Thank you.

98
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:18,666
He's back on air.

99
00:13:20,398 --> 00:13:24,437
He uses the same addresses,
but hides them better.

100
00:13:24,598 --> 00:13:28,273
Can you find him?
-I can only find the server.

101
00:13:28,438 --> 00:13:30,474
What does he want with that man?

102
00:13:30,638 --> 00:13:32,390
Is it live on the site?
-No.

103
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:34,150
Do you know who it is?
-No.

104
00:13:34,318 --> 00:13:37,867
Check the background.
-It may be a recording.

105
00:13:39,798 --> 00:13:43,234
Martin, here.
We're just looking at it.

106
00:13:43,398 --> 00:13:46,834
Who? Are you sure?

107
00:13:46,998 --> 00:13:48,590
We're coming.

108
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:50,669
We know who it is.

109
00:13:58,118 --> 00:14:02,191
I have a talk
with my boss. She's under pressure.

110
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:05,668
The sloppy investigation of
Monique Brammer ...

111
00:14:05,838 --> 00:14:09,069
Five colleagues are
standing trial for murder.

112
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:15,677
Are you listening?

113
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:22,107
Is it so hard to acknowledge
by saying the occasional 'yes' or 'um'?

114
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:26,669
I sit next to you in the car.
I have to listen to you.

115
00:14:28,438 --> 00:14:31,271
She could use some good PR.

116
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:37,673
She wants to show the police do
a good job. You know what I mean?

117
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:45,152
If we solve this together, she wants it to
appear as if it's especially due to my work.

118
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:48,674
I just wanted to say that.
And we should share the honor.

119
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:51,477
Fine. If that's important to you.

120
00:14:51,638 --> 00:14:55,267
For me?
Don't you think that's important?

121
00:14:57,878 --> 00:14:59,277
Give me a break.

122
00:14:59,438 --> 00:15:04,990
You know you'll also get 
a promotion if we solve this?

123
00:15:05,158 --> 00:15:06,637
Yes.

124
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:10,996
These cases can move
your career forward.

125
00:15:11,158 --> 00:15:12,910
It doesn't matter.
-Oh, no?

126
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,546
I don't want a promotion.

127
00:15:15,718 --> 00:15:19,028
Why not?
-I am not a leader.

128
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,508
Who said that?
-Nobody.

129
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,153
I thought you should know this.

130
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:33,712
Thank you.
-No thanks.

131
00:15:52,158 --> 00:15:53,511
Excuse me.

132
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:56,469
Hold it.

133
00:16:02,998 --> 00:16:06,274
Let me go.
-Just calm down. Come on.

134
00:16:06,438 --> 00:16:08,394
Stop it.

135
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:11,595
Let me see your bag.
-I don't want.

136
00:16:11,758 --> 00:16:14,192
Let's see your bag.
-Let me go.

137
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:17,395
Stand still and let me look at your bag.

138
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,827
Please let me go.

139
00:16:23,478 --> 00:16:26,390
What is wrong with you? Stand still.
-Let me go.

140
00:16:26,558 --> 00:16:29,789
Let me see your bag. Hello?

141
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:34,031
I want to see what's in your bag.
-It wasn't on purpose.

142
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:37,588
Not on purpose?
I want it to look in your bag.

143
00:16:37,758 --> 00:16:39,828
I'm sorry.

144
00:16:40,878 --> 00:16:45,349
Do they have their own beds?
-First come, first served.

145
00:16:45,518 --> 00:16:47,474
Except Bjørn.
-Well ...

146
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:51,551
He gets violent
if someone swipes his bed.

147
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:54,949
And that worked?
-He was thrown out.

148
00:16:55,118 --> 00:16:57,313
Eventually he got his own way.

149
00:16:57,478 --> 00:17:00,390
Who's that girl?
-His daughter.

150
00:17:00,558 --> 00:17:03,948
He took that picture during his last visit.

151
00:17:04,118 --> 00:17:07,269
Was he a sailor?
-He sailed in the merchant navy.

152
00:17:07,438 --> 00:17:10,714
Do you know if he fought with anyone?

153
00:17:10,878 --> 00:17:17,431
Besides neighbors, shopkeepers, policemen
and all other people on earth?

154
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:20,158
I can't help you.

155
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,470
But there are enough people
angry at Bjørn.

156
00:17:24,638 --> 00:17:28,631
I know where Bjørn is.
Or, where he was, in any case.

157
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:25,990
It's a pin from a taser.

158
00:18:26,158 --> 00:18:29,833
ln the cartridge are strips of paper
with a serial number.

159
00:18:29,998 --> 00:18:32,637
They flying out when it's fired.

160
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:36,586
You can identify who fired,
how long and how often.

161
00:18:36,758 --> 00:18:38,874
To prevent abuse.

162
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:42,394
A strip of paper?
-Small strips of paper.

163
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:45,834
We need people to come
and find them.

164
00:19:06,838 --> 00:19:08,669
I'm sorry.

165
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:30,034
That's it.

166
00:19:36,878 --> 00:19:39,551
What are you thinking?
-Why is he there?

167
00:19:39,718 --> 00:19:42,186
Bjørn?
-What's the offender doing?

168
00:19:42,358 --> 00:19:46,146
He'll tell us later.
He isn't stingy with information.

169
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:54,349
Lilian told me something else.
You've filed a complaint against me.

170
00:19:54,518 --> 00:19:57,430
What can I do so you'll withdraw it?

171
00:20:00,118 --> 00:20:02,313
Nothing.

172
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:17,429
What did you do yesterday?
-I was at the slaughterhouse, with you.

173
00:20:17,598 --> 00:20:21,352
Yes, but?
-Why do you want to know?

174
00:20:21,518 --> 00:20:25,557
No idea. If you work together,
you just talk to each other.

175
00:20:25,718 --> 00:20:29,996
I'm having a conversation with you.
-I even had sex.

176
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,633
How did you succeed?

177
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:37,993
It doesn't take so long?

178
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:42,596
What was his name?
-I don't remember.

179
00:20:42,758 --> 00:20:47,832
He shoots ... Bjørn down with a taser

180
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:50,990
and binds him to a chair.

181
00:20:51,158 --> 00:20:53,718
And puts it on the Internet.
Why?

182
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:57,348
He killed the others instantly.

183
00:20:57,518 --> 00:21:00,430
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.

184
00:21:03,478 --> 00:21:05,708
We will go there immediately.

185
00:21:05,878 --> 00:21:07,231
She woken up.

186
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:10,435
She was very awake.

187
00:21:10,598 --> 00:21:14,671
How's she doing?
-From time to time she's conscious.

188
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:18,148
Conscious.
-What?

189
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:21,469
It's 'conscious'.
-Thank you.

190
00:21:21,638 --> 00:21:23,708
Okay.

191
00:21:28,278 --> 00:21:32,237
Shall we take a look?
Then we didn't come for nothing.

192
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:50,547
Sonja, d'you hear me?

193
00:21:53,158 --> 00:21:54,716
Sonja, d'you hear me?

194
00:22:03,678 --> 00:22:06,238
I'll get a doctor.
-Wait.

195
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:11,510
Sonja, d'you hear me?

196
00:22:11,678 --> 00:22:15,910
Stefan.
-I'm Saga Norén, Malmö CID.

197
00:22:16,078 --> 00:22:21,106
Stefan was there.
-Is Stefan someone you know?

198
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:25,794
Everything is good.
-Did you see someone with the bottles?

199
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:30,429
Stefan.
-Did Stefan have the bottles?

200
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:33,271
Sonja, do your best.

201
00:22:33,438 --> 00:22:37,954
Stay awake.
Do your best to stay awake.

202
00:22:38,118 --> 00:22:42,191
Do you know who has poisoned you?
Did you see anyone?

203
00:22:42,358 --> 00:22:46,954
I've seen him.
-Did you know him? What did he look like?

204
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:52,031
Who are you?
-And who are you?

205
00:22:52,198 --> 00:22:54,837
I'm her brother.
Is she awake?

206
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:58,195
No. Saga Norén,
Malmö CID.

207
00:22:58,358 --> 00:23:01,430
This is Martin Rohde
of the Danish police.

208
00:23:01,598 --> 00:23:04,749
Who are you?
-Stefan Lindberg.

209
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:07,193
What are you doing here?

210
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:12,237
Can you show some ID?

211
00:23:17,638 --> 00:23:21,677
So you've found her
and brought here.

212
00:23:21,838 --> 00:23:24,511
How long has your sister been homeless?

213
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:29,514
I don't know.

214
00:23:34,918 --> 00:23:38,911
We lost contact with each other
when I was fifteen.

215
00:23:39,078 --> 00:23:43,037
We ended up in 
separate foster homes.

216
00:23:44,078 --> 00:23:50,995
I just found her yesterday. I didn't 
even know if she was still alive.

217
00:23:52,118 --> 00:23:56,475
So you just find your sister
and then apparently she gets poisoned.

218
00:23:58,758 --> 00:24:02,387
Yes. Is that so strange?

219
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:05,789
That's bad luck.
-Where were you before?

220
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:08,836
I had to arrange things.

221
00:24:08,998 --> 00:24:12,513
And you left
your dying sister behind.

222
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:18,754
I can show you where she was.

223
00:24:18,918 --> 00:24:21,955
No, you don't.
We know where she was.

224
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,395
Tell me if I can help you with 
anything. Can I go to Sonya?

225
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,356
We have to buy flowers for Gry.
-Why?

226
00:24:39,518 --> 00:24:42,271
It's her birthday.
-Oh yeah?

227
00:24:42,438 --> 00:24:47,148
Did you know?
-Go ahead. I'll wait here.

228
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:48,990
Do you have some Swedish money?

229
00:24:51,438 --> 00:24:53,429
Can I borrow some?

230
00:25:09,318 --> 00:25:11,752
Aren't you going back to work?

231
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:17,712
Mommy?

232
00:25:38,238 --> 00:25:40,308
I said I was sorry?

233
00:26:39,918 --> 00:26:44,036
Take an aspirin.
-I took one an hour ago.

234
00:26:44,198 --> 00:26:47,031
From a taser.
See if you can identify it.

235
00:26:47,198 --> 00:26:48,995
Do you know which brand?

236
00:26:49,158 --> 00:26:51,752
I'll start immediately.
-Please.

237
00:26:51,918 --> 00:26:54,307
Congratulations from Saga and me.

238
00:26:56,118 --> 00:26:58,234
I didn't buy flowers.

239
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:01,470
You said they were from both of us.

240
00:27:01,638 --> 00:27:04,106
It doesn't matter. She was delighted.

241
00:27:04,278 --> 00:27:08,317
What does that have to do with it?
-Something's happening to the feed.

242
00:27:21,318 --> 00:27:25,550
Yes, but I can't come.
We need to do it over the phone.

243
00:27:25,718 --> 00:27:30,633
For three hours. lt's okay.
But call me later.

244
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:38,952
You were really good on TV today.
-Thank you, Åke.

245
00:27:39,118 --> 00:27:42,667
I'm really glad you liked it.

246
00:27:42,838 --> 00:27:46,717
No, you mean that ironically.
-No.

247
00:27:46,878 --> 00:27:49,711
lronie is dead, Åke.

248
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:51,675
Really?

249
00:27:53,758 --> 00:27:57,114
But you were right.
It's all here.

250
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:00,827
I know.
This man is my Sankara Stones.

251
00:28:00,998 --> 00:28:02,954
What are they?

252
00:28:12,838 --> 00:28:16,592
Daniel Ferbé.
-Nice, the bit about "truth terrorist".

253
00:28:16,758 --> 00:28:22,355
I don't care what you think.
-Shall I call someone else?

254
00:28:22,518 --> 00:28:25,476
No, you don't.
-Good.

255
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:29,517
I've seen your broadcast.
Have you seen mine?

256
00:28:32,318 --> 00:28:33,910
I'm looking now.

257
00:28:34,078 --> 00:28:37,195
You're not alone.

258
00:28:40,158 --> 00:28:42,752
And the pictures?
-Are you now a journalist?

259
00:28:42,918 --> 00:28:48,948
I can figure out who they are, 
but it's easier if you tell me.

260
00:28:49,118 --> 00:28:51,234
Who are they?

261
00:29:01,518 --> 00:29:04,078
What's this?

262
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:56,028
Dad's on TV.

263
00:30:58,678 --> 00:31:01,750
Bjørn Rasmusen is in the video.

264
00:31:01,918 --> 00:31:06,036
Two property owners from Malmö
and two from Copenhagen ...

265
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:10,874
are also on the site.
-I'll get it.

266
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,668
Daniel Ferbé, the journalist
who had contact with the killer ...

267
00:31:15,838 --> 00:31:20,116
 says these four have to save 
Rasmusen. How is unknown.

268
00:31:24,838 --> 00:31:27,750
Chosen to save Bjørn.

269
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:29,715
How?
-No idea.

270
00:31:29,878 --> 00:31:32,676
What is the common denominator?
-Real Estate.

271
00:31:32,838 --> 00:31:36,148
But the link to Bjørn?
-No idea.

272
00:31:36,318 --> 00:31:40,789
No lead on the spot where
Bjørn is being held.

273
00:31:42,478 --> 00:31:47,029
In the video, you can't see where he is.
-Why not?

274
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:48,870
Or else he wasn't there.

275
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:52,155
The police are going to Lorentzen
and Beckgård.

276
00:31:52,318 --> 00:31:56,994
You and I go to Söringer.
Anne and Navid to Hodell.

277
00:31:57,158 --> 00:32:00,389
What has it to do with Sonja?
-She saw someone.

278
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:03,436
They'll get protection.
-Saga, Martin?

279
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:06,150
He's dead.
-Who?

280
00:32:06,318 --> 00:32:09,469
Söringer died last night
in Copenhagen.

281
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:12,436
Whose business is it now?

282
00:32:20,918 --> 00:32:25,787
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.
I'd like to speak to you.

283
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:29,233
Remember me?

284
00:32:31,718 --> 00:32:34,312
I don't want to talk to you.

285
00:32:34,478 --> 00:32:37,868
I want to help you,
but I will only talk with you.

286
00:32:39,118 --> 00:32:42,713
Do you have a name?
Martin Rohde.

287
00:32:44,758 --> 00:32:46,749
Come inside.

288
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:56,191
Aren't you coming in?

289
00:32:56,358 --> 00:32:58,508
Haven't you heard what she said?

290
00:32:59,918 --> 00:33:03,354
Can't you just listen?
-Yeah.

291
00:34:10,678 --> 00:34:12,794
Hold it.

292
00:34:15,718 --> 00:34:17,948
Get out.

293
00:34:18,998 --> 00:34:21,193
Stupid drunk.

294
00:34:37,278 --> 00:34:40,907
What do you want doing?
What do you want?

295
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:10,193
I get hungry too.

296
00:35:25,638 --> 00:35:27,594
But you know that yourself.

297
00:35:57,718 --> 00:36:02,155
Every officer in Malmö and Copenhagen
are actively looking for him.

298
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:05,435
The camera turns off
and the image disappears.

299
00:36:05,598 --> 00:36:09,273
He'll come to us.
-You hope.

300
00:36:09,438 --> 00:36:13,636
How long ago was this?
-Approximately one hour.

301
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:19,316
None of the Danish
property owners know Bjorn ...

302
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:21,946
or know how to save him.

303
00:36:22,118 --> 00:36:26,316
No Bjørn Rasmusen
rents his house ...

304
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:29,993
or has anything to do 
with Hodells real estate.

305
00:36:30,158 --> 00:36:32,831
Charlotte Söringer didn't know him.

306
00:36:32,998 --> 00:36:38,550
He didn't pick up those four.
-But he doesn't have Bjørn anymore.

307
00:36:38,718 --> 00:36:41,027
We don't have him either.

308
00:37:08,798 --> 00:37:14,316
Such a psychological profile is useful.
But we don't know if there is only one perpetrator.

309
00:37:14,478 --> 00:37:17,788
There's only one.
-How do you know?

310
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:21,155
From the way
when he speaks to us.

311
00:37:21,318 --> 00:37:23,070
Hello, Salvatore.

312
00:37:23,238 --> 00:37:26,310
This is Martin Rohde from Denmark.

313
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:30,551
I suppose no one can pronounce
your last name properly?

314
00:37:30,718 --> 00:37:35,109
Sounds like a classic case
of manipulation.

315
00:37:35,278 --> 00:37:38,111
Hear that, Saga?
-Good.

316
00:37:45,318 --> 00:37:48,594
I am Martin Rohde.
Salvatore Johansson,.

317
00:37:48,758 --> 00:37:52,637
It's not much to go on.
I have little evidence.

318
00:37:52,798 --> 00:37:58,634
But this is someone on the edge
of a psychotic condition.

319
00:37:58,798 --> 00:38:03,110
Saga, we have a ...
-You'll have to wait.

320
00:38:03,278 --> 00:38:09,069
This person focuses on a project
and shuts out all the other things.

321
00:38:09,238 --> 00:38:10,910
He is single.

322
00:38:11,078 --> 00:38:16,755
He is successful or was successful
in his profession or otherwise.

323
00:38:16,918 --> 00:38:22,470
I think a traumatic
event has taken place.

324
00:38:22,638 --> 00:38:25,948
Which has turned his world
 up side down.

325
00:38:26,118 --> 00:38:31,636
In this way he tries make the world
understandable again.

326
00:38:31,798 --> 00:38:35,268
Are we talking
about a psychopath?

327
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:40,034
You could say that.
He has a clear goal.

328
00:38:40,198 --> 00:38:42,996
He wants to impose
his worldview on us.

329
00:38:43,158 --> 00:38:48,107
If he has people to sacrifice,
he will do so.

330
00:38:48,278 --> 00:38:52,715
A psychopath, I think.
-Does he have a weakness?

331
00:38:52,878 --> 00:38:57,190
Everything he does,
is carefully planned and executed.

332
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:01,397
He worked on it for over three years.
-That doesn't surprise me.

333
00:39:01,558 --> 00:39:04,675
But that's his weak spot.

334
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:10,629
If someone or something upsets his plans
 and it isn't the way he wants ...

335
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:13,471
everything will collapse.

336
00:39:13,638 --> 00:39:17,426
In short: He doesn't improvise.

337
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:32,751
Daniel Ferbé.
- Who's that woman?

338
00:39:32,918 --> 00:39:34,988
What woman?
The photo-.

339
00:39:35,158 --> 00:39:38,628
lnstead of Goran Söringer.
-He is deceased.

340
00:39:38,798 --> 00:39:41,392
He died yesterday.

341
00:39:41,558 --> 00:39:43,708
That's his wife.

342
00:39:43,878 --> 00:39:47,314
Maybe you should
just read the whole article.

343
00:39:47,478 --> 00:39:50,788
Should I find someone else?

344
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:00,306
What happens now?

345
00:40:00,478 --> 00:40:02,946
To Bjørn.

346
00:40:24,198 --> 00:40:29,318
We have been in contact with Taser.
The gun was known to us.

347
00:40:29,478 --> 00:40:32,515
It was in 2001 handed over.
-To us?

348
00:40:32,678 --> 00:40:36,068
In April 19. It was supposed 
to be destroyed on May 8.

349
00:40:36,238 --> 00:40:38,388
Then it disappeared.
-Why?

350
00:40:38,558 --> 00:40:42,312
It was legally
removed from the registry.

351
00:40:42,478 --> 00:40:44,514
By?
-Lennart Fransson.

352
00:40:44,678 --> 00:40:46,953
An officer. He's retired.

353
00:40:47,118 --> 00:40:50,633
Four years ago. He has
an apartment in the city.

354
00:40:58,238 --> 00:40:59,876
How was he as an officer?

355
00:41:00,038 --> 00:41:04,475
He was good, accurate,
never went wrong, well liked.

356
00:41:04,638 --> 00:41:06,788
And this?
-We still know nothing.

357
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:09,791
Anne, Navid, go to the rear.

358
00:41:26,398 --> 00:41:29,037
Gry, stay here.

359
00:41:36,918 --> 00:41:39,068
Police, Lennart.

360
00:41:40,518 --> 00:41:43,351
Lennart, this is Hans of CID.

361
00:42:29,718 --> 00:42:31,913
I'll come back.

362
00:43:33,318 --> 00:43:37,072
ls daddy home?
-He just left.

363
00:43:38,118 --> 00:43:41,269
We're having visitors
for Oscar's birthday.

364
00:43:41,438 --> 00:43:46,307
My brother and my parents are coming.
-Nice.

365
00:43:52,118 --> 00:43:56,077
Can I wait for daddy?

366
00:43:56,238 --> 00:43:58,991
Here?

367
00:44:00,038 --> 00:44:03,474
It may take a while.
He just left.

368
00:44:03,638 --> 00:44:07,711
That's okay.
I can wait.

369
00:44:09,478 --> 00:44:12,117
You may sit there.

370
00:44:38,158 --> 00:44:40,467
Does Mommy know you're here?

371
00:44:40,638 --> 00:44:44,756
No. I thought you'd call
to say I'm asleep.

372
00:44:44,918 --> 00:44:46,829
Yeah, but ...

373
00:44:49,038 --> 00:44:51,472
There's something happening at home.

374
00:44:51,638 --> 00:44:54,596
I can't go home. Because ...

375
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:59,912
You can't stay.
I'm sorry, but you can't.

376
00:45:00,078 --> 00:45:05,277
You can't come unexpectedly.
-Why not?

377
00:45:05,438 --> 00:45:08,475
Filippa's brother's coming with his family.

378
00:45:08,638 --> 00:45:13,268
Her parents and neighbors what a piece of ...

379
00:45:13,438 --> 00:45:17,829
There is no place.
-I won't come to the party.

380
00:45:17,998 --> 00:45:23,789
I'm looking for a place to sleep.
-It's okay to come to the party.

381
00:45:23,958 --> 00:45:26,995
But we have
no place for you to sleep.

382
00:45:28,238 --> 00:45:34,234
Everyone, except the
neighbors, will stay overnight.

383
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,310
But I can surely ...

384
00:45:37,478 --> 00:45:41,915
Another time.
You're always welcome.

385
00:45:42,078 --> 00:45:44,467
You know that.

386
00:45:50,598 --> 00:45:54,716
I have no time to take
you all the way home.

387
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:58,837
I can bring you to the train.
-Doesn't matter .

388
00:46:06,078 --> 00:46:07,955
Are we okay?

389
00:46:30,518 --> 00:46:34,193
There are no traces
at Fransson's house.

390
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:37,430
That doesn't happen.
-Still nothing?

391
00:46:37,598 --> 00:46:43,309
What happened to Bjørn?
-He got to him.

392
00:46:43,478 --> 00:46:46,117
He needed Bjørn for something.

393
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:51,396
Why Bjørn?
-Why not?

394
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:56,393
He is big, strong and aggressive.
-He had a taser.

395
00:46:56,558 --> 00:47:03,396
But why Bjørn?
-Maybe he was just in his way.

396
00:47:03,558 --> 00:47:07,915
Then I'd pick somebody
weaker. It's easier.

397
00:47:12,878 --> 00:47:14,834
Say Hans ...

398
00:47:16,038 --> 00:47:20,953
Are you going to move?
-Why? Do you want to get rid of me?

399
00:47:21,118 --> 00:47:25,157
There's still nothing decided.
Karen's looking at houses on the internet.

400
00:47:25,318 --> 00:47:29,357
We're homesick.
It doesn't go away.

401
00:47:29,518 --> 00:47:32,715
Do you want to replace me?
-No.

402
00:47:38,998 --> 00:47:43,708
Whoever succeeds me,
will be glad you're on the team.

403
00:47:43,878 --> 00:47:49,157
Extremely concentrated,
single, successful employee ...

404
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:53,550
clear objectives, organized.
-There you go.

405
00:47:53,718 --> 00:47:56,835
What?
-There you go.

406
00:47:56,998 --> 00:48:00,991
That's the psychological profile
of the perpetrator.

407
00:48:04,638 --> 00:48:07,357
You have to go home and sleep.

408
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:12,227
How was your day?

409
00:49:12,398 --> 00:49:14,514
Well.

410
00:49:16,878 --> 00:49:19,836
The children are in our bed.

411
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,829
Why?

412
00:49:21,998 --> 00:49:24,717
Ask your eldest son.

413
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,755
What has he done?

414
00:49:26,918 --> 00:49:30,433
He showed them the tied up 
man on the computer.

415
00:49:30,598 --> 00:49:33,635
Now they don't dare
sleep in their own beds.

416
00:49:35,718 --> 00:49:38,357
Why does it start again now?

417
00:49:59,278 --> 00:50:03,317
What is it?
-How about you?

418
00:50:03,478 --> 00:50:08,916
The little ones are in our bed
because you've shown them that misery.

419
00:50:09,078 --> 00:50:11,956
That's the reality.
-That's too intense.

420
00:50:12,118 --> 00:50:15,474
What it means.
Nobody wants to see reality.

421
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:17,196
What do you mean?

422
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:20,509
Him. The truth terrorist.

423
00:50:20,678 --> 00:50:25,194
He does more for the homeless than politicians.
-He kills them.

424
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:29,431
Everyone talks about it.
At least now they have shelter.

425
00:50:29,598 --> 00:50:33,352
Should I worry about you're doing?
-No, why?

426
00:50:33,518 --> 00:50:38,308
You don't go to school,
don't work, sleep all day ...

427
00:50:38,478 --> 00:50:41,948
What's your plan?
-The plan is to have no plan.

428
00:50:42,118 --> 00:50:45,952
That doesn't work.
You can't think only of yourself.

429
00:50:46,118 --> 00:50:48,678
Don't you do that?

430
00:50:49,718 --> 00:50:52,551
You need to help more.
Yes, yes.

431
00:50:52,718 --> 00:50:55,915
You need to help Mette more.
I mean it.

432
00:50:56,078 --> 00:50:58,956
I said yes?
-We want you ...

433
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:13,515
Why do they call him
the truth terrorist?

434
00:51:13,678 --> 00:51:19,116
A Swedish reporter called him that.
It's on the Internet.

435
00:51:19,278 --> 00:51:21,508
TT.

436
00:51:23,918 --> 00:51:28,355
Turn it off. And act mature.
-Yes, I will.

437
00:51:31,518 --> 00:51:34,078
Who was that?
-My father.

438
00:51:35,238 --> 00:51:37,672
I don't know him, right?

439
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:45,711
I don't either.
-Why do you live with him then?

440
00:52:58,478 --> 00:53:00,992
Do you come here to find someone?

441
00:53:01,158 --> 00:53:04,468
No, but ...

442
00:53:04,638 --> 00:53:06,469
But it's raining outside.

443
00:53:06,638 --> 00:53:10,108
I know.
I just put the waste out.

444
00:53:14,998 --> 00:53:18,468
I'm having a cup of tea.

445
00:53:18,638 --> 00:53:21,630
There's a cup for you if you want. 

446
00:53:29,238 --> 00:53:30,990
Okay.

447
00:53:33,438 --> 00:53:36,191
Come on up.

448
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:51,751
I only have green tea.
-That's fine.

449
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:02,991
Nice apartment.
-Thank you.

450
00:54:05,438 --> 00:54:07,394
Sit down.

451
00:54:10,718 --> 00:54:13,596
Where are you from?
-From Copenhagen.

452
00:54:13,758 --> 00:54:16,556
What are you doing here?

453
00:54:19,118 --> 00:54:24,067
It sounds terribly childish,
but I ran away from home.

454
00:54:24,238 --> 00:54:26,547
Why?

455
00:54:26,718 --> 00:54:28,549
Quarrel with my mother.

456
00:54:30,878 --> 00:54:33,028
You do that sometimes.

457
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:50,347
Can I stay a while?

458
00:54:50,518 --> 00:54:55,148
Fine. You can stay as long as you want.

459
00:54:55,318 --> 00:54:59,391
That's nice of you.
I'll stay a while.

460
00:55:13,438 --> 00:55:15,952
Dad, you should see something.

461
00:55:16,118 --> 00:55:19,235
What time is it?
-Five o'clock.

462
00:55:19,398 --> 00:55:21,548
Come on.
-What is it?

463
00:55:25,518 --> 00:55:29,511
Hello?
-He has Bjørn back on air again.

464
00:55:29,678 --> 00:55:32,397
What happened? Is he dead?

465
00:55:32,558 --> 00:55:34,037
Not yet.

466
00:55:35,078 --> 00:55:37,194
I'm coming.
-Good.

467
00:55:40,078 --> 00:55:42,592
Saga Norén.
-He called again.

468
00:55:42,758 --> 00:55:45,272
Have you heard from him?

469
00:55:45,438 --> 00:55:48,157
He wants to have 20 million.
-Who?

470
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:51,151
From those four. Five million each.

471
00:55:51,318 --> 00:55:54,071
If he gets it, he'll put
a stop to everything.

472
00:55:54,238 --> 00:55:58,516
If they don't, we know
how much a person is worth.

473
00:56:05,798 --> 00:56:10,110
How much time do we have?
-He started at 5 am, it's now about 6.

474
00:56:10,278 --> 00:56:14,396
He's lost a pint of blood.
He weighs 80 kilos.

475
00:56:14,558 --> 00:56:16,708
7 % is more than 5 liters.

476
00:56:16,878 --> 00:56:20,553
At 40 % blood loss
he'll loose consciousness.

477
00:56:20,718 --> 00:56:23,869
Half a liter per hour.
We have four hours.

478
00:56:24,038 --> 00:56:27,235
His heart won't stop immediately.
-Five, six hours.

479
00:56:27,398 --> 00:56:30,595
Do we know where he's broadcasting from?

480
00:56:30,758 --> 00:56:32,908
We'll contact those four.

481
00:56:33,078 --> 00:56:36,673
He's doing something, with those eyes?
-The blink?

482
00:56:36,838 --> 00:56:40,467
Wasn't he in the merchant marine?
It's Morse Code.

1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:03,157
previously...

2
00:00:05,768 --> 00:00:08,202
The power is out on the bridge.

3
00:00:08,368 --> 00:00:11,405
The women on the bridge
are the beginning.

4
00:00:11,568 --> 00:00:14,719
He identifies five specific problems.

5
00:00:14,888 --> 00:00:19,678
The first problem is inequality
before the law followed by four more.

6
00:00:19,848 --> 00:00:22,601
He wants to kill the homeless.
-He doing that.

7
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:25,521
Is he a psychopath?

8
00:00:25,688 --> 00:00:28,919
He sacrifices people when necessary.

9
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:32,478
Is it the same man as on the bridge?
-Absolutely.

10
00:00:32,648 --> 00:00:37,438
Two women and nine homeless persons.
-Ten, they've found another one.

11
00:00:37,608 --> 00:00:43,558
In our studio is Daniel Ferbé,
who's had contact with the perpetrator.

12
00:00:43,728 --> 00:00:46,367
Or the perpetrators.
Why is that, Daniel?

13
00:00:46,528 --> 00:00:50,077
We don't know.
I've had contact with one man.

14
00:00:50,248 --> 00:00:53,763
He's done more for them
than the politicians.

15
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,965
He kills them.
-Now they're news.

16
00:00:57,128 --> 00:01:00,006
Stefan. Stefan was there.

17
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:03,638
Stefan. Is he someone you know?

18
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:07,767
Do you know who brought the bottle?
Who's your poisoner?

19
00:01:12,048 --> 00:01:14,642
We have no place for you, Anja.

20
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:18,198
I'm having a cup of tea. Want some?

21
00:01:21,328 --> 00:01:23,239
What do you want?

22
00:01:29,128 --> 00:01:32,438
Has he contacted you?
-He wants 20 million.

23
00:01:32,608 --> 00:01:35,680
From those four. Then he'll stop
everything.

24
00:01:35,848 --> 00:01:37,918
His heart won't stop immediately.

25
00:01:38,088 --> 00:01:42,366
We have five, six hours to
find out where he broadcasts from.

26
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:44,678
We'll contact those four.

27
00:01:44,848 --> 00:01:48,477
He's doing something, with his eyes?
-The blinks?

28
00:01:48,648 --> 00:01:51,560
Wasn't he in the merchant marine?
It's Morse Code.

29
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:20,996
Good morning.
-Did you sleep well?

30
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:25,161
I'm fine. And you?

31
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:28,599
I dream a lot.

32
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:32,361
About Dad?
-About anything and everything.

33
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:41,242
Was he happy?

34
00:04:43,488 --> 00:04:47,845
Yes. Why do you ask?

35
00:04:50,448 --> 00:04:53,406
We got along very 
well together. Why?

36
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:06,605
I want to see him.

37
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:14,645
Is that wise?
-I don't know, but I want to see him.

38
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,725
Want to go?

39
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:30,479
The police. They want to talk to you.

40
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:37,324
Charlotte Söringer's coming.
-And the Danes?

41
00:05:37,488 --> 00:05:39,922
Both are coming. Reluctantly.

42
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:43,160
I won't care. Tell me when
they're there.

43
00:05:44,448 --> 00:05:46,484
How are you?

44
00:05:46,648 --> 00:05:50,846
This is Kjell-Åke Jönsson.
He was a telegrapher.

45
00:05:52,688 --> 00:05:58,797
He has found "recognize the eyes"
and "not true, when".

46
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:00,720
He knows him?
-Apparently.

47
00:06:00,888 --> 00:06:04,642
From the merchant marine?
-No, because TT has no Morse.

48
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:08,323
TT?
He's called that on the Internet.

49
00:06:08,488 --> 00:06:12,879
The truth terrorist.
-This is new.

50
00:06:13,048 --> 00:06:15,642
The ...

51
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,526
man ...

52
00:06:20,528 --> 00:06:23,281
lives ...

53
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:26,201
ist ...

54
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:28,245
istedgade.

55
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:31,480
The man lives on the Istedgade.
I'll go there.

56
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:05,798
August, damn.

57
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:09,085
I got milk on the stove.
Keep any eye on it.

58
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,679
How are you, twerps?

59
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:23,046
We're not twerps.
-Yes. All three of you.

60
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:27,201
What happened to Mommy?
-She has eaten something wrong.

61
00:07:27,368 --> 00:07:31,566
What then?
-I don't know. A car?

62
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:34,401
She did it yesterday.
-Eat a car?

63
00:07:34,568 --> 00:07:36,763
No, throw up.

64
00:07:48,488 --> 00:07:51,924
The officers are acquitted
of the abuse charges.

65
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:56,479
Mistreatment by the police
couldn't be proven.

66
00:07:56,648 --> 00:08:00,402
It couldn't be determined
who did what ...

67
00:08:00,568 --> 00:08:05,039
Hadi Hurani was seriously injured
resisting when he was arrested.

68
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,403
That's why experts think ...

69
00:08:26,888 --> 00:08:30,085
I don't give a hoot
what they say on the radio.

70
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:41,519
Good coffee.

71
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:04,486
What are you doing?
-Did I wake you?

72
00:09:04,648 --> 00:09:06,286
Nope.

73
00:09:07,368 --> 00:09:09,404
What time is it?

74
00:09:09,568 --> 00:09:11,479
What are you doing here?

75
00:09:12,768 --> 00:09:14,963
What are you doing here?

76
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:19,883
I came here yesterday
and then I slept over.

77
00:09:20,048 --> 00:09:22,243
Don't you remember?

78
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:29,804
I had a fight with my mother,
and it was raining outside.

79
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:32,766
Then you let me in.

80
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,166
Do you have bread or something?

81
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:08,167
A samurai must always fast
the day before the battle.

82
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:14,723
Tomorrow I need to do
a difficult task.

83
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:22,317
Do you mind if I eat something?
-Okay.

84
00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:43,202
Bread is in the other box.

85
00:11:10,688 --> 00:11:15,443
Why are you so cranky?
-I am afraid of my wife.

86
00:11:23,288 --> 00:11:27,839
Former sailor. Nasty guy.
He can't come here anymore.

87
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:30,476
Why not?
-We got complaints.

88
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,287
He was aggressive. Uncontrolable.

89
00:11:33,448 --> 00:11:36,520
The clincher was
he hit someone.

90
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:39,725
Have you looked in "O5"?
-He had enemies.

91
00:11:39,888 --> 00:11:42,277
Absolutely.
-Where did he go?

92
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:44,245
I know nothing more.

93
00:11:44,408 --> 00:11:47,718
I need to know who was here
when Bjørn came here.

94
00:11:47,888 --> 00:11:53,087
Jesus. Do you know how many there were?
What do you mean?

95
00:11:53,248 --> 00:11:56,763
We think Bjorn
knows his kidnapper.

96
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:11,047
Stefan Lindberg.

97
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:14,279
What a coincidence.

98
00:12:14,448 --> 00:12:17,918
I work here.
-what as?

99
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:21,478
As Swedish contact person in Malmö.

100
00:12:21,648 --> 00:12:24,481
Then maybe you know Bjørn.
-Bjørn Who?

101
00:12:24,648 --> 00:12:28,323
The Bjørn currently bleeding to death
in front of the camera.

102
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:33,724
Were you here when Bjørn
was kicked out?

103
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:37,119
I don't know Bjørn, so I
don't think so.

104
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:39,324
How's your sister?

105
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,438
Still unconscious.

106
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:47,838
When will you be in Malmö?

107
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:53,087
Sometime in the afternoon.
-Come along to the police station.

108
00:12:53,248 --> 00:12:57,082
We want to ask you some questions.
-What?

109
00:12:57,248 --> 00:12:59,603
You hear them this afternoon.

110
00:13:18,408 --> 00:13:22,196
Glad you could come here so soon.

111
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:25,644
We had a choice?
I was ordered to come.

112
00:13:25,808 --> 00:13:29,198
What are we doing here?
-You must go into his claim.

113
00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:33,441
Why?
-He doesn't improvise.

114
00:13:33,608 --> 00:13:36,884
If he does,
he can make a mistake.

115
00:13:37,928 --> 00:13:41,887
So he thinks we won't pay?
-Of course.

116
00:13:42,048 --> 00:13:47,486
It is well known you four are
not philanthropists.

117
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:53,563
We need to discuss the next step.

118
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:58,358
After your public refusal
he has to react. That gives us time.

119
00:13:58,528 --> 00:14:01,440
Then we can save Bjørn.
-So what?

120
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:06,887
No idea.
-We understand what's intended.

121
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:10,802
But we need some time to
discuss this together.

122
00:14:10,968 --> 00:14:13,163
Of course.

123
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:22,883
Is there anything to discuss.

124
00:14:30,128 --> 00:14:31,800
Well?

125
00:14:32,848 --> 00:14:35,681
Would you give 20 million
to a fool?

126
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:43,522
We could agree,
and then withdraw the money.

127
00:14:52,008 --> 00:14:54,920
We shouldn't pay on principle.

128
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:59,001
On the Internet, there's a group:
"They can save Bjørn".

129
00:14:59,168 --> 00:15:02,717
Which so far has 9,454 members.

130
00:15:03,768 --> 00:15:05,884
And this is there too.

131
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:11,357
they can save Bjørn

132
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:13,803
I agree with Charlotte.

133
00:15:20,768 --> 00:15:22,645
Bjørn knows his kidnapper.

134
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:27,284
He knows these people.
-I'll have it checked out.

135
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:30,360
There is more.
-Is it something personal?

136
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:32,883
No idea.
-Is he in Denmark?

137
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:36,279
I really don't know.
-Jesus, Martin.

138
00:15:36,448 --> 00:15:41,476
Tomorrow we'll get hit hard.
-I heard they got acquitted.

139
00:15:41,648 --> 00:15:45,641
The press'll make a
connection to the case of the gang.

140
00:15:45,808 --> 00:15:51,405
Four immigrants were wrongly
convicted of complicity.

141
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:54,082
And this is the same?
-Yes.

142
00:15:54,248 --> 00:15:56,478
Is this really the same? Do you think?

143
00:15:56,648 --> 00:16:00,118
Now it's all about officers?
-Yes, now the cops.

144
00:16:00,288 --> 00:16:02,006
I'm going to Malmö.

145
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:05,240
Martin, good luck.

146
00:16:24,808 --> 00:16:26,560
Hello, Henning.

147
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:33,320
How are you?
-Good.

148
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,360
That lawsuit has
really bogged  you down.

149
00:16:40,408 --> 00:16:43,286
It's acquittal.
-I heard.

150
00:16:43,448 --> 00:16:45,564
Can I bum a butt?

151
00:16:49,168 --> 00:16:51,079
Why did you protect them?

152
00:16:53,728 --> 00:16:56,003
I don't.

153
00:16:56,168 --> 00:17:00,207
He fell.
-Broke his arm and hurt his eye?

154
00:17:00,368 --> 00:17:02,563
You weren't there. He fell.

155
00:17:02,728 --> 00:17:08,166
You're wekk out of it. How can you
be so sure the affair is finally over?

156
00:17:11,888 --> 00:17:14,163
He's dead.

157
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:17,479
Hold on.
-Let me go.

158
00:17:17,648 --> 00:17:21,766
Otherwise I'm gonna come 
to an unhappy end too?

159
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:27,597
I see it still bothers you.

160
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:31,401
Don't let them
bring you down.

161
00:18:00,568 --> 00:18:04,800
What were you talking about?
-Nothing.

162
00:18:11,728 --> 00:18:13,400
One day.

163
00:18:16,288 --> 00:18:19,041
You need to keep quiet
only one more day.

164
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,278
Got it?

165
00:18:27,248 --> 00:18:29,557
It'll be fine, Henning.

166
00:18:36,728 --> 00:18:40,323
There is no news
from the property owners ...

167
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:45,039
at the police station in Malmö
to discuss whether they'll agree.

168
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:50,680
It's becoming urgent. According to experts
the kidnapped Bjørn Rasmusen ...

169
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:54,204
will lose consciousness
in the next hour.

170
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:58,520
Then he has about
one hour to live.

171
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:00,326
Back to the studio.

172
00:19:00,488 --> 00:19:04,481
Thank you, Karin. She is
at the police station in Malmö.

173
00:19:04,648 --> 00:19:07,116
Now to Daniel Ferbé ...

174
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:12,885
the journalist from the 'Aftonpost'
in contact with the bridge killer.

175
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,325
How are you here?

176
00:19:56,488 --> 00:20:00,686
We don't know how Bjørn is
if that's what you mean.

177
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:07,640
The homeless didn't reveal anything.
I ran into Stefan Lindberg.

178
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:09,958
What was he doing?
-He works there.

179
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:14,326
I asked him to come here.
-Why?

180
00:20:14,488 --> 00:20:16,718
I think he pops up too often.

181
00:20:16,888 --> 00:20:18,446
They won't pay.

182
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:21,998
Haven't they listened to us?
-No idea.

183
00:20:22,168 --> 00:20:24,523
Are they calling the shots?
-Leave it now.

184
00:20:24,688 --> 00:20:27,521
They don't.
-Stop it, Saga.

185
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:30,122
Wait a minute. He's saying something new.

186
00:20:31,288 --> 00:20:35,679
He says A, 1, ...

187
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:41,206
and then three letters: A, J, B.

188
00:20:41,368 --> 00:20:45,407
And then he repeats A, 1, ...
-Maybe a code.

189
00:20:45,568 --> 00:20:51,006
Why? It's probably something he sees.
-He sees the camera.

190
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:53,284
Maybe.

191
00:20:54,328 --> 00:20:58,560
Gry, Navid, look after all details
on A1AJB.

192
00:20:58,728 --> 00:21:02,721
Production number, serial number,
property register ...

193
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:08,679
Have them do the same in Copenhagen.
If any info comes, we'll hear it.

194
00:21:08,848 --> 00:21:12,523
What if it doesn't work.
He'll lose consciousness.

195
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:22,963
they'll murder Björn

196
00:21:28,368 --> 00:21:30,723
Can you see it?
-You wrote it?

197
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:33,322
It's true.
-So isn't that simple.

198
00:21:33,488 --> 00:21:37,447
To negotiate with terrorists ...
-Write about it yourself.

199
00:21:37,608 --> 00:21:40,202
Have you seen the competition?

200
00:21:40,368 --> 00:21:43,917
It's about feelings.
-That is exactly what he wants.

201
00:21:44,088 --> 00:21:46,397
How'd you know?

202
00:21:46,568 --> 00:21:49,287
Have you ever had contact with him?
-No.

203
00:21:49,448 --> 00:21:55,887
There you go. You're just jealous.
-That's not the case with me at all.

204
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:19,486
The four property owners
asked to pay the ransom ...

205
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:23,880
decided not to pay 20 million.

206
00:22:33,048 --> 00:22:35,482
Have you changed your mind?
-No, not yet.

207
00:22:35,648 --> 00:22:39,277
We can go back too.
-No, I want to see him.

208
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:44,323
Are you okay?

209
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,880
Who are you?

210
00:23:40,928 --> 00:23:43,362
Sorry, I'm going.

211
00:23:46,848 --> 00:23:49,920
Who are you? What are you doing here?

212
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:54,525
I'm Emilie Hanson. I was
a good friend of Göran.

213
00:24:03,488 --> 00:24:06,924
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be here.

214
00:24:07,088 --> 00:24:08,840
Em?

215
00:24:11,688 --> 00:24:13,804
Are you Em?

216
00:24:18,528 --> 00:24:21,042
Did you have a relationship?

217
00:24:28,608 --> 00:24:31,406
Condolences, Maya.

218
00:24:35,488 --> 00:24:37,956
I didn't know she'd be here.

219
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,404
Think out loud.

220
00:26:18,568 --> 00:26:21,446
He hasn't made a single mistake.

221
00:26:22,488 --> 00:26:25,480
He didn't know Bjorn
could communicate.

222
00:26:25,648 --> 00:26:29,926
It doesn't matter to him
what's behind the camera.

223
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,637
It looks like an abandoned factory.

224
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:39,087
What's in an abandoned factory?
-Machines.

225
00:26:39,248 --> 00:26:42,399
Then he had said
what kind of machine.

226
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:47,722
Pipes, doors ...
A door with a number.

227
00:26:47,888 --> 00:26:54,361
A container with a chemical.
-Behind a camera that films ...

228
00:26:54,528 --> 00:26:56,962
Films ...

229
00:27:43,168 --> 00:27:47,002
Bjørn sees an electricity meter.
-Do you know what?

230
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:49,204
Two digits are missing.

231
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:54,317
ln Malmö we have a letter, a number,
three letters and two digits.

232
00:27:54,488 --> 00:27:57,685
Probably he can't see
the last two digits.

233
00:27:57,848 --> 00:28:02,160
There are certainly 99 possible?
-Hundred. 00 is also possible.

234
00:28:02,328 --> 00:28:06,116
We have found it.
-It's a meter. And further?

235
00:28:06,288 --> 00:28:10,167
Not everything one is in use.
There are 89 active numbers.

236
00:28:10,328 --> 00:28:14,879
That is 88 too many.
-There are 67 residential.

237
00:28:15,048 --> 00:28:17,881
He isn't in a house.
-Another 22 posibilities.

238
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,198
Martin, Saga?

239
00:28:25,768 --> 00:28:27,360
I'll pay.

240
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:34,638
I'll pay everything.
-Why? By yourself?

241
00:28:36,688 --> 00:28:41,125
We can pretend
the others paid too.

242
00:28:41,288 --> 00:28:45,918
You said your husband wouldn't do it.
-He'd burst into a rage.

243
00:28:46,088 --> 00:28:48,807
Are you sure? It's a lot of money.

244
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:51,402
I'm quite sure.

245
00:28:51,568 --> 00:28:56,562
Then he must go to Bjørn.
-I'll notify the media.

246
00:28:59,808 --> 00:29:01,605
Please come with me.

247
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:10,842
Why have you changed his mind?

248
00:29:13,608 --> 00:29:15,405
Revenge.

249
00:29:17,608 --> 00:29:19,758
Sorry.

250
00:29:19,928 --> 00:29:24,126
No lofty motives,
and no moral dilemma.

251
00:29:24,288 --> 00:29:27,724
Just out of revenge.
-On your husband?

252
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:34,886
I've found I wasted 19 years
of my life.

253
00:29:35,048 --> 00:29:37,357
I feel that to.

254
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:42,278
It doesn't matter.

255
00:29:43,688 --> 00:29:47,317
I can collapse or turn back.

256
00:29:47,488 --> 00:29:49,558
I'll turn back.

257
00:29:51,088 --> 00:29:52,840
Are you married?

258
00:29:55,968 --> 00:29:57,924
Married?

259
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:03,044
Good.

260
00:30:04,648 --> 00:30:08,357
I'd like to drive you home,
but I have to work.

261
00:30:08,528 --> 00:30:12,567
Doesn't matter. I have my own car
and I'm in no rush.

262
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:16,926
Maya gets the chance
to leave the house.

263
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:20,444
My stepdaughter.

264
00:30:20,608 --> 00:30:23,247
Now who inherits 20 million less.

265
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:36,723
They'll pay 20 million.
-In order to save the Swede?

266
00:30:36,888 --> 00:30:38,844
Some good news.
-Have you?

267
00:30:39,008 --> 00:30:42,557
I'm not issuing a press release.
Give it to Åke.

268
00:30:42,728 --> 00:30:48,007
What is he doing now?
-Åke now is picking his nose.

269
00:30:48,168 --> 00:30:54,038
No, the killer bridge. TT.
-He'll stop bleeding when he gets the money.

270
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,722
Then he is going to.

271
00:30:57,808 --> 00:31:00,845
But nobody knows where "there" is.

272
00:31:05,048 --> 00:31:10,441
There are three meters of interest
in the port area, all in the same building.

273
00:31:10,608 --> 00:31:14,396
One of these meters
is now being used illegally.

274
00:31:18,568 --> 00:31:22,277
The SWAT team is about 20 minutes
away. We'll get him.

275
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:25,326
If he's keeps his word.
-He does.

276
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:39,043
You think he's dead?

277
00:31:47,888 --> 00:31:51,927
Are you expecting someone?
-Open it.

278
00:32:01,368 --> 00:32:03,040
The door's locked.

279
00:32:12,968 --> 00:32:18,167
Lasse Jönsson?
-Yes, he lives here. Let us in.

280
00:32:19,248 --> 00:32:22,797
I want a signature.

281
00:32:26,728 --> 00:32:28,559
Thank you.

282
00:32:45,288 --> 00:32:48,121
I don't like the door locked.

283
00:32:48,288 --> 00:32:51,803
Why not?
-Then I'm trapped.

284
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:55,756
I don't lock you in.
I just lock out the outside world.

285
00:32:55,928 --> 00:33:00,319
But for me the same result.
Yet?

286
00:33:01,768 --> 00:33:04,202
Here's the keys.

287
00:33:04,368 --> 00:33:06,120
How's that?
-Yes.

288
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:09,519
But don't let anyone in.
-No.

289
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:14,159
Won't you open the package?
-I don't want to.

290
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:17,047
Not yet.
-Who from?

291
00:33:18,408 --> 00:33:20,364
From no one.

292
00:33:23,008 --> 00:33:25,238
I want to call my mom.

293
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:30,967
She must be worried.
Well, she deserved it.

294
00:33:34,728 --> 00:33:37,162
Dad is much cooler.

295
00:33:37,328 --> 00:33:40,923
But he has
a great, new family.

296
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:43,727
So he has no time.

297
00:33:48,248 --> 00:33:50,159
Who are you?

298
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:53,403
Are you kidding?

299
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,277
Anja.

300
00:33:58,448 --> 00:34:02,043
I came yesterday.
I slept over.

301
00:34:03,088 --> 00:34:05,477
The rain.

302
00:34:07,688 --> 00:34:11,363
I'm going out.
-Will you be back?

303
00:34:14,088 --> 00:34:16,841
Does that suit you?
-Of course.

304
00:34:17,008 --> 00:34:19,966
Knock just three times.

305
00:34:59,688 --> 00:35:03,522
They are about ten minutes away.
Then we'll go inside.

306
00:35:04,568 --> 00:35:09,847
The meters are in three different
places. Ten minutes is a long time.

307
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:11,839
9.47.

308
00:35:14,368 --> 00:35:16,723
What are you doing?
-I'm going to work.

309
00:35:23,048 --> 00:35:25,801
We have to wait
on the arrest team.

310
00:35:28,928 --> 00:35:33,001
It is important
an officer protects his colleague.

311
00:35:33,168 --> 00:35:36,604
For the record:
I am your colleague.

312
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,486
To the left.

313
00:36:26,288 --> 00:36:27,721
This is one.

314
00:36:27,888 --> 00:36:31,483
Saga, it's Hans. Where are you?

315
00:36:38,888 --> 00:36:42,767
Saga, it's Hans. Where are you?

316
00:36:42,928 --> 00:36:44,839
Saga, come in.

317
00:36:45,008 --> 00:36:46,680
What is she doing now?

318
00:36:59,848 --> 00:37:01,406
Police. Halt.

319
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:05,085
Stop.

320
00:37:06,328 --> 00:37:08,478
Don't kill me.

321
00:37:09,568 --> 00:37:11,923
The other meter is a little further.

322
00:37:18,568 --> 00:37:20,479
Calm down.

323
00:37:22,128 --> 00:37:24,039
Take it easy.

324
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:27,723
I'm with the police,
so calm down.

325
00:37:27,888 --> 00:37:29,321
What's your name?
-Mange.

326
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:31,524
And beyond?
-I live here.

327
00:37:31,688 --> 00:37:36,921
Have you seen anyone here today?
-No, there's no one else.

328
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:41,798
I'll go to the other meters.
You bring him up?

329
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,801
Are you okay?
-Yes.

330
00:37:44,968 --> 00:37:48,483
Hans, it's Saga.
We've found someone.

331
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:02,086
What are you doing?
He wasn't there?

332
00:38:02,248 --> 00:38:04,478
Who's that?
-A Swede.

333
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:09,005
He wasn't at Sorgenfri or Dalvik.
-What are they?

334
00:38:09,168 --> 00:38:14,447
Industrial areas with meters with
the same number. But nothing.

335
00:38:18,888 --> 00:38:22,961
I was so sure.
- He put a stop to the bleeding.

336
00:38:23,128 --> 00:38:25,926
We need to know where they are.

337
00:38:27,248 --> 00:38:29,318
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.

338
00:38:29,488 --> 00:38:32,400
With Gry. We've discovered something.

339
00:38:32,568 --> 00:38:36,527
Some meters have
a sort of twin numbers.

340
00:38:36,688 --> 00:38:43,127
What does that mean?
- On Sorgenfri there's new construction.

341
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:48,726
These meters have the same numbers
as the meters in the demolition area.

342
00:38:48,888 --> 00:38:53,006
But those are still there.
The meters are thus in two places.

343
00:38:53,168 --> 00:38:55,921
And we were in the building.
-Exactly.

344
00:38:56,088 --> 00:38:59,558
Give me the information.
Send everyone back there.

345
00:39:24,648 --> 00:39:29,199
Can I have your gun?
-You mustn't carry arms in Sweden.

346
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:32,644
I don't care.
-I can shoot well.

347
00:39:32,808 --> 00:39:34,764
Okay. That way.

348
00:39:39,608 --> 00:39:41,564
We must follow this course.

349
00:40:14,368 --> 00:40:16,484
You okay?
-Yes.

350
00:40:30,688 --> 00:40:32,246
Are you okay?

351
00:40:53,088 --> 00:40:56,478
Bjørn, can you hear me?

352
00:41:20,488 --> 00:41:23,798
Hans, it's Saga.
I've found the victim.

353
00:41:27,088 --> 00:41:29,397
TT escape through the roof.

354
00:41:29,568 --> 00:41:32,002
He is armed.

355
00:42:21,368 --> 00:42:24,883
How are you?
-Am I? Well.

356
00:42:25,928 --> 00:42:29,603
What did he look like?
-He was taller than me ...

357
00:42:29,768 --> 00:42:32,601
well trained, fit ...

358
00:42:32,768 --> 00:42:36,681
He can fight well. Nothing more.
-That's all?

359
00:42:36,848 --> 00:42:40,204
We really mean:
How are you?

360
00:42:40,368 --> 00:42:43,246
I'm back together.
How's Bjørn?

361
00:42:43,408 --> 00:42:48,880
He was alive when we arrived,
but he died in the ambulance.

362
00:42:49,048 --> 00:42:52,438
He had put stop to the bleeding.
He kept his word.

363
00:42:52,608 --> 00:42:55,361
But you didn't catch him.

364
00:42:55,528 --> 00:43:00,477
He knew how to flee.
-He shot two officers.

365
00:43:00,648 --> 00:43:02,320
How are they?

366
00:43:02,488 --> 00:43:05,719
One dead and the other has
life-threatening injuries.

367
00:43:05,888 --> 00:43:08,800
Damn it.
-Have you seen anything?

368
00:43:10,848 --> 00:43:14,557
What then?
-It was something I felt.

369
00:43:16,128 --> 00:43:18,164
I don't know what it was.

370
00:43:18,328 --> 00:43:20,125
Unfortunately.

371
00:43:21,168 --> 00:43:24,240
Today I don't work,
but I'll come back tomorrow.

372
00:43:24,408 --> 00:43:26,763
Are you sure?
-Certainly.

373
00:43:26,928 --> 00:43:30,318
Your wife is waiting.
I'll send her to you.

374
00:43:33,888 --> 00:43:38,245
Are you Mette Rohde? Your husband is there.

375
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:42,242
Saga Norén Malmö CID.
-Nice to meet you.

376
00:43:42,408 --> 00:43:45,445
Martin has said a lot about you.
-What then?

377
00:43:45,608 --> 00:43:50,159
You two are working together.
-No more?

378
00:43:50,328 --> 00:43:53,877
You don't work together?
-No.

379
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,437
What do you mean?
-Mette leave it.

380
00:43:56,608 --> 00:43:58,963
I am Hans.

381
00:43:59,128 --> 00:44:02,564
I had called you. Would you go inside?
-Please.

382
00:44:02,728 --> 00:44:06,880
Hopefully I'll see you soon
under more pleasant circumstances.

383
00:44:13,688 --> 00:44:15,963
Come.

384
00:44:16,128 --> 00:44:19,438
I want a kiss from you.
Go sit down.

385
00:44:22,888 --> 00:44:25,038
Ouch, damn.
-Sorry.

386
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:27,085
It doesn't still hurt.

387
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:29,557
That bastard kicked me hard.

388
00:44:29,728 --> 00:44:34,199
It hurt so much.
Just as bad as childbirth.

389
00:44:38,768 --> 00:44:41,566
What is it?
-Nothing.

390
00:44:41,728 --> 00:44:44,288
Tell me.

391
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:46,723
Was it this guy?

392
00:44:46,888 --> 00:44:51,200
Why didn't you shoot him down?
How could he come so close to you?

393
00:44:51,368 --> 00:44:54,121
I can't carry weapons in Sweden.

394
00:44:54,288 --> 00:44:56,961
So you're unarmed
behind a madman?

395
00:44:58,648 --> 00:45:02,277
Saga is armed.
-And what did they do?

396
00:45:02,448 --> 00:45:05,008
She was also knocked down.

397
00:45:06,768 --> 00:45:10,124
Will you stop it?

398
00:45:10,288 --> 00:45:13,405
Why not?
-I can't.

399
00:45:13,568 --> 00:45:17,720
Of course.
You lie in the fucking hospital.

400
00:45:17,888 --> 00:45:21,881
I can't. I gotta find him.

401
00:45:22,048 --> 00:45:26,280
There is no difference between this job
and my other jobs.

402
00:45:26,448 --> 00:45:30,566
In addition, you can defend yourself.
That's a big difference.

403
00:45:36,688 --> 00:45:39,566
How are the twins
and Nicholai?

404
00:45:42,328 --> 00:45:44,717
August's taking care of them.

405
00:45:44,888 --> 00:45:47,641
He's been very big help.

406
00:45:49,088 --> 00:45:51,079
Now it's good.

407
00:45:53,928 --> 00:45:55,839
Maybe.

408
00:46:12,768 --> 00:46:15,805
Saga Norén isn't here.
She'll return tomorrow.

409
00:46:15,968 --> 00:46:20,758
And Martin Rohde?
-The same. Coming back tomorrow.

410
00:46:20,928 --> 00:46:25,604
Where is the punch?
-Will you say Stefan Lindberg stopped by?

411
00:46:25,768 --> 00:46:28,487
I will.
-This isn't one.

412
00:46:28,648 --> 00:46:32,960
What was your name again?
-Stefan Lindberg.

413
00:46:33,128 --> 00:46:35,278
Got it.
-Thank you.

414
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:40,484
Stefan Lindberg?
-Where is Veronica?

415
00:46:40,648 --> 00:46:44,277
Veronika what?
-They can't just run away.

416
00:46:44,448 --> 00:46:50,523
I'll really find her.
And if I don't find her, I'll find you.

417
00:47:05,048 --> 00:47:07,004
Jesus Mina.

418
00:47:24,848 --> 00:47:26,600
I can do it myself.
-Sorry.

419
00:47:26,768 --> 00:47:28,599
What is it?

420
00:47:51,328 --> 00:47:54,320
Are you back home?

421
00:47:54,488 --> 00:47:59,721
I might as well be home in bed.
Thanks for looking after the little ones.

422
00:47:59,888 --> 00:48:02,561
Really fine.

423
00:48:02,728 --> 00:48:05,526
Have you seen the TT?
-Yes.

424
00:48:05,688 --> 00:48:09,397
How did he look like?
-No idea. But he kicks hard.

425
00:48:09,568 --> 00:48:12,526
I'm going to bed. Are you going too?

426
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:18,999
Maybe I make an account.
-Why?

427
00:48:19,168 --> 00:48:21,443
To maintain contact with others.

428
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:24,441
Yes, you can do that.

429
00:48:24,608 --> 00:48:27,725
Who is that?
-Frida.

430
00:48:27,888 --> 00:48:31,085
Pretty girl.
You got a girlfriend?

431
00:48:31,248 --> 00:48:34,240
Is she a girlfriend?
-That you should know.

432
00:48:34,408 --> 00:48:37,684
Who is she?
-She's my ex.

433
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:42,126
She was my girlfriend
in high school.

434
00:48:42,288 --> 00:48:45,837
Do you remember something
of my high school?

435
00:48:46,008 --> 00:48:49,284
He said, leaving his son alone.

436
00:48:50,688 --> 00:48:52,918
Good night.
-From the same.

437
00:49:00,048 --> 00:49:02,084
Damn it.

438
00:49:05,928 --> 00:49:07,725
What is it?

439
00:49:09,048 --> 00:49:11,084
What are you thinking?

440
00:49:17,248 --> 00:49:19,478
Is there something wrong?

441
00:49:24,808 --> 00:49:27,003
What is it?

442
00:49:27,168 --> 00:49:28,965
I'm pregnant.

443
00:49:39,688 --> 00:49:42,441
I was operated on for you.

444
00:49:43,528 --> 00:49:48,522
It's yours, do you doubt.
-No, no.

445
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:53,363
We wanted no more children.

446
00:49:56,568 --> 00:49:58,081
But?

447
00:50:03,088 --> 00:50:05,727
We can't?

448
00:50:05,888 --> 00:50:10,040
I don't know.
-And if it's twins?

449
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:16,362
It could be twins again.
Then we have five children.

450
00:50:19,248 --> 00:50:21,808
We don't have ...

451
00:50:21,968 --> 00:50:24,528
We don't have room for.

452
00:50:25,848 --> 00:50:31,081
Can we handle it?
Or, we can handle?

453
00:50:36,048 --> 00:50:39,324
Come here.

454
00:50:57,008 --> 00:50:59,568
We don't need to decide anything now.

455
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:11,208
I'm going home.

456
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:15,600
Hans, what's the main task
an officer?

457
00:51:17,168 --> 00:51:20,160
Solve crime? Catch perpetrators?

458
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:23,843
Protect your colleague.
That's Martin.

459
00:51:24,008 --> 00:51:27,762
You couldn't help it
Martin was injured.

460
00:51:27,928 --> 00:51:30,362
I thought Bjørn was important.

461
00:51:30,528 --> 00:51:34,521
The important thing is
to save lives.

462
00:51:34,688 --> 00:51:36,121
Martin is still alive.

463
00:51:36,288 --> 00:51:40,759
Save a life is more important.
-I say anyway.

464
00:51:40,928 --> 00:51:44,045
They are equal
on the priority list.

465
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:49,521
We have the same rules
throughout Scandinavia.

466
00:51:49,688 --> 00:51:52,885
There is no difference.
You handled it properly.

467
00:52:22,088 --> 00:52:24,477
Why are you in the dark?

468
00:52:35,928 --> 00:52:37,646
Honey?

469
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:43,645
We wanted to search him,
but he resisted.

470
00:52:43,808 --> 00:52:49,201
Bo gave him a knee in his face.
Then his eye got damaged.

471
00:52:49,368 --> 00:52:53,361
Luffe wanted him to quit
screaming and broke his arm.

472
00:52:53,528 --> 00:52:56,998
He had so much pain.
He tried to stand.

473
00:52:57,168 --> 00:53:02,447
They went down on him,
until he calmed down.

474
00:53:02,608 --> 00:53:05,202
He lost consciousness.

475
00:53:06,248 --> 00:53:11,276
I watched. I watched,
and when I left.

476
00:53:18,608 --> 00:53:21,805
You must tell this to other people.

477
00:53:24,688 --> 00:53:26,804
I think so.

478
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:47,124
Sorry.

479
00:53:53,568 --> 00:53:56,287
Hi, I am.

480
00:54:07,728 --> 00:54:11,516
Did you met anyone?
Some one who just left?

481
00:54:13,008 --> 00:54:18,241
How can I meet anyone?
-So he called. A real master.

482
00:54:19,888 --> 00:54:24,404
If you say so ...
-He has revealed the truth.

483
00:54:31,448 --> 00:54:33,484
Good night, Anja.

484
00:54:35,128 --> 00:54:40,156
You're crazy.
But in a good way.

485
00:54:40,328 --> 00:54:44,799
Do you? I have called my mom.

486
00:54:44,968 --> 00:54:48,756
I thought she would cry
and would ask me to come home.

487
00:54:48,928 --> 00:54:51,681
Like mothers do.

488
00:54:51,848 --> 00:54:54,999
But she was well into the red wine.

489
00:54:56,528 --> 00:55:00,840
So I'll stay another night
if you don't mind.

490
00:55:01,008 --> 00:55:07,356
Fine. You can stay as long as you want.
From tomorrow, the apartment is yours.

491
00:55:07,528 --> 00:55:10,565
What? Why is it mine?
-Good night.

492
00:55:10,728 --> 00:55:13,322
Don't forget to lock the door.

493
00:55:13,488 --> 00:55:15,365
Nope.

494
00:55:54,568 --> 00:55:57,128
Hi, Saga.
-How are your balls?

495
00:55:57,288 --> 00:56:00,917
Small talk isn't
your forte. What is it?

496
00:56:01,088 --> 00:56:04,524
There was something inside me.
About what happened.

497
00:56:04,688 --> 00:56:10,365
He focused on you, but he didn't fire.
Why didn't he shot you down?

498
00:56:11,848 --> 00:56:16,763
No idea.
Later, he shot down two policemen.

499
00:56:19,568 --> 00:56:23,846
I was no threat.
-Maybe not.

500
00:56:24,928 --> 00:56:27,396
Whether he wants to make something clear.

501
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:32,276
What then?
-Maybe he needs you.

502
00:56:32,448 --> 00:56:35,884
Why?
-I don't know.

503
00:56:37,488 --> 00:56:41,367
Think about it.
Good night.

1
00:00:01,078 --> 00:00:03,672
previously...

2
00:00:07,478 --> 00:00:12,029
TT?
-They call him the truth-terrorist.

3
00:00:12,198 --> 00:00:14,871
Go to his demands.
-Why?

4
00:00:15,038 --> 00:00:21,989
He doesn't improvise. When he
does, he makes mistakes.

5
00:00:22,158 --> 00:00:25,753
We don't know
if the property owners ...

6
00:00:25,918 --> 00:00:30,548
who the police are
consultating, will meet his demands.

7
00:00:30,718 --> 00:00:34,870
He says: A, 1 ...

8
00:00:35,038 --> 00:00:36,994
and then three letters.

9
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:41,868
A J-B.
-Bjørn's seeing an electricity meter.

10
00:00:42,038 --> 00:00:47,192
There are three meters correspond.
They're in an abandoned building.

11
00:00:54,718 --> 00:00:58,154
Bjørn, can you hear me?

12
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:10,033
He shot two men,
then disappeared.

13
00:01:10,198 --> 00:01:11,916
How are they?

14
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:16,356
One died on the spot,
the other is seriously injured.

15
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,312
Sören, stop it.

16
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,589
You don't even know me.
Why are you doing that?

17
00:01:24,758 --> 00:01:26,794
Because I can.

18
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,835
Hold it.
-Let me go.

19
00:01:28,998 --> 00:01:33,276
Otherwise I'll also meet
an unhappy end?

20
00:01:35,998 --> 00:01:38,353
Then he was unconscious.

21
00:01:39,678 --> 00:01:43,751
I watched
and then I ran off.

22
00:01:43,918 --> 00:01:46,068
Won't you open the package?

23
00:01:46,238 --> 00:01:49,708
I shouldn't. Not yet.

24
00:01:49,878 --> 00:01:53,393
A samurai fasts the day
before he fights.

25
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,188
Lasse Jönsson?

26
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:25,509
Hello. I'm Emil.

27
00:02:26,838 --> 00:02:29,796
Have you ever come here before?

28
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:33,189
No problems
coming here?

29
00:02:33,358 --> 00:02:35,269
Come on.

30
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:24,350
Thank you.

31
00:04:24,518 --> 00:04:29,956
We can best honour our colleague,
Mats from the SWAT team ...

32
00:04:30,118 --> 00:04:33,793
by catching the bastard.

33
00:04:36,678 --> 00:04:40,990
How are you?
-Fine, as long as I swallow painkillers.

34
00:04:41,158 --> 00:04:42,750
Good.

35
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:50,595
Was there something found with Bjørn?
-A shoe print, size 43.

36
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:54,034
I don't know
what brand the sole is.

37
00:04:54,198 --> 00:04:58,476
Now you must bring in
all men with size 43 feet.

38
00:05:00,278 --> 00:05:03,793
That was a joke.
-I know too.

39
00:05:15,318 --> 00:05:19,152
Hello, Lillian.
-What time are you in court?

40
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:22,833
In one hour.
-Then we have plenty of time.

41
00:05:24,518 --> 00:05:26,873
What are you doing now?

42
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,074
I don't know.
-Don't you know?

43
00:05:32,238 --> 00:05:37,790
I think you'll tell who did what,
and that you watched.

44
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:41,348
And when I say ...

45
00:05:41,518 --> 00:05:45,955
what happened?
-Then you have to testify.

46
00:05:46,118 --> 00:05:50,748
Some colleagues will spit at you,
others will support you.

47
00:05:54,598 --> 00:06:00,355
Will I be prosecuted for perjury?
-There's a small risk.

48
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:07,634
But the risk's there.
And then I'll be fired.

49
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:11,393
I'll do my best
to prevent that.

50
00:06:13,318 --> 00:06:18,472
That's not good enough.
-Henning, that boy is dead.

51
00:06:38,718 --> 00:06:45,396
Today the decision is expected in the case
against the four Copenhagen officers.

52
00:06:45,558 --> 00:06:52,748
The 24-year-old Hadi Hurani died after he
was arrested. The prosecutor has ...

53
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:54,874
Saif, let's go.

54
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:00,908
Why aren't you ready yet?
-I don't want to go.

55
00:07:01,078 --> 00:07:04,195
We've already discussed it.

56
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:07,907
It's important you're there.
For your brother.

57
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:12,708
I already know what will happen.
-They'll make the right choice.

58
00:07:12,878 --> 00:07:15,517
Do you believe that yourself?

59
00:07:15,678 --> 00:07:20,194
I have to. I've no choice.

60
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,516
Come on.

61
00:07:28,358 --> 00:07:31,668
We're being made fools.
You know it.

62
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:44,876
Two murders this morning.
A postman and a psychologist.

63
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,508
In the case of the postman,
the perpetrator committed suicide.

64
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:51,146
Is that for me?
-Don't you want it?

65
00:07:51,318 --> 00:07:53,593
Yes, this is great.

66
00:07:53,758 --> 00:07:56,909
Make sure it looks good.
-Of course.

67
00:07:57,078 --> 00:07:59,308
I just need ...

68
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,347
He is so sweet when he works hard.
Like throwing a ball to a puppy.

69
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:10,027
Daniel Ferbé.
-What a sad front page.

70
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,907
I try to make people
aware of problems.

71
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:16,387
This diverts their attention.

72
00:08:16,558 --> 00:08:19,311
Then you shouldn't shoot cops.

73
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:22,948
They came too close.
-Are you careless?

74
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:26,747
Are you trying to irritate me?
-No, sorry.

75
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:30,035
We will focus on
the third problem.

76
00:08:30,198 --> 00:08:31,756
And that is?

77
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:45,309
Psychiatric patients must make
do with pills and a pat on the back.

78
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:53,033
Åke, let Daniel read everything
you have. He'll decide what we use.

79
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:56,907
It was my job.
-Not any more. There's what's happening.

80
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:11,147
Several murders were committed,
in three cases, followed by suicide.

81
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:15,231
In Malmö a postman was
murdered with a machete.

82
00:09:15,398 --> 00:09:19,835
Someone cut up rough at a
psychiatrist's with a sword.

83
00:09:19,998 --> 00:09:23,468
In Copenhagen someone
on a bus was hit with an ax...

84
00:09:23,638 --> 00:09:27,347
and there someone was stabbed
in a doorwaywith a knife.

85
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:32,228
According to Daniel Ferbé, the TT
says he's behind it.

86
00:09:32,398 --> 00:09:35,356
Due to budget cuts
in psychiatry.

87
00:09:35,518 --> 00:09:38,908
It's probably the same in Denmark?
-Unfortunately, yes.

88
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,832
This is the third problem.
-How did he do this?

89
00:09:42,998 --> 00:09:47,150
Both Swedish offenders
suffer from paranoid schizophrenia.

90
00:09:47,318 --> 00:09:49,229
Confirme for the Dane too.

91
00:09:49,398 --> 00:09:52,196
He worked here for months.

92
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,714
So four murders,
and only three suicides?

93
00:09:55,878 --> 00:09:59,951
The killer of the psychiatrist
was captured ...

94
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:02,234
before he could commit suicide.

95
00:10:02,398 --> 00:10:06,107
Is he here?
-The first interrogation yielded nothing.

96
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:09,827
It's 9.55 am.
The second interview with Lasse Jönsson.

97
00:10:09,998 --> 00:10:15,914
Interrogator: Saga Norén. Present:
Martin Rohde of the Danish police.

98
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:20,750
You killed Emil Fernskog.

99
00:10:24,478 --> 00:10:28,630
It wasn't your idea.
Who did you do that for?

100
00:10:34,318 --> 00:10:36,627
Did you meet him?

101
00:10:36,798 --> 00:10:39,790
What did he look like?
Can you describe him?

102
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:43,988
Lasse?

103
00:10:56,918 --> 00:10:59,193
Look at us, Lasse.

104
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:04,388
Lasse, try to look at us.

105
00:11:08,838 --> 00:11:10,715
How do you feel?

106
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:14,147
What?

107
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:19,790
I don't know.
Are you thirsty, hungry? Do you smoke?

108
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:24,793
A cup of green tea.
-Green tea?

109
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:29,793
You'll get a green tea
if you do something for me.

110
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:35,107
What then?
-You have to answer some questions.

111
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:41,751
Not about him.
-Who?

112
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:47,667
About whom?

113
00:11:47,838 --> 00:11:49,908
No one.

114
00:11:53,238 --> 00:11:57,390
Lasse, are you afraid of him?

115
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:03,708
He isn't here.
He can't come here.

116
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:11,547
Besides, you should be
more afraid of me than of him.

117
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:17,988
Do you understand me?

118
00:12:19,478 --> 00:12:23,790
You have to talk.
You've committed murder for him.

119
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:29,874
I'll get angrier if you keep
sitting there without saying anything.

120
00:12:30,038 --> 00:12:32,996
Lasse, you know what I'm saying?

121
00:12:33,158 --> 00:12:38,357
Look at me when I talk to you.
Don't keep him in protection.

122
00:12:38,518 --> 00:12:40,236
Martin?
-Yes?

123
00:12:40,398 --> 00:12:42,958
You shouldn't protect him.

124
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,876
The hearing ended at 9.57 hours.

125
00:13:00,798 --> 00:13:03,596
Don't say anything.
-What?

126
00:13:03,758 --> 00:13:06,636
About this.
-About what you heard?

127
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:11,952
If I tell you here to keep
your mouth shut, I mean really ...

128
00:13:12,118 --> 00:13:15,554
you should keep quiet
about this. Will you?

129
00:13:15,718 --> 00:13:18,312
But that's not true.
-Thank you.

130
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:36,994
What are you doing?
-He is always one step ahead of us.

131
00:13:37,158 --> 00:13:42,073
So I don't see. I don't see it
if we were after him.

132
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:46,754
How do you see it?
-We are at various locations.

133
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:50,593
With the right information
we'll get there together.

134
00:13:50,758 --> 00:13:52,669
This is the same.
-No.

135
00:13:52,838 --> 00:13:57,389
If we sit waiting for him,
he determines the route.

136
00:13:57,558 --> 00:14:00,914
Martin, Stefan Lindberg
stopped by.

137
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:04,036
Yesterday?
-I forgot to tell you.

138
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:08,111
And now you tell us.
Didn't you have our mobile numbers?

139
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:11,873
He may have had
important information.

140
00:14:12,038 --> 00:14:16,873
I asked him to come.
-She don't know.

141
00:14:17,998 --> 00:14:19,397
Good day.

142
00:14:23,478 --> 00:14:27,107
He needs help few days a week.

143
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,274
I don't know.

144
00:14:31,718 --> 00:14:35,393
I'm going around some time
this afternoon to see how he's doing.

145
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:37,276
Absolutely.

146
00:14:38,318 --> 00:14:42,072
No, it doesn't matter.

147
00:14:42,238 --> 00:14:44,752
Hold on.

148
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:53,235
Sorry.

149
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:59,033
I will tell you just know
how it went. Thanks alot.

150
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,518
Were you talking to Veronika?

151
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:15,908
No, a colleague.

152
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:20,434
I want Veronika
and the kids back.

153
00:15:20,598 --> 00:15:22,953
Yes, of course.

154
00:15:23,118 --> 00:15:29,148
At the office, do they know where she is.
-No, you tell me now.

155
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:35,670
Where are they?

156
00:17:06,398 --> 00:17:09,515
Stefan Lindberg, this is Martin Rohde.

157
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:13,512
I know you're home.
Open up.

158
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:25,313
What were you doing?
-I was in bed. I had night shift.

159
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:29,236
I just wanted to come in.

160
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,027
Sure. Come in.

161
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,471
What ...

162
00:17:55,638 --> 00:17:59,950
What do you actually do?
-We run into each other a little too often.

163
00:18:00,118 --> 00:18:02,552
In several places.

164
00:18:02,718 --> 00:18:05,869
Now we're both
in the same place.

165
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:09,352
Are you nervous?
-No.

166
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:17,752
Without the murder of Kerstin Ekwall or
another celebrity I wouldn't know you now.

167
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:20,955
Celebrity. Do you have some
against promenant people?

168
00:18:21,118 --> 00:18:24,110
I don't mean that.
-Why did you say it?

169
00:18:24,278 --> 00:18:27,554
What do you mean?
-If you're working ...

170
00:18:27,718 --> 00:18:31,188
I see society is unjust.

171
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:34,236
But you can't solve that by force.
-How then?

172
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:37,071
I don't know.

173
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:51,469
Are you OK?
-Yeah. Why do you ask?

174
00:18:54,478 --> 00:18:58,187
Is this someone you know?

175
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,989
Are they homeless?

176
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:05,718
Addicts?

177
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:11,667
Why would I know them?
-Maybe you met them.

178
00:19:15,518 --> 00:19:20,228
I want Lasse Jönsson's file.
-This was his first visit.

179
00:19:20,398 --> 00:19:22,673
But he did have an appointment?

180
00:19:22,838 --> 00:19:26,035
He made it two months ago.

181
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:32,114
How many psychiatrists work here?
-Five. But they're never all here.

182
00:19:32,278 --> 00:19:35,668
So it was a coincidence
he came to see Fernskog.

183
00:19:35,838 --> 00:19:41,310
No, he specifically wanted have
an appointment with Emil today.

184
00:19:41,478 --> 00:19:45,835
I remember because Emil
previously had two cancellations.

185
00:19:45,998 --> 00:19:49,877
Then I called Lasse Jönsson ...

186
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:55,317
to say he could come earlier.
But he insisted on today.

187
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:02,476
Martin.
-Saga, here. Are you in the office?

188
00:20:02,638 --> 00:20:06,950
I'm with Stefan.
-See you in fifteen minutes?

189
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:09,712
I'll be there.
-Good.

190
00:20:09,878 --> 00:20:11,357
Until then.

191
00:20:11,518 --> 00:20:14,954
We must talk again later.

192
00:20:15,118 --> 00:20:16,915
Will you stay in town?
-What?

193
00:20:17,078 --> 00:20:20,627
You won't be travelling around
the world or anything?   -No.

194
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:24,268
My sister is sick, so I'll stay here.

195
00:20:24,438 --> 00:20:26,110
See ya.

196
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:43,477
What did Stefan Lindberg say?
Nothing, but there's something about him.

197
00:20:43,638 --> 00:20:45,276
We'll monitor him.

198
00:20:45,438 --> 00:20:47,554
You have to see this.

199
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:53,236
These two schizophrenics in Copenhagen
lived here and there.

200
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:57,471
The murders were
respectively here and there.

201
00:20:57,638 --> 00:21:02,666
The postman was killed
in the vestibule of the perpetrator.

202
00:21:02,838 --> 00:21:06,433
Lasse lived here ...

203
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,988
walked to the bus stop, took the bus ...

204
00:21:10,158 --> 00:21:15,107
got out, walked through
the park to practice ...

205
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:21,035
sat waiting in the waiting room and
killed Fernskog in the consulting room.

206
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:25,430
He made the appointment
with Fernskog eight weeks ago.

207
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:27,634
It was planned.
-Or worse.

208
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:31,029
Bjørn announced
he knew his kidnapper.

209
00:21:31,198 --> 00:21:35,077
Maybe Brammer and Ekwall
weren't symbols.

210
00:21:35,238 --> 00:21:38,947
You mean
he chose them?

211
00:21:39,118 --> 00:21:42,872
Gry see if there is a connection
among the victims.

212
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:47,236
Have they found Lasse' apartment?
-It is being investigated.

213
00:22:04,998 --> 00:22:09,753
The four officers were acquitted.
The statement called for restraint.

214
00:22:09,918 --> 00:22:14,787
Last year, four immigrants
were convicted of assault ...

215
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,791
although wasn't certain
who the perpetrator was.

216
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:25,353
Jesper Anderson, you follow
the growth of organized crime.

217
00:22:25,518 --> 00:22:30,353
What does this sentence mean?
-This is a serious matter.

218
00:22:30,518 --> 00:22:34,477
This sends the wrong signal.
-Explain.

219
00:22:34,638 --> 00:22:42,067
We work with young people
and try to build trust.

220
00:22:42,238 --> 00:22:48,188
But after such a verdict
there isn't anthing left.

221
00:22:48,358 --> 00:22:53,352
This is compared with the trial
of the four immigrants last year.

222
00:22:53,518 --> 00:22:56,430
I understand it happens.

223
00:22:56,598 --> 00:23:00,637
It appears again
we aren't equal before the law.

224
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:02,834
That's a problem.

225
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:09,267
Both for the police and for society
deserving of our attention.

226
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:12,191
Thank you, Jesper Anderson.

227
00:23:14,878 --> 00:23:18,154
Lucky, I wasn't there.
-We're going to appeal.

228
00:23:18,318 --> 00:23:21,230
It doesn't help.
-It's all we can do.

229
00:23:21,398 --> 00:23:26,756
Not you, no. If something's gonna happen,
you have to do it yourself.

230
00:23:26,918 --> 00:23:31,196
Where you going?
-On the street, with my friends.

231
00:23:31,358 --> 00:23:34,111
Stay away from them.

232
00:23:35,478 --> 00:23:37,469
Saif, stay home.

233
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:42,315
We're urging the sender
of the package to contact us.

234
00:23:42,478 --> 00:23:46,437
That does nothing. Anything else?
-Navid?

235
00:23:50,078 --> 00:23:54,549
He swallowed clozapine.
Looks like he followed the dosage.

236
00:23:54,718 --> 00:23:57,312
Get it analysed.

237
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:00,276
It was in his apartment.

238
00:24:01,838 --> 00:24:04,398
Properly signed.
-But not by him.

239
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:09,712
The pen in the flat has
various fingerprints.

240
00:24:09,878 --> 00:24:12,028
Do you know who?
-Not yet.

241
00:24:12,198 --> 00:24:15,508
It's a small hand.
Not an adult.

242
00:24:15,678 --> 00:24:18,511
Someone with the initials AB.

243
00:24:22,718 --> 00:24:25,437
Charlotte Söringer. Am I interrupting?
-No.

244
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:30,547
I have found something in Göran's belongings.
-What have you found?

245
00:24:30,718 --> 00:24:34,597
An archive.
It's easier if you just look.

246
00:24:34,758 --> 00:24:37,989
I'll come right away.
-Great.

247
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:43,226
Charlotte Söringer found something.
-What then?

248
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:46,868
An archive. I'm going there now.
-Great.

249
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:53,428
This he called his black archive.

250
00:24:53,598 --> 00:24:57,637
With all complaints
that were filed against him.

251
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:00,232
Legal correspondence.

252
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:03,788
Tenants Associations, the environmental service.

253
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:07,837
People who had a case against him.

254
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:17,349
There is also a folder of hate mail.

255
00:25:24,118 --> 00:25:27,952
Can you do something with?
-I'll have someone look at it.

256
00:25:30,678 --> 00:25:34,148
Do you have to go right back?
-Yes.

257
00:26:47,118 --> 00:26:50,235
He's leaving. We'll follow him.

258
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:43,677
Martin.
-Where are you?

259
00:27:43,838 --> 00:27:47,990
At Charlotte Söringer's.
-Still? Why?

260
00:27:48,158 --> 00:27:52,788
I'll be there in about twenty minutes.
-Did she have any news for us?

261
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:58,271
I've got an archive.
-Did it take so long to get that?

262
00:27:58,438 --> 00:28:00,952
I'm coming. See you soon.

263
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:09,117
How does it feel to cheat on your wife?

264
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:14,952
I remember what Göran did.

265
00:28:21,358 --> 00:28:23,713
This isn't the first time, right?

266
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:28,026
It's some time ago.

267
00:28:41,918 --> 00:28:44,671
Take care of yourself.

268
00:28:48,678 --> 00:28:51,146
Did I miss something?
-No.

269
00:28:51,318 --> 00:28:54,867
The cameras at Lasse' apartment 
haven't yielded anything.

270
00:28:55,038 --> 00:29:00,066
We don't need to see Lasse.
I think he never went out the door.

271
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:06,586
Our man also avoided the cameras. 
He didn't stand in front of it.

272
00:29:06,758 --> 00:29:11,468
Stop. Stop. Go back.

273
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:16,909
There. She turns around
when she sees the officer.

274
00:29:17,078 --> 00:29:22,152
That might be his roommate.
-Lasse said nothing about a roommate.

275
00:29:22,318 --> 00:29:26,470
According to the lab, the drugs of
all four are placebos.

276
00:29:26,638 --> 00:29:30,153
They didn't swallow anything 
for schizophrenia for months.

277
00:29:30,318 --> 00:29:34,675
Thank you.
The Göran Söringer archive.

278
00:29:34,838 --> 00:29:39,354
Go through them with Navid and see if 
you find a name in the investigation.

279
00:29:40,718 --> 00:29:43,073
Can I see her again?

280
00:29:46,238 --> 00:29:48,035
See that sign?
-Yes.

281
00:29:48,198 --> 00:29:50,393
Ellborns' Fur.

282
00:30:07,638 --> 00:30:11,187
The windows were smashed three times.

283
00:30:11,358 --> 00:30:14,828
Red paint splashed everywhere.
And what did the police do?

284
00:30:14,998 --> 00:30:19,549
Vandalism isn't a priority.
-For me it is.

285
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:22,516
But I'm talking about us.

286
00:30:22,678 --> 00:30:24,270
Is that all?

287
00:30:24,438 --> 00:30:28,636
The images are
 kept only for 48 hours.

288
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:32,347
I'll send someone to issue a citation.
-Why?

289
00:30:32,518 --> 00:30:36,193
The camera in the window is illegal.
-No way.

290
00:30:37,238 --> 00:30:41,117
Wasn't that a joke?
-She never makes jokes.

291
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:43,234
I'll see what I can do.

292
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:51,308
Are there any rules you don't follow?
-Why?

293
00:30:51,478 --> 00:30:54,276
I'm just wondering.

294
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:58,113
Rules are there to be followed.

295
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:00,155
You mean the camera?

296
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:02,707
That's illegal.

297
00:31:02,878 --> 00:31:04,994
He's helping us.
-Maybe.

298
00:31:05,158 --> 00:31:08,787
He wants to help us.
He was helpful.

299
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:12,109
And then you'd 
condone anything?

300
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:14,234
I don't mean that.

301
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:19,711
If anyone wants to help us, you'd
prosecute him for something else.

302
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,517
Why not?

303
00:31:22,678 --> 00:31:27,115
You just don't.
These are unwritten rules.

304
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:31,916
I don't know.

305
00:31:32,078 --> 00:31:35,593
It's me. I'm on my way home.

306
00:31:35,758 --> 00:31:41,628
Can we eat together?
Yes, all together. For a change.

307
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:44,312
That would be great.

308
00:31:44,478 --> 00:31:48,790
I'm coming home.
Saga sends her greetings.

309
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:53,631
Why did you say that?

310
00:31:53,798 --> 00:31:57,473
I didn't send greetings to her.

311
00:31:57,638 --> 00:32:02,234
But I had to do it.
Is that an unwritten rule?

312
00:32:03,478 --> 00:32:07,312
I'm going home. Call me if Johan 
finds something on the video.

313
00:32:21,438 --> 00:32:25,033
A murderer lives near you?
-Nice, right?

314
00:32:25,198 --> 00:32:30,636
The addresses of psychiatric patients.
What is wrong with you? Is that legal?

315
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:32,834
I asked just one question.

316
00:32:32,998 --> 00:32:36,070
He just wants people to be afraid.

317
00:32:36,238 --> 00:32:40,026
He just wants to identify
what the problems are.

318
00:32:40,198 --> 00:32:45,067
Not every psychiatric patient
is a potential killer.

319
00:32:45,238 --> 00:32:48,548
That was so this morning
in four cases.

320
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:03,157
The parents of the boy
who killed the postman ...

321
00:33:03,318 --> 00:33:09,029
have been trying for weeks
 to get their son committed.

322
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:11,428
We need to write about that.

323
00:33:11,598 --> 00:33:16,467
You don't decide what we write.
-No, the TT does.

324
00:33:16,638 --> 00:33:20,028
You are a dork
he's making use of.

325
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:25,033
That's better than being 
an ordinary fool. Or is it?

326
00:33:28,678 --> 00:33:33,354
Please delet my name
if you update this nonsense.

327
00:33:35,918 --> 00:33:41,356
Glad you're here.
This is the fur shop's video.

328
00:33:41,518 --> 00:33:43,907
Lasse Jönsson is nowhere to be seen.

329
00:33:44,078 --> 00:33:48,230
But his potential roommate
is there three times.

330
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:50,389
Here.

331
00:33:52,438 --> 00:33:54,952
That's all.

332
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:58,827
We must know who that is.
-This is Anja Björk.

333
00:33:58,998 --> 00:34:02,707
She disappeared two days ago
in Copenhagen.

334
00:34:02,878 --> 00:34:05,631
Anja Björk.
-Are we going to find her?

335
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:12,112
Keep it quiet that she's involved in 
this investigation. Otherwise she's at risk.

336
00:34:18,478 --> 00:34:22,756
This had already been cleaned.
-I know.

337
00:34:23,998 --> 00:34:27,877
Is it so difficult to ask 
him to do something ?

338
00:34:28,038 --> 00:34:31,428
He finds it difficult
to adapt.

339
00:34:31,598 --> 00:34:33,907
And so must we adapt?

340
00:34:34,078 --> 00:34:37,468
You don't notice he's here.
-Exactly.

341
00:34:37,638 --> 00:34:40,357
The twins help more than him.

342
00:34:42,198 --> 00:34:46,635
What would happen if you 
placed damands on him?

343
00:34:46,798 --> 00:34:49,266
No idea.

344
00:34:49,438 --> 00:34:51,588
Give him some time.

345
00:34:52,638 --> 00:34:56,074
And as long as we 
still keep "Hotel Rohde" open?

346
00:34:56,238 --> 00:34:58,798
For me it's new too.

347
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:01,153
Give him a chance.

348
00:35:02,318 --> 00:35:04,513
Is dinner ready?

349
00:35:12,518 --> 00:35:15,988
August, the door bell.

350
00:35:22,118 --> 00:35:26,157
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.
Does Martin Rohde live here?

351
00:35:26,318 --> 00:35:28,195
Is he home?

352
00:35:30,798 --> 00:35:34,074
What is it?
-I know who the girl is.

353
00:35:34,238 --> 00:35:37,674
Her name is Anja Björk, 14 years old,
ran away from home.

354
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:40,306
We're about to eat. Do 
you want to eat here?

355
00:35:40,478 --> 00:35:42,628
We have no time.
-Yes.

356
00:35:42,798 --> 00:35:47,314
And this is faster than just going to
the supermarket. We're eating 'biksemad'.

357
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:50,038
Hash.

358
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:59,112
This is Carl, Johanne and Nikolai.

359
00:35:59,278 --> 00:36:03,351
The young man staring 
at you is August.

360
00:36:03,518 --> 00:36:05,986
Mette know already.

361
00:36:06,478 --> 00:36:10,357
Aren't you going to greet 
my colleague here?

362
00:36:10,518 --> 00:36:15,672
Charlotte Söringer gave me this.
-That was nice of her.

363
00:36:18,758 --> 00:36:21,591
Sit down.

364
00:36:28,638 --> 00:36:32,916
You can get the recipe.
-No, it wasn't good.

365
00:36:33,078 --> 00:36:35,273
Just leave it on the plate.

366
00:36:35,438 --> 00:36:39,670
I also want to leave it.
-You just eat what's on your plate.

367
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:44,354
Why are you looking at me like that?
-I'm not.

368
00:36:44,518 --> 00:36:47,078
August is a fan of the TT.

369
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:50,514
Not because of what he does.
The murders and stuff.

370
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:54,910
But he highlights important
problems. He's a genius.

371
00:36:55,078 --> 00:36:58,309
He has planned 
everything extremely well.

372
00:36:58,478 --> 00:37:01,788
He's no genius.
-That is just what you see.

373
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:03,994
I know nobody like him.

374
00:37:04,158 --> 00:37:09,027
Exactly. He's Michelangelo,
while the others work with finger paints.

375
00:37:09,198 --> 00:37:11,666
That's a good comparison.

376
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:14,477
So you're a fan?

377
00:37:14,638 --> 00:37:18,551
I understand him. 
I understand how he thinks.

378
00:37:18,718 --> 00:37:20,390
We're coming.

379
00:37:20,558 --> 00:37:24,028
Anja Björk's mother
is en route to the office.

380
00:37:24,198 --> 00:37:28,794
Nice to meet you, Saga.
Too bad you didn't like it.

381
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:31,677
Thanks for the food.

382
00:37:34,438 --> 00:37:36,190
See you later.

383
00:37:43,238 --> 00:37:45,911
That's all I can do for you.

384
00:37:48,198 --> 00:37:52,111
She can still come home?
-Yes, I promise.

385
00:37:52,278 --> 00:37:58,751
You can't promise. We'll do
our best, but we can't promise anything.

386
00:38:01,198 --> 00:38:04,747
Will you make further contact?

387
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:19,826
You know sometimes what you say?
-What?

388
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:23,991
Do you know what you say?

389
00:38:24,158 --> 00:38:29,027
We can't promise
she'll come back. She may be dead.

390
00:38:29,198 --> 00:38:34,591
Eight days ago she was alive.
-Therefore, she can now be dead.

391
00:38:34,758 --> 00:38:38,797
30 percent of all people
who disappear, don't come back.

392
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:45,952
I know.

393
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:50,031
And I think they
 know that too.

394
00:38:50,198 --> 00:38:54,714
But sometimes you have to tell people
what they want to hear ...

395
00:38:54,878 --> 00:38:57,073
even if it isn't true.

396
00:38:59,758 --> 00:39:04,468
Martin, wait. So people 
sometimes want to be lied to?

397
00:39:04,638 --> 00:39:07,869
Yes sometimes people want
to be told a lie.

398
00:39:08,038 --> 00:39:13,351
What do we say
if she is dead? You promised.

399
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,635
Now you're getting on my nerves.
-Oh yeah?

400
00:39:18,998 --> 00:39:22,070
But Anja ...
-What about her?

401
00:39:22,238 --> 00:39:26,231
She isn't the only one who knows him.
-No, but he doesn't says anything.

402
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:29,629
Maybe we'e asking
the wrong questions.

403
00:39:35,878 --> 00:39:39,473
I want to talk about Anja.
She stayed with you.

404
00:39:41,558 --> 00:39:44,595
Did you like her?

405
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:47,318
She signed for you.

406
00:39:54,038 --> 00:39:58,748
The man you killed for
has done this.

407
00:39:58,918 --> 00:40:01,034
And this.

408
00:40:02,718 --> 00:40:04,754
And this.

409
00:40:08,078 --> 00:40:10,034
And this.

410
00:40:10,198 --> 00:40:14,157
He'll do the same to Anja
if we don't catch him.

411
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:17,071
Do you want that?

412
00:40:17,238 --> 00:40:19,706
Do you want that?

413
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:25,071
If we catch him, Anja is safe.

414
00:40:25,238 --> 00:40:29,948
But we need to know
what he looks like. What does he look like?

415
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:35,358
Lasse, what does he look like?

416
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:44,307
He is tall, with blue eyes, plaid
coat, hat, scarf and gloves.

417
00:40:44,478 --> 00:40:47,868
What did you say?
Tall, blue eyes, plaid jacket ...

418
00:40:48,038 --> 00:40:50,506
hat, scarf and gloves.

419
00:40:52,478 --> 00:40:55,470
You must speak louder.
-Tall, blue eyes, plaid jacket ...

420
00:40:55,638 --> 00:40:57,469
and gloves.
-But ...

421
00:40:57,638 --> 00:41:04,191
He's tall, he has brown hair,
he wears one scarf and gloves.

422
00:41:05,438 --> 00:41:11,354
He is tall, with blue eyes, he wears
a plaid jacket and gloves.

423
00:41:15,318 --> 00:41:19,994
That's him. She has seen him.
-He isn't on the other videos.

424
00:41:20,158 --> 00:41:21,750
He avoids the cameras.

425
00:41:21,918 --> 00:41:26,867
No. He doesn't know Anja's a
threat. We need to find her.

426
00:41:27,038 --> 00:41:30,553
Every officer in the region
is looking for her.

427
00:41:30,718 --> 00:41:35,667
Does Anja's father where she is?
-He had no idea.

428
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:40,832
We need to find her.
-You can't look everywhere.

429
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,877
You can't, and you can't go
everywhere. Do you hear me?

430
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:31,269
Are you Daniel?

431
00:42:31,438 --> 00:42:33,588
Daniel Ferbé?
-Yes.

432
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:39,392
What the hell is that?

433
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:43,107
The stone was thrown through my window.

434
00:42:43,278 --> 00:42:47,157
I'm Mark Bolin.
Perhaps you recognize my name.

435
00:42:47,318 --> 00:42:50,754
You have just published my address.

436
00:42:57,118 --> 00:43:00,190
Relax, I won't hit you.

437
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:05,112
I wanted to tell you
the problems your articles cause.

438
00:43:05,278 --> 00:43:09,635
That's sad.
But I just write.

439
00:43:11,278 --> 00:43:15,237
I'm not responsible
for what people do.

440
00:43:15,398 --> 00:43:18,913
Jesus, that's pretty easy.

441
00:43:19,078 --> 00:43:22,468
You don't care about the consequences.

442
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:27,912
Good luck in life.

443
00:43:28,078 --> 00:43:30,433
Good luck.

444
00:43:40,438 --> 00:43:44,954
One more. Do you want another one?
-Don't you want something stronger?

445
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:04,227
You recognize me?

446
00:44:04,398 --> 00:44:07,196
Oh yes. We had sex.

447
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:08,757
Right.

448
00:44:09,958 --> 00:44:13,030
Anton Cederlund.

449
00:44:13,198 --> 00:44:15,758
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.

450
00:44:17,558 --> 00:44:21,187
Do you want a drink?
-I gotta eat something first.

451
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:24,589
First?
-If we are going to have sex.

452
00:44:24,758 --> 00:44:26,953
I haven't eaten all day.

453
00:45:08,758 --> 00:45:13,036
That was Saga Norén,
Malmö CID.

454
00:45:13,198 --> 00:45:16,827
She is special.

455
00:45:16,998 --> 00:45:20,070
Occasionally I want to shake her.

456
00:45:20,238 --> 00:45:22,991
But she has something special.

457
00:45:23,158 --> 00:45:25,467
We're a good team.

458
00:45:27,198 --> 00:45:31,555
Nice of her to bring your wallet.

459
00:45:31,718 --> 00:45:34,994
Didn't you not notice
you lost it?

460
00:45:35,158 --> 00:45:37,274
No, so.

461
00:45:38,798 --> 00:45:42,473
Who is Charlotte?

462
00:45:43,518 --> 00:45:46,794
Charlotte is one of
the property owners.

463
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:49,836
She paid the twenty million.

464
00:45:57,158 --> 00:46:00,150
Do you know you're super sexy?

465
00:47:33,718 --> 00:47:38,508
We see Anja Björk on corner
of Adelgata and Östergata. Over.

466
00:47:59,318 --> 00:48:01,707
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.

467
00:48:04,358 --> 00:48:07,111
Well. I'm coming.

468
00:48:07,278 --> 00:48:09,553
I've got to go.

469
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:33,274
Henning?

470
00:50:40,678 --> 00:50:42,908
Are you drunk?

471
00:50:43,078 --> 00:50:45,387
Yes, a little.

472
00:50:47,198 --> 00:50:49,507
How'd you know?

473
00:50:52,518 --> 00:50:57,592
I heard the verdict.
Did you speak to Lillian?

474
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:01,357
Yes, I have spoken to her.

475
00:51:01,518 --> 00:51:04,430
What did she say?

476
00:51:05,718 --> 00:51:09,393
No. Nothing I want to hear.

477
00:51:29,558 --> 00:51:32,709
Let go but, Saif.
It's late.

478
00:51:33,998 --> 00:51:36,717
I understand you're disappointed.

479
00:51:36,878 --> 00:51:40,109
We did what was right.
-You, yes. I didn't.

480
00:51:40,278 --> 00:51:45,352
We'll file in appeal. We will go
to the media, talk with journalists.

481
00:51:45,518 --> 00:51:47,156
That doesn't help.

482
00:51:47,318 --> 00:51:51,630
Yes. We live Denmark.
Here it's better.

483
00:51:52,838 --> 00:51:56,467
You are lost your son
and they weren't punished.

484
00:51:56,638 --> 00:52:00,472
Listen. You solve nothing 
with hatred and revenge.

485
00:52:03,558 --> 00:52:08,234
I want you behind this.
You mean everything to me, Saif.

486
00:52:08,398 --> 00:52:10,389
I suppose so.

487
00:52:11,438 --> 00:52:16,034
Your brother didn't listen. He went
his own way and now we've lost him.

488
00:52:16,198 --> 00:52:18,029
You won't get rid of me.

489
00:52:18,198 --> 00:52:23,113
I feel I've already lost you.
That's how it feels sometimes.

490
00:52:25,238 --> 00:52:28,548
Saif?
-I gotta go.

491
00:53:15,238 --> 00:53:17,354
Remember him?

492
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:21,672
Did he shoot you?

493
00:53:32,438 --> 00:53:34,952
If you draw, I'll pick him up.

494
00:53:41,558 --> 00:53:43,708
Will I die?

495
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,789
No.

496
00:54:11,678 --> 00:54:13,475
Anything else?

497
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:20,794
Anything else?

498
00:55:09,078 --> 00:55:13,993
We found nothing in the garage.
How's Anja?

499
00:55:14,158 --> 00:55:16,592
She died 20 minutes ago.

500
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:23,235
Did she?
-Yes.

501
00:55:27,678 --> 00:55:30,829
Really?
-She drew that.

502
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:40,309
D'you see who it is?

503
00:55:42,118 --> 00:55:44,951
It's Stefan Lindberg.

504
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:49,636
Don't you see?

505
00:55:49,798 --> 00:55:52,266
His eyes.

1
00:00:00,848 --> 00:00:03,237
previously...

2
00:00:09,088 --> 00:00:13,001
Daniel Ferbé.
-What a sad front page.

3
00:00:13,168 --> 00:00:16,843
I try make people
aware of problems.

4
00:00:17,008 --> 00:00:21,718
According to Daniel Ferbé, the TT
said he's behind it.

5
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:24,880
Due to budget cuts
in psychiatry.

6
00:00:25,048 --> 00:00:28,961
You need to talk.
You committed a murder for him.

7
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:33,440
Look at me when I talk to you.
Don't take him into custody.

8
00:00:33,608 --> 00:00:37,920
There. She turns when she
sees the officer. Is that his roommate?

9
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:41,637
I want to talk about Anja.
She stayed with you.

10
00:00:43,328 --> 00:00:46,718
The man you killed for,
did this.

11
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,358
And this.

12
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:52,519
And this.

13
00:00:52,688 --> 00:00:57,637
He'll do the same to Anja
if we don't find. Do you want that?

14
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:02,202
That's him. We need to find her.

15
00:01:02,368 --> 00:01:05,997
We've sighted Anja Björk, at
the corner of Adelgata and Östergata.

16
00:01:15,168 --> 00:01:19,525
Stefan? I see you're home.
Open up.

17
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:21,440
What did Lindberg say?
-Nothing.

18
00:01:21,608 --> 00:01:24,805
But there's something about him.
-We'll monitor him.

19
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:29,484
Soon I'll get fired.
-I'll do my best to prevent it.

20
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:34,963
The four officers were acquitted.
The verdict called for resistance.

21
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:39,758
Last year, four immigrants
were convicted of assault ...

22
00:01:39,928 --> 00:01:42,317
even if it wasn't clear
who the culprit was.

23
00:01:42,488 --> 00:01:44,718
We must take action.

24
00:01:46,248 --> 00:01:48,603
Where are you going?
Stay home.

25
00:02:27,808 --> 00:02:29,366
Henning?

26
00:02:38,968 --> 00:02:40,526
Are you here?

27
00:04:18,568 --> 00:04:20,559
Good morning.

28
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:23,959
And goodnight. I'll go to sleep.

29
00:04:25,328 --> 00:04:29,480
Did you just come home or going away?
-So you can ask that, yes.

30
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:32,166
I'm leaving.

31
00:04:34,248 --> 00:04:37,285
Can you help out at home today?
-What?

32
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:41,680
With everything that has to be done
when Mette comes home with the kids.

33
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:46,603
She never asked for help.
-That shouldn't have been necessary.

34
00:04:46,768 --> 00:04:48,326
That's good.

35
00:04:50,568 --> 00:04:53,162
Will you see Saga today?
-Yes.

36
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:57,559
Do you enjoy working together?
-Nice ...

37
00:05:02,888 --> 00:05:07,962
She is an amazing
good detective ...

38
00:05:08,128 --> 00:05:10,164
but fun?

39
00:05:11,368 --> 00:05:13,324
Yes, we like it.

40
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:16,321
We have fun,
but she's pretty special.

41
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:20,117
In what way?
-All ways.

42
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:25,080
Is she single?

43
00:05:33,928 --> 00:05:37,364
What?
-I just asked.

44
00:05:37,528 --> 00:05:41,885
What do you ask?
-Whether she's single.

45
00:05:44,568 --> 00:05:47,321
Yes, she's single.

46
00:05:47,488 --> 00:05:51,367
No one would be
able to stand her.

47
00:05:53,248 --> 00:05:54,806
See you later.

48
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:16,367
Sorry to bother you,
but I'm really worried.

49
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:20,680
Perhaps it's about revenge.
You hear a lot about their gangs.

50
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:24,761
But you've seen nothing in the house
that's amiss?

51
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:30,958
He's just never
disappeared in this way.

52
00:06:31,128 --> 00:06:36,043
He was determined to be alone.
That trial had ground him down.

53
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:40,884
I'll ask if anyone here knows anything.
I'll call you when I know more.

54
00:06:41,048 --> 00:06:42,959
That's good, thank you.

55
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:46,006
Maybe he's already home.
-Maybe.

56
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:48,636
And wondering where I am.

57
00:06:49,528 --> 00:06:53,680
Thank you for your time.
-No thanks necessary.

58
00:07:15,008 --> 00:07:18,159
Where were you?
-In the cemetery.

59
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:21,798
Why?
-That's my sister.

60
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:26,484
How did he know Anja? She was
never connected to this investigation.

61
00:07:26,648 --> 00:07:30,561
We were the only ones who knew
why we were looking for her.

62
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:34,960
Would anyone leak the information?
-I don't know.

63
00:07:35,128 --> 00:07:36,800
Take a look.

64
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:42,605
How good they look together?
-Good. Look at the look.

65
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:47,521
He ducks all the time.

66
00:07:47,688 --> 00:07:51,601
He was home all evening
When Anja was shot.

67
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:56,000
As it is, let's see him alone and
what he wants us to see.

68
00:07:57,048 --> 00:07:59,198
It isn't enough.

69
00:07:59,368 --> 00:08:02,087
Then let's look further.
Come on.

70
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:10,245
We need a search warrant.

71
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:14,924
Do you want to arrested me for burglary?

72
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:19,366
No, I'm just saying we
need a search warrant.

73
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:22,838
Only a Sweden would
be as upstanding as that.

74
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:51,880
Did you regret it?

75
00:08:52,768 --> 00:08:59,287
The prosecution gave permission.
-Good. Where do you start?

76
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:03,521
I'll do the kitchen and you the bedroom.
-Agreed.

77
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:25,000
In the bedroom.

78
00:09:29,608 --> 00:09:35,205
This is a great first aid station.
Does he play doctor?

79
00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:42,959
This is as big as the needle
that drained Bjørn's blood.

80
00:09:45,928 --> 00:09:49,841
This certainly isn't
destined for Africa.

81
00:09:50,008 --> 00:09:51,726
This isn't enough.

82
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:57,763
Is there a connection or something?

83
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,607
You're late.

84
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:28,997
What did you do tonight?
-Nothing. I just hung around.

85
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:31,204
For four hours?

86
00:10:32,888 --> 00:10:34,321
I hung around.

87
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:39,278
Who were you with?
Yassir and the others?

88
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:45,206
Listen. You can stay out
as long as you want.

89
00:10:45,368 --> 00:10:50,203
You can go wherever you want.
But promise me one thing.

90
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:55,920
I won't gett called by the
hospital or the police. Got it?

91
00:10:57,168 --> 00:10:58,806
Do we have a deal?

92
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,802
There was a letter for you at the door.

93
00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:23,804
Did you see
who left it there?

94
00:11:23,968 --> 00:11:26,198
What's in it?
-Nothing.

95
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,802
What are you going to do?

96
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:43,961
What do you mean? Today?
-No, he no longer calls.

97
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:48,246
If you are a journalist again
like everyone else here.

98
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,842
That will never happen.
-Oh, no?

99
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:56,560
I'll always be the man who had
direct contact with a horrible killer.

100
00:11:56,728 --> 00:12:00,607
People forget quickly.
-I'll keep reminding them.

101
00:12:00,768 --> 00:12:05,125
I think I'll write a book.
Maybe two or three.

102
00:12:08,288 --> 00:12:10,006
What are you thinking?

103
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:18,647
You look really like shit. I'm
worried about you, is that so strange?

104
00:12:19,728 --> 00:12:21,559
So is he.

105
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:28,320
Someone's been arrested who may
know him. Should I check this?

106
00:12:28,488 --> 00:12:32,367
Did they find someone?
-A social worker.

107
00:12:32,528 --> 00:12:33,961
Do we know his name?

108
00:12:34,648 --> 00:12:36,718
I'm not him.

109
00:12:36,888 --> 00:12:40,483
What do you do with all those drugs
and first aid stuff?

110
00:12:40,648 --> 00:12:44,607
You've been to my home.
-That was me, yes.

111
00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:49,437
It isn't forbidden to do that.
-What do you do with it?

112
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:53,567
If someone gets hurt.
-That often happens in your neighborhood?

113
00:12:53,728 --> 00:12:55,286
Just in case.

114
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,758
Do you know who this is?

115
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:02,878
Should I know?

116
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:07,007
Where were you last night between 10 and 12?
- In the evening?

117
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:10,126
In the evening, yes.
-I was home watching TV.

118
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:14,725
What did you watch?
-Nothing special. I was channel surfing.

119
00:13:14,888 --> 00:13:19,518
So you can't name a specific
program you watched.

120
00:13:19,688 --> 00:13:23,078
No, I can't remember anything.
-Do you speak Danish?

121
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:26,842
I'm not the man you're looking for.

122
00:13:28,768 --> 00:13:31,646
These are wine boxes
from a crime scene.

123
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:37,603
And this comes from your apartment.
Same type of wine.

124
00:13:39,728 --> 00:13:41,764
Yes, I see it.

125
00:13:41,928 --> 00:13:44,567
Why is all this blood
in your bedroom?

126
00:13:44,728 --> 00:13:47,117
What blood?

127
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:57,047
We'll come back for a blood sample.
-That is okay.

128
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:02,927
Can I go?
-That you can't. You stay here.

129
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:11,120
Please. Good day and goodbye.
-Goodbye.

130
00:14:27,608 --> 00:14:30,076
"Closed"

131
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:36,678
What is this?

132
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:40,726
What do you want? What is your purpose?

133
00:15:41,768 --> 00:15:46,523
The thing with your brother, that's not ...
-Shut up about my brother.

134
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:51,887
I can explain about your brother ...
-Shut up about my brother.

135
00:15:52,048 --> 00:15:55,085
Shut up about my brother.
-Listen ...

136
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:59,799
What are you doing here in the basement?
How did you get here?

137
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:02,562
What do you mean?
-What do you mean?

138
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:08,917
You've dragged me here?
Will you release me?

139
00:16:10,328 --> 00:16:14,037
Will you untie me?
-Why should I release you?

140
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,166
Then we'll rectify
that thing with your brother.

141
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:22,197
Upstairs we'll explain
how it all went.

142
00:16:22,368 --> 00:16:25,565
Then we'll explain what happened?

143
00:16:25,728 --> 00:16:31,200
I didn't do it. I'm very sad about
what happened to your brother ...

144
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:35,600
You won't get your brother
back by doing this.

145
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:40,239
That's exactly what I won't get.
I won't get my brother back.

146
00:16:40,408 --> 00:16:43,241
When did your sister died?

147
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:46,161
Fifteen years ago.
-Your parents?

148
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:51,083
I was younger. 7 years old. She was 14.
-Just like Anja.

149
00:16:54,328 --> 00:16:57,525
How did she die?
-Suicide.

150
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,006
Were you close?

151
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:07,201
I guess so. She lived with me.

152
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,646
Why not with her parents?
-She didn't want to.

153
00:17:15,528 --> 00:17:17,439
Suicide?

154
00:17:19,608 --> 00:17:21,917
She jumped in front of a train.

155
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:26,120
Was she depressed?
Did she show signs?

156
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:32,002
I'm not good at signs.

157
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:36,806
He asked for you.

158
00:17:46,328 --> 00:17:50,116
I help people.
-We know.

159
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:52,597
It's almost more than a job.

160
00:17:52,768 --> 00:17:57,284
Our society leaves many weak
people in the lurch. I help them.

161
00:17:57,448 --> 00:18:03,398
You can do that with food, cash, clothes,
drugs, sometimes with housing.

162
00:18:03,568 --> 00:18:06,082
How do you pay for that?
Have you inherited money?

163
00:18:06,248 --> 00:18:10,446
There are many ways
you can fool the system.

164
00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:14,362
Give a name of someone
you helped this week.

165
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:17,281
I can't, and you know it.

166
00:18:17,448 --> 00:18:21,441
There is a priest
who can confirm it.

167
00:18:21,608 --> 00:18:23,644
The blood in your apartment?

168
00:18:27,768 --> 00:18:30,760
The only thing I can think of ...

169
00:18:30,928 --> 00:18:35,683
I had a refugee visiting
who had to leave the country.

170
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:41,286
He cut himself. I stopped
the bleeding and bandaged him.

171
00:18:41,448 --> 00:18:45,885
Where is that refugee now?
-I don't know.

172
00:18:57,608 --> 00:19:00,361
Do we know anything
about the blood in the apartment?

173
00:19:00,528 --> 00:19:04,407
It isn't the victim's
or Stefan's.

174
00:19:04,568 --> 00:19:06,365
An unknown death?

175
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:11,204
Our perpetrator won't kill in his own
house. Then he'd erase all traces.

176
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:16,840
I don't believe the story of the refugee.
-Stefan isn't the man we're looking for.

177
00:19:17,008 --> 00:19:21,763
At least the priest confirms
the story about the refugee.

178
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:28,197
Our culprit is socially disengaged.
-No. He wants to pick certain people.

179
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:34,238
Do we spend more time and energy on
Lindberg? Then I'll to release him.

180
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:39,436
Wait a bit.
I want to talk with Daniel Ferbé first.

181
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:43,440
Gry, I need your help. Come on.

182
00:19:50,048 --> 00:19:55,566
Just go to my boss if you want
to say anything about the publication of his name.

183
00:19:56,888 --> 00:19:58,526
It isn't him.

184
00:20:00,568 --> 00:20:05,801
Stefan Lindberg isn't the man we're
looking for. He's been released now.

185
00:20:05,968 --> 00:20:12,282
Have you already published?
-No. I don't begrudge you a scoop.

186
00:20:12,448 --> 00:20:15,963
Why?
-It can help our investigation.

187
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:21,919
You can quote an anonymous source and
add that he doesn't speak Danish.

188
00:20:23,928 --> 00:20:27,364
Stefan doesn't speak Danish?
-No.

189
00:20:28,488 --> 00:20:29,967
Well?

190
00:20:31,088 --> 00:20:35,366
What should I do?
-Write that we were mistaken.

191
00:20:38,128 --> 00:20:42,041
I'm giving this to you alone
because Saga likes the articles you write.

192
00:20:53,848 --> 00:20:55,566
Damn.

193
00:20:55,728 --> 00:21:01,007
Damn, say. Pardon me.
There's a toilet outside.

194
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:33,124
How is it?
-It looks like I peed chocolate.

195
00:21:33,288 --> 00:21:36,041
In my opinion
it'll wash out.

196
00:21:39,288 --> 00:21:43,600
When do you explain to the press?
-How long do you need?

197
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:46,680
One hour.
-You'll get two.

198
00:21:57,288 --> 00:22:00,086
What is that?
-Daniel's SIM card.

199
00:22:00,248 --> 00:22:03,126
Why?
-It's from his mobile.

200
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:05,882
Did he give it to you?
-Not at all.

201
00:22:06,048 --> 00:22:08,562
If our killer calls, you answer.

202
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:12,084
Initiative: 1, insight: 0.
Misconduct.

203
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,045
You don't want to do it?

204
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:19,879
He's posted something new.

205
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:33,801
Why just Henning and not the rest?
-I don't know.

206
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:44,325
Have you seen it?
-Yes.

207
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,001
Does he have Henning?

208
00:22:46,168 --> 00:22:50,047
I think so. His wife said
he disappeared last night .

209
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:53,280
I'll deploy the whole force.
-That'll lead to riots.

210
00:22:53,448 --> 00:22:55,837
Do you have a better idea?
-No.

211
00:23:22,088 --> 00:23:24,648
Saif, why did you close up?

212
00:23:25,888 --> 00:23:28,448
I had to do something.

213
00:23:29,728 --> 00:23:32,959
Did you hear?
One of those officers was kidnapped.

214
00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:35,926
They think he's here in Nørrebro.

215
00:23:41,648 --> 00:23:43,878
There'll be fighting in the streets.

216
00:23:45,728 --> 00:23:48,720
Saif, here. We need to see each other.

217
00:23:48,888 --> 00:23:52,597
Has something happened there?
-I can't talk about it now.

218
00:23:52,768 --> 00:23:54,759
Do you have that cop?

219
00:23:55,968 --> 00:24:00,200
I want to talk to you about it.
-I 'm on the square.

220
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:15,486
Hi, Danne. Want to go out drinking this evening?
-No, he'll call you later.

221
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:32,087
Daniel?
-No, Saga Norén, Malmö CID.

222
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,846
Why don't you talk to us directly?

223
00:24:42,888 --> 00:24:47,359
Hello? Are you still there?
-Yes. Where do you want to talk?

224
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:53,398
Why did Anja die?
How did you know we were looking for her?

225
00:25:02,528 --> 00:25:05,440
I'll skip lunch.
-It's for you.

226
00:25:05,608 --> 00:25:07,166
It's for you.

227
00:25:12,288 --> 00:25:15,166
What are you up to?
-Excuse me?

228
00:25:15,328 --> 00:25:18,718
I wonder what you're up to.
-Nothing.

229
00:25:19,848 --> 00:25:23,761
What is it?
-Why do the police answer when I call you?

230
00:25:23,928 --> 00:25:28,638
Why would they do that?
-Saga Norén has your phone.

231
00:25:28,808 --> 00:25:31,038
But I have it here.

232
00:25:32,968 --> 00:25:34,526
I'll check ...

233
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:38,359
Damn it.

234
00:25:41,928 --> 00:25:46,365
He stole my SIM card. That Dane.

235
00:25:46,528 --> 00:25:51,318
We know that. Now we can
continue our cooperation.

236
00:26:11,968 --> 00:26:15,927
Police made a mistake
and will release the man in question.

237
00:26:16,088 --> 00:26:21,367
You have something of mine.
-Hi. I was just reading your article.

238
00:26:21,528 --> 00:26:26,443
Cool action. I didn't expect that.
-Me neither.

239
00:26:26,608 --> 00:26:31,398
My boss Carina will see red
when she hears.

240
00:26:31,568 --> 00:26:35,925
I am a journalist. She attaches great
importance to source protection.

241
00:26:36,088 --> 00:26:39,319
She'll cut all your heads off.

242
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:45,563
I'll be nice. I don't say anything, but
you guys are in debt to me.

243
00:26:45,728 --> 00:26:50,848
And give it back. I need it.
-Yes, many people have called.

244
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:54,080
You haven't made note
of the names, huh?

245
00:26:54,248 --> 00:26:58,605
He called me at the office.
Now it's about immigrants.

246
00:26:58,768 --> 00:27:00,440
I'll forward it.

247
00:27:05,488 --> 00:27:09,197
How's it going?
Have either of you seen Yassir?

248
00:27:09,368 --> 00:27:11,563
No.
-Okay. I'll see you later.

249
00:27:22,288 --> 00:27:27,316
Hey, Yassir. What's up?
-There you are. Where have you been?

250
00:27:27,488 --> 00:27:31,959
I had to help. You gotta see something.
-Not now. Come.

251
00:27:35,008 --> 00:27:39,365
I got him. That fucking cop.

252
00:27:39,528 --> 00:27:44,602
That fucking cop's sitting in my basement.
-Are you serious?

253
00:27:46,368 --> 00:27:49,166
Will you help me?
-Of course. Come.

254
00:28:21,688 --> 00:28:26,045
Okay. You're not the man we're after.
But you've something to do with it.

255
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:31,282
I'm going to compare the blood
of every corpse that turns up this week.

256
00:28:32,328 --> 00:28:36,241
And if I find out
whose blood it is, I'll nab you.

257
00:28:45,048 --> 00:28:48,404
In Copenhagen 17
people were arrested.

258
00:28:48,568 --> 00:28:52,846
Three policemen were injured
in skirmishes.

259
00:28:53,008 --> 00:28:57,559
Henning Tholstrup, the kidnapped officer
still has not been found.

260
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,925
We know the fourth problem.
-Immigrants?

261
00:29:01,088 --> 00:29:06,082
Or rather their failure to integrate.
He says we have failed them.

262
00:29:06,248 --> 00:29:09,524
Because integration doesn't happen.

263
00:29:11,328 --> 00:29:16,641
"Those in power,
don't want to share with others."

264
00:29:16,808 --> 00:29:20,721
Then there's free speech
of your Danish colleagues ...

265
00:29:20,888 --> 00:29:26,326
figures that indicate immigrants
are punished harder than natives.

266
00:29:26,488 --> 00:29:31,039
Pia Kjaersgaard, crime statistics,
The Swedish Democrats ...

267
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:34,280
and a proposal
for a burqa ban.

268
00:29:34,448 --> 00:29:38,407
All that plays no role.
This is personal.

269
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:42,356
This is about Henning.
As in the other cases.

270
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:46,965
He tells the police where Henning is.
Henning must die.

271
00:29:47,128 --> 00:29:51,838
He's making it easier
for the force to find him.

272
00:29:52,008 --> 00:29:54,920
Where does the victim's family live?

273
00:30:09,848 --> 00:30:14,399
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.
This is my colleague, Martin Rohde.

274
00:30:14,568 --> 00:30:16,638
Is Saif here?
-No.

275
00:30:16,808 --> 00:30:18,878
Do you know where he is?
-No.

276
00:30:19,048 --> 00:30:22,085
Do you know that one of
these officers has disappeared?

277
00:30:22,248 --> 00:30:24,318
My son's out.

278
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:28,561
How do you know? You don't know where he is.
-Because he is my son.

279
00:30:28,728 --> 00:30:32,721
It doesn't matter.
Violence and revenge aren't hereditary.

280
00:30:32,888 --> 00:30:36,164
What is behind this?
-The stairs.

281
00:30:36,328 --> 00:30:39,161
One to our house
and one to the basement.

282
00:30:39,328 --> 00:30:41,205
Can we take a look?

283
00:30:56,568 --> 00:31:00,004
Stop it.

284
00:31:00,168 --> 00:31:02,728
Silence. Keep your damn ...

285
00:31:10,528 --> 00:31:11,881
Shut up.

286
00:31:18,728 --> 00:31:21,765
What's in there?
-The heating cellar.

287
00:31:22,888 --> 00:31:27,757
Others who aren't ours.
They're all locked.

288
00:31:32,848 --> 00:31:35,043
I don't have the key.

289
00:31:37,288 --> 00:31:39,677
Then we're done.

290
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:09,997
He wants Henning to die. It must be in
the area the force searched.

291
00:32:10,168 --> 00:32:14,161
We can't do anything more here.
-You can always do more.

292
00:32:18,048 --> 00:32:20,278
Feel like talking?

293
00:32:21,368 --> 00:32:24,485
About what?
-About your sister.

294
00:32:24,648 --> 00:32:28,323
What do you want to know?
-I want to know everything.

295
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:33,278
I don't want to talk about it.
-Maybe you need to.

296
00:32:33,448 --> 00:32:36,520
Why should I?
-Because you couldn't save Anja.

297
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:42,046
She was the same age as your sister,
so you might recall something.

298
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:45,518
Sometimes it's totally empty without her.
But she's gone now.

299
00:32:51,528 --> 00:32:54,759
Will you be okay?
-Yes.

300
00:33:00,968 --> 00:33:02,765
See you tomorrow.

301
00:34:22,968 --> 00:34:26,643
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.
-So you're still working?

302
00:34:28,088 --> 00:34:30,966
What do you want?
-What do you want?

303
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:36,724
So you want to talk
if you take the initiative.

304
00:34:39,648 --> 00:34:42,720
You were surprised
When I took Daniel's mobile.

305
00:34:42,888 --> 00:34:45,686
You don't like surprises, huh?

306
00:34:45,848 --> 00:34:48,965
Order and control
are your stability in the world.

307
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:52,484
You talk like you know me.
-I understand you.

308
00:34:52,648 --> 00:34:55,845
Knowledge of others is rooted in
self-knowledge.

309
00:34:56,008 --> 00:34:58,283
How did you know
we were looking Anja?

310
00:35:01,888 --> 00:35:03,879
I will find you.

311
00:35:04,048 --> 00:35:10,760
Perhaps, yes. You still want to know
how I knew you were looking for Anja?

312
00:35:10,928 --> 00:35:13,920
Do you feel guilty about her death?
-No.

313
00:35:15,408 --> 00:35:17,126
I couldn't do anything.

314
00:35:17,288 --> 00:35:21,725
Awful, isn't it? The feeling
you've missed the mark.

315
00:35:26,928 --> 00:35:30,682
How did you know?
-You should know that.

316
00:35:30,848 --> 00:35:34,397
Me as a person or as the
head of an investigation?

317
00:35:34,568 --> 00:35:37,878
You're intelligent. You'll find out.

318
00:36:05,808 --> 00:36:07,605
Are you awake?

319
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:17,241
What were you actually doing at Charlotte's?
-I had to interrogate her.

320
00:36:18,848 --> 00:36:23,763
I keep thinking about your wallet.
-my wallet?

321
00:36:27,848 --> 00:36:32,444
Yesterday it slipped out of your pocket
when you took your pants off.

322
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:37,398
What about it?
-Did you use the toilet at her place?

323
00:36:37,568 --> 00:36:40,924
I can't remember.

324
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,841
You don't remember?
-Yes ...

325
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:48,997
It's so, yes.
I went to the bathroom at her place.

326
00:36:52,248 --> 00:36:54,398
Did you fuck her?

327
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:06,244
I really don't know why ...

328
00:37:06,408 --> 00:37:11,766
Perhaps it has something
to do with the vasectomy. I don't know ...

329
00:37:11,928 --> 00:37:14,806
I'm not sure if I have something to prove.

330
00:37:16,008 --> 00:37:18,363
To prove?
-Yes.

331
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:22,999
Or something to do with me ...
Or that I still can. Or ...

332
00:37:26,448 --> 00:37:31,203
Or something to do with my
manhood. I have no idea.

333
00:37:31,368 --> 00:37:35,919
You got me pregnant.
-I know.

334
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:38,602
Isn't that evidence?

335
00:37:38,768 --> 00:37:42,681
I don't know what to say.
-You say nothing.

336
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:46,242
You get up and grab your stuff.

337
00:37:46,408 --> 00:37:49,480
And then you clam up.
I don't want it anymore.

338
00:39:04,568 --> 00:39:06,843
Tired, tired.

339
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:42,800
What do you want?

340
00:39:57,808 --> 00:39:59,366
Thirsty?

341
00:40:19,448 --> 00:40:25,603
If you let me go, I'll tell everything.
There'll be a new trial.

342
00:40:25,768 --> 00:40:30,603
It was Bo who did it.
Bo and Luffe. I'll tell everything.

343
00:40:30,768 --> 00:40:36,320
You should have to spoken sooner.
-I can testify. Will get you sorted out.

344
00:40:36,488 --> 00:40:38,718
It's too late. D'you understand.

345
00:40:38,888 --> 00:40:44,485
It isn't too late. I will testify.
There will be a new trial.

346
00:40:46,328 --> 00:40:48,888
Listen to me. It's not ...
-Shut up.

347
00:42:26,368 --> 00:42:31,522
The unrest is now declining. The police
reported major riots.

348
00:42:31,688 --> 00:42:35,397
Several persons were wounded
and cars set on fire.

349
00:42:35,568 --> 00:42:40,039
There is still no trace of Henning
Tholstrup the missing officer ...

350
00:42:42,288 --> 00:42:44,961
You're up early.
-I couldn't sleep.

351
00:42:45,128 --> 00:42:47,323
Me neither.

352
00:42:47,488 --> 00:42:51,003
Why not?
-I dreamed.

353
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:55,559
What did you dream about?
-I was with your brother.

354
00:42:55,728 --> 00:43:00,040
We met these officers.
They started beating him.

355
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:05,958
I couldn't do anything.
I was just watching.

356
00:43:06,128 --> 00:43:10,360
Then they went away.
I went to him and turned him around.

357
00:43:10,528 --> 00:43:12,120
It wasn't him.

358
00:43:13,488 --> 00:43:16,560
He had your face.
-My face?

359
00:43:19,408 --> 00:43:21,160
Was there blood in the dream?

360
00:43:22,968 --> 00:43:28,645
No? It was just a silly dream.
You shouldn't fret about it.

361
00:43:58,808 --> 00:44:02,926
Why do you feed me?
-Rats must eat, right?

362
00:44:04,248 --> 00:44:06,239
What's it?

363
00:44:06,408 --> 00:44:09,559
What's going on here? What are you doing?

364
00:44:13,368 --> 00:44:16,485
What is he doing here?
-I found him here.

365
00:44:16,648 --> 00:44:18,445
You found him here?

366
00:44:18,608 --> 00:44:23,636
We'll take it to the court.
I'll testify, I promise.

367
00:44:23,808 --> 00:44:29,963
What are you talking about? All that grief
because you and your nasty colleagues.

368
00:44:31,288 --> 00:44:35,440
I can testify.
If I testify, everything will be fine.

369
00:44:35,608 --> 00:44:40,966
Fine? What can you fix?
I've lost my son.

370
00:44:41,128 --> 00:44:43,688
Can you give me my son back?
-No.

371
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:46,999
Let me go. Then we'll make it right.

372
00:44:47,168 --> 00:44:53,880
We make anything okay. You don't understand.
Tell the truth to the court.

373
00:44:54,048 --> 00:44:58,360
You've killed my son.
He's not coming back.

374
00:45:01,768 --> 00:45:05,158
Calm down. Calm down.

375
00:45:12,608 --> 00:45:14,166
Help him.

376
00:47:02,368 --> 00:47:03,926
Martin.

377
00:47:05,008 --> 00:47:07,602
What do you want?
-Open the door.

378
00:47:13,008 --> 00:47:19,880
I was hoping for a cup of coffee.
I've brought croissants.

379
00:47:20,048 --> 00:47:24,200
Have you brought for August?
-August Who?

380
00:47:27,168 --> 00:47:28,726
My August?

381
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:32,085
Can I borrow a towel.
-Fine.

382
00:47:34,848 --> 00:47:38,807
What the hell are you doing?
-What does it look like?

383
00:47:38,968 --> 00:47:40,765
He slept here.

384
00:47:47,488 --> 00:47:49,604
I'll wait downstairs in the car.

385
00:47:57,408 --> 00:47:59,399
What was that?
-None of your business.

386
00:47:59,568 --> 00:48:03,527
Saga is my colleague and you're my son.
-I'll do what I want.

387
00:48:03,688 --> 00:48:09,206
No. You don't. As long as you live
with me, You obey my rules.

388
00:48:09,368 --> 00:48:14,488
How do I know your rules if
you've never told me?

389
00:48:14,648 --> 00:48:19,358
So this is revenge because
I've been a bad father to you?

390
00:48:19,528 --> 00:48:21,883
Not everything revolves
around you, you know.

391
00:48:23,248 --> 00:48:26,524
Saga ... exactly why Saga?

392
00:48:26,688 --> 00:48:29,919
Are you jealous or something?
-Give me a break.

393
00:48:32,648 --> 00:48:34,240
Are you going home?

394
00:48:37,568 --> 00:48:41,641
You've come here yourself,
So you can create your own home.

395
00:48:41,808 --> 00:48:43,685
Very mature.

396
00:48:53,568 --> 00:48:58,323
Henning's been found. He's dead.
-Damn.

397
00:49:12,288 --> 00:49:13,926
What's wrong?

398
00:49:16,888 --> 00:49:20,801
You and my son. That's what's wrong.

399
00:49:20,968 --> 00:49:24,244
He's 18.
He doesn't need your permission.

400
00:49:27,128 --> 00:49:32,760
You shouldn't. It isn't right.
-Why not?

401
00:49:35,768 --> 00:49:39,283
You're a little weird, but still ...

402
00:49:39,448 --> 00:49:46,081
I don't see the problem.
-We'll talk no more about it.

403
00:49:46,248 --> 00:49:51,800
I don't want to hear anything more.
You must keep quiet for a while.

404
00:50:04,088 --> 00:50:07,478
You found him in the basement,
let him go after one day ...

405
00:50:07,648 --> 00:50:10,287
and then saw he was wounded?

406
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:13,285
By an officer?

407
00:50:13,448 --> 00:50:16,440
What did he look like?
-I don't know.

408
00:50:16,608 --> 00:50:19,281
How tall was he? Height.

409
00:50:19,448 --> 00:50:22,599
I can't remember.
He was in combat uniform.

410
00:50:22,768 --> 00:50:29,162
There must be something you
remember. Think carefully.

411
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:33,684
Yes?

412
00:50:33,848 --> 00:50:37,761
I got a letter with a key
for where he was.

413
00:50:37,928 --> 00:50:40,158
Where's the key?
-Here.

414
00:50:46,288 --> 00:50:47,846
What else?

415
00:50:48,928 --> 00:50:50,441
Actually, no.

416
00:50:53,248 --> 00:50:55,398
What is it?
-It is so typical.

417
00:50:55,568 --> 00:50:57,923
What's so typical?
-You know.

418
00:50:58,088 --> 00:50:59,965
I don't know.

419
00:51:00,128 --> 00:51:05,725
My brother was murdered. I ask for
justice. You let me rot.

420
00:51:05,888 --> 00:51:10,882
If one of you is killed,
suddenly it's a very different matter.

421
00:51:11,048 --> 00:51:15,166
You saw chaos everywhere,
turning everything upside down. No?

422
00:51:15,328 --> 00:51:21,039
That's how the Danish police work.
-Shut your face. Shut your face.

423
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:24,041
What did he look like?
-I don't remember.

424
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:28,565
Eye color. Hair color.
-He looked like a cop.

425
00:51:41,008 --> 00:51:43,727
Was he as big as Martin?

426
00:51:56,008 --> 00:51:59,080
He had a uniform.

427
00:51:59,248 --> 00:52:03,878
He was as big as Martin,
or slightly larger. He was slim.

428
00:52:06,368 --> 00:52:08,165
I remember no more.

429
00:52:30,368 --> 00:52:36,443
How did you know where I was?
-I read the morning the police reports.

430
00:52:36,608 --> 00:52:41,682
Young man. Overdose.
Your favourite nightclub.

431
00:52:41,848 --> 00:52:46,399
And you weren't at work. You don't
need to ne called Einstein.

432
00:52:46,568 --> 00:52:50,641
That must be the
highlight of your morning.

433
00:52:50,808 --> 00:52:52,446
Not at all.

434
00:52:55,688 --> 00:52:58,600
How are you?
-Okay.

435
00:53:01,448 --> 00:53:03,598
I spent the whole time sleeping.

436
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:08,524
You haven't heard
what happened last night.

437
00:53:08,688 --> 00:53:11,964
Henning Tholstrup
was shot in Copenhagen.

438
00:53:14,408 --> 00:53:18,401
I'm going to work,
but first I'll take you home if you want.

439
00:53:22,008 --> 00:53:23,839
I died last night.

440
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:29,758
I laid lifeless on the ground
for 2 minutes 33 seconds.

441
00:53:32,928 --> 00:53:39,447
I saw no tunnel. No light.
-I'll take you home.

442
00:53:41,808 --> 00:53:44,003
It was just dark, Åke.

443
00:53:47,368 --> 00:53:49,006
Very dark.

444
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:56,725
The preliminary investigation confirms
Henning was in the basement.

445
00:54:56,888 --> 00:55:00,119
Saif had something to say
when we were there.

446
00:55:00,288 --> 00:55:03,997
His confidence in the police
isn't very large.

447
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:09,526
It can still be him. He killed Henning
and invented the story of the officer.

448
00:55:09,688 --> 00:55:12,646
No gunpowder residue
on his hands or clothes.

449
00:55:13,968 --> 00:55:15,640
Maybe a gang member?

450
00:55:15,808 --> 00:55:20,404
Can someone be abducted
without a trace?

451
00:55:20,568 --> 00:55:22,763
It sounds more like our perpetrator.

452
00:55:22,928 --> 00:55:26,364
What do you think, Saga?
-That it was him.

453
00:55:26,528 --> 00:55:31,602
He wasn't sure Henning would
be killed, so he stayed nearby.

454
00:55:31,768 --> 00:55:35,158
But why Henning?
-I don't know.

455
00:55:35,328 --> 00:55:38,525
But there is a connection
among the victims.

456
00:55:44,288 --> 00:55:46,085
The car's been found.

457
00:56:27,848 --> 00:56:30,203
The car comes from Helsingör.

458
00:56:32,888 --> 00:56:36,244
Only Saif saw him
getting into the car.

459
00:56:36,408 --> 00:56:40,560
How can a police car
be stolen for half day?

460
00:56:46,568 --> 00:56:51,323
It may not have been stolen.

1
00:00:01,158 --> 00:00:03,547
previously...

2
00:00:06,718 --> 00:00:12,076
If you work, you see
society is unjust.

3
00:00:14,758 --> 00:00:17,477
This time it's immigrants.

4
00:00:20,598 --> 00:00:23,032
Here?
-He slept over.

5
00:00:23,198 --> 00:00:27,316
Saga is my colleague and you're my son.
-I do what I want.

6
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:31,073
He has posted something new.
-Why only Henning?

7
00:00:31,238 --> 00:00:35,356
Does he have Henning?
-I think so. He disappeared last night.

8
00:00:35,518 --> 00:00:37,031
You have a letter.

9
00:00:37,198 --> 00:00:39,632
I want my brother back.

10
00:00:44,998 --> 00:00:50,595
What did you actually do at Charlotte's?
-I had to interrogate her.

11
00:00:50,758 --> 00:00:52,908
Did you fuck her?

12
00:00:53,078 --> 00:00:57,833
You get up, put on your stuff and then
clam up. I don't want it anymore.

13
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:04,748
I died last night.
I saw no tunnel. No light.

14
00:01:09,158 --> 00:01:11,274
You can't just go inside.

15
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,430
Why is there blood in your bedroom?
-It's not me.

16
00:01:14,598 --> 00:01:18,386
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.
-Still working, so late?

17
00:01:18,558 --> 00:01:19,707
I'll find you.

18
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:24,234
I'm Stefan.
-Charlie walked down the street ...

19
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:29,070
Sonja, you know who poisoned you?
Did you see anyone?

20
00:01:29,238 --> 00:01:30,591
I saw him.

21
00:01:31,598 --> 00:01:35,352
How can a police car
be stolen for half a day?

22
00:01:35,518 --> 00:01:37,907
It may not be stolen.

23
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,310
Maybe he's one of us.
Maybe he's in the police.

24
00:02:22,798 --> 00:02:25,028
What next?

25
00:03:56,078 --> 00:04:01,072
Mette. Now I can't talk now,
leave a message after the beep.

26
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:04,436
It's me.

27
00:04:05,758 --> 00:04:12,596
I know you're angry and hurt.
But we must talk.

28
00:04:12,758 --> 00:04:16,546
So will you call me back?

29
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,192
I'll try to get home tonight.

30
00:04:21,518 --> 00:04:23,076
Good day.

31
00:04:24,118 --> 00:04:25,756
Today.

32
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:33,110
It explains a lot
if he's in the police.

33
00:04:33,278 --> 00:04:37,157
Such as?
-he never leaves traces.

34
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:43,757
Experienced criminals don't.
-They want to make money. He doesn't.

35
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,228
What's his motive?
-It's something personal.

36
00:04:47,398 --> 00:04:53,109
He always chooses someone
he wants dead. In this case Henning.

37
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:59,353
Why a cop?
-Anja. He knew we were looking for her.

38
00:04:59,518 --> 00:05:03,431
Only the police knew she
was in the garage.

39
00:05:03,598 --> 00:05:08,228
He managed to get a police car
with no one raising an alarm.

40
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:13,677
He has access to riot gear.
The taser was in police possession.

41
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:17,467
The shots were
fired by a professional.

42
00:05:17,638 --> 00:05:20,710
He is well organized, and
plans everything well.

43
00:05:20,878 --> 00:05:24,029
He understands weapons and explosives.

44
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:28,111
He is military.
-A special police unit.

45
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:35,277
If we continue on this track,
we must be very careful.

46
00:05:35,438 --> 00:05:40,751
Since he's a Dane, we want all the
material and to take the lead on it.

47
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:44,706
Why a Dane?
-Danish police car and equipment.

48
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,346
He spoke fluent Danish with Daniel.

49
00:05:47,518 --> 00:05:51,397
I'll see who fits that profile.

50
00:05:51,558 --> 00:05:55,153
Nobody would shoot his own colleagues.

51
00:05:55,318 --> 00:05:58,754
Do you have a different theory, Martin?

52
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:03,194
Well?

53
00:06:03,358 --> 00:06:07,317
I'll send what we have.
We still have to talk.

54
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:10,675
Shall we have breakfast?
-No, thank you.

55
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,432
Why not?
-Because I don't have time.

56
00:06:16,238 --> 00:06:21,073
Martin has difficulty with the idea
it could be a colleague.

57
00:06:21,238 --> 00:06:24,036
Or is there something else
I should know about?

58
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,710
He's a bit mad at me.
-Why?

59
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:31,711
Because his son slept with me.

60
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,391
Had he missed the train home?
-No, he likes me.

61
00:06:38,558 --> 00:06:42,836
How old is Martin's son?
-18, So I don't understand his anger.

62
00:06:42,998 --> 00:06:45,796
It's his son.
-August is mature.

63
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,631
That's not the point.

64
00:06:48,798 --> 00:06:52,757
You can't have sex with your
colleagues' children.

65
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,035
We didn't have sex.
-You said ...

66
00:06:56,198 --> 00:07:01,636
I just said he had slept with me.
-You must also say that to Martin.

67
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:05,427
Why?
-He probably thought the same as I.

68
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:10,831
That's not my problem.
-Can you do it for me.

69
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:16,713
A school bus just vanished.
Five children are missing.

70
00:07:59,718 --> 00:08:02,027
BODY FOUND IN CONTAINER

71
00:08:40,598 --> 00:08:42,953
I'm Stefan. Do you recognize me?

72
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:56,388
Charlie walked down the street
and found a bag.

73
00:08:56,558 --> 00:09:00,107
He thought full of tobacco,
but it was gunpowder.

74
00:09:01,638 --> 00:09:06,234
Are we in the past or the present?
-We're in the present now, sister.

75
00:09:07,398 --> 00:09:12,028
Has she woken up.
-Yes, she's awake.

76
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:17,636
Don't go away.
-Listen to me.

77
00:09:17,798 --> 00:09:20,312
I'll never leave you alone.

78
00:09:21,638 --> 00:09:23,993
I'll never leave you alone.

79
00:09:43,118 --> 00:09:45,996
DOES A KILLER LIVE ON YOUR STREET?

80
00:09:47,558 --> 00:09:52,188
I didn't think you'd come in  today.
-You were right.

81
00:09:53,638 --> 00:09:58,428
It was a mistake to publish the
addresses of psychiatric patients.

82
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:02,713
I'm here to offer my apology.

83
00:10:05,678 --> 00:10:07,714
You're a good man, Åke.

84
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,918
I didn't appreciate you.

85
00:10:13,758 --> 00:10:19,276
I gotta go. A school bus has
disappeared with five children.

86
00:10:19,438 --> 00:10:21,827
It's great.
-Congratulations.

87
00:10:41,798 --> 00:10:46,428
Hey. Åke said you were sick.
-I'm better now.

88
00:10:46,598 --> 00:10:51,035
He killed Henning.
-I heard.

89
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:56,795
Do you know anything about the fifth
problem? Have you checked your email?

90
00:10:59,398 --> 00:11:01,753
Aren't you going to do it?

91
00:11:03,398 --> 00:11:05,070
I don't think so.

92
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:12,907
It doesn't matter.
-What doesn't matter?

93
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:17,708
This. Everything I write.
Everything he sends me.

94
00:11:19,998 --> 00:11:23,991
Ultimately, everything is meaningless.

95
00:11:24,158 --> 00:11:29,755
There's actually nothing means anything.
-Daniel, what's wrong with you?

96
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:09,195
What does he say?

97
00:12:10,318 --> 00:12:12,354
I have no idea.

98
00:12:45,158 --> 00:12:49,197
Lillian sent these.
They match the criteria.

99
00:12:56,358 --> 00:13:01,307
He died this winter.
He died years ago.

100
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:04,948
I don't know why
they hadn't checked.

101
00:13:06,238 --> 00:13:09,628
I received new material from Copenhagen.

102
00:13:09,798 --> 00:13:12,596
Martin, I didn't have sex with your son.

103
00:13:13,678 --> 00:13:17,910
August and I didn't have sex.
You probably wanted to know.

104
00:13:23,598 --> 00:13:26,237
Listen.
-What is that?

105
00:13:26,398 --> 00:13:30,710
A conversation between a police
helicopter and the stolen car.

106
00:13:32,118 --> 00:13:36,236
HK4 to vehicle 319. What's your status?

107
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:42,075
HK4, vehicle 319 here. Zebra Zulu. Zebra Zulu.

108
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:47,870
vehicle 319, repeat.
-Everything's under control. Nothing to report.

109
00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:51,075
vehicle 319, understood.
Over and out.

110
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:57,833
Zebra Zulu means everything's quiet.
ZZ is a snore.

111
00:13:57,998 --> 00:14:02,196
It's special forces police jargon
in America.

112
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:08,228
Does one of those persons fit the profile?
-They all received FBI training.

113
00:14:09,478 --> 00:14:13,517
Can't he have learned 'Zebra Zulu'
from the internet?

114
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:16,750
I get no hits
on the major engines.

115
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:20,069
Is there anyone in Sweden
who meets the profile?

116
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:26,393
Johan? Swedish police officers?
-With the search criteria, I have seven.

117
00:14:27,438 --> 00:14:32,432
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.
Yes. Thank you.

118
00:14:32,598 --> 00:14:34,987
Sonja's come out of the coma. Martin.

119
00:14:35,158 --> 00:14:40,312
Wait. There are five children missing
and we have 15 people for investigation.

120
00:14:40,478 --> 00:14:43,550
Sonja said she saw him.

121
00:14:43,718 --> 00:14:49,668
We don't know what he intends.
-Can I get the photos of those seven Swedes?

122
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:56,996
She doesn't answer.

123
00:14:57,158 --> 00:15:01,037
Who?
-Mette. I've called her all day.

124
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:03,553
Why do you call her?

125
00:15:03,718 --> 00:15:06,278
She threw me out.
-Why?

126
00:15:08,718 --> 00:15:11,391
She knows I've gone weird.

127
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:14,948
Didn't she know you don't
believe in monogamy?

128
00:15:15,118 --> 00:15:16,676
What?

129
00:15:17,798 --> 00:15:23,555
How do you figure? I don't believe.
-Why did you have sex with others?

130
00:15:23,718 --> 00:15:28,394
Have you ever had a relationship?
-It depends how you define it.

131
00:15:28,558 --> 00:15:32,346
I'm not talking about sex
with boys 20 years younger.

132
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,994
I'm 19 years older
and we didn't have sex.

133
00:15:37,158 --> 00:15:40,355
What did you do all night with him?

134
00:15:40,518 --> 00:15:44,113
Talked. Watched a movie. Slept.
-In the same bed?

135
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:49,796
Is it weird to spend the night
together without having sex?

136
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:55,237
In that case I understand your infidelity.
-Will you stop now?

137
00:15:55,398 --> 00:15:56,956
Thank you.

138
00:16:03,798 --> 00:16:09,953
Moreover, it is your fault. You stood
there waving my wallet.

139
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,830
Did you do it with
Charlotte Söringer?

140
00:16:16,398 --> 00:16:18,036
Why was that?

141
00:16:38,638 --> 00:16:44,827
Mette Rohde, here. I'll be right
down. Thank you.

142
00:16:52,438 --> 00:16:55,908
Is Sebastian Sandstrod here?
-Yes, he's there.

143
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:09,675
Hello. Mette Rohde.
-Sebastian Sandstrod. Pleased to meet you.

144
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,992
You were in my calendar. Go ahead.
-I want to show our software.

145
00:17:15,158 --> 00:17:18,707
That does make sense.
I don't buy IT systems.

146
00:17:18,878 --> 00:17:22,666
But you use them right?
-I use what the company buys.

147
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:27,673
They think only in the interest
of the firm. I think of your interests.

148
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,069
Sellers always want
to improve my life.

149
00:17:31,238 --> 00:17:35,595
But I really can do that.
-How?

150
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:40,313
Do you want the long or short version?
-The very short one.

151
00:17:40,478 --> 00:17:45,347
Gain a clear overview, less
coordination, less overtime.

152
00:17:45,518 --> 00:17:48,669
and more family time
for other things.

153
00:17:50,518 --> 00:17:54,636
Too long?
-No, but is it true?

154
00:17:55,638 --> 00:17:58,630
ln the short version is all true.

155
00:18:01,278 --> 00:18:04,907
Sebastian Sandstrod,
I'll give you five minutes.

156
00:18:05,078 --> 00:18:09,151
It's not long.
-You must earn more time.

157
00:18:14,998 --> 00:18:16,670
We go up here.

158
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:21,834
Do you think it's my fault
Mette's mad at you?

159
00:18:21,998 --> 00:18:25,195
You could've given
me my wallet at work.

160
00:18:25,358 --> 00:18:31,194
So the problem isn't that you
comit adultery, but that Mette knows.

161
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:35,237
You said so.
-The problem is I want her back.

162
00:18:35,398 --> 00:18:38,708
I love her and don't want to lose her.
-That has ...

163
00:18:38,878 --> 00:18:43,394
Before? Thank you, Saga. I know.

164
00:18:55,078 --> 00:18:56,796
What are you doing here?

165
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:02,237
I want to ask a few questions.
-She just woke up. Can't it wait?

166
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:07,870
I'm Saga Norén, Malmö CID.
Look at these pictures.

167
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:11,235
Did you see who left
the wine bottles?

168
00:19:11,398 --> 00:19:15,914
You said you recognized him.
Do you remember?

169
00:19:17,078 --> 00:19:18,955
How are you?
-Good.

170
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:20,676
Fine.

171
00:19:25,358 --> 00:19:27,474
Look at the pictures.

172
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:33,075
Sonja concentrate.
Look at each picture.

173
00:19:37,118 --> 00:19:41,077
Can you concentrate?
-She's just woken up.

174
00:19:41,238 --> 00:19:44,833
Do you have something to tell me?
-No.

175
00:19:57,358 --> 00:19:58,871
Are you all right?

176
00:20:04,158 --> 00:20:06,149
Sonja, it's okay.

177
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:24,788
It shows again we aren't equal
before the law. That's a problem.

178
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:31,477
Both the police and for society.
That deserves attention.

179
00:20:31,638 --> 00:20:36,234
"As for the law."
-A serious problem.

180
00:20:36,398 --> 00:20:41,108
Jesper Andersson, born in 1969,
bilingual, Danish mother.

181
00:20:41,278 --> 00:20:46,068
Lived up to 12 in Denmark.
Gratuated from the police academy in 1995.

182
00:20:46,238 --> 00:20:50,436
Between 1998 and 2000 trained
by the FBI at Quantico.

183
00:20:50,598 --> 00:20:56,628
Assigned to the swat team until 2003,
two colleagues killed in an operation.

184
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:00,916
Sick-leave, divorced in 2005,
back to work in 2006.

185
00:21:01,078 --> 00:21:07,028
Head of the team that monitored
recruitment for organized crime.

186
00:21:07,198 --> 00:21:10,190
Doing good work among the youth.
Was well liked.

187
00:21:10,358 --> 00:21:14,317
It can be him. Now find
the link to the dead persons.

188
00:21:14,478 --> 00:21:19,950
One more thing. If we monitor him
nobody else must know.

189
00:21:21,918 --> 00:21:26,594
Can't we talk to him?
-Do it.

190
00:21:42,118 --> 00:21:45,269
Is Jesper Andersson here?
-No.

191
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:49,033
Do you know where he is?
-No. No idea.

192
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:51,268
What do you want?
-To talk to him.

193
00:21:51,438 --> 00:21:53,315
I can say who was there?

194
00:21:58,878 --> 00:22:00,675
He is a Swede.
-Who?

195
00:22:00,838 --> 00:22:05,389
You said he was Danish.
-I said many things that could be.

196
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:08,994
But Jesper Andersson is a Swede.

197
00:22:09,158 --> 00:22:11,194
What do you mean?
-Nothing.

198
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:23,628
He isn't there.
-He isn't at home.

199
00:22:23,798 --> 00:22:26,915
Gry will search his house
with a team.

200
00:22:27,078 --> 00:22:28,909
I'll go there.
-Wait.

201
00:22:29,078 --> 00:22:34,550
If it's Andersson, he's now
working on something. Go to Johan.

202
00:22:43,918 --> 00:22:49,788
Millions of children in the world
are abused and exploited every day.

203
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:54,952
If an item is very cheap,
there's another price to pay.

204
00:22:55,118 --> 00:23:00,067
The problem is nothing we can
cure. It's not our children.

205
00:23:00,238 --> 00:23:01,671
But these ones.

206
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:06,036
Where does this come from?
-Sanningnu.se, and on the Danish site.

207
00:23:06,198 --> 00:23:09,349
Each child represents a type of business.

208
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:15,434
There are companies in our region
indirectly using child labor.

209
00:23:15,598 --> 00:23:20,877
I want the companies set
afire before time runs out.

210
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:26,954
Each fire rescues a child. All of them can
stay alive, the choice is yours.

211
00:23:27,118 --> 00:23:32,590
A list of the companies
will soon be made public.

212
00:23:33,758 --> 00:23:35,510
Jesus Christ.

213
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:52,028
The list of companies.

214
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:58,115
That's not bad.

215
00:24:00,358 --> 00:24:06,115
We assume this list is correct?
Can they be involved in child labor?

216
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,749
Up until now he was always right.
-Publishing it will have consequences.

217
00:24:10,918 --> 00:24:13,034
Probably five fires.

218
00:24:13,198 --> 00:24:16,668
What, insurance companies
make less profits ...

219
00:24:16,838 --> 00:24:19,955
and five children's lives, or what?

220
00:24:20,118 --> 00:24:24,555
So isn't that simple.
-It is that simple.

221
00:24:24,718 --> 00:24:27,994
Or does it involve our advertisers?

222
00:24:28,158 --> 00:24:32,276
You can't incite arson.
-We don't.

223
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:37,671
We just provide information.
As we've done all week.

224
00:24:37,838 --> 00:24:43,356
We don't publish
this is to encourage crime.

225
00:24:43,518 --> 00:24:46,271
You've already talked to the lawyers.

226
00:24:46,438 --> 00:24:50,477
The list goes to the police.
This is a police matter.

227
00:24:50,638 --> 00:24:53,914
Oh yes, now it concerns those
who pay our wages?

228
00:24:54,078 --> 00:25:00,347
I've taken a lot of shit from you,
but be careful you don't go too far.

229
00:25:00,518 --> 00:25:03,988
I didn't sign the death sentence
of the five children.

230
00:25:04,158 --> 00:25:06,388
Now you've gone too far.

231
00:25:32,838 --> 00:25:37,195
Thank you. These were five well-spent
minutes, or how long was it?

232
00:25:37,358 --> 00:25:41,192
A half hour.
-But we also had coffee.

233
00:25:41,358 --> 00:25:47,228
It sounds very interesting, the software.
I'll discuss it with my colleagues.

234
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:51,755
It's simple. Data systems are
metaphors for life.

235
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:55,467
Find out how everything is connected
and then create order.

236
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:59,711
And how do you do that,
bring order to your life?

237
00:25:59,878 --> 00:26:04,952
If I knew, I'd now be an
extremely well-paid lecturer.

238
00:26:07,918 --> 00:26:11,672
Do you need it? Order in your life?

239
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:15,713
Who doesn't?

240
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:24,030
Sorry. it's too private, too fast.
Pardon me.

241
00:26:24,198 --> 00:26:29,272
Doesn't matter. Your five minutes
are definitely over.

242
00:26:29,438 --> 00:26:35,149
I'll send the information,
you can give to your colleagues.

243
00:26:35,318 --> 00:26:37,912
Thank you.
-I must thank you.

244
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,876
Navid?

245
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:57,949
What about Andersson
and the victims?

246
00:26:58,118 --> 00:27:05,069
Kerstin Ekwall used to prosecute.
So they may have met.

247
00:27:05,238 --> 00:27:07,468
Here is the list of companies.

248
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:16,077
We can't monitor all
their warehouses and shops.

249
00:27:16,238 --> 00:27:20,277
We must try.
Pardon me.

250
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,030
Anne?
-Yes.

251
00:27:22,198 --> 00:27:27,352
See if you can find a link
between the companies and the kids.

252
00:27:27,518 --> 00:27:29,395
Please.
-Thank you.

253
00:27:31,998 --> 00:27:36,389
Any chatter on the net?
-No noise.

254
00:27:52,718 --> 00:27:55,073
What the hell did you do?

255
00:27:56,278 --> 00:27:59,714
I suppose that's
a rhetorical question?

256
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,836
I said no.
-I have to press on.

257
00:28:04,478 --> 00:28:09,677
Now, the list is all over the Internet,
if you want to get it off the site.

258
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:14,354
You're all done.
Get out within a minute.

259
00:28:14,518 --> 00:28:18,193
You know the Labour code
doesn't quite work like that.

260
00:28:18,358 --> 00:28:20,826
I want you to leave.

261
00:28:40,878 --> 00:28:43,631
An update on Andersson.

262
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:49,395
His ex and he have no contact,
but she calls him a loner.

263
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:55,349
His mother doesn't want to see him
again. He has a house in Småland.

264
00:28:55,518 --> 00:28:59,750
We'll talk to his colleagues,
but be careful.

265
00:28:59,918 --> 00:29:05,072
Has Gry called?
-She didn't found anything at his house.

266
00:29:05,238 --> 00:29:08,833
We haven't made any progress
since this morning.

267
00:29:10,838 --> 00:29:16,037
Excuse me. We found
a body. Sören Holmgren.

268
00:29:16,198 --> 00:29:19,429
His wife, Veronika Holmgren,
has disappeared.

269
00:29:19,598 --> 00:29:25,195
Their social worker is Stefan Lindberg.
Have you've heard of him before?

270
00:29:25,358 --> 00:29:28,555
He can't be found.
Do you know where he is?

271
00:29:28,718 --> 00:29:35,476
He's in hospital. That's his sister.
-Nice. Thank you.

272
00:29:35,638 --> 00:29:39,028
He did it.
-Excuse me?

273
00:29:39,198 --> 00:29:41,712
Stefan Lindberg did it.

274
00:29:41,878 --> 00:29:47,077
There is blood between the floor boards
in his bedroom. Check it out.

275
00:29:47,238 --> 00:29:51,754
Saga, the school bus has been found
after an anonymous tip.

276
00:29:59,078 --> 00:30:04,311
Five fires in two hours.
Otherwise he'll let the children die.

277
00:30:04,478 --> 00:30:07,868
He wants people
to act instinctively.

278
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:10,632
Is it our instinct to start fires?

279
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:15,269
Children work on the people's
feelings, just like kittens.

280
00:30:16,438 --> 00:30:20,192
Don't you think this is
the worst thing he's done?

281
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:23,354
He'll murder five children.

282
00:30:23,518 --> 00:30:27,147
Five little people.
He's killed more homeless.

283
00:30:27,318 --> 00:30:31,027
Little people?
-They don't know they're in danger.

284
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:35,589
It was worse for Björn Rasmusen.
He knew he was dying.

285
00:30:44,518 --> 00:30:47,476
You don't really have
a maternal instinct, huh?

286
00:30:50,078 --> 00:30:52,433
But why do you ask?

287
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:24,233
The windows are covered up.
No movement inside.

288
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:28,949
We will send the bomb expert 
in first. Are you ready?

289
00:31:29,118 --> 00:31:32,110
I'm ready.
-Then go.

290
00:31:36,998 --> 00:31:38,670
They aren't on the bus.

291
00:31:38,838 --> 00:31:42,877
We don't know that.
-He wasn't filmed on the bus.

292
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:45,677
He may have moved them.
-No.

293
00:31:45,838 --> 00:31:48,068
It could be a video.

294
00:31:48,238 --> 00:31:51,708
We'll take no risks.
We'll assume the worst.

295
00:31:53,598 --> 00:31:55,748
Can you hear me, Milos?

296
00:31:57,718 --> 00:31:59,276
Okay.

297
00:32:22,158 --> 00:32:25,867
Here you can see it.
This is Milos' camera.

298
00:32:49,438 --> 00:32:52,316
Whose warehouse is that?
-Unknown.

299
00:32:52,478 --> 00:32:54,389
It's important.

300
00:32:56,238 --> 00:32:59,947
We need to know whose warehouse that is?
Find out fast.

301
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:13,870
And, Milos?
-The exterior of the bus is fine.

302
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:16,836
Nothing on the outside.

303
00:33:28,998 --> 00:33:33,992
Take it back a little.
-Milos, can you go back?

304
00:33:42,318 --> 00:33:43,876
What is this?

305
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:48,348
Can you get a better image?
-Wait.

306
00:33:50,478 --> 00:33:54,471
"Thanks for the help."
Thanks for the help?

307
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:56,676
Go ahead.

308
00:34:01,198 --> 00:34:04,395
Thank you. It's a furniture company.

309
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:07,834
What's it called?
-Hulbos Furniture.

310
00:34:08,318 --> 00:34:09,910
He must get out of there.

311
00:34:10,078 --> 00:34:12,387
I got the door open.
-He's going in.

312
00:34:12,558 --> 00:34:16,790
It's a company on the list.
He must leave now.

313
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:20,348
Come directly out.
-I'm going in.

314
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:22,634
Cease your operation immediately.

315
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:48,027
A fire broke out in the warehouse
where the school bus was parked.

316
00:34:48,198 --> 00:34:53,989
The bomb expert just managed to get out
before the whole place caught fire.

317
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:58,913
We don't know if the five
children were in the bus.

318
00:34:59,078 --> 00:35:03,390
Police think that isn't the case
because the perpetrator ...

319
00:35:03,558 --> 00:35:06,948
left a note "Thanks for the help."
And next on TV1.

320
00:35:09,878 --> 00:35:12,187
Five companies have to burn.

321
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:16,067
We don't know whether this warehouse
belongs to one of those companies.

322
00:35:16,238 --> 00:35:21,631
The warehouse is now ablaze
and it will take time to ...

323
00:35:52,558 --> 00:35:56,471
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.
-Johan, here.

324
00:35:56,638 --> 00:36:03,111
"Furniture" was removed from the list,
So one child will be saved.

325
00:36:09,478 --> 00:36:13,266
Have you spoken to the police?
-What?

326
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:16,635
Those officers in uniform.
They asked about you.

327
00:36:17,198 --> 00:36:21,111
Yes. Yes, we talked. Thank you.

328
00:36:42,758 --> 00:36:46,592
You were very long.
-I know. Sorry.

329
00:36:47,758 --> 00:36:49,589
We gotta go.

330
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:53,551
Where?
-I don't know. Just go.

331
00:36:53,718 --> 00:37:00,669
Together?
-Of course. We'll always stay together.

332
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:02,954
Now?
-Yes, now.

333
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,792
We'll start a new life, Sonja.

334
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:17,431
We'll start again. We'll leave
all the misery behind us. Come.

335
00:37:41,798 --> 00:37:44,949
Let's go the other way.

336
00:37:46,238 --> 00:37:48,627
Wait, I need to sit down.

337
00:37:59,118 --> 00:38:03,430
Sonja, listen to me.
I did something stupid.

338
00:38:03,598 --> 00:38:09,389
Can you hear me? I'll take care of you
and ensure you get sorted out.

339
00:38:09,558 --> 00:38:11,549
I love you.

340
00:38:14,718 --> 00:38:17,551
Sonja, listen to me.

341
00:38:17,718 --> 00:38:21,506
Remember what I said to you
the summer they took you from me?

342
00:38:21,678 --> 00:38:25,591
I'd wait for you?
Can you promise me the same?

343
00:38:25,758 --> 00:38:28,750
You wait for me?

344
00:38:28,918 --> 00:38:31,751
Come with me.
-We want to stay together.

345
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:35,672
We'll do that too.
You just have to wait.

346
00:39:05,998 --> 00:39:07,590
"Clothing" has also been removed.

347
00:39:07,758 --> 00:39:11,546
Young people have
set fire to a clothing store.

348
00:39:11,718 --> 00:39:15,870
Were they caught?
-Yes. The bystanders were heroes.

349
00:39:16,038 --> 00:39:19,110
Indeed they are.
-Three to go.

350
00:39:20,118 --> 00:39:21,471
Excuse me.

351
00:39:21,638 --> 00:39:23,310
Is he a father?
-No idea.

352
00:39:23,478 --> 00:39:26,948
He has a son
who's just turned two.

353
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:33,114
I'm sitting here with Erik and Anna,
the parents one of the kidnapped boys.

354
00:39:33,278 --> 00:39:37,556
Some businesses were set on fire.
What do you think of that?

355
00:39:37,718 --> 00:39:39,709
It's awful ...

356
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:45,874
but these are just things,
material things.

357
00:39:47,438 --> 00:39:50,874
It's important
I get my son back.

358
00:39:51,038 --> 00:39:57,113
They're insured, right?
I'll never get my son back.

359
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:38,395
I'd like the number of
Gladans Chocolate in Malmö.

360
00:40:38,558 --> 00:40:40,310
Can you transfer me?

361
00:40:43,638 --> 00:40:49,395
Hello, you're speaking with Daniel Ferbé.
Yes indeed, that Daniel Ferbé.

362
00:40:49,558 --> 00:40:53,710
Your company is allegedly
associated with child labor.

363
00:40:53,878 --> 00:40:58,554
I'd like to interview
for a nuanced story.

364
00:40:59,598 --> 00:41:03,227
Who do I have to have to talk to?
Can you transfer me?

365
00:41:05,118 --> 00:41:08,508
How's Andersson?
-I had him monitored.

366
00:41:08,678 --> 00:41:11,795
Then he disappeared.
-He has already disappeared.

367
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:14,233
Do we know anything about him?

368
00:41:16,118 --> 00:41:23,274
Found out anything about Andersson?
-I've seen his roster.

369
00:41:23,438 --> 00:41:28,717
He often works nights. Travels
between Sweden and Denmark.

370
00:41:28,878 --> 00:41:31,233
Nobody knows where he hangs out.

371
00:41:31,398 --> 00:41:34,674
Gry, have you found a link
to the kids?

372
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:38,035
No, they seem to
be chosen at random.

373
00:41:38,198 --> 00:41:41,827
In Copenhagen
a toy warehouse is on fire.

374
00:41:41,998 --> 00:41:44,956
And another clothing store in Malmö.

375
00:41:45,118 --> 00:41:48,793
Another three minutes and we have
two fires to go.

376
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:52,997
You want him to succeed?
-Yes. And you want that too.

377
00:41:53,158 --> 00:41:55,353
"Sport" is gone.

378
00:41:56,198 --> 00:42:01,033
How can this be personal? There should
be a connection to Andersson.

379
00:42:01,198 --> 00:42:06,750
Maybe he knows one of the parents.
-Five companies have to burn.

380
00:42:06,918 --> 00:42:11,389
The link between the companies.

381
00:42:11,558 --> 00:42:14,436
Find the link between the companies.

382
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:17,670
Gladans headquarters
is on fire.

383
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:21,035
One minute and thirty seconds.

384
00:42:40,598 --> 00:42:42,190
They were saved.

385
00:42:46,598 --> 00:42:51,831
Everyone finds this a good thing?
-Because no children die, yes.

386
00:42:51,998 --> 00:42:57,277
It's a good thing. But when
he pits people against each other?

387
00:42:57,438 --> 00:43:01,147
Five disabled die for five children.

388
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:06,950
Or five immigrants.
-But he hasn't done that.

389
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:10,508
Everyone does what he says.
Isn't that scary?

390
00:43:10,678 --> 00:43:12,748
Something new has appeared.

391
00:43:13,678 --> 00:43:16,272
GPS coordinates.

392
00:43:16,758 --> 00:43:18,635
Look where that is.

393
00:43:45,158 --> 00:43:47,752
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.

394
00:43:48,718 --> 00:43:52,711
Is this man who you locked up?
-I don't know.

395
00:43:52,878 --> 00:43:55,551
Did you see him?
-Yes.

396
00:43:55,718 --> 00:43:58,915
Look at the picture. Concentrate.
Was it him?

397
00:43:59,078 --> 00:44:05,267
Maybe. He had a beard and an
eye patch. He looked like a pirate.

398
00:44:05,438 --> 00:44:07,793
I have found these. Are these them?

399
00:44:09,558 --> 00:44:12,914
They all say the same thing.

400
00:44:14,558 --> 00:44:19,473
Last problem. He has named
all five, so he's ready.

401
00:44:19,638 --> 00:44:20,991
Maybe.

402
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:24,707
Get a search warrant.

403
00:44:25,798 --> 00:44:31,111
He doesn't want us to look for him.
-It doesn't matter what he wants or not.

404
00:44:32,358 --> 00:44:35,111
We won't issue a search warrant.

405
00:45:28,758 --> 00:45:30,908
What are you doing here?

406
00:45:31,078 --> 00:45:34,991
Change of clothes and look in on the kids.
-They're asleep.

407
00:45:35,158 --> 00:45:38,434
And August?
-This isn't home.

408
00:45:38,598 --> 00:45:41,112
Were the children saved?
-Yes.

409
00:45:41,278 --> 00:45:46,557
So it's over?
-No, he's not caught. I want to...

410
00:45:46,718 --> 00:45:49,790
Go get your clothes and then go away.

411
00:45:54,038 --> 00:45:55,949
I love you, Mette.

412
00:46:19,758 --> 00:46:22,272
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.

413
00:46:24,078 --> 00:46:25,875
What? Now?

414
00:46:32,158 --> 00:46:34,626
I just happened by.

415
00:46:34,798 --> 00:46:39,588
Where were you going?
-Nowhere. I wanted to see you again.

416
00:46:41,918 --> 00:46:43,988
You want to sleep with me.

417
00:46:45,038 --> 00:46:47,313
If I may.
-No.

418
00:46:48,478 --> 00:46:50,753
Your father doesn't approve.

419
00:46:51,718 --> 00:46:55,427
Who cares what he thinks?
-Me.

420
00:46:55,598 --> 00:46:57,554
Really?

421
00:46:58,838 --> 00:47:00,635
I gotta get back to work.

422
00:47:04,158 --> 00:47:05,876
Good night.

423
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:16,796
Thank you for a wonderful day
sleep well

424
00:47:22,998 --> 00:47:24,954
I'll go back.

425
00:47:26,598 --> 00:47:29,317
How long will it be like this?

426
00:47:30,078 --> 00:47:32,956
I don't know.
-We need to talk.

427
00:47:33,118 --> 00:47:35,586
I've just don't want to see you.

428
00:48:39,758 --> 00:48:43,228
Lithium aluminum hydride.
-Excuse me?

429
00:48:43,398 --> 00:48:49,712
That was on the floor around the bus.
It ignites in contact with water.

430
00:48:49,878 --> 00:48:53,348
August slept over at your place.

431
00:48:53,518 --> 00:48:56,828
Do you know if Andersson
knows anything about chemistry?

432
00:48:56,998 --> 00:48:58,750
So you have a spare bed?

433
00:48:58,918 --> 00:49:01,910
Don't you know or he doesn't
know anything about chemistry?

434
00:49:02,078 --> 00:49:05,753
I don't know.
But do you have a spare bed?

435
00:49:05,918 --> 00:49:10,628
Do you want to sleep with me?
-I don't. I was thinking of someone else.

436
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:12,956
Who then?

437
00:49:20,078 --> 00:49:22,273
You can't touch that.

438
00:49:36,118 --> 00:49:39,997
It is brand new, huh?
-Yes, it hasn't been used.

439
00:49:40,158 --> 00:49:42,831
So August slept in your bed?

440
00:49:46,718 --> 00:49:51,075
He came along at the office today.
-Who?   -August.

441
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:54,949
What did he want?
-He wanted to sleep with me.

442
00:49:57,158 --> 00:49:59,547
Thank you.
-Please.

443
00:50:03,598 --> 00:50:07,796
I'm going to eat. Do you want to?
Then I'll make something.

444
00:50:28,838 --> 00:50:32,592
You call this 'what will do'?
-Isn't it hot?

445
00:50:32,758 --> 00:50:35,830
Yes, it's hot. It's perfect.

446
00:50:42,598 --> 00:50:47,433
Have you always lived alone?
-Except one time with my sister.

447
00:50:47,598 --> 00:50:52,274
I referred to a friend.
A partner.

448
00:50:52,438 --> 00:50:57,114
Why not?
-I'm no good as a friend.

449
00:50:58,078 --> 00:51:02,390
You can't know
If you've never had a boy friend.

450
00:51:02,558 --> 00:51:05,948
Do you live alone
because of your sister?

451
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:11,068
What do you mean?
-Are you afraid something will happen?

452
00:51:11,238 --> 00:51:13,433
that you ought to have foreseen?

453
00:51:15,158 --> 00:51:20,152
Many people commit suicide without
showing signs beforehand.

454
00:51:22,158 --> 00:51:24,388
That's true.

455
00:51:29,238 --> 00:51:31,274
Are you expecting a visitor?

456
00:51:34,438 --> 00:51:35,996
Come in.

457
00:51:40,718 --> 00:51:44,506
This is Martin Rohde,
of the Copenhagen police.

458
00:51:44,678 --> 00:51:49,991
His wife has thrown him out.
This is Anton, I sometimes have sex with him.

459
00:51:58,118 --> 00:52:02,430
Do you want to go to bed right now?

460
00:52:03,758 --> 00:52:08,593
I won't stay.
Martin's sleeping on the guest bed.

461
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:10,714
But I thought ...

462
00:52:14,758 --> 00:52:18,990
I'll come back another time, okay?
-Sure.

463
00:52:20,518 --> 00:52:24,272
Good day.
-Good day. It was ... cozy.

464
00:52:36,478 --> 00:52:39,038
Nice guy.

465
00:52:40,078 --> 00:52:45,391
I had better leave you alone.
-No, we have work to do.

466
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:50,556
What then?
-Jesper Andersson.

467
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:29,150
Was it just you?
-Only me. What are you doing?

468
00:53:29,318 --> 00:53:31,593
I'm copying things.

469
00:53:32,758 --> 00:53:37,752
I've spent too much time here
for Carina to let me go now.

470
00:53:40,838 --> 00:53:45,354
What are you writing?
-About the rescued children.

471
00:53:45,518 --> 00:53:47,474
It has to be ready for tomorrow.

472
00:53:52,478 --> 00:53:56,551
I know who set the fire
at Gladans Chocolate.

473
00:53:56,718 --> 00:54:00,677
Do you? Who then?

474
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:05,275
Not all of it.
Just a small area in the office.

475
00:54:06,598 --> 00:54:09,908
Have you lost your senses?

476
00:54:10,078 --> 00:54:15,106
I have saved a child. And you can't
name me. Source protection.

477
00:54:15,278 --> 00:54:17,951
I don't want to "out" you.

478
00:54:20,038 --> 00:54:23,826
What'll you do now?
-I don't know.

479
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:28,353
It was so amazing
to save a child.

480
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:34,029
Or did I just find it normal
to set a building on fire?

481
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:40,234
I thought you'd changed.
-I have.

482
00:54:40,398 --> 00:54:42,628
There seems no difference.

483
00:54:43,718 --> 00:54:45,788
"So sue me."

484
00:55:20,238 --> 00:55:25,266
I thought you were ready.
-I want to thank you for your cooperation.

485
00:55:25,438 --> 00:55:28,669
I've got the sack because of you.
-Pity.

486
00:55:28,838 --> 00:55:32,194
But you have helped me,
So I will help you.

487
00:55:32,358 --> 00:55:37,478
Your newspaper will take you back, if you
get an exclusive interview with me.

488
00:55:37,638 --> 00:55:39,515
Will we meet?

489
00:55:39,678 --> 00:55:45,355
We'll meet, talk and then
can you turn me in to the police.

490
00:55:48,638 --> 00:55:51,391
Is this a joke?
-Not at all.

491
00:55:51,558 --> 00:55:56,427
I never wanted to escape punishment.
I want people to wake up.

492
00:55:56,598 --> 00:56:01,433
Now I'm done. I'm
ready for my sentence.

493
00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:08,157
How do we do that?
-I'll tell you when you're in your car.

494
00:56:15,798 --> 00:56:18,266
I'm sitting in my car.

495
00:56:21,118 --> 00:56:24,554
You are suddenly struck
by déjà vu?

496
00:56:26,038 --> 00:56:29,826
It wasn't at all funny.
-You know what isn't funny?

497
00:56:29,998 --> 00:56:33,308
People who hold their own interests
above everything else.

498
00:56:33,478 --> 00:56:37,391
Journalists let themselves get bribed.
Cowardly people.

499
00:56:37,558 --> 00:56:40,834
People like you, Daniel.

500
00:56:40,998 --> 00:56:45,833
Okay, very good. You know what?
We're done with each other.

501
00:56:45,998 --> 00:56:47,431
I agree.

1
00:00:00,848 --> 00:00:03,282
previously...

2
00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:08,718
Thanks for your cooperation.
-I'm done with you.

3
00:00:08,888 --> 00:00:10,765
I agree.

4
00:00:15,408 --> 00:00:20,004
Each fire rescues a child.
All of them can survive.

5
00:00:20,848 --> 00:00:25,285
"Thanks for the help."
-Milos, come right out.

6
00:00:27,168 --> 00:00:32,481
I haven't had sex with your son.
August and I haven't had sex.

7
00:00:33,848 --> 00:00:38,524
You don't work. What are your plans?
-The plan isn't to have a plan.

8
00:00:38,688 --> 00:00:41,122
I'm pregnant.
-Come here.

9
00:00:42,728 --> 00:00:45,765
Have you done it with Charlotte?
Why was that?

10
00:00:47,728 --> 00:00:52,040
Do you need it? Order in your life?
Sorry. It's too private.

11
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:54,039
I love you, Mette.

12
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:58,602
Have you never lived with
a boyfriend? Why not?

13
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:02,727
I'm no good as a friend.
-You can't know that.

14
00:01:06,128 --> 00:01:07,481
I am Emil.

15
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:12,040
It explains a lot
if he is in the police.

16
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:17,646
He could get riot gear
and a police car.

17
00:01:17,808 --> 00:01:22,757
The taser came from police storage.
He has knowledge of explosives.

18
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:27,080
Did you see who put down the wine?
You said you recognized him.

19
00:01:27,248 --> 00:01:28,840
Look at the pictures.

20
00:01:53,808 --> 00:01:56,322
Be careful of the car.

21
00:01:57,728 --> 00:02:02,882
Why did he kill Daniel?
-He didn't need him anymore.

22
00:02:03,048 --> 00:02:08,918
That isn't enough. Kerstin, Monique,
Emil Henning, Bjørn and Daniel.

23
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:12,444
A link between them.

24
00:02:14,128 --> 00:02:18,963
Andersson's been home 20 minutes now.
We can go inside.

25
00:04:10,448 --> 00:04:14,202
Why am I here?
-Why do you think?

26
00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:18,247
No idea, but I know
what happened at those times.

27
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:20,046
Because you were there?

28
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:24,963
As I'm in the police. And I know
what you two are working on.

29
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:31,368
Do you need DNA?
Fingerprints? It's fine by me.

30
00:04:31,528 --> 00:04:34,520
I want you to fill out the form.

31
00:04:41,288 --> 00:04:45,566
Anderson's alibis. Check them out.
-I'll get on it right away.

32
00:04:45,728 --> 00:04:49,846
Double check everything.
If it's him, it will likely agree.

33
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:52,966
Have Johan search
Daniel's computer.

34
00:04:53,128 --> 00:04:58,521
"If it's him"? Aren't you sure?
-You must always remain objective.

35
00:04:58,688 --> 00:05:04,923
Andersson went to therapy after
the death of his two colleagues.

36
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:06,726
Emil Fernskog.

37
00:05:06,888 --> 00:05:12,724
He relieved him of his position.
-See if he knows the other victims.

38
00:05:12,888 --> 00:05:17,962
We'll check out Jesper's
psychological dossier. Ready?

39
00:05:24,288 --> 00:05:27,724
Does Mette like you living with me?
-Probably, okay.

40
00:05:27,888 --> 00:05:30,686
Does she think you're having sex with me?
-No.

41
00:05:30,848 --> 00:05:33,282
Why not?
-You're not my type.

42
00:05:33,448 --> 00:05:38,238
Do you have a type? Charlotte and Mette
are quite different. Do you want to separate?

43
00:05:38,408 --> 00:05:44,119
No. It'll be okay.
-Have you reconciled?

44
00:05:44,288 --> 00:05:49,806
So you've been unfaithful?
-What are you doing?

45
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:53,597
Talking.
As colleagues do.

46
00:05:53,768 --> 00:05:58,125
You have no talent for it,
So don't.

47
00:05:58,288 --> 00:06:01,200
Do I irritate you now?
-No.

48
00:06:01,368 --> 00:06:05,043
But sometimes?
-Sometimes you're very annoying, yes.

49
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,961
More than other people?
-Now and then.

50
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:15,646
You don't care anyway
what other people think of you?

51
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:19,721
Well. It's important to me
how you feel about me.

52
00:06:19,888 --> 00:06:22,402
Is Mette unfaithful to you too?
-No.

53
00:06:22,568 --> 00:06:27,801
I read, in unhappy relationships both
parties often seek solace outside.

54
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:31,722
We aren't unhappy.
-Why are you weird?

55
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:38,726
Does it really matter to you
what I think about you?

56
00:06:38,888 --> 00:06:42,085
Then you must stop now. Thank you.

57
00:07:00,848 --> 00:07:04,045
I have hardly slept
since it happened.

58
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:09,123
I keep seeing all that blood,
and him and the sword ...

59
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:14,681
I don't know how I can work here.
-We want a file.

60
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:18,682
We don't have one.
It was his first visit.

61
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:22,045
Not Lasse Jönsson's.
But Jesper Andersson's.

62
00:07:23,368 --> 00:07:25,518
That name means nothing to me.

63
00:07:26,768 --> 00:07:29,328
It was a while ago.

64
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:39,202
Jesper Andersson. His last session
with Emil was five years ago.

65
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:43,805
I didn't work here then.
-We want his file.

66
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:46,436
I can't give it to you.
-Yes, you can.

67
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:48,087
I may not.

68
00:07:48,248 --> 00:07:54,244
For offenses punishable by more than 1 year
imprisonment voids privacy protection.

69
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:57,605
You know that
as a medical secretary?

70
00:08:10,328 --> 00:08:14,082
You still doubt whether it's him?
-I won't say.

71
00:08:14,248 --> 00:08:19,720
Because you want to be 100% sure?
-I want to be sure only when there is certainty.

72
00:08:19,888 --> 00:08:25,804
If it's him, he knows we have no DNA
or fingerprints. He's good.

73
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:30,727
We now know his relationship
to Emil and Henning.

74
00:08:30,888 --> 00:08:34,563
Three more.
Maybe he knows Ekwall from work.

75
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:40,360
Andersson's back in the
interrogation room. His lawyer too.

76
00:08:41,968 --> 00:08:47,088
Our subject has complete control.
Why does he need help?

77
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:51,719
Because we are super good.
-Not in his world. Not according to him.

78
00:08:51,888 --> 00:08:56,200
Why would he murder a homeless
person, a politician and a whore ...

79
00:08:56,368 --> 00:09:01,317
manipulate schizophrenics 
and threaten the lives of children?

80
00:09:01,488 --> 00:09:07,677
Talk about the death of your colleagues.
-I'd like to talk about that.

81
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:12,319
It was a joint Danish-Swedish operation
against a motorcycle gang.

82
00:09:12,488 --> 00:09:16,527
We had the building surrounded
and waited for a signal.

83
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:21,603
The Danes didn't search the building
from the other side.

84
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:28,844
We were shot at
and two of my colleagues were killed.

85
00:09:29,008 --> 00:09:32,921
You hold the Danish police
responsible for their death.

86
00:09:33,088 --> 00:09:37,161
You mean they actually
had to die?

87
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:39,319
I never said that.

88
00:09:39,488 --> 00:09:42,366
You said that on August 23
to your psychologist.

89
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:46,680
That was less than a month
after they were shot.

90
00:09:46,848 --> 00:09:51,478
Jesper was going to a psychologist
because of just those types of thoughts.

91
00:09:51,648 --> 00:09:56,244
You are then transferred.
-That was the right decision.

92
00:09:56,408 --> 00:10:01,277
That wasn't your opinion at the time.
-Now yes, now I've put it in perspective.

93
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:06,203
What do you think about your divorce
Now you've put it in perspective?

94
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:16,044
I understand why Maria left. I was
angry, I was full of hate.

95
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,803
I was selfish, unsympathetic.

96
00:10:19,968 --> 00:10:24,041
Now you're a considerably self-aware,
middle aged man.

97
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,961
Do you live with someone?
-No.

98
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:31,644
Why not?
-Sorry, but where is this going?

99
00:10:31,808 --> 00:10:36,643
Tholstrup Henning was one of the
Danes who participated in the operation.

100
00:10:36,808 --> 00:10:42,883
Wasn't the same Henning Tholstrup
just acquitted of negligence?

101
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:46,199
I know. I was there.
-Then you know ...

102
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:57,124
Then you know Henning was shot
day before yesterday.

103
00:10:57,288 --> 00:11:01,201
You spoke on TV about the verdict.

104
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:04,922
In Danish.
-Yes.

105
00:11:05,088 --> 00:11:08,683
I am bilingual. It's very useful
in my work.

106
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:11,760
You said we aren't equal
before the law.

107
00:11:11,928 --> 00:11:15,967
That's what the perpetrator wanted
to show with his first victims.

108
00:11:16,128 --> 00:11:18,198
Is that a problem?

109
00:11:18,368 --> 00:11:25,206
There are editors who've written
the same thing. Are they sitting here?

110
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:32,524
Then do you have anything else to present.
Such a motive, or evidence.

111
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:43,202
Three of his alibis are confirmed.

112
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:49,045
Ekwall was kidnapped when he was at
an information evening in Copenhagen.

113
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:54,646
When the bottles were distributed,
he was in a youth club in Rosengård.

114
00:11:54,808 --> 00:11:57,276
The staff confirms that.

115
00:11:57,448 --> 00:12:01,600
When Bjørn was kidnapped,
he was working in a school.

116
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:07,400
We don't know what time Bjørn was
kidnapped, but he was there at 7:30 pm.

117
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:10,719
Bjørn was alone a little after 7:00pm.

118
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:16,008
Jesper worked with Lennart Fransson
during the 2001 weapons amnesty.

119
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:20,958
Fransson registered the taser. We
don't know if he passed it to him.

120
00:12:21,128 --> 00:12:23,847
And Ferbé's computer?
-It's still missing.

121
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:29,321
The lock was forced. Break-in.
-Have we asked to arrest him?

122
00:12:29,488 --> 00:12:34,801
True to his profile.
Extremely focused on a project.

123
00:12:34,968 --> 00:12:40,918
No relationship. Successful in his work.
Experienced a traumatic event.

124
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:45,923
This gets us no further.
-We try it again.

125
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:56,847
Sonja Lindberg has pointed you out.
How do you explain that?

126
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:03,561
I don't know Sonja Lindberg.

127
00:13:03,728 --> 00:13:09,007
She is one of the homeless who
was poisoned. She has pointed you out.

128
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:13,366
She's mistaken.
-She viewed 15 pictures.

129
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:17,965
She wasn't mistaken.
She picked you out immediately.

130
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:22,246
She wasn't mistaken.
She recognized you and you know her.

131
00:13:22,408 --> 00:13:26,037
Is that the woman in a comma?
Until yesterday, yes.

132
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:30,565
And is she trustworthy?
-There isn't anyhing wrong with her eyes.

133
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:34,198
I've heard
she was homeless for a long time ...

134
00:13:34,368 --> 00:13:38,839
and that, sorry to say,
not entirely reliable.

135
00:13:39,008 --> 00:13:44,162
And, Jesper has an alibi for
the time the wine was deposited.

136
00:13:44,328 --> 00:13:47,604
But have you
already checked.

137
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:54,877
Hans gives up.
-Why?

138
00:13:55,048 --> 00:13:58,836
He wants to go back to Gothenburg.
Closer to the children.

139
00:13:59,008 --> 00:14:00,885
I can understand that.

140
00:14:01,968 --> 00:14:07,361
It is one hour by plane and three
by train. How close do you have to get?

141
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:13,357
You'll miss him.
-I don't know.

142
00:14:15,248 --> 00:14:19,161
The prosecutor authorized remand.
-On what grounds?

143
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:23,116
Think about what you'd prefer
to do in the next 72 hours.

144
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:35,887
The prosecutor has given us three days.
Three days root into your life.

145
00:14:36,048 --> 00:14:39,006
And we will find out
what you're hiding.

146
00:14:47,768 --> 00:14:52,842
No district court in the world
would you hold on to those grounds.

147
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:56,796
You also said no
prosecutor would do that?

148
00:14:56,968 --> 00:15:01,883
It's difficult to clear my name.
The press will devour me.

149
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:07,645
In 72 hours you'll befree. Then we'll see
how we cope with the press.

150
00:15:16,408 --> 00:15:21,323
Three days. They'll tear me apart.

151
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:29,200
If you have something to say,
it is good to do so now.

152
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:37,958
No, nothing.

153
00:15:42,928 --> 00:15:44,805
Thanks for the help.

154
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:15,841
Say, can I go to the bathroom?

155
00:18:53,488 --> 00:18:55,877
Open it.

156
00:18:57,368 --> 00:18:58,960
Get in.

157
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,600
Get back.

158
00:19:06,408 --> 00:19:07,966
Drive.

159
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:25,565
How could he have escaped?
-He received help.

160
00:19:25,728 --> 00:19:28,322
He used a key card.

161
00:19:28,488 --> 00:19:33,164
Where did the gun come from?
-He went to the bathroom before he escaped.

162
00:19:33,328 --> 00:19:37,037
Dis someone leave 
a weapon there for him?

163
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:43,807
Check everything. Bank accounts, emails,
phone calls, ex-wife, family.

164
00:19:43,968 --> 00:19:49,201
Leave everything else
and make sure you find the car.

165
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:04,366
Knock, knock, knock.

166
00:20:05,448 --> 00:20:08,201
Am I interrupting?
-No.

167
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:11,485
Or rather a little bit, yes.

168
00:20:11,648 --> 00:20:17,166
I was going to send the information, but then
I wanted to make sure you were around.

169
00:20:17,328 --> 00:20:21,037
What beautiful flowers.
-They are for my mother.

170
00:20:26,328 --> 00:20:32,324
I'm kidding. They are for you.
As I pass by unannounced.

171
00:20:33,768 --> 00:20:37,124
I'll get a vase. Do you want coffee?
-Please.

172
00:21:43,688 --> 00:21:48,398
No traces of blood or violence.
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.

173
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:54,723
Jesper has a foundation for young people
that fights crime.

174
00:21:54,888 --> 00:22:00,246
The foundation is registered
to Jesper's address.

175
00:22:00,408 --> 00:22:05,960
It is his foundation, so ...
-They rent a room in the Frihamnen.

176
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:08,366
What do all these proposals have in common?
-They were filmed.

177
00:24:10,008 --> 00:24:15,162
No computer, no camera, nothing.
We must search his apartment again.

178
00:24:38,248 --> 00:24:41,843
Isn't it strange the photos are
of his ex-wife?

179
00:24:43,288 --> 00:24:45,722
I don't have any of mine.

180
00:24:50,888 --> 00:24:54,483
Look.
Look who's the best man.

181
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:57,759
Kent Hammar.

182
00:24:59,008 --> 00:25:04,207
Look. This is the garage
Jesper comes in a few seconds.

183
00:25:04,368 --> 00:25:09,362
We thought Kent arrived at that
moment. But look.

184
00:25:19,448 --> 00:25:21,882
This is three minutes earlier.

185
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:28,247
He is waiting for someone.
-They work together. Anne?

186
00:25:28,408 --> 00:25:34,040
Hammar Kent, born in 1975,
joined the police in 2000.

187
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:39,282
He rented a room from Jesper.
They knew each other.

188
00:25:39,448 --> 00:25:44,124
When Jesper was in the special unit,
he recommended Kent twice.

189
00:25:44,288 --> 00:25:50,124
He failed the test both times.
-He was best man at Jesper's wedding.

190
00:25:50,288 --> 00:25:53,837
Colleagues confirm
they're good friends.

191
00:25:54,008 --> 00:25:59,002
That explains Jesper's alibis.
-We'll look at Kent's roster.

192
00:25:59,168 --> 00:26:01,204
So we had the right man.

193
00:26:05,848 --> 00:26:10,603
Now you know something more of it.
Call me if you're interested.

194
00:26:10,768 --> 00:26:14,044
Thank you. It looks fascinating.

195
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:18,247
I must thank you.
If only for your company.

196
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,845
Are you okay?

197
00:26:29,608 --> 00:26:31,405
What's going on?

198
00:26:31,888 --> 00:26:35,517
I've got cramps.
-Have you had them previously?

199
00:26:37,288 --> 00:26:39,085
I'm pregnant.

200
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:45,046
Then it's clear.
You must go to the hospital. Now.

201
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:47,199
My car is downstairs.

202
00:26:53,008 --> 00:26:56,159
Hammar used his credit card.
-Where?

203
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:59,957
Statoil Bunkeflostrand.
He rented a car.

204
00:27:00,128 --> 00:27:05,407
Do they know the license plate?
-There's a GPS tracking system.

205
00:27:05,568 --> 00:27:08,207
Do you know where they are?
-Yes.

206
00:27:09,648 --> 00:27:14,881
Hi, honey.
Where are you? I'll be right there.

207
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:18,757
Mette's gone to the hospital.
There's something to do with the child.

208
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,681
She's pregnant. I have to go.
Good luck.

209
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,521
Wasn't he neutered?

210
00:27:44,168 --> 00:27:48,844
They're in the third row.
Third car from the front.

211
00:27:49,008 --> 00:27:53,001
There is little space. Lots of people.
We'll wait for a while.

212
00:28:04,608 --> 00:28:06,280
I gotta pee.

213
00:28:13,448 --> 00:28:15,439
Hammar's left the car.

214
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:19,158
Anne and Navid, pick him up.

215
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:49,521
Jesper will wonder why he stays.
-We'll get him.

216
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:09,926
Put your weapon down.

217
00:29:11,608 --> 00:29:13,838
Put your weapon down.

218
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:17,676
Put your weapon down.

219
00:29:34,688 --> 00:29:38,806
Feel a pulse?
-He's alive. Take him to the car.

220
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:46,443
Police. Relax.
There's an ambulance.

221
00:30:50,288 --> 00:30:53,837
How are you?
-I'm in a lot of pain.

222
00:30:54,008 --> 00:30:55,566
What happened?

223
00:30:55,728 --> 00:31:01,997
We had lunch and suddenly I got
bad cramps twice. It hurts so much.

224
00:31:02,168 --> 00:31:05,683
And what about ...
-I don't know.

225
00:31:12,808 --> 00:31:17,438
I'm here with you,
So it'll be okay, okay?

226
00:31:19,368 --> 00:31:21,928
Who are you?
-Martin. Mette's husband.

227
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:27,321
Hi, I'm Tom.
I'm her doctor here in the hospital.

228
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:30,366
The ultrasound has told us two things.

229
00:31:30,528 --> 00:31:36,398
As far as we can see the children
are okay. And you have kidney stones.

230
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:41,846
Children?
You mean like twins?

231
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:46,887
There are two of each.
Two children and two stones.

232
00:31:51,688 --> 00:31:54,282
What do we do with the stones?

233
00:31:54,448 --> 00:31:57,645
Sometimes you can fix it 
by drinking a lot of water.

234
00:31:57,808 --> 00:32:01,881
Then peeing them out.
We can't crush them now.

235
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:07,566
If necessary, we go inside
with a tube and we can fish them out.

236
00:32:07,728 --> 00:32:14,440
But first we start drinking and
urination, take painkillers and thumbs up.

237
00:32:14,608 --> 00:32:17,441
Shall we meet again? Good.

238
00:32:24,728 --> 00:32:26,286
Two there.

239
00:32:27,688 --> 00:32:32,682
How can we save?
-Just now I have too much pain to talk.

240
00:32:32,848 --> 00:32:34,645
Of course.

241
00:33:15,248 --> 00:33:19,526
How old can they be?
-Sixteen, maybe seventeen.

242
00:33:23,448 --> 00:33:29,717
Jesper received a youth award
two years ago.

243
00:33:29,888 --> 00:33:32,083
He's done a good job.

244
00:33:34,328 --> 00:33:38,844
He didn't work with young people
to search for more victims.

245
00:33:39,008 --> 00:33:41,363
It was intended as a counterweight.

246
00:33:44,528 --> 00:33:49,761
Both are active. Sadistic.
Jesper over Hammar.

247
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:54,558
The man we seek, didn't enjoy
hurting people.

248
00:33:56,248 --> 00:33:58,523
They aren't him.

249
00:33:59,608 --> 00:34:02,168
Are we really sure?

250
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:06,600
Then we're back to square one.
-I 'm going to tell the others.

251
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:15,843
Jesper Andersson and Kent Hammar
aren't the men we're seeking.

252
00:34:16,008 --> 00:34:20,638
Andersson didn't know all the victims.
And his profile is wrong.

253
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:26,678
Maybe they know Hammar.
-What is wrong then?

254
00:34:26,848 --> 00:34:31,558
Our offender has no partner.
A partner poses a risk.

255
00:34:31,728 --> 00:34:35,118
But Sonja Lindberg identified him?

256
00:34:35,288 --> 00:34:40,123
She was on their videos.
They sexually abused her.

257
00:34:41,328 --> 00:34:43,922
So we're not finished with the case.

258
00:34:47,008 --> 00:34:49,886
Why are you sitting?

259
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:55,168
We have a break.
A coffee-break.

260
00:35:02,688 --> 00:35:04,804
What are you talking about?

261
00:35:04,968 --> 00:35:09,598
About nothing in particular.
Just small talk.

262
00:35:18,288 --> 00:35:20,848
I'm not feeling well.

263
00:35:43,848 --> 00:35:45,566
How's Mette?

264
00:35:47,168 --> 00:35:48,726
Better.

265
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:57,325
She'll stay for some more monitoring.
But she'll come home tonight.

266
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,126
Fine.

267
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:02,279
How's it this gone?

268
00:36:02,448 --> 00:36:06,760
Well. The two older ones are watching TV
and Nikolai is asleep.

269
00:36:06,928 --> 00:36:10,762
Nice. Thanks for your help.

270
00:36:10,928 --> 00:36:14,841
There is bread and coffee in the kitchen.

271
00:36:27,168 --> 00:36:28,886
Are you getting divorced?

272
00:36:35,928 --> 00:36:41,161
It started that way with mom.
You no longer slept at home.

273
00:36:42,928 --> 00:36:47,763
I don't know if you didn't want
to or if she didn't allow you.

274
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:53,037
I was one year younger 
than the twins when you left.

275
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:57,121
You came back on my 
tenth birthday with a bicycle.

276
00:36:57,968 --> 00:37:01,165
I did occasionally stop by.

277
00:37:02,488 --> 00:37:04,558
Not that I can remember.

278
00:37:07,328 --> 00:37:11,037
It seemed better to keep a distance.

279
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:13,802
You were very angry,
and your mother was angry.

280
00:37:13,968 --> 00:37:18,564
Then I met Julie and began a new life.

281
00:37:18,728 --> 00:37:20,798
I felt ...

282
00:37:22,288 --> 00:37:25,246
I could no longer
interfere with you.

283
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:29,086
That would be for me to decide.

284
00:37:30,528 --> 00:37:32,962
You know why you stayed away?

285
00:37:34,288 --> 00:37:38,122
Because you always chose
the path of least resistance.

286
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:43,964
You get used to in. 
And you stay that way.

287
00:37:46,968 --> 00:37:48,606
That's how I understand it.

288
00:37:55,088 --> 00:38:01,436
Would you have preferred I was there?
-Yes. For a while then.

289
00:38:01,608 --> 00:38:03,644
But after all I care about you.

290
00:38:06,008 --> 00:38:10,684
I threw the bike into the canal.
-Did you really do that?

291
00:38:10,848 --> 00:38:12,725
The next day.

292
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:20,686
If you love Mette and you don't
want a divorce, why are you acting weird?

293
00:38:27,768 --> 00:38:29,440
Because ...

294
00:38:30,928 --> 00:38:32,805
I thought ...

295
00:38:34,088 --> 00:38:36,477
I really thought I needed it.

296
00:38:37,968 --> 00:38:43,042
And I had to prove something.

297
00:38:44,888 --> 00:38:48,961
And I wanted to make sure
I'd made the right choice.

298
00:38:50,448 --> 00:38:54,566
And you're back there now?
-Yes.

299
00:38:54,728 --> 00:38:58,960
In some respects you are
the dumbest man I know.

300
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:04,282
Why do you live here?
-To see if I really mean nothing to you.

301
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:07,679
Was that it?
-What was I supposed to think?

302
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:09,839
You just went away.

303
00:39:18,048 --> 00:39:23,042
I'm glad you came here
to live. I am happy.

304
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:28,716
I've talked about it with Frida.
on the Internet.

305
00:39:28,888 --> 00:39:33,564
She said I had to talk to you about it.

306
00:39:33,728 --> 00:39:35,605
That is a wise girl.

307
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:59,726
Saga. Kerstin Ekwall was a prosecutor
before she went into local politics.

308
00:39:59,888 --> 00:40:05,724
I've reviewed at her won, lost and discontinued cases.

309
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:08,243
One is very interesting.

310
00:40:09,688 --> 00:40:11,246
Are you listening?

311
00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:14,888
In 2001 there was a collision on the bridge.

312
00:40:15,048 --> 00:40:19,997
A woman and her son were killed.
The other car drove away.

313
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:24,161
Later it appeared it had been
reported stolen.

314
00:40:24,328 --> 00:40:28,241
There was no evidence
the owner drove it that night.

315
00:40:28,408 --> 00:40:33,198
I remember. She suspected
Sixten Rockstad. But he wasn't prosecuted.

316
00:40:33,368 --> 00:40:36,246
Ekwall ordered an investigation.

317
00:40:38,368 --> 00:40:44,523
The husband of dead woman was a policeman.
The Danish elite police.

318
00:40:57,128 --> 00:40:58,925
Where are you?
-Home.

319
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:04,560
You shouldn't be. It's not Andersson.
But we are on to something.

320
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:08,118
Mette is doing well.
She has kidney stones.

321
00:41:08,288 --> 00:41:10,518
You probably wanted to know.

322
00:41:10,688 --> 00:41:14,840
I wanted to know, yes. Thank you.
When can you come in?

323
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:19,286
Now. Soon. At once.
-Nice.

324
00:41:19,448 --> 00:41:21,279
Was that Saga ?
-Yes.

325
00:41:22,328 --> 00:41:24,842
About Saga and me ...
-I already know.

326
00:41:25,008 --> 00:41:29,923
She said nothing happened.
So everything's fine.

327
00:41:31,688 --> 00:41:33,246
Okay.

328
00:41:35,648 --> 00:41:38,287
Are you saying 'okay'? You sound surprised.

329
00:41:38,448 --> 00:41:43,602
No, you know. I wanted to tell you
yesterday I was working at Saga's.

330
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:47,158
I know.
-She threw me out.

331
00:41:47,328 --> 00:41:50,764
Because you didn't like
how we treated each other.

332
00:41:52,768 --> 00:41:55,840
I gotta go. Can we continue talking?

333
00:41:56,968 --> 00:41:59,243
I thought you should know.

334
00:42:07,328 --> 00:42:09,637
Saga, you have a visitor.

335
00:42:09,808 --> 00:42:12,880
Who then?
-Anton "What's his name".

336
00:42:18,808 --> 00:42:20,161
What are you doing?

337
00:42:20,328 --> 00:42:23,161
How are you?
-Good.

338
00:42:23,328 --> 00:42:26,957
What are you doing?
-These are for you.

339
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:29,278
Why?

340
00:42:29,448 --> 00:42:35,398
We started in the wrong way.
With sex.

341
00:42:35,568 --> 00:42:38,002
And I want to ...

342
00:42:40,888 --> 00:42:45,439
I want to turn back time.
Get to know you.

343
00:42:45,608 --> 00:42:47,564
Why?

344
00:42:47,728 --> 00:42:54,804
Because I feel you're worthwhile
to get to know.

345
00:42:54,968 --> 00:42:59,678
Can we go out one more time together
to eat? Just food.

346
00:42:59,848 --> 00:43:03,443
You mean without sex?
-Yes. Without sex.

347
00:43:03,608 --> 00:43:08,204
Didn't you like it?
-Yes. That's not it.

348
00:43:09,248 --> 00:43:11,808
I want to see if it can be more.

349
00:43:17,248 --> 00:43:19,045
There you are again. Hello.

350
00:43:23,048 --> 00:43:25,403
Think about it.

351
00:43:25,568 --> 00:43:30,801
What are you to think about?
-Listen. Do you know this man?

352
00:43:30,968 --> 00:43:34,119
This is Jens. I've worked
with him for years.

353
00:43:34,288 --> 00:43:37,041
Was he a good cop?
-The best.

354
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:40,200
He could have gone far.

355
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:45,362
What happened?
-His wife and child were killed.

356
00:43:45,528 --> 00:43:51,558
He never got over that.
He was fired and lost everything.

357
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:58,283
Why are we talking about Jens?

358
00:43:59,808 --> 00:44:04,518
Would he be able to commit a murder
without leaving a trace?

359
00:44:05,568 --> 00:44:09,243
Freezing a woman's body?
Provoking a riot?

360
00:44:13,848 --> 00:44:15,679
It isn't him, Saga.

361
00:44:16,728 --> 00:44:19,879
Ekwall didn't prosecute anyone
after the accident.

362
00:44:20,048 --> 00:44:25,076
That may well be, but he's dead.
He blew out his brains.

363
00:44:25,248 --> 00:44:28,046
He's in Charlotte Söringer's archive.

364
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:33,680
In 2004, he was put in one of their
homes. Then he threatened them.

365
00:44:34,488 --> 00:44:38,720
Gry didn't look further because he's dead.
-Logical.

366
00:44:41,048 --> 00:44:45,087
Are you serious about this now?
-Why shouldn't I be?

367
00:44:45,248 --> 00:44:50,197
Because he's dead. He blew out
his brains in his caravan.

368
00:44:50,368 --> 00:44:52,359
I've seen him.

369
00:44:52,528 --> 00:44:57,124
You mean he literally
he shot his head off?

370
00:44:57,288 --> 00:45:00,405
Why?
-Didn't he have a face anymore?

371
00:45:11,048 --> 00:45:13,960
It's someone taking vengeance on
Jens' behalf.

372
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:19,885
After five years? Maybe it looked bad 
or because he was a policeman, but ...

373
00:45:20,048 --> 00:45:24,997
I see no fingerprints
or DNA samples were taken.

374
00:45:25,168 --> 00:45:29,002
He sat in his caravan.
He had blown out his brains.

375
00:45:29,168 --> 00:45:33,047
There was a farewell letter
in his own handwriting.

376
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:37,759
Isn't there an autopsy report?
-There was no investigation.

377
00:45:37,928 --> 00:45:41,887
Why not?
-The cause of death was obvious, right?

378
00:45:42,048 --> 00:45:47,361
Don't you do an investigation for a suicide?
-Yes, but this was a colleague.

379
00:45:47,528 --> 00:45:50,247
Let the poor man rest in peace.

380
00:45:54,488 --> 00:45:56,160
I'll take it with me.

381
00:45:57,368 --> 00:45:59,484
I've talked with August.

382
00:45:59,648 --> 00:46:04,164
I'd a feeling more went on
when he was with you.

383
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:07,161
Do you remember the conversation 
with Anja's mother?

384
00:46:07,328 --> 00:46:13,119
That you sometimes say what people
want to hear? Are you doing that now?

385
00:46:13,288 --> 00:46:15,119
And now neither.

386
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:20,796
You'll learn Jens' wife was
Swedish.

387
00:46:20,968 --> 00:46:24,802
She wanted to visit her parents
with her child.

388
00:46:26,288 --> 00:46:31,157
They were on the bridge 
when they were hit by a car.

389
00:46:31,328 --> 00:46:34,001
There was no evidence
it was Rockstad.

390
00:46:34,168 --> 00:46:37,319
But when Jens wants revenge ...
Or, someone else.

391
00:46:38,368 --> 00:46:41,201
Why didn't he kill
Rockstad?

392
00:46:57,088 --> 00:46:58,806
Thank you.

393
00:47:00,248 --> 00:47:04,321
Rockstad died in Monaco.
Drunk driving.

394
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,127
Well, do you call that poetic justice.

395
00:47:14,648 --> 00:47:19,039
Jens asked if he could
investigate the accident.

396
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:23,599
To us in any case.
Sweden refused each time.

397
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:27,923
A note about Jens.

398
00:47:29,168 --> 00:47:35,607
Is always tardy, places colleagues
in danger, suspected of drug use ...

399
00:47:35,768 --> 00:47:41,161
requirement for transfer to desk duty,
psychological evaluation.

400
00:47:41,328 --> 00:47:44,638
Signed by police union representative.

401
00:47:45,728 --> 00:47:47,844
Do you know who that was?
-Yes.

402
00:47:49,048 --> 00:47:50,925
Henning Tholstrup.

403
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:34,358
Daniel was investigating the accident.
He was at the same festival too.

404
00:48:34,528 --> 00:48:38,237
As who?
-Sixten Rockstad. In Copenhagen.

405
00:48:38,408 --> 00:48:44,165
He asked the staff how drinks
Rockstad had.

406
00:48:44,328 --> 00:48:48,367
And whether he got in to his car
behind the wheel.

407
00:48:48,528 --> 00:48:53,124
Did he complete his research?
-I don't know.

408
00:48:53,288 --> 00:48:58,601
He suddenly got an offer from
Stockholm. Good job, good income.

409
00:48:58,768 --> 00:49:01,328
He left immediately.
-Bribery.

410
00:49:01,488 --> 00:49:05,322
It isn't inconceivable
what you have about Daniel.

411
00:49:06,928 --> 00:49:12,639
As far as I know, he was completely
lacked moral scruples.

412
00:49:19,048 --> 00:49:20,766
I'll miss him.

413
00:49:25,608 --> 00:49:27,280
Thanks for your help.

414
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:35,446
Saga, Martin, I
read the information on Jens.

415
00:49:35,608 --> 00:49:40,477
There was a report recommending he
be relieved from his duties ...

416
00:49:40,648 --> 00:49:44,323
and even doubts about his fitness
as an officer.

417
00:49:44,488 --> 00:49:47,366
But the report is missing.

418
00:49:47,528 --> 00:49:51,316
Do you know the name of his psychologist?
-When was that?

419
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:55,766
Late autumn 2003.

420
00:49:55,928 --> 00:50:01,048
Lately he had completely given
up trying at work.

421
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:05,406
His imminent dismissal is again
referred to in the report.

422
00:50:05,568 --> 00:50:08,685
But there's no indication
who drafted the report.

423
00:50:08,848 --> 00:50:11,157
What did Emil Fernskog do in 2003?

424
00:50:11,328 --> 00:50:16,004
He had a practice in Copenhagen and
transferred to Sweden the following year.

425
00:50:16,168 --> 00:50:18,477
Andersson went there see to him.

426
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:23,278
Did Fernskog sometimes work
with traumatized officers?

427
00:50:31,008 --> 00:50:35,286
Sonja Lindberg was found.
She'll be here in about five minutes.

428
00:50:36,808 --> 00:50:39,322
I will put them in a vase?

429
00:50:43,328 --> 00:50:45,444
What did Anton want?

430
00:50:47,168 --> 00:50:49,318
He wants to take me out to dinner.

431
00:50:49,488 --> 00:50:52,560
He gives you flowers
and asks you to dinner?

432
00:50:52,728 --> 00:50:54,559
Yes. Weird, right?

433
00:50:55,808 --> 00:50:57,924
Why do you find that weird?

434
00:50:58,088 --> 00:51:03,082
I read men do that when they
want sex. But we already had sex.

435
00:51:03,248 --> 00:51:06,001
Where did you read that?
-Isn't it so?

436
00:51:06,168 --> 00:51:10,764
No. Or yes. Sometimes.
What are you doing?

437
00:51:10,928 --> 00:51:14,887
As Sonja Lindberg is ...
-I'm talking about Anton.

438
00:51:15,048 --> 00:51:17,357
I don't know.

439
00:51:17,528 --> 00:51:22,727
You should do it. He likes you.
-How is it possible? He doesn't know me.

440
00:51:22,888 --> 00:51:25,402
No, that's true.

441
00:51:34,448 --> 00:51:36,439
Do you know who that is?

442
00:51:38,808 --> 00:51:43,643
He was like my brother.
Stefan saved me.

443
00:51:56,648 --> 00:52:02,723
My brother is.
I wait for him where I live now.

444
00:52:05,168 --> 00:52:09,081
This man ...
Where did he save you?

445
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:18,239
Someone picked up my stuff.
He picked up my stuff all the time.

446
00:52:18,408 --> 00:52:22,526
He told him to stop,
and when he hit him.

447
00:52:22,688 --> 00:52:27,364
So Jens hit the man who picked up
your stuff?

448
00:52:30,048 --> 00:52:36,078
Later he hit him. Very, much 
worse than I got. Repeatedly.

449
00:52:36,248 --> 00:52:39,604
Remember the man's name?

450
00:52:39,768 --> 00:52:43,397
His name was Bjørn. Like the animal.

451
00:52:49,608 --> 00:52:51,166
Is this him?

452
00:52:56,768 --> 00:52:58,884
He hit him.

453
00:53:00,128 --> 00:53:02,278
He hit everyone.

454
00:53:05,368 --> 00:53:08,917
Thank you.
You have helped us a lot.

455
00:53:09,088 --> 00:53:12,683
Where is my brother?
You know, unfortunately.

456
00:53:16,608 --> 00:53:18,166
She can go.

457
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,726
Do you have a name?

458
00:53:34,888 --> 00:53:40,679
The business where the fire broke 
out is connected to a group: Pica.

459
00:53:40,848 --> 00:53:44,045
Do you know who is the CEO?

460
00:53:44,208 --> 00:53:48,599
No idea.
Ida Rockstad. Sixten's mother.

461
00:53:58,088 --> 00:54:02,366
I've talked with my dad.
-Was it good?

462
00:54:05,688 --> 00:54:09,727
Better than I expected.
-Does he feel guilty?

463
00:54:13,648 --> 00:54:18,927
Not really. But it was good. Thank you.
-Take me out to dinner.

464
00:54:24,248 --> 00:54:30,437
Deal. Say where and when.
-You can bet it'll be expensive.

465
00:54:42,768 --> 00:54:44,884
I thought you were asleep.

466
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:49,246
I'm looking after the children
I'm stuck.

467
00:54:56,088 --> 00:54:57,840
Are you all right?

468
00:55:08,448 --> 00:55:13,078
Remember Jens?
-Yes. What happened to him?

469
00:55:13,248 --> 00:55:15,637
Saga thinks he's still alive.

470
00:55:16,808 --> 00:55:18,685
You can't.

471
00:55:19,888 --> 00:55:25,406
I know it sounds crazy,
but there's every indication he is.

472
00:55:38,128 --> 00:55:42,644
I'll go.
-You may as well stay.

473
00:55:42,808 --> 00:55:44,878
Are you serious?

474
00:55:52,888 --> 00:55:58,918
Today I thought I was going to lose
the child, I was almost relieved.

475
00:56:00,848 --> 00:56:04,443
I'm not sure I want more children.

476
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:08,396
Now I felt like I didn't have
the right to take that decision.

477
00:56:08,568 --> 00:56:10,877
Can we handle it, more kids?

478
00:56:11,048 --> 00:56:14,597
If we can manage each other,
it can work.

479
00:56:18,368 --> 00:56:20,359
Can we do it together?

480
00:56:38,168 --> 00:56:43,367
We need to spread out the photos.
The whole area is full of them.

481
00:56:43,528 --> 00:56:48,807
He must have changed his appearance.
-I know.

482
00:56:48,968 --> 00:56:53,041
You know what's worse?
-No. What then?

483
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:59,363
Five years ago he staged his suicide, 
his plans have been long in the works. 

484
00:56:59,528 --> 00:57:04,886
Do you think he is finished now, after Daniel?
-Why not?

485
00:57:06,688 --> 00:57:10,567
It isn't enough. He isn't finished.

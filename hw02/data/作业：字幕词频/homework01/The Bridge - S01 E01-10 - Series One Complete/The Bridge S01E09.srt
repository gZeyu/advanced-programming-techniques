1
00:00:01,158 --> 00:00:03,592
previously...

2
00:00:07,118 --> 00:00:10,588
That message about Martin
at the bridge ...

3
00:00:10,758 --> 00:00:14,034
He had no good reason
to release the ambulance.

4
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:17,588
Can I take your gun?
-You can't carry arms.

5
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:23,750
What are all these for?

6
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:30,236
Back.

7
00:00:31,918 --> 00:00:33,670
Knock, knock, knock.

8
00:00:35,798 --> 00:00:39,586
What's the matter?
You must now go to the hospital.

9
00:00:39,758 --> 00:00:43,717
The children are doing well
but you have kidney stones.

10
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:46,312
Children? As in twins?

11
00:00:47,038 --> 00:00:49,268
Put your gun down.

12
00:00:51,158 --> 00:00:53,718
They aren't our men.
We're back to square one.

13
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:58,668
The girl named Anja Björk, 14
years old. She ran away from home.

14
00:00:59,918 --> 00:01:01,909
Saga Norén came along.

15
00:01:05,158 --> 00:01:08,389
You always choose
the path of least resistance.

16
00:01:08,558 --> 00:01:11,755
That's right.
That's how I hold it together.

17
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:13,909
A soldier.
-Special Unit.

18
00:01:14,078 --> 00:01:19,436
This is Jens. His wife and child
died in a car accident.

19
00:01:19,598 --> 00:01:22,112
They were killed on the bridge.

20
00:01:22,278 --> 00:01:23,916
He committed suicide.

21
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:27,866
No fingerprints
or DNA samples were taken.

22
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:31,747
Saga thinks he's still alive.
-You can't believe it.

23
00:02:01,598 --> 00:02:04,908
Do you want to sleep here again?
-Yes.

24
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:10,391
Fine. It would be bad if you don't
work it out. You're a good couple.

25
00:02:10,558 --> 00:02:12,150
That we are, indeed!

26
00:02:13,438 --> 00:02:16,874
Do you have to work?
-Yes, I'm off to Malmö.

27
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:20,352
I thought it was over.

28
00:02:20,518 --> 00:02:23,555
We still need to try to catch him.

29
00:02:23,718 --> 00:02:26,152
Saga also thinks he's alive.

30
00:02:27,518 --> 00:02:29,713
What?
-I don't know.

31
00:02:35,998 --> 00:02:41,709
When everything is quieter,
can we do something together?

32
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:44,676
Somewhere or something.

33
00:02:44,838 --> 00:02:46,669
We'll work it out together?
-Yes.

34
00:02:48,678 --> 00:02:50,430
Where should we go?

35
00:02:51,518 --> 00:02:53,190
I don't know.

36
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:56,708
You think about it today?

37
00:02:58,318 --> 00:02:59,876
Okay.

38
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:18,508
He can be recognized. He operates
both in Malmö and Copenhagen.

39
00:03:18,678 --> 00:03:22,591
He's changed his appearance?
-Probably.

40
00:03:22,758 --> 00:03:25,431
Bjørn knew him by his eyes.

41
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:32,790
Search the archives for things
about facial plastic surgery.

42
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:36,394
What should I focus on?
-Deaths and missing persons.

43
00:03:36,558 --> 00:03:38,753
Hi, everyone.

44
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:43,833
Where were you? I thought you were
sleeping at my place.   -I slept at home.

45
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:47,233
I haven't got anything
going on with Saga, though.

46
00:03:47,398 --> 00:03:52,028
Martin went strange and then
his wife threw him out.

47
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,666
That's right. Then you know that.

48
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:02,986
What was the name of Jens'wife?
-Mikaela. His wife was named Mikaela.

49
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:06,468
Why were they crossing the bridge?
-She was going to Sweden.

50
00:04:06,638 --> 00:04:09,755
Jens said she went to her parents.

51
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:12,830
Two o'clock at night, in the
middle of the week.

52
00:04:12,998 --> 00:04:18,026
Strange time to visit your parents.
-I'll check it out.

53
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:42,115
Can you pick up
the little ones today?

54
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:44,633
At what time?
-Around eleven.

55
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:49,268
Aren't they in school?
-They're out today.

56
00:05:49,438 --> 00:05:51,588
We're also going to the zoo.

57
00:05:51,758 --> 00:05:55,671
What did you before?
-Team meetings. Here at home.

58
00:05:55,838 --> 00:06:00,389
Are you still sick?
-It's a presentation.

59
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:02,116
I can handle it.

60
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:09,351
I don't want the children running
around here, can you watch them?

61
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:11,827
No, I have to go to town.

62
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:18,552
I understand it's difficult for you
liveing in my house. Martin is almost never here.

63
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:24,827
I've never asked for anything, and
allowed you to use our house as a hotel.

64
00:06:24,998 --> 00:06:27,353
But I need you now.

65
00:06:27,518 --> 00:06:31,670
What's so important
you can't help me?

66
00:06:32,838 --> 00:06:35,398
I have a job interview.

67
00:06:36,758 --> 00:06:43,834
An interview? For a job?
-Yes. I can pay for the hotel.

68
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:49,434
I'll find something else.

69
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:52,554
Make a good job of it.

70
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:56,030
Good luck.
-Thank you.

71
00:07:30,238 --> 00:07:32,513
Think out loud.

72
00:07:32,678 --> 00:07:34,873
You were friends with Jens.
-Yes.

73
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,316
That's why he didn't shot you at Sorgenfri.
-Probably.

74
00:07:40,718 --> 00:07:44,552
Was there anything between you two
that's relevant to our case?

75
00:07:46,238 --> 00:07:52,268
I don't know. Jens was a good
cop and a good person.

76
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:57,512
He thought he could improve the world.
This is something quite different.

77
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:02,069
You were right. Jens' wife
wasn't on the way to her parents.

78
00:08:02,238 --> 00:08:03,591
Where was she going?

79
00:08:03,758 --> 00:08:08,627
They thought her friend,
Josefin Samuelsson, perhaps knew.

80
00:08:08,798 --> 00:08:12,188
And did she?
-Mikaela was going to her.

81
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:27,146
Why was Mikaela coming to you?

82
00:08:27,318 --> 00:08:32,187
She had a fight with Jens and asked
if she and Rasmus could sleep at my place.

83
00:08:32,358 --> 00:08:34,474
What were they arguing about?

84
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:40,668
She wanted a divorce. She told him
she had met someone else.

85
00:08:40,838 --> 00:08:45,958
Jens was furious and wanted her
say more. She didn't dare to stay.

86
00:08:46,118 --> 00:08:50,316
Then she decided to come 
with Rasmus to my place.

87
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:53,993
Did she tell you who she'd met?
-No.

88
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:59,596
Did she tell Jens?
-No. Only that she had met someone.

89
00:08:59,758 --> 00:09:02,716
Are you sure?
-Yes.

90
00:09:02,878 --> 00:09:07,429
I asked if she warned
him about Jens.

91
00:09:07,598 --> 00:09:10,874
She said Jens didn't
know who he was.

92
00:09:11,038 --> 00:09:13,313
Did she say anything else?
-No.

93
00:09:13,478 --> 00:09:17,266
No, she called from the bridge
and said we'd see each other soon.

94
00:09:17,438 --> 00:09:20,748
Why the questions?
It was years ago.

95
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:24,433
Their names has surfaced
in our investigation.

96
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:29,592
Jens committed suicide.
-Yeah, I know.

97
00:09:56,398 --> 00:09:58,832
Why did you walk away?

98
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:03,753
The man, who Mikaela met, was me.

99
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:11,075
I wasn't married. It was long
Before I met Mette.

100
00:10:11,238 --> 00:10:17,586
I was separated from Susanne.
She had left with Julie.

101
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:20,830
Mikaela had it hard,
and then it happened.

102
00:10:20,998 --> 00:10:26,948
So you weren't married, but she was
to your best friend and colleague.

103
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:30,797
Can it stay between us?

104
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:36,316
I don't want the rest of
the team to know.

105
00:10:36,478 --> 00:10:39,754
If it's important,
is unavoidable.

106
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,748
Did you know she wanted to tell Jens?
-No.

107
00:10:45,838 --> 00:10:48,796
It must have been difficult
to see him every day.

108
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:54,430
How could you continue as colleagues
after what you had done?

109
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:58,273
Or wasn't that the intention?

110
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:04,988
I had certainly never
wanted to cause her death.

111
00:11:05,158 --> 00:11:06,716
You didn't.

112
00:11:09,158 --> 00:11:13,071
She wanted to tell.
Jens was so angry when she left.

113
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:16,867
Without me, there wouldn't have been
anything to say.

114
00:11:17,038 --> 00:11:21,793
Without a bridge, there'd be no accident.
So you shouldn't think you're responsible.

115
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,116
But I do.

116
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,516
Come on.

117
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:40,116
Have you found anything?

118
00:11:41,438 --> 00:11:44,635
It costs money
to perform this operation.

119
00:11:44,798 --> 00:11:49,269
Maybe he owns property
and we can follow a transaction.

120
00:11:49,438 --> 00:11:54,148
We looked at unresolved
robberies and burglaries.

121
00:11:54,318 --> 00:11:58,277
That has yielded nothing.
But we'll go on checking.

122
00:11:58,438 --> 00:12:03,307
Did your colleagues know about Jens?
-Lillian told a few of them.

123
00:12:03,478 --> 00:12:05,355
What did the friends say?

124
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:13,037
Mikaela told Jens when she left
home, she was afraid to stay with him.

125
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:16,349
What was wrong?
-She had met another guy.

126
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:18,270
Do we know who he was?

127
00:12:21,998 --> 00:12:27,391
She didn't say, and Jens didn't know.
So it isn't important.

128
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:35,870
I've got Karl-Erik Hermansson,
a plastic surgeon.

129
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:41,829
Killed in an accident in 2007.
He had a clinic near the Triangle.

130
00:12:41,998 --> 00:12:43,716
Did he have any employees?

131
00:12:43,878 --> 00:12:47,951
A nurse, Elsa Dahlberg.
Here's her address.

132
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:57,467
I just wanted to give you 
a compliment. You're doing well.

133
00:12:57,638 --> 00:13:01,790
If it leads somewhere ... You're deserving.

134
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:09,187
If someone is solving this, you are.
-I think so.

135
00:13:22,918 --> 00:13:27,992
Do you ever tell the others
you appreciate their work?

136
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:29,716
Why not?

137
00:13:31,438 --> 00:13:34,794
I just tell them what to do.

138
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,110
They do it well.
-It's their job to get it right.

139
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,314
Don't you like to be praised?

140
00:13:43,638 --> 00:13:45,947
No, I don't need it.

141
00:13:47,638 --> 00:13:53,474
Do you think it's important?
-Very. Most people find it important.

142
00:13:53,638 --> 00:13:55,868
Do you want to praise me now?

143
00:13:57,038 --> 00:13:58,710
It's okay to do that.

144
00:13:59,878 --> 00:14:02,836
What do you want me to say?
-It doesn't work like that.

145
00:14:02,998 --> 00:14:08,436
It's like wanting somebody to say he
loves you. It should come by itself.

146
00:14:22,318 --> 00:14:24,274
Did you miss me yesterday?

147
00:14:24,438 --> 00:14:27,828
When?
-Last night when I didn't.

148
00:14:32,598 --> 00:14:34,316
A little.

149
00:14:46,358 --> 00:14:52,797
Karl-Erik ... They said he
took his own life in his car.

150
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,348
But I never believed that.
-Why not?

151
00:14:56,518 --> 00:14:59,590
I worked with him for eleven years.

152
00:14:59,758 --> 00:15:03,068
I'd know if he was planning suicide.

153
00:15:03,238 --> 00:15:09,996
Many people who commit suicide
show no signs beforehand.

154
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:18,557
And then there was the fire.
It was obvious something was wrong.

155
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,278
What fire?
-In the surgery.

156
00:15:21,438 --> 00:15:26,148
Two weeks after his death.
The entire building almost burned down.

157
00:15:26,318 --> 00:15:29,674
This man.
Was he a patient of yours?

158
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:42,077
Jens "What's his name". A Dane.

159
00:15:42,238 --> 00:15:46,789
It wouldn't surprise me
if he had committed suicide.

160
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,311
Why not?

161
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:53,950
If you want to change your appearance
so much, there's a lot wrong with you.

162
00:15:54,118 --> 00:16:00,637
What did he have done?
-Hairline, nose, mouth, teeth ...

163
00:16:00,798 --> 00:16:03,517
changes in bone structure.

164
00:16:03,678 --> 00:16:07,227
But he was very stylish.

165
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:11,437
Karl-Erik was good at his job.

166
00:16:11,598 --> 00:16:14,192
Do you have records from that time?

167
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:20,035
They were there.
And backups on the computer.

168
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:23,156
Unfortunately, everything was
destroyed in the fire.

169
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:27,789
Can you describe
what he looked like for an artist?

170
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,587
I think I have a picture of him.

171
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:35,114
Him? After the surgery fire?

172
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:41,069
I had paper copies of some
patients' files.

173
00:16:41,238 --> 00:16:44,913
I sometimes worked from home.
My husband was ill.

174
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:48,707
So you may now have
something at home?

175
00:16:48,878 --> 00:16:50,550
In the attic.

176
00:16:57,358 --> 00:17:00,316
Do you remember where they were
placed?

177
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,834
They're in a box.
What's marked on it?

178
00:17:03,998 --> 00:17:09,630
I don't remember anymore, but they
lie slightly further in.

179
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:14,155
How far?
-Go further that way.

180
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:18,869
Maybe somewhere near a typewriter.

181
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:27,551
There.

182
00:17:30,238 --> 00:17:32,433
It says 'office' on it.

183
00:17:32,598 --> 00:17:37,035
Is 'office' written on it?
-Yes, that's it.

184
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,636
There.

185
00:18:15,238 --> 00:18:20,471
Sorry I'm late.
Flowers for your recovery.

186
00:18:24,158 --> 00:18:25,750
Come inside.

187
00:18:31,638 --> 00:18:34,436
Thi is what he looks like now.

188
00:18:37,198 --> 00:18:40,270
What do we do now?
-I try to find a name.

189
00:18:40,438 --> 00:18:43,475
What about the picture?
Do we distribute it?

190
00:18:43,638 --> 00:18:46,710
He doesn't know we know
what he looks like.

191
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:50,996
If no one but us knows,
he can't be recognized.

192
00:18:51,158 --> 00:18:56,516
If we want to catch him,
Everyone should know what he looks like.

193
00:18:56,678 --> 00:19:00,637
If we do that, he'll disappear.
-If we have a leak.

194
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,677
He always knows the information
we distribute.

195
00:19:04,838 --> 00:19:07,989
Okay, we'll leave it
a moment for us.

196
00:19:09,678 --> 00:19:11,157
How long?

197
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:17,109
If we have anything tomorrow morning,
I'll issue an alarm. Europol Interpol, everywhere.

198
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:25,357
Martin. I won't lie to Hans.
-What are you lying about then?

199
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:29,591
I haven't told him
you had a thing with Mikaela.

200
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:34,507
You haven't told everything.
That's not lying.

201
00:19:34,678 --> 00:19:39,115
Not tell the truth
is the same as lying.

202
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,395
But has he asked you about it?

203
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,028
if he'd asked,
would you conceal anything?

204
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:53,946
Then you haven't lied.
-He'll come to know sooner or later.

205
00:19:54,998 --> 00:20:01,028
You say you knew, but
you didn't think it was important.

206
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:04,389
But then I lied.

207
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:09,597
Is it important?
Until now, no.

208
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:24,673
What a beautiful house you have.
-Thank you. We are very happy with it.

209
00:20:26,918 --> 00:20:32,709
What does your husband do?
Martin works for the police.

210
00:20:32,878 --> 00:20:38,874
Exciting. What kind of police
work does he do?

211
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,393
He's a detective.

212
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:46,074
He's working on the bridge murder
case or the TT ...

213
00:20:46,238 --> 00:20:48,388
or whatever they call the crazy guy.

214
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:53,188
Then he's busy. It seems
they can't catch him.

215
00:20:53,358 --> 00:20:57,033
I wouldn't say so.
They're close to solving it.

216
00:20:57,198 --> 00:20:59,268
Mommy, when are we leaving?

217
00:20:59,438 --> 00:21:02,953
When I finish work.
If I can handle it.

218
00:21:03,118 --> 00:21:05,951
You promised.
-Before I became ill.

219
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:08,473
You can work.

220
00:21:08,638 --> 00:21:14,156
The more you disturb me, the longer
it'll take and I'm tired now.

221
00:21:18,718 --> 00:21:23,792
Where were you going?
-To the zoo.

222
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,995
Now it'll be a movie and candy.

223
00:21:27,158 --> 00:21:31,197
The zoo sounds like more fun.
-They think so too.

224
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:32,950
Do you want company?

225
00:21:33,998 --> 00:21:36,751
No, I'll manage.

226
00:21:36,918 --> 00:21:42,834
You do this for sure, but I can
help with the kids, if you want.

227
00:21:42,998 --> 00:21:44,351
It isn't necessary.

228
00:21:44,518 --> 00:21:49,228
I haven't been in ages.
It would be nice.

229
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,552
Thank you. Nice.

230
00:22:07,758 --> 00:22:11,273
Thank you for coming.
You'll hear from us.

231
00:22:11,438 --> 00:22:16,387
"Thank you for your interest,
but the job is already taken."

232
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:21,678
Excuse me?
-If you want help with the formulation.

233
00:22:21,838 --> 00:22:24,955
As I mentioned, you'll be hearing from us.

234
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:01,992
What are you doing here already?
-What do you mean?

235
00:23:02,158 --> 00:23:06,470
You said you could only come this afternoon?
-Afternoon?

236
00:23:06,638 --> 00:23:10,392
We decided to see each other?
-Did we?

237
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:13,118
We agreed.

238
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:18,306
When did we agree?
-The day before yesterday. In the chat room.

239
00:23:18,478 --> 00:23:22,915
We don't chat.
-Quit kidding.

240
00:23:23,078 --> 00:23:24,750
It's true.

241
00:23:25,918 --> 00:23:31,311
Are you taking the piss? We chatted
for more than one week, every night.

242
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:37,269
No we don't, you know. Someone
must be playing a joke on you.

243
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:43,395
I hope you haven't revealed too much.

244
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:46,356
Did you say anything
you'd regret?

245
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:49,992
No, not directly.

246
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:55,995
I don't know.
I thought I was talking to you.

247
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,267
In any case we have met each other again.

248
00:24:09,398 --> 00:24:11,150
Am I interrupting?
-What is it?

249
00:24:11,318 --> 00:24:14,469
Where's Martin?
-Coffee Break. I'll get him.

250
00:24:14,638 --> 00:24:20,190
Don't. I want to tell you
before the others hear.

251
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:24,795
I've asked for a transfer.
-Yes, to Gothenburg.

252
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:27,108
It's going to happen.
-When?

253
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,953
I don't know.
First I want to close this case.

254
00:24:31,118 --> 00:24:35,828
And they must find a replacement.
-How long will that take?

255
00:24:35,998 --> 00:24:39,513
I don't know. A month maybe.

256
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:43,470
Do you know who it's going to be?
-No.

257
00:24:46,438 --> 00:24:50,670
You'll do just fine.
You're a great police officer.

258
00:24:50,838 --> 00:24:53,830
Not everone agrees.
-They'll see their mistake.

259
00:24:53,998 --> 00:24:56,990
Not everyone is as understanding as you.

260
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:02,031
I just wanted you to know.

261
00:25:21,358 --> 00:25:23,269
A cession with Johan.

262
00:25:25,678 --> 00:25:30,194
We have a name.
Sebastian Sandstrod.

263
00:25:30,358 --> 00:25:34,431
There was a link between him
and Jens' bank account.

264
00:25:34,598 --> 00:25:37,271
He has a IT-consulting firm.
-Where?

265
00:25:37,438 --> 00:25:41,716
There's only a PO Box
and a mobile phone.

266
00:25:41,878 --> 00:25:46,156
When we discovered his name,
we have everything. Credit card, address ...

267
00:25:46,318 --> 00:25:50,072
Where does he live?
-Outside Copenhagen. In Hellerup.

268
00:25:50,238 --> 00:25:52,752
Did Jens live there?
-No.

269
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:57,275
Well done. You have
all done very well.

270
00:25:57,438 --> 00:25:59,952
Thank you.
-No thanks.

271
00:26:01,598 --> 00:26:03,395
Will you come with me?

272
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:07,273
No, I'm going along with Martin.

273
00:26:10,718 --> 00:26:12,948
Who are you calling?
-Mette.

274
00:26:13,118 --> 00:26:16,235
Did she know Mikaela?
-No.

275
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:20,027
Tell her now you've deceived her.

276
00:26:20,198 --> 00:26:25,272
Because even though you didn't know her yet,
when you knew Mikaela, when you were with ...

277
00:26:27,358 --> 00:26:29,997
Go and wait outside.

278
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:39,675
That's my husband.
I'll call him later.

279
00:26:41,118 --> 00:26:44,076
Where's your hat?
-I don't know.

280
00:26:48,238 --> 00:26:51,867
Have you told your husband about us?
-What then?

281
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:55,792
I came today and wanted to
go to the zoo?

282
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:58,074
I'll leave him a note.

283
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,427
Then we're done.

284
00:27:02,598 --> 00:27:07,035
you don't regret it?
-No, I'm excited.

285
00:27:17,718 --> 00:27:19,515
Nobody in the house.

286
00:27:26,998 --> 00:27:28,875
We'll go in.

287
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:19,356
Downstairs.

288
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:48,114
I had Gry, Navid and Anne come.
They know what to look for.

289
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:53,511
We also have police.
-There's no time for political stuff.

290
00:28:53,678 --> 00:28:56,954
Easily said.
You haven't anything to lose.

291
00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:06,393
I'm going to talk to someone who knew Jens.
-You knew him.

292
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:09,948
Not in the last few years.
-I want to leave the team.

293
00:29:10,118 --> 00:29:12,348
I have withdrawn the report.

294
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:18,028
For the bridge?
-Yes. I thought you should know.

295
00:29:18,198 --> 00:29:21,554
But you were wrong however.
-Thanks anyway.

296
00:29:32,078 --> 00:29:35,434
Has she been talking to you 
about me on the way here?

297
00:29:35,598 --> 00:29:37,509
No. Was she supposed to?

298
00:29:37,678 --> 00:29:41,671
No, you know. But I'm quitting.
I'm moving.

299
00:29:41,838 --> 00:29:43,317
I know.

300
00:29:43,478 --> 00:29:47,073
Now it's certain, I wonder 
how she'll handle it.

301
00:29:47,238 --> 00:29:52,073
Saga never says how she feels.
-If anyone knows, it's you.

302
00:29:52,238 --> 00:29:56,629
You think so?
-You might ask her about it.

303
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:00,393
Of course.
-It'll mean a lot to me.

304
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:02,947
You mean a lot to her.

305
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:44,392
Remember my old colleague. Jens?
-He lived here.

306
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:50,793
Were there places
where he felt safe?

307
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:56,794
He didn't talk very much.
He was very self contained.

308
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:59,233
Do your best, I need something.

309
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:04,347
He bought the caravan, in which he
committed suicide. All I know.

310
00:31:04,518 --> 00:31:06,156
Why?

311
00:31:09,678 --> 00:31:11,748
It wasn't suicide.

312
00:31:11,918 --> 00:31:14,637
Was he killed?
-No, he's still alive.

313
00:31:15,718 --> 00:31:20,712
What are you saying?
-His name is Sebastian Sandstrod. Know him?

314
00:31:24,078 --> 00:31:28,674
Think carefully. Can you
think of anything?

315
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:38,436
Yeah, hold on. Just before he
left here, he got a package.

316
00:31:38,598 --> 00:31:42,637
What was it?
-His family had a house in Sweden.

317
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:45,028
In Höllviken.
-Yes you're right.

318
00:31:45,198 --> 00:31:49,316
When they sold it,
they sent his things to Mikaela.

319
00:31:49,478 --> 00:31:53,676
What things?
-I don't know exactly.

320
00:31:53,838 --> 00:31:58,593
Notebooks, some letters
personal things.

321
00:31:58,758 --> 00:32:01,750
But there was something
that infuriated him.

322
00:32:01,918 --> 00:32:03,954
What?
-I don't know.

323
00:32:04,118 --> 00:32:07,793
But he cried
someone had to die.

324
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:13,635
He broke furniture. He was
out of control. I had to throw him out.

325
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:19,873
When he bought the caravan in which he ...
He never came back.

326
00:32:28,878 --> 00:32:33,190
Saga, here. He knows it was you.

327
00:32:57,318 --> 00:33:00,355
Come on, now. Just pick up.

328
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:11,358
It's August.
-It's me. Is Mette home?

329
00:33:11,518 --> 00:33:13,668
No. I'm home alone.

330
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:19,310
Where'd she go?
-She said she went to the zoo.

331
00:33:19,478 --> 00:33:24,711
I thought she wasn't going.
-There's a note.

332
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:29,349
She is gone. With someone.
-Who?

333
00:33:31,078 --> 00:33:33,069
Sebastian Sandstrod.

334
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:56,034
His photograph's been distributed 
and there's an APB on him and his car.

335
00:33:56,198 --> 00:34:02,956
Gry, Navid and Anne are searching his
cellar. He must have planned this too.

336
00:34:03,118 --> 00:34:07,031
You said he has succeeded 
in everything else?

337
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:14,234
Does that mean ...
-Stop it. I can't think.

338
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:18,676
The zoo's been searched completely.
They're not there.

339
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:23,309
Why's he out to get you?
You were friends.

340
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,675
How do I know what he thinks?

341
00:34:33,558 --> 00:34:36,755
And Mette's mobile?
-Barbara's working on it.

342
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:39,478
Just move it.

343
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:54,993
I've got him. He's in that area.

344
00:34:55,158 --> 00:35:00,471
Can you define it more precisely?
-No. But he doesn't seem to be moving.

345
00:35:00,638 --> 00:35:02,754
What is that?
-The Zoo.

346
00:35:02,918 --> 00:35:05,432
They're still there.
How's that possible?

347
00:35:05,598 --> 00:35:08,988
It doesn't make sense.
-Perhaps the ring tone is off.

348
00:35:09,158 --> 00:35:11,672
He gives his name for Mette to write down.

349
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:16,116
He trusts we'll learn
who he is and where they are.

350
00:35:16,278 --> 00:35:18,838
But that's the best we have.

351
00:35:21,718 --> 00:35:23,674
Can't you say "thanks"?

352
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:28,229
The first team is about 5 minutes away.
-No uniforms.

353
00:35:28,398 --> 00:35:30,309
Okay, we're now on our way.

354
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:38,988
Should we go?

355
00:35:40,878 --> 00:35:42,436
What is it?

356
00:36:35,598 --> 00:36:36,997
That way.

357
00:36:44,518 --> 00:36:48,067
Saga Norén.
-He used his credit card.

358
00:36:48,238 --> 00:36:51,753
Where?
-Just now. In the zoo café.

359
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:57,356
He used his credit card. Where?
-In a kiosk called the Proviant.

360
00:37:12,038 --> 00:37:16,509
Police. I want to see your credit card.
-I've got it.

361
00:37:16,678 --> 00:37:21,149
Can I see him?
-He said I had to use it here.

362
00:37:23,078 --> 00:37:25,876
Are you Martin?
-Yes.

363
00:37:26,038 --> 00:37:28,029
He said you'd duck.

364
00:37:29,078 --> 00:37:34,152
Relax. Here's the point.

365
00:37:35,278 --> 00:37:37,838
He said I had to give it to you.

366
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:02,789
Do you have children?

367
00:38:06,238 --> 00:38:10,072
I had one. One son.

368
00:38:10,238 --> 00:38:14,072
What happened?
Auto accident.

369
00:38:16,478 --> 00:38:20,915
That's really terrible. I'm sorry.

370
00:38:23,518 --> 00:38:25,748
It took a while ...

371
00:38:28,558 --> 00:38:30,992
but I recovered.

372
00:38:32,038 --> 00:38:37,237
The worst was the rage.
You need to vent your anger.

373
00:38:39,038 --> 00:38:41,711
I worked at it every day.

374
00:38:42,798 --> 00:38:46,711
I don't know what I'd do if
something happened to the children.

375
00:38:51,998 --> 00:38:58,187
And your wife? Is she ...
-She met another guy.

376
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:02,715
She wanted a divorce. I let her go.
So I lost her already before the accident.

377
00:39:03,518 --> 00:39:07,113
Pardon me.
I rooting around in your life.

378
00:39:08,598 --> 00:39:10,316
It doesn't matter.

379
00:39:11,398 --> 00:39:14,470
Martin deceived me.

380
00:39:14,638 --> 00:39:18,631
I mean, I know
what you've been through.

381
00:39:22,038 --> 00:39:23,551
It hurts.

382
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:32,391
We'd better ...

383
00:39:33,398 --> 00:39:35,036
Children.

384
00:39:36,278 --> 00:39:37,996
We're leaving.

385
00:39:42,518 --> 00:39:49,469
Thanks for today. It was fun.
-I want to show you one thing, okay?

386
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:52,152
We must go home. They're tired.

387
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:57,267
It'll only take a minute.
You won't regret it.

388
00:40:23,118 --> 00:40:25,029
The door is open.

389
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:32,146
Go inside.
There's a surprise for you.

390
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:34,513
The light switch is next to the door.

391
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:43,633
Whose is this?
-It belongs to a friend of mine.

392
00:40:49,798 --> 00:40:53,427
What animal is that? A rat?
-I think so.

393
00:40:53,598 --> 00:40:59,036
Rats aren't so small.
These are slightly larger.

394
00:40:59,198 --> 00:41:00,756
What is it?

395
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:17,597
Pardon me.
-I didn't know. That was ...

396
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:23,230
I'll get the kids.
-That is the best.

397
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:28,631
Come on, kids.
-Look, a hamster.

398
00:41:28,798 --> 00:41:32,632
I have something for you.
Close your eyes.

399
00:41:33,678 --> 00:41:36,146
Close your eyes. Give me your hand.

400
00:41:39,718 --> 00:41:42,437
Hold down here.
-What is it?

401
00:41:42,598 --> 00:41:44,156
I'm almost done.

402
00:41:45,478 --> 00:41:47,036
Good pinch.

403
00:41:48,918 --> 00:41:50,556
Now you can watch.

404
00:41:55,758 --> 00:41:57,510
What's that, mommy?

405
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:10,556
What is that?

406
00:42:13,078 --> 00:42:17,993
Sit down. Listen to me. Sit down.

407
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:36,273
Help.

408
00:42:45,558 --> 00:42:47,753
I've talked with my dad.

409
00:42:47,918 --> 00:42:51,228
Was it good?
-Better than expected.

410
00:43:37,638 --> 00:43:40,198
Have you already found her?
-No.

411
00:43:40,358 --> 00:43:43,031
I found something.
-What then?

412
00:43:43,198 --> 00:43:47,988
Remember that Frida
with whom I chatted? My ex-girlfriend.

413
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:49,750
What about her?

414
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:53,314
It wasn't Frida.

415
00:43:58,278 --> 00:44:00,508
Saga, come on.

416
00:44:11,238 --> 00:44:15,197
I met her today.
We didn't chat at all.

417
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:19,067
When did she contact you?
-A week ago.

418
00:44:19,238 --> 00:44:24,153
It is Jens. You write here
we're looking for Anja. So he did.

419
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:25,990
Did it matter?

420
00:44:31,718 --> 00:44:33,071
Is there more?

421
00:44:33,238 --> 00:44:38,232
He doesn't know August is on to "Frida". 
We'll make contact with him.

422
00:44:38,398 --> 00:44:42,311
He hasn't answered.
I've written to him today.

423
00:44:42,478 --> 00:44:44,036
What is there today?

424
00:44:44,198 --> 00:44:48,191
I'd agreed with Frida,
rather the alleged Frida,

425
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:51,156
to meet in Fælledparken,
in about a half hour?

426
00:44:51,318 --> 00:44:56,153
Do you have a hoodie?
-Yes. Why? Do you think he'll come?

427
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,947
So far, he's fulfilled its promises.
-I'm going.

428
00:45:00,118 --> 00:45:03,076
I stay here with August
and monitor everything.

429
00:45:14,518 --> 00:45:16,110
I'm in position.

430
00:45:17,598 --> 00:45:22,547
Roger. Can I get your status
units 1 to 4?

431
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:28,028
Unit 1 is ready.
I see the object clearly.

432
00:45:28,198 --> 00:45:32,350
Unit two in place.
I see the object clearly.

433
00:45:32,518 --> 00:45:35,749
Unit three in position. I see the object.

434
00:45:35,918 --> 00:45:41,595
Unit four in position. I see the object.
-Roger. Standby.

435
00:46:30,798 --> 00:46:32,868
A man approaches the object.

436
00:46:39,238 --> 00:46:40,990
What's happening?

437
00:46:41,158 --> 00:46:44,468
A man with a dog
approaching the object.

438
00:46:45,758 --> 00:46:49,194
All units,
walk slowly toward the object.

439
00:47:06,678 --> 00:47:11,877
It isn't him. We'll restart the operation. 
Everyone to his old position.

440
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:42,073
I want to report
strange noises.

441
00:47:42,238 --> 00:47:46,436
It sounds like a woman
and children screaming.

442
00:47:47,958 --> 00:47:50,597
You write a lot about me.

443
00:47:51,718 --> 00:47:54,232
Maybe.
-MlLF?

444
00:47:57,718 --> 00:47:59,595
That was a joke.

445
00:48:01,158 --> 00:48:04,833
It means ...
-I know, but I have no children.

446
00:48:12,638 --> 00:48:15,630
Did it matter, you
 told me about Anja?

447
00:48:17,718 --> 00:48:21,472
He didn't know we were looking for her
until you mentioned it.

448
00:48:26,358 --> 00:48:29,236
So it's my fault she's dead?

449
00:48:29,398 --> 00:48:34,392
We didn't have to talk about her. 
That was unprofessional.

450
00:48:34,558 --> 00:48:37,948
I saw no harm in it.
I didn't know it was him.

451
00:48:38,118 --> 00:48:41,588
I know. He is smart and dangerous.

452
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:46,671
Will he murder Mette
and the children?

453
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:53,429
Give me an honest answer.

454
00:48:55,838 --> 00:48:59,274
Probably.
If he hasn't done so already.

455
00:49:31,478 --> 00:49:35,710
Still nothing. What do we do now?
-Just a minute.

456
00:49:35,878 --> 00:49:38,551
He was twenty minutes late, so ...

457
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:43,633
He's not coming. Abort.
He's not coming, damn.

458
00:49:43,798 --> 00:49:48,269
We'll abort the operation.
We'll meet in the office.

459
00:49:54,438 --> 00:49:59,558
The office called. Someone reported hearing 
a woman and children crying for help.

460
00:49:59,718 --> 00:50:01,948
Morten, you drive.

461
00:50:13,278 --> 00:50:15,155
Why does he do this?

462
00:50:15,318 --> 00:50:19,630
His wife and child died
in a car accident.

463
00:50:19,798 --> 00:50:24,747
He thinks mistakes were made in the 
investigation. Now he wants to avenge himself.

464
00:50:24,918 --> 00:50:29,753
So all this talk of his
about opening people's eyes ...

465
00:50:29,918 --> 00:50:31,988
was just talk?

466
00:50:35,998 --> 00:50:38,558
What mistake did my father make?

467
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:47,913
You must ask him.
-But you know?

468
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:50,034
Did he let him down?

469
00:50:52,598 --> 00:50:55,988
Like he did me
and my mother ...

470
00:50:56,158 --> 00:50:59,787
and my half sister and her mother,
and Mette.

471
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,674
He has done so.

472
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:22,031
Wait here.

473
00:51:33,998 --> 00:51:35,670
Martin, what 's happening?

474
00:51:45,118 --> 00:51:50,556
Lillian will take you outside.
There's a grenade. Get them out of here.

475
00:51:50,718 --> 00:51:54,233
I stay here with Mom.
Take the children away.

476
00:51:54,398 --> 00:51:56,309
I'll stay with mom.

477
00:52:02,038 --> 00:52:07,476
Help me.
-I'm with you. I'll take it now.

478
00:52:07,638 --> 00:52:14,510
I will help you. Come on honey, you've
so well done. Now we do it together.

479
00:52:16,238 --> 00:52:18,388
Martin, you can get.

480
00:52:25,038 --> 00:52:27,313
To the left. To the ruins.

481
00:52:36,798 --> 00:52:38,151
I'm with you.

482
00:52:40,398 --> 00:52:42,992
At three you release.

483
00:52:47,238 --> 00:52:51,356
Okay? On three. Raise your hand.

484
00:52:53,598 --> 00:52:59,434
In three open your hand
and let it go. Ready?

485
00:53:00,518 --> 00:53:04,033
One, two, three.

486
00:53:30,398 --> 00:53:31,797
Thank you. Good day.

487
00:53:33,958 --> 00:53:37,951
Johan couldn't continue
with that chat.

488
00:53:38,118 --> 00:53:42,350
Who is Johan?
-He is the specialist of my IT team.

489
00:53:42,518 --> 00:53:47,034
You'll always hear, huh?
When it starts going well ...

490
00:53:49,198 --> 00:53:53,908
Frida let me ...
Or the man I mistook for Frida ...

491
00:53:54,078 --> 00:53:57,548
He showed me a different side
of my father.

492
00:54:00,598 --> 00:54:02,793
Because of him, I talked to him.

493
00:54:08,198 --> 00:54:12,714
He said really good things
and then turns out to be a psychopath.

494
00:54:17,998 --> 00:54:20,637
Do you hear me?
-The park.

495
00:54:20,798 --> 00:54:22,595
Do you know anything?

496
00:54:22,758 --> 00:54:28,151
He had already lost Mikaela.
Why did he never see her again.

497
00:54:29,638 --> 00:54:33,267
And so he lost a son.
-Who?

498
00:54:33,438 --> 00:54:38,558
As Martin and you come closer 
together, it will hurt him even more.

499
00:54:38,718 --> 00:54:40,515
What are you talking about?

500
00:54:40,678 --> 00:54:44,193
He's not after Mette
and the children, he's after you.

501
00:54:50,638 --> 00:54:53,869
Saga Norén. Can you hear me? Over.

502
00:54:54,038 --> 00:54:57,553
What is it?
This is Saga-Norén. Can you hear me? Over.

503
00:54:57,718 --> 00:55:01,427
Why don't they answer?
-This is Saga. Can you hear me?

504
00:55:04,958 --> 00:55:06,516
What are you doing?

505
00:55:10,118 --> 00:55:11,676
He's here.

506
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:27,030
Don't you have a gun on you?
-No. Come on.

507
00:55:54,278 --> 00:55:56,189
Stay here.

508
00:56:08,918 --> 00:56:10,476
Turn around.

509
00:56:13,238 --> 00:56:14,876
Hands behind your back.

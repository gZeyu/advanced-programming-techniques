1
00:00:00,808 --> 00:00:03,276
previously...

2
00:00:05,808 --> 00:00:08,606
Working so late?
-I'll find you.

3
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:13,558
This is Jens. He was my colleague.
He committed suicide.

4
00:00:13,728 --> 00:00:17,960
His wife and child died
in a car accident.

5
00:00:18,128 --> 00:00:21,837
I read no fingerprints
or DNA were taken.

6
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:24,238
Saga thinks he's still alive.

7
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:30,165
His wife and son were killed. He thinks
mistakes were made in the investigation.

8
00:00:30,328 --> 00:00:35,721
So all this talk of his about opening
people's eyes doesn't mean anything?

9
00:00:35,888 --> 00:00:40,916
Sometimes you tell people what
they want to hear. Even if it isn't true.

10
00:00:41,088 --> 00:00:46,287
So sometimes people want you to lie to them?
-Yes, Saga, sometimes they want you to lie.

11
00:00:51,368 --> 00:00:54,519
Sebastian Sandstrod.
-Do you have children?

12
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:58,806
I've had one. One son.
I'm back on top come.

13
00:00:58,968 --> 00:01:00,321
Her name was Mikaela.

14
00:01:00,488 --> 00:01:04,163
Mikaela wanted a divorce.
She met another guy.

15
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:06,558
The other man was me.

16
00:01:06,728 --> 00:01:08,639
He knows it was you.

17
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,126
Help.

18
00:01:19,448 --> 00:01:24,568
I wouldn't lie to Hans. I haven't
told him about you and Mikaela.

19
00:01:24,728 --> 00:01:27,720
When was that?
-The day before yesterday. In the chat room.

20
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:29,765
We haven't chatted.

21
00:01:29,928 --> 00:01:33,318
The "Frida" who I chatted to,
wasn't Frida.

22
00:01:33,488 --> 00:01:37,117
Saga, come on.
-It is Jens.

23
00:01:37,288 --> 00:01:40,439
He's not after Mette and the children,
he's after you.

24
00:03:09,128 --> 00:03:12,359
Wait here.
-What is it?

25
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:20,486
Where are the guards?
-Perhaps inside.

26
00:03:20,648 --> 00:03:25,324
That wasn't the intention.
-Call them. You go inside.

27
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:45,118
Martin? Come here.

28
00:03:50,048 --> 00:03:52,278
The ambulance is on its way.

29
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,164
Don't talk.

30
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:01,923
He's got August.

31
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:08,966
Y E. ..
-Y, E.

32
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:14,203
Five, seven.
-Five, seven.

33
00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:16,677
Yes. Y, E, five, seven.

34
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:19,681
Dark blue.
-Dark blue.

35
00:04:19,848 --> 00:04:22,316
Y, E, five, seven. Dark blue.

36
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:31,286
All cars, we looking for his dark blue
car. The license plate starts with YE 57.

37
00:04:31,448 --> 00:04:34,406
I repeat: YE 57.

38
00:04:36,448 --> 00:04:42,000
What happened?
-He ... He's got August.

39
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:49,564
Where are we going?

40
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,883
What are you doing?
My son would've been seventeen now.

41
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:01,602
His name was Rasmus.

42
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:10,126
How old are you?
-I'll be twenty soon.

43
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,676
You could've been friends.

44
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:20,285
Just like your father and me.

45
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,963
Everything was different.

46
00:05:27,608 --> 00:05:29,599
What are you doing?

47
00:05:30,648 --> 00:05:32,206
With you?

48
00:05:44,048 --> 00:05:46,039
What has Martin done?

49
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:51,405
You call him that?

50
00:05:54,248 --> 00:05:55,806
Not 'Daddy'?

51
00:05:58,168 --> 00:06:00,045
Does it matter?

52
00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:09,848
Haven't you ever felt everything turned
out to be different than you thought?

53
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:13,364
That the people supposed to help you,
aren't there.

54
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:19,766
Authorities and agencies that are
supposed to protect you, don't.

55
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:22,486
That friends ...

56
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:27,637
people you consider
as friends, cheat you.

57
00:06:30,248 --> 00:06:32,716
It is a shocking experience.

58
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:36,205
A real revelation.

59
00:06:38,408 --> 00:06:40,160
What has he done?

60
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,359
Is he a good father?

61
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:48,960
He wants to be..

62
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:53,322
And is he ideal?

63
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,521
He knows he's not perfect ...

64
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:03,165
but he's as good as he can be.

65
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:13,884
That's a wise observation.
-What did he do?

66
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,281
Here we are.

67
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,438
Can you let me go?

68
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:55,359
I don't understand.

69
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:26,197
It looks okay. The bullet in your side
didn't hit any vital organs.

70
00:08:26,368 --> 00:08:30,520
And your blood levels
are almost back to normal.

71
00:08:30,688 --> 00:08:34,237
You were lucky.
Can you squeeze my fingers?

72
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:43,438
Can you squeeze harder?

73
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:54,916
The nerve and muscle damage
should be investigated further.

74
00:08:55,088 --> 00:08:56,726
I can't.

75
00:08:56,888 --> 00:08:59,686
What do you say?
-I need to work.

76
00:08:59,848 --> 00:09:04,922
You've lost a lot of blood.
-You said my levels were normal.

77
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:10,321
That they were almost normal.
Your body has had a big hit.

78
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:11,967
I feel good.

79
00:09:12,128 --> 00:09:17,919
Thanks to your adrenaline
and my painkillers. You stay right here.

80
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:37,079
Europol and Interpol were informed. His photo
is in the media. We'll do everything.

81
00:09:37,248 --> 00:09:39,603
Martin, are you listening to me?

82
00:09:39,768 --> 00:09:44,558
Yes. What about you and your team?
Anything found in the basement?

83
00:09:44,728 --> 00:09:48,437
No. Everything is now in Malmö.
They're working as fast as they can.

84
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:53,443
And the license plate?
-We're working on them. Excuse me.

85
00:09:56,328 --> 00:09:58,796
I gotta do something.
-What?

86
00:09:58,968 --> 00:10:04,998
No idea. I'm going crazy waiting.
-Your judgment wouldn't be objective.

87
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:11,926
You put me on the investigation. Or
I'll quit and find the bastard anyway.

88
00:10:12,088 --> 00:10:13,646
That was Saga.

89
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:20,164
How is she?
-Pretty good. She wants me to come.

90
00:10:35,488 --> 00:10:38,048
How are you?
-Good.

91
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:43,965
I have nerve and muscle damage in my arm,
but my vital organs are intact.

92
00:10:44,128 --> 00:10:46,403
But how are you?
-Good.

93
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:51,717
I've got clothes from Mette.

94
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:55,483
Nice. Can you help me with the stockings?

95
00:10:57,928 --> 00:11:01,967
Have the doctors actually said
you could in your condition?

96
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:06,804
They said you had to stay?
-Yes. How is the license plate?

97
00:11:06,968 --> 00:11:11,644
They are working on it. You better stay.
-He has August.

98
00:11:11,808 --> 00:11:17,599
Have you any idea where he can be?
-No, but he's still alive.

99
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:21,522
How do you know?
-He wants Martin to suffer as he suffers.

100
00:11:21,688 --> 00:11:24,282
That's why he doesn't kill August.

101
00:11:24,448 --> 00:11:29,124
Why should Martin suffer?
-Put the zipper closed.

102
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:34,965
You think he wants to kill August?
-In the end. Are you here with the car?

103
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:43,326
Why does he do this?

104
00:11:45,128 --> 00:11:49,804
You were friends.
Why is he doing this to us?

105
00:11:56,928 --> 00:12:00,887
Because I went to bed
with Mikaela.

106
00:12:04,008 --> 00:12:05,919
With his wife?

107
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:11,161
You slept with his wife?

108
00:12:12,728 --> 00:12:14,798
She wanted to leave him.

109
00:12:16,728 --> 00:12:18,764
They had a fight.

110
00:12:20,608 --> 00:12:23,964
She ran away. So she was on the bridge.

111
00:12:24,128 --> 00:12:30,681
When they are killed.
-After that, you practically lived with him.

112
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:35,763
He didn't know then.
He found out only much later ...

113
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:44,718
I'm so sorry, Mette.

114
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:56,682
I am so sorry for what you all
had to endure. I'm so sorry.

115
00:12:57,728 --> 00:13:00,561
Now it's just about August.

116
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:11,597
Are you okay?
-I've been given painkillers and blood.

117
00:13:11,768 --> 00:13:14,726
I feel some pain, but
otherwise I feel good.

118
00:13:14,888 --> 00:13:18,767
It could have ended much worse.
-Shall we go?

119
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,962
You're bleeding.
-I know.

120
00:13:53,488 --> 00:13:59,438
Everything's gone wrong and it's all my fault.
-Yes, you seem to think that.

121
00:14:01,368 --> 00:14:04,201
I think she'll leave me.
-Mette?

122
00:14:04,368 --> 00:14:08,998
You should have seen her when I
told her about Mikaela and me.

123
00:14:09,168 --> 00:14:12,319
You hadn't already.
-I haven't.

124
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:18,604
She sees sides of me
she didn't know.

125
00:14:18,768 --> 00:14:21,601
Why did you tell her?
-I had to.

126
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:26,558
He locked her and the children in the house
in with a grenade. She had to know why.

127
00:14:26,728 --> 00:14:28,366
I've been thinking.

128
00:14:30,848 --> 00:14:35,319
I imagine that Jens
decided to do everything ...

129
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:38,207
when he read the notebooks.

130
00:14:38,368 --> 00:14:43,158
You don't know.
-Even I had abandoned him.

131
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:52,679
Can you check on this? That too
isn't connected to this.

132
00:14:56,328 --> 00:15:00,241
Hey, how are you?
-Good. How are you?

133
00:15:00,408 --> 00:15:04,242
I'm okay, but there's a lot.

134
00:15:04,408 --> 00:15:10,005
What have you found so far?
-The link isn't always clear.

135
00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:16,926
All this is related to the bridge,
the outage and the women.

136
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:20,797
There are the homeless,
The cards and poison ...

137
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:24,438
the schizophrenics,
Here is the gang in Nørrebro ...

138
00:15:24,608 --> 00:15:29,523
the bus companies and
companies who used child labour.

139
00:15:29,688 --> 00:15:34,808
The things here we haven't
linked to the five problems.

140
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:37,357
It's all over the map ...

141
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:42,727
as well as print-outs, schedules,
pictures, formulas, drawings ...

142
00:15:42,888 --> 00:15:47,006
We don't know whether all this
is related to anything.

143
00:15:47,168 --> 00:15:52,401
He has something planned for August,
So among all this, we should find something.

144
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:57,164
There are 103 cars that begin
with YE 57 and are dark blue.

145
00:15:57,328 --> 00:16:00,843
82 are registered
in Jutland and Fynen.

146
00:16:01,008 --> 00:16:06,480
None are reported stolen. Then there are
21 on Zealand and 15 in Copenhagen.

147
00:16:06,648 --> 00:16:11,597
And none reported as stolen?
-We'll start in Copenhagen.

148
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:18,685
Wait a minute. I have to check.
Anne, that parking ticket?

149
00:16:18,848 --> 00:16:25,083
Here. This is a parking ticket on the day
before everything began on the bridge.

150
00:16:26,408 --> 00:16:27,966
Let's see.

151
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:35,397
There. Margrethe Helstad.
Bakkegårds Allée, Copenhagen.

152
00:16:35,568 --> 00:16:37,126
I know where that is.

153
00:16:42,688 --> 00:16:45,407
Yes. He was here
a few weeks ago.

154
00:16:45,568 --> 00:16:49,447
To Margrethe Helstad?
-He comes several times a year.

155
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:50,961
Why?

156
00:16:51,128 --> 00:16:56,248
To visit her.
I think he's her cousin.

157
00:16:56,408 --> 00:17:00,560
I know it's early,
but we have to talk to her.

158
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:04,198
Of course. She doesn't sleep much.

159
00:17:07,008 --> 00:17:10,398
Good morning Margrethe,
You have a visitor.

160
00:17:10,568 --> 00:17:12,877
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.

161
00:17:15,048 --> 00:17:19,041
They are the police.
They want to ask you something.

162
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,483
Do you know this man?

163
00:17:23,768 --> 00:17:28,205
He's here sometimes. He comes to visit.

164
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:31,963
We know,
but why is he here?

165
00:17:40,048 --> 00:17:42,243
He's my father.

166
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:47,561
No, he's not.
-Who are you?

167
00:17:49,248 --> 00:17:53,480
It's a home
for the demented elderly?

168
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:56,560
Is there anyone else
who knows anything about her?

169
00:17:56,728 --> 00:18:00,323
I'm sorry, but I don't think so.

170
00:18:05,248 --> 00:18:10,800
I think Jens plans a special vengeance.
How exactly did his son die?

171
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:15,564
He died in the collision
on the bridge and then drowned.

172
00:18:18,368 --> 00:18:22,043
With Saga. It's the car.
Trace it.

173
00:18:23,128 --> 00:18:25,562
We need to trace that car.

174
00:18:40,528 --> 00:18:42,883
Okay. Saga, we're going.

175
00:18:46,968 --> 00:18:49,163
We go straight along the road.

176
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:54,197
They found the car.
Beside Bispebjerg Cemetery.

177
00:19:00,048 --> 00:19:03,358
Mikaela is buried here.
-And the son?

178
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:07,521
He was never found.
-But he was declared dead?

179
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,680
Did you find anything?
-No.

180
00:19:10,848 --> 00:19:13,316
WAs the trunk checked?
-Not yet.

181
00:19:25,008 --> 00:19:26,964
Martin, Saga, come HERE.

182
00:19:36,328 --> 00:19:37,841
Lillian, yes.

183
00:19:38,008 --> 00:19:41,125
What is this?
-There is a gravedigger.

184
00:19:52,848 --> 00:19:54,839
Nothing there.

185
00:19:55,008 --> 00:19:58,000
Someone tried to get into Sandstrod's home .
-Who?

186
00:19:58,168 --> 00:20:00,762
We don't know, but he was arrested.

187
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,960
Here I am again.

188
00:20:05,128 --> 00:20:08,279
There is no point in going.

189
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:12,361
He knows we know his new name
and follow every clue.

190
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:16,806
We can ask that person.
-He can't help us.

191
00:20:16,968 --> 00:20:21,564
He makes us run from pillar to post,
so he can work peacefully.

192
00:20:21,728 --> 00:20:23,286
What do we do?

193
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:29,836
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.
That's his mother, Margrethe.

194
00:20:30,008 --> 00:20:34,126
Say that again.
-Margrethe is his mother.

195
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:37,200
Of whom?
Of Jens. Or Sebastian.

196
00:20:37,368 --> 00:20:38,926
His parents are dead.

197
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:44,924
His adoptive parents. ln 1991, he reestablished
contact via the adoption agency.

198
00:20:45,088 --> 00:20:49,081
Where did they used to?
-Engmosevej 22 .

199
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,638
Who's the owner there now?
-Hold on.

200
00:20:52,808 --> 00:20:56,517
They are still there.
But I think nobody lives there.

201
00:22:31,688 --> 00:22:33,440
What are you doing?

202
00:22:34,848 --> 00:22:37,806
Suppose we find nothing.

203
00:22:37,968 --> 00:22:41,802
Then we'll continue the search. Come.
-But where to?

204
00:22:43,848 --> 00:22:47,636
I haven't talked to him in years
and then he came to me.

205
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:53,838
You know I left him when he was little?
We wanted to do something together.

206
00:22:54,008 --> 00:22:59,082
Just him and me. I never thought
that it would turn out like this.

207
00:22:59,248 --> 00:23:01,842
Jens thought of that.
-I know.

208
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,238
And now I'm close to loosing him.

209
00:23:08,048 --> 00:23:12,280
You can't say now
we won't find him.

210
00:23:12,448 --> 00:23:15,042
What should I do if he isn't there?

211
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:26,038
Where are you?
-We're checking out some information.

212
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:29,166
Are you alone?
-No, Saga is with me.

213
00:23:29,328 --> 00:23:33,480
I want him to be tried.
I want him dead.

214
00:23:33,648 --> 00:23:38,768
Have you checked on the man at the house?
-Did you hear me? You're a policeman.

215
00:23:38,928 --> 00:23:42,238
If you can't handle this,
you must withdraw.

216
00:23:42,408 --> 00:23:44,524
I can handle it.

217
00:23:44,688 --> 00:23:50,206
If you think you've found something, then call
in and wait for reinforcements, okay?

218
00:23:50,368 --> 00:23:55,237
Jens gave the man 500 DKK
to go to his home.

219
00:23:58,168 --> 00:24:01,399
I'll call you back when we know something.
-Do that.

220
00:24:02,768 --> 00:24:04,963
It looks empty.

221
00:24:05,128 --> 00:24:07,562
Take this.
-I can't.

222
00:24:07,728 --> 00:24:09,286
I'll say nothing.

223
00:24:11,168 --> 00:24:14,683
And if I have to shoot?
-Then we'll invent something.

224
00:24:18,928 --> 00:24:20,839
Do it for me.

225
00:25:09,368 --> 00:25:11,962
Police. Is there anybody home?

226
00:25:51,448 --> 00:25:53,040
Monique Brammer.

227
00:26:03,608 --> 00:26:05,166
It's me.

228
00:26:06,768 --> 00:26:08,406
Jens, damn ...

229
00:26:11,248 --> 00:26:15,161
That was long ago.
It's good you went, I understand.

230
00:26:15,328 --> 00:26:20,561
You should let August go, do you hear me? 
You have to punish me.

231
00:26:20,728 --> 00:26:24,607
I'm still to do that?
-I'd like to talk to August.

232
00:26:24,768 --> 00:26:27,282
You can't.
-Why not?

233
00:26:27,448 --> 00:26:30,246
He isn't here.
-What have you done?

234
00:26:31,848 --> 00:26:33,406
He's alive.

235
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,647
I believe we must meet.

236
00:26:38,808 --> 00:26:41,766
Why?
-Because you're right.

237
00:26:44,128 --> 00:26:46,039
I'm mad at you.

238
00:26:47,688 --> 00:26:52,716
I only kidnapped August to get
you to speak to me. Alone.

239
00:26:54,288 --> 00:26:56,927
Where?
-Where are you now?

240
00:26:58,008 --> 00:27:00,727
Engmosevej 22.

241
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,642
Hello, are you still there?

242
00:27:09,568 --> 00:27:14,801
I'm impressed. Monique
Brammer is in the freezer in the garage.

243
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:18,358
We found her, yes.
-You aren't alone?

244
00:27:18,528 --> 00:27:24,683
Saga is with me.
-Oh yeah? How is she?

245
00:27:24,848 --> 00:27:28,887
Where will we meet?
-I'll call you back in about one minute.

246
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:32,757
Get in your car,
I'll give you directions.

247
00:27:32,928 --> 00:27:35,362
And perhaps for the sake ...

248
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:40,522
to avoid any misunderstandings:
you really should just come alone.

249
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:44,600
One minute.

250
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,766
You don't want to go?

251
00:27:47,928 --> 00:27:52,763
There is no reason to believe
he'll let August go.

252
00:27:52,928 --> 00:27:58,241
His son is dead. He wants to punish you.
He wants to kill August, whatever you do.

253
00:27:58,408 --> 00:28:00,797
I gotta believe I have a chance.

254
00:28:00,968 --> 00:28:04,756
Call in and tell Lillian
we've found Monique.

255
00:28:04,928 --> 00:28:08,762
And don't say anything about my 
conversation with Jens. It's important.

256
00:28:08,928 --> 00:28:14,161
You must promise you won't say anything
about my conversation with Jens.

257
00:28:14,328 --> 00:28:19,083
Someone called me and then I left.
You don't know who called me.

258
00:28:19,248 --> 00:28:21,808
I know.
-It's important.

259
00:28:21,968 --> 00:28:25,756
Promise me you'll say nothing, okay?

260
00:28:30,888 --> 00:28:34,039
He's killed everyone
who let him down.

261
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:36,766
I'm going now.

262
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:40,004
I'm on my way to the car.

263
00:28:51,248 --> 00:28:55,400
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.
I want to speak to Lillian.

264
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:59,678
Where are you?
-On Jagtvej in the direction of Nørrebro.

265
00:28:59,848 --> 00:29:06,117
Go to the roundabout at Skt. Kjeld Plads.
Don't hang up, I want to keep listening to you.

266
00:30:16,008 --> 00:30:18,841
Have you thought about me ...

267
00:30:20,128 --> 00:30:22,039
since my suicide?

268
00:30:23,768 --> 00:30:28,478
I haven't thought about you, no.
-I think about you.

269
00:30:30,888 --> 00:30:36,201
What went through your head
when you went to bed with my wife?

270
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:40,247
What was your intention?
-I had no intention to do it.

271
00:30:40,408 --> 00:30:43,081
Did you think I'd congratulate you?

272
00:30:44,128 --> 00:30:47,564
My wife and my best friend.

273
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:51,885
Did you think I'd be happy for you?

274
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:57,446
No, I didn't.
-Was it easy?

275
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,364
To get her into bed?

276
00:31:03,768 --> 00:31:08,284
Does it go well between you and Mette?
-Why do you ask?

277
00:31:08,448 --> 00:31:12,999
She was very open ...

278
00:31:13,168 --> 00:31:16,205
and responsive, in the last few days.

279
00:31:16,368 --> 00:31:21,283
If things were going well between you, she 
probably wouldn't have gone to bed with me.

280
00:31:32,488 --> 00:31:36,561
I'm at the roundabout.
-Take Bryggervang.

281
00:31:38,368 --> 00:31:41,246
Can you see me?
-Maybe.

282
00:31:48,368 --> 00:31:50,359
Park the car on the side.

283
00:31:54,328 --> 00:31:59,277
Across the street is a Toyota.
The key is on the left front tire.

284
00:31:59,448 --> 00:32:03,646
Leave your mobile behind,
There is a new one in the Toyota.

285
00:32:18,088 --> 00:32:20,761
So you don't know where Martin is?
-No.

286
00:32:20,928 --> 00:32:24,557
What about the material
from the basement?

287
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:28,927
It's Lillian. Saga Norén, here.

288
00:32:29,088 --> 00:32:32,558
May I talk to Martin? He doesn't answer.
-He isn't here.

289
00:32:32,728 --> 00:32:36,562
Where is he?
-I don't know. He left.

290
00:32:36,728 --> 00:32:39,845
Where did he go?
-No idea.

291
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:46,402
He received a phone call and then
he left. I don't know where he is.

292
00:32:46,568 --> 00:32:49,366
If anything happens, it's your fault.

293
00:32:50,448 --> 00:32:54,885
You can't lie very well.
-I can always do better?

294
00:32:55,048 --> 00:32:56,686
Yes.

295
00:33:01,728 --> 00:33:03,207
How are you?

296
00:33:03,368 --> 00:33:07,122
Where is Martin?
-There isn't here. How are you?

297
00:33:07,288 --> 00:33:13,841
There is still a lot we can't associated
to bring his 'problems'.

298
00:33:14,008 --> 00:33:17,523
Then we need more context.

299
00:33:17,688 --> 00:33:23,445
He has August.
Jens' son died.

300
00:33:23,608 --> 00:33:28,124
Think out loud. Say what comes into your mind.
-His son drowned.

301
00:33:28,288 --> 00:33:31,121
Or was already dead.
-He fell into the water.

302
00:33:31,288 --> 00:33:35,247
Nothing here is related to water.
-He was never found.

303
00:33:35,408 --> 00:33:37,399
Does this help us?
-But how?

304
00:33:38,968 --> 00:33:43,325
The first event was the accident
on the bridge on April 13.

305
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:46,639
Is there anything 
related to April 13?

306
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:52,724
I checked but found nothing.
Wrong date, wrong month.

307
00:33:52,888 --> 00:33:55,402
Saga, you're bleeding. With Johan.

308
00:33:55,568 --> 00:33:58,605
The trial. Of Henning.

309
00:33:58,768 --> 00:34:02,886
He had no influence,
So he had to plan around it.

310
00:34:03,888 --> 00:34:09,201
The encounter with August in the park.
That was scheduled for a specific time.

311
00:34:09,368 --> 00:34:14,488
Is there anything related to today? 
With today? With something recent?

312
00:34:14,648 --> 00:34:17,685
No, nothing.

313
00:34:19,048 --> 00:34:24,247
What are we overlooking?
-Maybe it's nothing about August.

314
00:34:24,408 --> 00:34:28,959
It's here. It must be.
Continue to search.

315
00:36:37,808 --> 00:36:42,404
I know where he is.
I know where August is. Come on.

316
00:36:56,968 --> 00:36:59,528
Have you been inside?
-Yes.

317
00:36:59,688 --> 00:37:01,918
You haven't checked well.

318
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:06,444
One more time.

319
00:37:15,768 --> 00:37:18,680
Tell me about your colleague, 
Saga Norén.    -No

320
00:37:25,088 --> 00:37:28,683
Why not?
-Because I don't want to.

321
00:37:28,848 --> 00:37:35,162
I am so tired of this. I want no more,
Do you understand? You're sick.

322
00:37:35,328 --> 00:37:37,319
You're awfully sick.

323
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:42,325
Where are you now?
-What do you want?

324
00:37:43,768 --> 00:37:47,363
Go to the Central Station
and go inside.

325
00:38:09,048 --> 00:38:12,438
We couldn't find anything.
-We looked everywhere.

326
00:38:12,608 --> 00:38:16,840
Then we'll look through everything 
again. He must be here.

327
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:24,163
He isn't here. You're mistaken.
Don't you really know where Martin is?

328
00:38:25,408 --> 00:38:28,400
Did he meet with Jens?

329
00:38:28,568 --> 00:38:32,880
Saga, did he meet Jens?
-I think so.

330
00:38:45,328 --> 00:38:47,717
Now what?
-Go to platform two.

331
00:38:47,888 --> 00:38:51,085
There is the Øresundtrein.
Get on it.

332
00:39:19,408 --> 00:39:23,959
Now what? Do I have to go to Sweden?
Are you holding August in Sweden?

333
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,517
Mikaela was on her way to Sweden.

334
00:39:28,848 --> 00:39:33,319
On the bridge. Are you going to throw 
him from the bridge, you sick bastard?

335
00:39:33,488 --> 00:39:35,843
Can you hear me?
-Yes.

336
00:39:36,008 --> 00:39:37,566
Sit down.

337
00:39:44,568 --> 00:39:46,320
Well done, Martin.

338
00:39:48,608 --> 00:39:50,917
Relax and enjoy the ride.

339
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:27,243
I found it.
There's a false wall.

340
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:54,040
We went
to the dedication of the bridge.

341
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:56,722
Mikaela ...

342
00:41:58,168 --> 00:41:59,760
Rasmus and I.

343
00:42:01,128 --> 00:42:02,766
Were you there?

344
00:42:08,168 --> 00:42:10,443
We can keep quiet,
if you want.

345
00:42:11,648 --> 00:42:18,679
Why? I need to know why.
Was it because they chose me?

346
00:42:19,808 --> 00:42:26,247
ls it all because they chose me?
-In some ways perhaps.

347
00:42:30,168 --> 00:42:33,877
Did you kill all those people
because your wife left you?

348
00:42:34,048 --> 00:42:40,681
Because my wife left me, I lost 
my son, my job and my friends.

349
00:42:40,848 --> 00:42:42,327
How much do you need?

350
00:42:42,488 --> 00:42:47,881
Other people experience loss,
and don't go killing.

351
00:42:51,048 --> 00:42:56,725
I have contemplated suicide.
I stood with the gun in my mouth.

352
00:42:58,448 --> 00:43:00,359
But it wasn't my fault.

353
00:43:01,408 --> 00:43:07,040
Nothing was my fault.
So I decided to hit back.

354
00:43:17,248 --> 00:43:19,318
Is August dead?

355
00:43:21,728 --> 00:43:24,117
You get one chance to save him.

356
00:43:26,008 --> 00:43:29,796
That's more than I received.
Stay sitting.

357
00:43:34,808 --> 00:43:37,038
Good. There too.

358
00:43:39,048 --> 00:43:40,481
Damn it.

359
00:43:51,008 --> 00:43:54,205
No sound. Everyone stay sitting.

360
00:43:56,048 --> 00:43:58,881
We'll get out here. She comes too.

361
00:44:04,368 --> 00:44:07,087
She's not coming.
-You take her.

362
00:44:09,008 --> 00:44:11,886
I am Martin Rohde
of the Danish police.

363
00:44:12,048 --> 00:44:15,836
I want to ask you to sit
and you come along.

364
00:44:20,368 --> 00:44:23,201
Everyone stay. Quiet and calm.

365
00:45:15,608 --> 00:45:17,564
Handcuff her.

366
00:45:20,248 --> 00:45:21,886
She isn't going anywhere.

367
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:24,600
Do it.

368
00:45:52,048 --> 00:45:53,606
What's this?

369
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,442
Saga Norén, here.
-He's broadcasting again.

370
00:46:03,608 --> 00:46:06,520
Who?
-He, from the bridge.

371
00:46:06,688 --> 00:46:09,760
On sanningnu.se.
Martin is there too.

372
00:46:10,888 --> 00:46:14,642
He must know
we've found August .

373
00:46:14,808 --> 00:46:18,483
He has to know. Call Martin.

374
00:46:41,328 --> 00:46:42,841
Draw your gun.

375
00:46:43,688 --> 00:46:47,283
Where is August?
-It'll cost you to save your son.

376
00:46:47,448 --> 00:46:51,123
Your gun. You don't have much time.

377
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:00,687
I want you to shoot her.

378
00:47:00,848 --> 00:47:02,600
I won't.

379
00:47:03,848 --> 00:47:05,964
Lillian.
Martin's on the bridge.

380
00:47:06,128 --> 00:47:08,767
Yes. We're heading to Peberholm.

381
00:47:08,928 --> 00:47:14,480
The bridge is closed. We'll detemine
what we can do. Where are you?

382
00:47:16,488 --> 00:47:22,643
The clock is ticking. The chance, August
will survive, isn't increasing.

383
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:28,965
I won't shot her.
-You don't have to murder her.

384
00:47:33,128 --> 00:47:37,838
You'll be dismissed. Maybe you
be in prison for a few months.

385
00:47:38,008 --> 00:47:40,761
Infliction of injury. Abuse.

386
00:47:40,928 --> 00:47:45,444
Maybe they'll conduct a
trial. It'll cost you something.

387
00:47:45,608 --> 00:47:47,644
But you have to, to save August.

388
00:47:50,928 --> 00:47:53,726
I promise, I'll tell you where he is.

389
00:47:53,888 --> 00:47:58,040
You can find out from me 
what you want and what I've done ...

390
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:01,006
but I've always kept my word.

391
00:48:01,168 --> 00:48:04,365
I told you where Mette 
and the children were.

392
00:48:05,688 --> 00:48:07,724
You can still save him.

393
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:10,759
Isn't it worth it?

394
00:48:12,888 --> 00:48:17,723
Please. Don't shoot, please.

395
00:48:17,888 --> 00:48:20,482
Don't do it, please.

396
00:48:27,528 --> 00:48:31,999
Unfortunately, I have to do.
-Please. Don't shoot.

397
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:44,318
Martin shot the hostage.
-We have to go there.

398
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:49,243
Three people are on the working platform,
the train isn't empty ...

399
00:48:49,408 --> 00:48:52,047
No one can go there. Sorry.

400
00:49:06,368 --> 00:49:09,678
I have to go.
-The bridge is closed.

401
00:49:09,848 --> 00:49:12,601
Order it, otherwise you'll lose Martin.

402
00:49:16,088 --> 00:49:18,318
Did you find August ?

403
00:49:27,848 --> 00:49:30,681
She's in shock.
-I see.

404
00:49:33,648 --> 00:49:39,200
You've done exactly what I asked.
Every time.

405
00:49:40,968 --> 00:49:43,118
You deserve to know ...

406
00:49:44,408 --> 00:49:46,046
I lied.

407
00:50:06,968 --> 00:50:10,438
Where is he? Where is August?

408
00:50:12,408 --> 00:50:14,285
He's gone.

409
00:50:19,768 --> 00:50:23,681
What's he doing?
-He put down the detonator.

410
00:50:24,768 --> 00:50:29,364
You'll never know if he suffered ...

411
00:50:29,528 --> 00:50:35,524
if he was afraid, if he cried,
or had a long and painful death.

412
00:50:36,728 --> 00:50:41,722
You will never have a body to
bury, a grave to visit ...

413
00:50:41,888 --> 00:50:47,167
Shut up.
-You 'll always live in uncertainty.

414
00:50:47,328 --> 00:50:50,798
Shut up. Shut up.

415
00:50:52,488 --> 00:50:55,480
A group, ready to pick them up.

416
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:07,165
Martin, don't.

417
00:51:15,288 --> 00:51:19,122
We've found August.
-That isn't true.

418
00:51:19,288 --> 00:51:24,726
We found him in the garage,
at Engmosevej. Behind the wall.

419
00:51:24,888 --> 00:51:27,960
No, he's not dead. She's lying.

420
00:51:28,128 --> 00:51:32,644
Remember when he called?
When he heard we were there?

421
00:51:32,808 --> 00:51:37,484
He went silent and then he told
us Monique Brammer was there.

422
00:51:37,648 --> 00:51:43,564
So we wouldn't look any further.
-He isn't there. She's lying.

423
00:51:43,728 --> 00:51:48,677
He died somewhere else.
Slowly and painfully.

424
00:51:48,848 --> 00:51:53,603
He's unarmed, this is being
broadcast. Everybody's watching this.

425
00:51:57,528 --> 00:52:02,397
Whatever he did,
You can't shoot him.

426
00:52:02,568 --> 00:52:06,356
If she found him,
why isn't he here?

427
00:52:06,528 --> 00:52:09,998
I was in a hurry
and he had to go to the hospital.

428
00:52:11,768 --> 00:52:15,124
Call him.
Martin wants to talk to him.

429
00:52:15,288 --> 00:52:19,998
You have his mobile.
-He's with people you can call.

430
00:52:23,408 --> 00:52:28,607
He's not there.
You can't talk to him.

431
00:52:28,768 --> 00:52:31,885
Do you really think she's 
telling you the truth?

432
00:52:36,888 --> 00:52:39,846
I found him.
-Are you lying?

433
00:52:41,088 --> 00:52:45,001
Are you saying what I want to hear?
-We've found him.

434
00:52:45,168 --> 00:52:49,161
Maybe they found him,
but he still alive?

435
00:52:49,328 --> 00:52:50,886
Yes.

436
00:52:52,408 --> 00:52:54,126
Is he alive?

437
00:52:57,128 --> 00:52:59,244
August is still alive?

438
00:53:01,368 --> 00:53:04,963
Can you say to me
August is still alive?

439
00:53:06,328 --> 00:53:12,358
August is really still alive? Can you all
honestly say August is still alive?

440
00:54:12,688 --> 00:54:14,758
Can I come in?

441
00:54:17,968 --> 00:54:19,686
I'll wait outside.

442
00:54:29,968 --> 00:54:31,606
How are you?

443
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:37,041
I should never have 
given you that gun.

444
00:54:39,008 --> 00:54:40,760
Are you serious?

445
00:54:43,328 --> 00:54:45,364
He deserved to die.

446
00:54:46,688 --> 00:54:48,883
He would have won.

447
00:54:49,048 --> 00:54:53,485
You'd be fired from the police,
and end up in jail.

448
00:54:54,528 --> 00:54:57,042
I probably wanted to do it.

449
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:16,841
I don't know what to say.
-You don't have to say anything. It's okay.

450
00:55:19,728 --> 00:55:22,242
I'm sorry I was late.

451
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:26,558
You did everything you could.

452
00:55:26,728 --> 00:55:29,959
It wasn't enough.
I let you down.

453
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:38,802
When is the funeral?

454
00:55:41,448 --> 00:55:43,678
That hasn't been finalized.

455
00:55:47,528 --> 00:55:51,521
Call me when you know.
-I will.

456
00:55:53,168 --> 00:55:57,161
It was nice working with you.
-I liked that too.

457
00:56:38,008 --> 00:56:41,717
Anton here.
-Saga Norén, Malmö CID.

458
00:56:41,888 --> 00:56:46,120
Hey, Saga. How are you?
-Good.

459
00:56:46,288 --> 00:56:50,361
The dinner you 
wanted to treat me to. How about now.

460
00:56:50,528 --> 00:56:54,282
Now?
-Yes, now. I've got time.

461
00:56:54,448 --> 00:56:55,961
Where'll we meet?

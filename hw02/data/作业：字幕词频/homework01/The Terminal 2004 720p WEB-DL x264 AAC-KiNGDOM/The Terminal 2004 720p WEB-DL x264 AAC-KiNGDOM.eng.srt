1
00:00:41,743 --> 00:00:46,873
United Airlines announcing
the arrival of Flight 9435 from Beijing.

2
00:00:46,915 --> 00:00:50,043
Customer service representative,
report to Gate C42.

3
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:05,225
All visitors to the US should
line up at booths one through 15.

4
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:10,272
Please have your I-94 forms filled out.

5
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:14,234
- What's the purpose of your visit?
- What is the purpose of your visit?

6
00:01:14,317 --> 00:01:17,445
What is the purpose of your visit?
Business or pleasure?

7
00:01:17,487 --> 00:01:19,030
Just visiting. Shopping?

8
00:01:19,114 --> 00:01:20,073
Au plaisir.

9
00:01:20,156 --> 00:01:22,242
- Pleasure.
- Business.

10
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:24,119
How long will you be staying?

11
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:27,289
Could I see your return ticket?

12
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,917
- What's the purpose of your visit?
- Business or pleasure?

13
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:33,962
Enjoy your stay. Next.

14
00:01:34,045 --> 00:01:37,757
Please have your passports,
immigration forms, I-94,

15
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:41,553
and customs declarations
ready to hand to the inspector.

16
00:01:44,931 --> 00:01:47,601
- Stand by. He's fishing.
- Copy that.

17
00:01:47,684 --> 00:01:50,604
See this bunch
of Mickey Mouse sweatshirts?

18
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:53,565
That's the tour from China,
connecting to Orlando.

19
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:56,359
When was the last time
you saw Chinese tourists

20
00:01:56,443 --> 00:02:00,113
on their way to Disney World
without any cameras?

21
00:02:00,196 --> 00:02:03,116
Possible forged documents
on 1 0 and 1 1.

22
00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:14,336
Sir. Sir. Passport.

23
00:02:16,713 --> 00:02:18,048
Thank you.

24
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:22,510
Welcome, Mr. Navorski.

25
00:02:22,552 --> 00:02:24,554
Purpose of your visit?

26
00:02:24,638 --> 00:02:28,683
Business or pleasure?

27
00:02:43,198 --> 00:02:44,991
Sir, I have an IBIS hit on six.

28
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:46,493
No!

29
00:02:46,576 --> 00:02:50,038
Mr. Navorski, please follow me.

30
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,917
...flight number 746 from Montreal

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,712
must proceed to US Immigration
before claiming their luggage.

32
00:02:57,754 --> 00:03:02,050
All right, Mr. Navorski,
we'd like you to wait here, please.

33
00:03:02,092 --> 00:03:03,468
Next, please.

34
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,095
Next, please.

35
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:23,863
What are you doing
in the United States, Mr. Navorski?

36
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:31,955
Yellow taxicab, please.

37
00:03:31,997 --> 00:03:35,375
Take me to Ramada Inn,

38
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:39,087
1 61 Lexington.

39
00:03:43,008 --> 00:03:45,302
Staying at the Ramada Inn?

40
00:03:45,343 --> 00:03:47,846
Keep the change.

41
00:03:47,888 --> 00:03:51,349
Do you know anyone in New York?

42
00:03:51,391 --> 00:03:52,893
Yes.

43
00:03:53,018 --> 00:03:55,812
- Who?
- Yes.

44
00:03:56,813 --> 00:04:00,692
- Who?
- Yes.

45
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:04,070
- No, do you know anyone in New York?
- Yes.

46
00:04:04,154 --> 00:04:06,114
- Who?
- Yes.

47
00:04:11,494 --> 00:04:13,872
1 61 Lexington.

48
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:17,584
OK, Mr. Navorski, I need to see
your return ticket, please.

49
00:04:18,877 --> 00:04:21,504
No, your return ticket. Your...

50
00:04:21,588 --> 00:04:23,840
- Oh... Yes.
- Ah.

51
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,221
This is just a standard procedure.

52
00:04:30,597 --> 00:04:33,600
I'm going to need the passport also.

53
00:04:33,725 --> 00:04:35,644
Oh... OK.

54
00:04:35,727 --> 00:04:37,354
- No, no.
- Thank you.

55
00:04:37,395 --> 00:04:39,022
Mr. Navorski.

56
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:43,193
That. Passport.

57
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:48,031
That.

58
00:04:53,828 --> 00:04:56,081
Mr. Navorski?
Sorry to keep you waiting.

59
00:04:56,164 --> 00:05:01,586
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs
and Border Protection here at JFK.

60
00:05:01,628 --> 00:05:04,506
I help people
with their immigration problems.

61
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:07,342
We're looking for
an interpreter for you.

62
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:11,346
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?

63
00:05:11,429 --> 00:05:14,432
But I understand
that you speak a little English.

64
00:05:14,516 --> 00:05:17,269
- Yes.
- You do?

65
00:05:17,352 --> 00:05:20,772
I hope you don't mind if I eat
while we talk. I've a bit of bad news.

66
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:23,900
Your country has suspended
all traveling privileges

67
00:05:23,984 --> 00:05:26,695
on passports issued
by your government.

68
00:05:26,778 --> 00:05:29,781
And our State Department
has revoked the visa

69
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:32,367
that was going to allow you
to enter the US.

70
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,245
That's it in a nutshell, basically.

71
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:39,791
While you were in the air there
was a military coup in your country.

72
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,961
Most of the dead were members
of the Presidential Guard.

73
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:45,630
They were attacked
in the middle of the night.

74
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:48,008
They got it all on GHN, I think.

75
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:51,636
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.

76
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,640
Mr. Navorski, your country
was annexed from the inside.

77
00:05:55,682 --> 00:05:58,310
The Republic of Krakozhia
is under new leadership.

78
00:05:58,393 --> 00:06:01,354
Krakozhia. Krakozhia

79
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:08,778
- Krakozhia.
- Right. I don't think he gets it.

80
00:06:08,862 --> 00:06:12,157
Er... Let me... OK. Look.

81
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,659
Imagine that these potato chips
are Krakozhia.

82
00:06:14,743 --> 00:06:17,162
Kra-kozhia.

83
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:18,788
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.

84
00:06:18,872 --> 00:06:20,832
- Krakozhia.
- OK.

85
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:24,920
Er... So the potato chips are Krakozhia.

86
00:06:25,003 --> 00:06:28,673
- And this apple...
- Big Apple. Big Apple.

87
00:06:28,757 --> 00:06:31,551
...Big Apple represents
the Liberty Rebels.

88
00:06:32,385 --> 00:06:34,346
OK?

89
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,516
No more Krakozhia! OK?

90
00:06:38,558 --> 00:06:43,355
New government.
Revolution. You understand?

91
00:06:43,438 --> 00:06:46,775
All the flights in and out
of your country have been suspended.

92
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:50,987
The new government has sealed all
borders, so your visa's no longer valid.

93
00:06:51,071 --> 00:06:54,699
So, currently
you are a citizen of nowhere.

94
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:56,785
Now, we can't process you new papers

95
00:06:56,868 --> 00:07:02,791
until the US recognizes your country's
new diplomatic reclassification.

96
00:07:02,874 --> 00:07:05,544
You don't qualify for asylum,
refugee status,

97
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:08,505
temporary protective status,
humanitarian parole,

98
00:07:08,588 --> 00:07:12,676
or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.

99
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,761
You are at this time simply...

100
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,725
...unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

101
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,228
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

102
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:30,151
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge,
Empire State, Broadway show Cats.

103
00:07:30,235 --> 00:07:33,488
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.

104
00:07:33,572 --> 00:07:35,448
OK. OK.

105
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,577
Now I go New York City. Thank you.

106
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,831
No, Mr. Navorski. I cannot allow you
to enter the United States at this time.

107
00:07:42,914 --> 00:07:46,459
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.

108
00:07:46,585 --> 00:07:50,380
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.

109
00:07:50,463 --> 00:07:55,886
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?

110
00:07:55,969 --> 00:07:59,264
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.

111
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:01,725
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.

112
00:08:01,808 --> 00:08:03,810
Really? It's not important.

113
00:08:03,894 --> 00:08:07,314
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?

114
00:08:07,355 --> 00:08:09,983
OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.

115
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:12,319
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.

116
00:08:12,402 --> 00:08:16,239
You have no right to enter the US
and I have no right to detain you.

117
00:08:16,323 --> 00:08:18,867
You have fallen through
a crack in the system.

118
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,871
- I am crack.
- Yes. Until we get this sorted out,

119
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:27,209
I will allow you to enter
the International Transit Lounge.

120
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:30,879
I'm going to sign a release form
that is going to make you a free man.

121
00:08:30,962 --> 00:08:33,215
- Free?
- Free. Free.

122
00:08:33,298 --> 00:08:39,346
Free to go anywhere you like
in the International Transit Lounge.

123
00:08:39,387 --> 00:08:41,389
- OK?
- OK.

124
00:08:41,473 --> 00:08:43,892
- OK.
- OK.

125
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:45,101
OK.

126
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:47,854
Uncle Sam will have this
sorted out by tomorrow,

127
00:08:47,896 --> 00:08:50,440
and welcome
to the United States. Almost.

128
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:54,027
- Thank you.
- OK. All right.

129
00:08:54,152 --> 00:08:56,112
Thanks, Judge.

130
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:17,342
Announcing the arrival
of flight 76 from Singapore Airlines.

131
00:09:17,425 --> 00:09:19,386
Now, Mr. Navorski.

132
00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:21,263
Mr. Navorski. Mr. Navorski.

133
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:23,932
This is the International
Transit Lounge.

134
00:09:24,015 --> 00:09:27,102
You are free to wait here.
These are food vouchers.

135
00:09:27,227 --> 00:09:31,481
You can use them in the Food Court.
Your Krakozhian money is no good here.

136
00:09:31,565 --> 00:09:34,484
This is a 1 5-minute,
prepaid calling card.

137
00:09:34,568 --> 00:09:36,945
You may call home, if you like.

138
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:41,074
This, in case we need to contact you,
is a pager.

139
00:09:41,157 --> 00:09:44,536
You must keep this
with you at all times.

140
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:50,208
Here is an ID badge for you
to get into CBP. Beyond those doors...

141
00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:54,045
Mr. Navorski.
I'm going to need you to look at me.

142
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:56,923
Beyond those doors is American soil.

143
00:09:56,965 --> 00:09:59,593
Mr. Dixon wants me to make it clear

144
00:09:59,718 --> 00:10:02,470
that you are not
to enter through those doors.

145
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:06,975
You are not to leave this building.
America is closed.

146
00:10:07,058 --> 00:10:09,019
America closed.

147
00:10:10,353 --> 00:10:12,230
What I do?

148
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,110
There's only one thing
you can do here, Mr. Navorski.

149
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:19,529
Shop.

150
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:24,034
Passengers of flight 854
New York/Warsaw...

151
00:10:31,082 --> 00:10:35,503
...the international community
tries to secure a peaceful resolution.

152
00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:39,966
The populace has to wonder if
they will ever find political stability,

153
00:10:40,008 --> 00:10:45,430
or find the leadership to secure
their place on the world stage.

154
00:10:45,513 --> 00:10:48,183
And next this hour,
looking to buy a 90-foot yacht?

155
00:10:54,564 --> 00:10:58,693
...taken hostage. We're hearing
that the Vice President has been killed

156
00:10:58,735 --> 00:11:03,031
along with four cabinet members,
1 3 injured soldiers and 20 civilians.

157
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:06,284
By dawn, rebel leaders
had surrounded the state houses.

158
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:10,330
In a symbolic gesture, the national flag
of Krakozhia was torn down

159
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:13,625
from the Presidential Palace
and the parliament building.

160
00:11:39,442 --> 00:11:41,444
Please. Please.

161
00:11:42,362 --> 00:11:43,822
Television.

162
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,913
Passenger Chen Wan-Shiu
and Liu Tao-Jing,

163
00:11:51,955 --> 00:11:55,292
please come to podium
to pick up your boarding passes.

164
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:14,603
This just in. Last night a military coup
overthrew the government of Krakozhia.

165
00:12:14,686 --> 00:12:17,522
Bombing and gunfire
were heard through the night.

166
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:19,733
Although details are unclear,

167
00:12:19,816 --> 00:12:25,280
we are told that President Vagobagin
and his aides have been taken hostage.

168
00:12:25,363 --> 00:12:28,325
Bonjour, monsieur.
You are a Red Carpet Club member?

169
00:12:30,869 --> 00:12:34,956
I need to see
your boarding pass and club card, sir.

170
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,210
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a private lounge.

171
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:41,671
The public lounge is downstairs.

172
00:12:43,215 --> 00:12:49,012
The tiniest nation in the region
has been shaken by another uprising.

173
00:12:49,095 --> 00:12:53,975
Krakozhia has been involved in civil war
throughout the late '80s and '90s

174
00:12:54,017 --> 00:12:57,020
as it has tried
to transition from Communist rule.

175
00:13:23,088 --> 00:13:25,048
- Watch it!
- Please.

176
00:13:26,466 --> 00:13:28,426
Please, telephone?
Telephone?

177
00:13:29,594 --> 00:13:31,555
Telephone?

178
00:13:34,432 --> 00:13:36,059
Please. Please.

179
00:13:36,142 --> 00:13:38,144
Please. Please.

180
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:13,054
For security reasons, please
keep your luggage with you at all times.

181
00:14:13,138 --> 00:14:18,143
Unattended luggage will be removed
for inspection and may be destroyed.

182
00:14:32,824 --> 00:14:37,537
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, you broke my bag!

183
00:14:37,621 --> 00:14:41,333
I got this in Paris.
This is my favorite bag.

184
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:46,630
I can't believe you just broke my bag!
Mom, Dad! He broke my bag!

185
00:14:56,014 --> 00:15:00,685
- Food document.
- Excuse me. Stop it. Stop it.

186
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,313
Do you have an appointment?

187
00:15:03,396 --> 00:15:09,361
I don't let anyone to look
at my trash without an appointment.

188
00:15:09,402 --> 00:15:12,447
I have an opening next Tuesday.

189
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:16,451
Tuesday. Tuesday,
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Tuesday.

190
00:15:16,535 --> 00:15:20,288
It will be good time for you
to come back and get lost.

191
00:15:20,372 --> 00:15:22,707
OK, goodbye. Sorry.

192
00:15:24,543 --> 00:15:26,545
Tuesday.

193
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:27,851
Don't shoot!

194
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:41,364
She sleeps 12, Frank. Has a
120-volt generator, wet bar, gas range.

195
00:18:41,448 --> 00:18:43,408
She looks amazing.

196
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:46,119
She's my pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

197
00:18:46,161 --> 00:18:49,039
She's a beautiful boat
and I hope you get her soon.

198
00:18:49,122 --> 00:18:52,250
- You've earned her.
- Thank you, Frank.

199
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:55,086
- You have.
- Actually, I bought her yesterday.

200
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,089
Come on. Congratulations!

201
00:18:58,173 --> 00:19:00,800
I'm nominating you to take my place.

202
00:19:01,551 --> 00:19:05,180
You will assume the duties
of acting Field Commissioner

203
00:19:05,263 --> 00:19:08,058
until you get approval from Washington.

204
00:19:08,141 --> 00:19:10,602
Really? I don't know what to say.

205
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,148
- Jesus. Richard, is this real?
- It's real, Frank, it's real.

206
00:19:15,232 --> 00:19:17,692
Don't pretend to be surprised.

207
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:23,281
You've been waiting for me to retire
or drop dead for years now.

208
00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:26,117
No, I haven't been
waiting for you to retire.

209
00:19:28,203 --> 00:19:29,788
That's all right, Frank.

210
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:33,500
My retirement will become official
the day you get sworn in.

211
00:19:36,795 --> 00:19:40,757
- You've waited a long time for this.
- I have.

212
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,511
Just be careful
about the inspection process.

213
00:19:44,553 --> 00:19:47,597
I will.
I've been here for 1 7 years...

214
00:19:47,681 --> 00:19:50,892
We're talking about
the Field Commissioner position.

215
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:55,313
People are going to look to you
for leadership, to set an example.

216
00:19:57,482 --> 00:19:59,734
What are you saying?

217
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:05,365
I'm saying the job is yours to lose.

218
00:20:05,448 --> 00:20:09,828
Ship the Colombians
off to asylum hearings,

219
00:20:09,911 --> 00:20:12,664
and call the parents
of those kids from Long Island.

220
00:20:12,747 --> 00:20:15,625
Tell them it was a bad idea
to let them go to Jamaica.

221
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:19,087
Come on, let's go. South America
and Madrid are on the tarmac.

222
00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:21,464
I want them out of here in half an hour.

223
00:20:25,927 --> 00:20:28,597
Mr. Thurman.

224
00:20:28,638 --> 00:20:32,934
There's a man walking around
the terminal in a bathrobe.

225
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:36,563
I know, sir. You put him there.

226
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,418
Welcome to the United States.

227
00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:00,086
Next!

228
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,467
I need visa.

229
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:09,095
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.

230
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,139
Go to the wall.

231
00:21:11,223 --> 00:21:12,682
Next!

232
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,811
Sir.

233
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:22,484
The light green form.

234
00:21:49,052 --> 00:21:51,429
Light green.

235
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,060
Mr. Navorski, you cannot
get into New York without a visa.

236
00:21:57,102 --> 00:21:59,229
You cannot get a visa
without a passport,

237
00:21:59,312 --> 00:22:02,148
and you cannot get
a new passport without a country.

238
00:22:02,232 --> 00:22:04,818
There's nothing
we can do for you here.

239
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:06,862
I give you light green.

240
00:22:06,945 --> 00:22:10,198
I'm sorry,
but you've wasted an entire day.

241
00:22:10,282 --> 00:22:12,284
At this time you are simply...

242
00:22:13,827 --> 00:22:16,538
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.

243
00:22:16,621 --> 00:22:17,581
Unacceptable.

244
00:22:19,749 --> 00:22:21,585
Why is he still here?

245
00:22:21,668 --> 00:22:25,922
You released him, sir.
You put him there.

246
00:22:26,006 --> 00:22:29,968
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?

247
00:22:30,051 --> 00:22:35,015
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.

248
00:22:37,851 --> 00:22:41,605
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?

249
00:22:41,646 --> 00:22:46,109
No news from the State Department,
but we can deport him in a few days.

250
00:22:46,193 --> 00:22:49,905
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.

251
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,825
Who knows what this guy is thinking,
what gulag he escaped from.

252
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:55,869
Next!

253
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:00,415
Everything he does comes back to me.

254
00:23:00,498 --> 00:23:04,336
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.

255
00:23:06,588 --> 00:23:08,006
Hello.

256
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:11,051
Hello.

257
00:23:11,927 --> 00:23:15,472
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. 9.30.

258
00:23:15,555 --> 00:23:18,808
Food document, trash. Tuesday.

259
00:23:18,892 --> 00:23:22,354
Tuesday. I hate the Tuesday.

260
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:23,939
Excuse me.

261
00:23:50,465 --> 00:23:54,469
Airports are tricky places,
Mr. Navorski.

262
00:23:54,594 --> 00:23:57,347
I'm about to tell you something.

263
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,058
Something you can
never repeat to anyone.

264
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:02,852
Do you understand? It's a secret.

265
00:24:02,894 --> 00:24:05,605
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.

266
00:24:05,689 --> 00:24:11,111
At 1 2 o'clock today, the guards
at those doors will leave their posts

267
00:24:11,194 --> 00:24:14,781
and their replacements
are going to be five minutes late.

268
00:24:14,865 --> 00:24:17,033
Late five minutes.

269
00:24:17,075 --> 00:24:22,247
Yes. Late five minutes. At 1 2 o'clock.
Just today. Just this once.

270
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,624
No one is going
to be watching those doors.

271
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:29,379
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.

272
00:24:29,462 --> 00:24:30,630
No.

273
00:24:30,755 --> 00:24:34,926
America, for five minutes, is open.

274
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:37,137
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.

275
00:24:46,938 --> 00:24:50,400
Catch and release. It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.

276
00:24:50,483 --> 00:24:53,570
You unhook him
and place him back in the water.

277
00:24:53,612 --> 00:24:58,408
You set him free so that somebody else
can have the pleasure of catching him.

278
00:25:01,578 --> 00:25:03,788
All right, here we go.

279
00:25:03,914 --> 00:25:06,208
OK. Call them off.

280
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:08,585
Johnson, clear the doors.

281
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,714
All right. Go.

282
00:25:12,797 --> 00:25:16,051
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.

283
00:25:17,052 --> 00:25:18,887
All right.

284
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,806
Here we go.
Now where is he?

285
00:25:21,848 --> 00:25:24,768
- There he is.
- No, that's not him.

286
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:26,811
There he is.

287
00:25:26,895 --> 00:25:28,396
All right, Viktor.

288
00:25:29,147 --> 00:25:30,774
Here we go.

289
00:25:47,832 --> 00:25:51,711
What's so complicated? Exit, Viktor.

290
00:25:51,795 --> 00:25:55,257
Come on. In a few minutes,
you'll be somebody else's problem.

291
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,551
He wants to make sure
nobody's watching.

292
00:25:57,634 --> 00:26:00,053
I told him nobody would be watching.

293
00:26:00,136 --> 00:26:03,598
Come on. All right, here we go.

294
00:26:03,682 --> 00:26:06,142
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.

295
00:26:07,936 --> 00:26:08,937
Excuse me.

296
00:26:29,332 --> 00:26:32,043
You got it. There we go.

297
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:35,422
He's got to get a running start,
I guess.

298
00:26:35,505 --> 00:26:38,049
Just leave. Just leave.

299
00:26:38,091 --> 00:26:40,218
Leave. Leave.

300
00:26:40,302 --> 00:26:43,889
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling? Is he praying?

301
00:26:43,972 --> 00:26:46,516
No. He's tying his shoelace.

302
00:26:52,105 --> 00:26:54,357
Come on, leave.

303
00:26:54,441 --> 00:26:56,401
Get the cameras.

304
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:06,870
Where is he? Where is he?

305
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:14,294
- To the left of here.
- No. He was at the door.

306
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:17,380
- Just go a little left.
- All right. All right.

307
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:27,849
I wait.

308
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:38,276
What are you looking at?
Go back to work. Thank you.

309
00:27:45,825 --> 00:27:48,954
Oh, God. Oh, shit.

310
00:27:57,337 --> 00:28:00,382
- This belong you?
- Thank you.

311
00:28:00,465 --> 00:28:02,342
Oh, shit.

312
00:28:03,802 --> 00:28:07,097
See? Wet floor.

313
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,765
That you.

314
00:28:08,848 --> 00:28:10,350
I'm so late.

315
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:13,186
Buenos Aires.
I can't remember the gate.

316
00:28:13,228 --> 00:28:15,438
Gate 24.

317
00:28:15,522 --> 00:28:17,899
- You sure?
- Yes.

318
00:28:19,484 --> 00:28:21,278
Thanks.

319
00:28:21,403 --> 00:28:24,239
Ladies and gentlemen...

320
00:28:24,322 --> 00:28:26,366
Wait.

321
00:28:26,491 --> 00:28:29,202
For you. Payless Shoes.

322
00:28:29,286 --> 00:28:31,913
Second floor.
Sensible heels.

323
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,345
- Hi, baby.
- Come here, you.

324
00:28:53,518 --> 00:28:59,107
I think he's CIA.
The CIA put him here to spy on us.

325
00:28:59,232 --> 00:29:03,111
You don't know what you're talking
about. He doesn't speak English.

326
00:29:03,153 --> 00:29:05,614
If he could learn to speak, this guy.

327
00:29:05,697 --> 00:29:09,743
He can't speak English, how could he
have a meeting with a beautiful woman?

328
00:29:09,826 --> 00:29:11,161
A flight attendant.

329
00:29:11,244 --> 00:29:13,705
- So, she's CIA, too?
- No.

330
00:29:13,788 --> 00:29:19,544
She look like a Russian.
KGB. She gave him heel of her shoes.

331
00:29:19,628 --> 00:29:21,588
And he gave her a piece of the paper.

332
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:26,218
- Was it microfilm?
- A coupon from Payless Shoes.

333
00:29:26,301 --> 00:29:28,762
Must be some kind of the code.

334
00:29:28,845 --> 00:29:33,767
You been spending too much time
inhaling them cleaning products.

335
00:29:33,808 --> 00:29:36,811
I'm warning you guys.
You watch yourself.

336
00:29:36,895 --> 00:29:41,942
This guy is here for a reason.
And I think that reason is us.

337
00:30:03,129 --> 00:30:04,422
Excuse me, buddy.

338
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:27,821
What's going on?

339
00:30:27,904 --> 00:30:31,199
It's Navorski.
He's figured out the quarters.

340
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:59,102
Good afternoon. Welcome to Burger King.
May I take your order?

341
00:31:02,606 --> 00:31:04,191
Keep the change.

342
00:31:24,961 --> 00:31:26,254
Excuse me.

343
00:31:31,134 --> 00:31:34,262
OK, go. Go.

344
00:31:36,306 --> 00:31:39,351
Good boy. Thank you.

345
00:31:40,477 --> 00:31:41,478
Bye-bye.

346
00:31:59,412 --> 00:32:01,998
Welcome to Burger King.
May I take your...

347
00:32:28,692 --> 00:32:28,733
"Crisis. Crisis in Krakozhia. "

348
00:32:28,775 --> 00:32:32,571
"Crisis. Crisis in Krakozhia. "

349
00:32:32,654 --> 00:32:34,698
Now that heavy fighting has subsided

350
00:32:34,781 --> 00:32:37,826
and both sides have dug in
for the long winter ahead,

351
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:42,289
it's clear that the future of Krakozhia
may be in doubt for some time to come.

352
00:32:42,372 --> 00:32:46,167
Meanwhile, the people of Krakozhia
suffer the consequences.

353
00:32:46,209 --> 00:32:49,504
"And food... in... "

354
00:32:49,588 --> 00:32:52,173
...have caused food
and energy shortages.

355
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:54,259
"... in Krakozhia. "

356
00:33:16,781 --> 00:33:21,578
"The story of Broadway is the... "

357
00:33:26,374 --> 00:33:32,505
"The cast of comedy hit Friends

358
00:33:33,173 --> 00:33:36,927
which is set in New York. "

359
00:33:37,886 --> 00:33:40,388
Friends.

360
00:33:40,472 --> 00:33:42,474
Friends.

361
00:33:50,357 --> 00:33:53,985
Due to the heavy snowfall,
all flights have been cancelled...

362
00:34:04,329 --> 00:34:08,166
"Wayne Newton is 61 today. "

363
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,252
"It's a miracle. "

364
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:16,591
"Korean conjoined twins
separated today in Maine. "

365
00:34:16,675 --> 00:34:20,053
"Chances of survival 50-50."

366
00:34:20,136 --> 00:34:21,388
50-50.

367
00:34:25,225 --> 00:34:27,477
Next.

368
00:34:29,062 --> 00:34:31,314
Let me ask you something,
Mr. Navorski.

369
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:34,985
Why do you wait here every day
when there's nothing I can do for you?

370
00:34:35,068 --> 00:34:41,116
Your new visa will not arrive until
your country is recognized by the US.

371
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,243
You have two stamp.

372
00:34:43,326 --> 00:34:46,288
One red, one green.

373
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:51,835
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.

374
00:34:55,547 --> 00:34:59,509
Yes. That's a beautiful way to look at
it, but America doesn't work that way.

375
00:35:13,899 --> 00:35:18,528
As acting Field Commissioner,
I've created a new position here at JFK.

376
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:22,908
Transportation Liaison
for Passenger Assistance.

377
00:35:23,742 --> 00:35:27,120
Sir, what will that person do?

378
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:34,961
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.

379
00:35:37,255 --> 00:35:41,051
I'm Transportation Liaison
in charge of Passenger Assistance.

380
00:35:49,684 --> 00:35:52,187
No carts, no quarters.
No quarters, no food.

381
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:56,733
It'll be days before he goes through
the doors in violation of section 2.1 4

382
00:35:56,816 --> 00:35:58,818
Then he's somebody else's problem.

383
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,988
Why don't we tag him
in violation of section 2.1 4 now?

384
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:03,573
Then ship him to detention.

385
00:36:03,657 --> 00:36:05,784
He has to break the law by leaving.

386
00:36:05,867 --> 00:36:09,287
I won't lie, particularly to get rid
of somebody like him.

387
00:36:45,532 --> 00:36:47,993
- Sorry, buddy.
- Honey!

388
00:37:10,724 --> 00:37:13,226
Put it down. Put it down.

389
00:37:14,686 --> 00:37:16,646
Put it down.

390
00:37:17,731 --> 00:37:21,359
You try to take my mop.
You try to take my floor.

391
00:37:21,443 --> 00:37:25,906
It's my job. Stay off my floor.
Stay away from my mop.

392
00:37:25,947 --> 00:37:28,617
- Food.
- If you touch it again, I kill you.

393
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:45,175
Hey. I'm Enrique Cruz.

394
00:37:48,637 --> 00:37:50,597
We need to talk.

395
00:37:54,976 --> 00:37:58,522
- I want to make a deal with you.
- What deal?

396
00:37:58,605 --> 00:38:01,942
I need information
on CBP Officer Torres.

397
00:38:02,025 --> 00:38:05,070
You feed me information about her
and I'll feed you.

398
00:38:05,153 --> 00:38:08,615
- What do you want know?
- You see her every day.

399
00:38:08,657 --> 00:38:13,328
I want to know
what makes her knees weak.

400
00:38:13,411 --> 00:38:18,625
What makes her blood boil
and her body tingle.

401
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:21,962
She's a wild stallion
and you'll help me break her.

402
00:38:22,087 --> 00:38:23,588
I'm...

403
00:38:23,672 --> 00:38:25,840
I'm her man of mystery.

404
00:38:25,966 --> 00:38:30,887
- Officer Torres is wild stallion?
- Her name is Delores.

405
00:38:31,012 --> 00:38:34,933
You help me to win her heart
and you'll never go hungry again.

406
00:38:37,352 --> 00:38:39,980
- I do this.
- Really? Promise?

407
00:38:40,063 --> 00:38:43,316
- Yes.
- OK. Thank you.

408
00:38:44,067 --> 00:38:46,444
What mean, "wild stallion"?

409
00:38:53,577 --> 00:38:57,163
Officer Torres.
My friend say you are stallion.

410
00:38:57,289 --> 00:38:59,207

411
00:38:59,332 --> 00:39:02,252

417
00:39:20,979 --> 00:39:23,064

00:39:27,402 --> 00:39:31,781
- Very important.

00:39:34,075 --> 00:39:35,952
Something wrong with the salmon?

421
00:39:36,036 --> 00:39:37,746
Need gorchitsa.

422
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:39,039

00:39:48,465 --> 00:39:50,467
Thank you.

426
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,436
Officer Torres, you like the films?

427
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,855
- Movies?
- Not so much.

428
00:40:03,939 --> 00:40:07,192
- The Rockettes?
- Can't afford it.

429
00:40:07,275 --> 00:40:09,694
- What do you like?
- Conventions.

430
00:40:11,238 --> 00:40:13,448

Now, listen, Viktor.

00:40:39,641 --> 00:40:42,227
You can ask her something

Officer Torres.
Have you been ever in the love?

467
00:42:30,377 --> 00:42:34,005
Enough, Viktor. Who is it?

468
00:42:34,089 --> 00:42:36,466
Who's telling you

He's so sick. He's so in love.

473
00:42:52,983 --> 00:42:53,066
But what did she say?

474
00:42:53,108 --> 00:42:54,818
But what did she say?

475
00:42:54,901 --> 00:42:58,071
She did say, "Next! Next!"

476
00:42:58,154 --> 00:43:00,907
And now she say,
"Please. Please come. "

477
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:04,035
That's... Wait.

478
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:11,126
- I coming now.
- No, wait. Viktor.

479
00:43:11,209 --> 00:43:14,087
Viktor, just tell me more.

480
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:16,131
I coming. I coming.

481
00:43:16,214 --> 00:43:18,216
Please, please.

482
00:43:35,317 --> 00:43:40,155
Beeper went off.
Started beeping. So, I grab. I come.

483
00:43:40,238 --> 00:43:42,949
We have an idea.

484
00:43:43,033 --> 00:43:45,202
Would you like something to eat?

485
00:43:45,285 --> 00:43:47,871
No. No food. I stuffed.

486
00:43:50,582 --> 00:43:53,084
OK. All right.

487
00:43:53,126 --> 00:43:54,377
Thank you.

488
00:43:54,502 --> 00:43:58,173
So, Mr. Navorski,
I have some very good news for you.

489
00:43:58,256 --> 00:44:00,050
What?

490
00:44:00,133 --> 00:44:03,637
I've figured out a way
to get you out of this airport.

491
00:44:03,762 --> 00:44:05,388
How?

492
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:09,643
Well, we have laws here
that protect aliens

493
00:44:09,726 --> 00:44:13,355
who have a credible fear
of returning to their own country.

494
00:44:13,438 --> 00:44:15,941
If we can establish this fear with you,

495
00:44:16,024 --> 00:44:21,571
then the CBP will be forced
to begin Expedited Removal Procedures,

496
00:44:21,613 --> 00:44:27,494
to bring you to an immigration judge
and let you plead your case for asylum.

497
00:44:27,577 --> 00:44:29,746
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.

498
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:34,876
Unfortunately, the courts
are so backed up with asylum cases

499
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,881
that the soonest you'd get before
a judge would be six months from now.

500
00:44:39,965 --> 00:44:43,635
Yes, and we would have no choice

501
00:44:43,718 --> 00:44:48,932
but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law. You'd be released.

502
00:44:49,015 --> 00:44:52,227
You would be free to wait
in New York until your court date.

503
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:57,649
But, believe it or not, most people
never show up before the judge.

504
00:44:57,691 --> 00:45:01,528
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.

505
00:45:01,611 --> 00:45:03,989
You can go to New York City tonight.

506
00:45:04,072 --> 00:45:09,119
But, you only get to go
if we can establish a credible fear.

507
00:45:09,202 --> 00:45:10,912
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.

508
00:45:10,996 --> 00:45:12,455
- Fear.
- Fear.

509
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:14,791
From what?

510
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:16,668
That's the best part.

511
00:45:16,751 --> 00:45:21,256
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.

512
00:45:21,339 --> 00:45:23,842
So I'm going to ask you one question,

513
00:45:23,925 --> 00:45:28,221
if you give me the correct answer, I can
get you out of this airport tonight.

514
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:32,601
So, I answer one question.

515
00:45:33,977 --> 00:45:36,479
Go to New York City. Tonight.

516
00:45:36,521 --> 00:45:37,814
- Tonight.
- Tonight.

517
00:45:37,898 --> 00:45:39,649
- Tonight.
- Tonight.

518
00:45:43,486 --> 00:45:46,198
- OK.
- OK.

519
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:47,449
All right.

520
00:45:47,532 --> 00:45:52,204
Do you, at this time, have any fear
of returning to your own country?

521
00:45:52,245 --> 00:45:54,247
No.

522
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,379
OK. Let me try it again.

523
00:46:02,505 --> 00:46:05,383
- Your country's at war.
- Yes. War.

524
00:46:05,425 --> 00:46:08,929
There are men in the streets
with guns. Political persecution.

525
00:46:09,054 --> 00:46:11,431
- Yes. It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.

526
00:46:11,515 --> 00:46:13,683
And God only knows
what could happen.

527
00:46:13,767 --> 00:46:16,394
Innocent people
are torn from their beds.

528
00:46:16,478 --> 00:46:19,397
On Tuesdays. I hate Tuesdays.

529
00:46:19,439 --> 00:46:21,566
So you're afraid.

530
00:46:21,608 --> 00:46:24,819
- From what?
- Krakozhia.

531
00:46:24,903 --> 00:46:27,739
You're afraid of Krakozhia.

532
00:46:27,781 --> 00:46:29,824
Krakozhia?

533
00:46:29,908 --> 00:46:36,414
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.

534
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:42,295
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.

535
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,380
Human rights.

536
00:46:43,463 --> 00:46:48,343
Viktor, please don't be afraid
to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.

537
00:46:49,302 --> 00:46:53,849
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.

538
00:46:55,809 --> 00:46:59,729
So? I go to New York City now?

539
00:47:01,314 --> 00:47:03,316
- No.
- No?

540
00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:07,070
OK.

541
00:47:07,153 --> 00:47:11,283
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.

542
00:47:11,324 --> 00:47:14,411
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.

543
00:47:15,412 --> 00:47:20,041
I'm afraid from Wolfmens,
afraid from sharks.

544
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:21,501
Thanks a lot.

545
00:47:26,882 --> 00:47:28,884
Damn.

546
00:47:32,012 --> 00:47:36,725
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.

547
00:47:38,518 --> 00:47:40,478
This is the only fun I have.

548
00:47:41,771 --> 00:47:45,817
A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?

549
00:47:45,901 --> 00:47:49,362
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.

550
00:47:49,446 --> 00:47:51,698
I take four back-to-back flights,

551
00:47:51,781 --> 00:47:55,911
fly 27 hours straight
literally around the world,

552
00:47:55,994 --> 00:47:59,748
and now you tell me you're going
to spend July 4th with your wife?

553
00:47:59,831 --> 00:48:01,833
The woman hates fireworks.

554
00:48:03,543 --> 00:48:06,338
Don't lie to me, OK?

555
00:48:06,379 --> 00:48:09,883
I know for a fact
you took her to Rome last weekend.

556
00:48:09,966 --> 00:48:12,469
Because you flew United, Max.

557
00:48:17,724 --> 00:48:20,977
South African Airlines
passenger Sharif Al-Calala,

558
00:48:21,102 --> 00:48:23,104
please come to the main ticket counter.

559
00:48:31,696 --> 00:48:36,576
You make a habit out of listening
to other people's conversations?

560
00:48:36,618 --> 00:48:39,746
No, I try to call home.

561
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:42,374
So then...

562
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:47,504
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.

563
00:48:50,882 --> 00:48:53,552
Because they're all liars.

564
00:48:54,302 --> 00:48:56,096
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

565
00:48:57,806 --> 00:48:59,266
Wet floor.

566
00:48:59,349 --> 00:49:00,976
Please. Don't be hurt.

567
00:49:01,101 --> 00:49:02,769
How can I not be? He's married.

568
00:49:02,853 --> 00:49:04,938
One man. Two womens. Crowded.

569
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,065
You want to know
what the worst part is?

570
00:49:07,148 --> 00:49:11,319
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.

571
00:49:11,403 --> 00:49:14,281
What kind of sick person am I?

572
00:49:14,322 --> 00:49:16,825
I'm rooting for the home team.

573
00:49:22,414 --> 00:49:24,875
I just wish the sex
wasn't so amazing.

574
00:49:27,752 --> 00:49:29,754
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.

575
00:49:31,006 --> 00:49:35,677
You know...
sometimes in the mornings,

576
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,097
I just stare at him over room service.

577
00:49:39,181 --> 00:49:41,516
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.

578
00:49:43,101 --> 00:49:47,939
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.

579
00:49:50,025 --> 00:49:52,152
That we belong together.

580
00:49:54,946 --> 00:49:59,451
This... man... has you.

581
00:50:00,785 --> 00:50:05,040
Why he need... puzzle?

582
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:09,044
This is my problem.

583
00:50:09,085 --> 00:50:11,546
I always see men
the way I want to see them.

584
00:50:17,052 --> 00:50:20,013
Do I know you from someplace?

585
00:50:20,096 --> 00:50:23,016
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes. Second floor.

586
00:50:26,561 --> 00:50:28,396
Oh...

587
00:50:28,438 --> 00:50:30,440
You headed for home?

588
00:50:31,149 --> 00:50:34,361
Er... No, no. I am...

589
00:50:34,402 --> 00:50:38,698
I am delayed a long time.

590
00:50:38,782 --> 00:50:42,827
I hate it when they delay flights.
What do you do?

591
00:50:42,911 --> 00:50:48,416
I go from one building
to another building.

592
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,670
I have beeper.

593
00:50:51,753 --> 00:50:56,299
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.

594
00:50:59,052 --> 00:51:01,721
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.

595
00:51:01,805 --> 00:51:03,014
What's "BH"?

596
00:51:03,098 --> 00:51:05,058
In English...

597
00:51:06,643 --> 00:51:08,270
Viktor Navorski.

598
00:51:08,895 --> 00:51:13,859
- In English, Amelia Warren.
- Amelia Warren?

599
00:51:13,984 --> 00:51:16,069
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

600
00:51:16,152 --> 00:51:18,154
Nice to see you again.

601
00:51:20,949 --> 00:51:23,410
You like Italian food?

602
00:51:23,493 --> 00:51:26,454
I know, it's late
and you've probably got other plans,

603
00:51:26,538 --> 00:51:31,209
but if you'd like to grab some dinner,
we can run right out and catch a cab.

604
00:51:31,293 --> 00:51:34,796
I know a place
that has the greatest cannelloni.

605
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:36,381
Erm...

606
00:51:36,464 --> 00:51:38,925
No, I... I can't.

607
00:51:39,009 --> 00:51:40,844
- You married?
- No.

608
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:43,889
- Girlfriend?
- No.

609
00:51:43,972 --> 00:51:49,477
I... I can't go out... with you.

610
00:51:52,689 --> 00:51:56,443
God. I am so... I'm so sorry.

611
00:51:56,526 --> 00:51:57,777
I am so sorry.

612
00:51:57,861 --> 00:52:00,614
I must come off
like a complete nut job or something.

613
00:52:00,697 --> 00:52:03,992
- No.
- I didn't want to eat alone.

614
00:52:04,034 --> 00:52:06,036
Wet floor. Wet floor.

615
00:52:06,661 --> 00:52:09,372
- I...
- You don't have to explain.

616
00:52:09,456 --> 00:52:10,415
No, I... Please, I...

617
00:52:10,457 --> 00:52:11,458
No, I... Please, I...

618
00:52:14,711 --> 00:52:16,755
Wheelchair to gate A-five.

619
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,089
Nadia.

620
00:52:18,215 --> 00:52:23,595
In New York restaurant,
what cost is cantaloni?

621
00:52:23,678 --> 00:52:25,805
I don't know. Maybe 1 5 bucks.

622
00:52:25,889 --> 00:52:28,099
- Dollars?
- 20.

623
00:52:28,183 --> 00:52:30,393
Two people, 40.

624
00:52:30,477 --> 00:52:32,479
Two people, 40 dollars.

625
00:52:40,779 --> 00:52:43,698
Two people, 40 dollars.

626
00:52:49,663 --> 00:52:53,083
I... I... help you?

627
00:52:53,166 --> 00:52:57,754
I'm so sorry, sir.
The position has already been filled.

628
00:53:03,343 --> 00:53:07,138
- Do you live nearby?
- Yes. Gate 67.

629
00:53:07,222 --> 00:53:12,519
Because we are very particular
about punctual... Did you say Gate 67?

630
00:53:12,602 --> 00:53:14,437
Gate 67.

631
00:53:18,441 --> 00:53:20,402
You got to be kidding.

632
00:53:20,819 --> 00:53:25,240
You got to help me help you.
I don't see a Social Security number...

633
00:53:25,323 --> 00:53:27,951
...mailing address,
even a phone number.

634
00:53:28,076 --> 00:53:32,873
Telephone? You need? I get.
I get. I get phone.

635
00:53:32,956 --> 00:53:34,916
I get... I get phone.

636
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:50,098
451 -1 226.

637
00:53:50,182 --> 00:53:53,226
All right.
When's the best time to reach you?

638
00:53:55,228 --> 00:53:56,313
Now?

639
00:54:28,428 --> 00:54:30,680
- Hello?
- Hi, Mr. Navorski.

640
00:54:30,805 --> 00:54:33,225
Yes, this is Viktor Navorski.
Who calls?

641
00:54:33,266 --> 00:54:35,727
It's Cliff from the Discovery Store.

642
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,104
Cliff. Hello.

643
00:54:38,188 --> 00:54:39,731
- How's it going?
- Good.

644
00:54:39,814 --> 00:54:43,568
- Is this a good time?
- Yes, I wait for your call all day.

645
00:54:43,652 --> 00:54:47,280
Well, I got to tell you
that the position's been filled.

646
00:54:47,364 --> 00:54:51,034
Yeah, so could you please
go sit someplace else?

647
00:54:51,076 --> 00:54:53,995
- I go to bathroom now.
- That'd be good.

648
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,413
- All right.
- Thank you.

649
00:54:55,497 --> 00:54:56,915
OK.

650
00:56:25,212 --> 00:56:27,672
Who is this?

651
00:56:27,756 --> 00:56:30,175
- Who are you?
- It's no one.

652
00:56:30,217 --> 00:56:33,887
There's no one here for
two weeks. This isn't one of my guys.

653
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:42,020
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.

654
00:56:42,103 --> 00:56:44,940
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?

655
00:56:45,023 --> 00:56:47,192
Does Harry think
he's running this job?

656
00:56:47,234 --> 00:56:49,444
- I go now.
- Go? Go where?

657
00:56:49,528 --> 00:56:52,072
- Gate 67.
- 67?

658
00:56:52,197 --> 00:56:54,282
We're ten months away from 67.

659
00:56:54,407 --> 00:56:57,869
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours...

660
00:56:57,911 --> 00:57:00,330
Harry's trying to make me look bad.

661
00:57:00,413 --> 00:57:02,916
I've got to slow him down
before he gets to 67.

662
00:57:02,999 --> 00:57:05,794
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.

663
00:57:06,753 --> 00:57:09,214
Pull him off Harry's crew,
put him on mine.

664
00:57:09,256 --> 00:57:11,341
You start 6.30 Monday morning.

665
00:57:11,424 --> 00:57:14,094
You give me job?

666
00:57:15,804 --> 00:57:18,014
6.30, yes... Boss.

667
00:57:58,263 --> 00:58:01,391
We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.

668
00:58:01,516 --> 00:58:04,102
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.

669
00:58:04,186 --> 00:58:05,687
OK. Just bring it.

670
00:58:05,812 --> 00:58:08,565
- Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.

671
00:58:08,648 --> 00:58:11,985
Look. The man without a country.

672
00:58:12,027 --> 00:58:13,987
Come on in. Welcome.

673
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:16,990
- I see this.
- You did well.

674
00:58:17,532 --> 00:58:18,658
Have a seat.

675
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:19,910
- Here?
- Here.

676
00:58:19,993 --> 00:58:21,369
Come on, sit down.

677
00:58:21,453 --> 00:58:25,916
- Who invited him?
- I did. We needed a fourth, right?

678
00:58:25,999 --> 00:58:29,169
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?

679
00:58:29,211 --> 00:58:32,255
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?

680
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:37,010
He could be recording
everything we say. A wire in his shirt.

681
00:58:37,093 --> 00:58:39,471
A microphone up in his ass.

682
00:58:40,889 --> 00:58:45,644
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.

683
00:58:45,727 --> 00:58:48,438
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.

684
00:58:50,315 --> 00:58:52,317
Close your eyes.

685
00:59:02,452 --> 00:59:06,081
- OK. So you are clean.
- Good. Let's play cards.

686
00:59:06,206 --> 00:59:09,751
I will have money.
But... Friday.

687
00:59:09,876 --> 00:59:13,797
Don't worry about it. We play for
unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.

688
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:17,342
You'll be amazed
at what people leave at airports. Come.

689
00:59:17,425 --> 00:59:20,762
I have two nines and two nines.

690
00:59:20,846 --> 00:59:22,848
Four nines. Thank you.

691
00:59:24,182 --> 00:59:27,435
- Careful.
- Watch out.

692
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:32,607
- We have a question for you.
- Yeah, we're just curious.

693
00:59:32,691 --> 00:59:34,568
What is in the can?

694
00:59:34,609 --> 00:59:37,237
- This?
- We saw the x-ray.

695
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,489
We know there's no nuts in there.

696
00:59:40,448 --> 00:59:42,450
What is in there?

697
00:59:42,617 --> 00:59:44,578
This is jazz.

698
00:59:45,453 --> 00:59:47,247
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.

699
00:59:47,289 --> 00:59:49,833
- Jazz?
- Yes.

700
00:59:51,626 --> 00:59:55,255
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.

701
00:59:55,297 --> 00:59:57,716
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.

702
00:59:57,799 --> 01:00:00,635
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys. OK.

703
01:00:00,677 --> 01:00:03,096
For tonight's grand prize, we have...

704
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:06,975
Show them, Gupta.

705
01:00:07,017 --> 01:00:08,977
I found this upstairs.

706
01:00:09,019 --> 01:00:11,730
Virgin Air, first class lounge.

707
01:00:11,813 --> 01:00:13,773
There you go.

708
01:00:14,566 --> 01:00:16,318
And... they belong to?

709
01:00:16,443 --> 01:00:18,111
Cher.

710
01:00:18,195 --> 01:00:19,738
Cher?

711
01:00:19,821 --> 01:00:21,323
As in... Cher?

712
01:00:21,406 --> 01:00:22,699
Yeah. Cher.

713
01:00:22,782 --> 01:00:25,076
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.

714
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,495
Those are Cher's panties.

715
01:00:27,537 --> 01:00:29,289
- Ready?
- Hurry up.

716
01:00:29,331 --> 01:00:32,000
So, will we share the panties?

717
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:33,543
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.

718
01:00:33,627 --> 01:00:35,170
- Come on.
- Wait a second.

719
01:00:36,504 --> 01:00:36,546
United Airlines
flight number 801 to Narita

720
01:00:36,588 --> 01:00:40,759
United Airlines
flight number 801 to Narita

721
01:00:40,842 --> 01:00:43,011
is now announcing final boarding.

722
01:00:43,053 --> 01:00:46,598
"You can't.
That is mine. "

723
01:00:48,683 --> 01:00:51,311
"You can get so confused. "

724
01:00:51,394 --> 01:00:52,854
Viktor?

725
01:00:52,979 --> 01:00:54,356
Well, hi.

726
01:00:55,732 --> 01:00:56,691
Please.

727
01:00:56,775 --> 01:00:58,735
- How are you?
- Good.

728
01:00:58,818 --> 01:01:00,654
Man.

729
01:01:00,737 --> 01:01:05,534
I am so sorry about what happened
last time, asking you out like that.

730
01:01:05,575 --> 01:01:08,537
I'm so used to guys
trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet

731
01:01:08,578 --> 01:01:12,916
that when I meet somebody that doesn't,
I don't know how to react.

732
01:01:12,999 --> 01:01:15,252
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.

733
01:01:15,335 --> 01:01:17,963
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know. Both.

734
01:01:18,088 --> 01:01:20,048
Tell me about it.

735
01:01:20,549 --> 01:01:21,758
Napoleon?

736
01:01:21,883 --> 01:01:27,848
Yeah. I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.

737
01:01:27,931 --> 01:01:31,059
Like 1 200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.

738
01:01:31,142 --> 01:01:34,729
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah. He's one of my favorites.

739
01:01:35,772 --> 01:01:38,275
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.

740
01:01:38,358 --> 01:01:39,776
- His ego.
- Ego?

741
01:01:39,818 --> 01:01:40,902
Yes.

742
01:01:40,944 --> 01:01:43,280
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,

743
01:01:43,363 --> 01:01:47,492
Napoleon isolates himself
on the tiny island of Saint Helena.

744
01:01:47,576 --> 01:01:50,120
No one knows exactly
what happens next,

745
01:01:50,203 --> 01:01:52,497
but the version I like goes like this:

746
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:57,043
He's very depressed
and decides to take his own life.

747
01:01:57,752 --> 01:02:01,798
But Napoleon believes himself
to be of such superhuman strength

748
01:02:01,882 --> 01:02:05,802
that he takes six times the amount
of poison needed to do the job.

749
01:02:05,886 --> 01:02:10,473
His stomach is so full up with poison
that his body rejects it,

750
01:02:10,557 --> 01:02:12,475
and he doesn't die.

751
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:15,854
See? Ego. Saved his life.

752
01:02:15,937 --> 01:02:18,190
Maybe he need glasses.

753
01:02:18,273 --> 01:02:21,109
- Glasses?
- Yes. To read words on bottle.

754
01:02:21,151 --> 01:02:23,153
Poison.

755
01:02:24,821 --> 01:02:27,324
It's funny you should say that.

756
01:02:27,449 --> 01:02:30,118
Rumor has it
that Napoleon was farsighted.

757
01:02:30,243 --> 01:02:31,912
- There you go.
- There you go.

758
01:02:31,995 --> 01:02:34,748
- There you go.
- And there you go.

759
01:02:34,831 --> 01:02:37,792
I think we're rewriting history
right here.

760
01:02:37,834 --> 01:02:39,836
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?

761
01:02:40,962 --> 01:02:43,965
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.

762
01:02:44,049 --> 01:02:46,051
I just did it again.

763
01:02:47,886 --> 01:02:50,430
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?

764
01:02:50,514 --> 01:02:54,351
I'm sick. I don't have the ability
to be alone for five seconds.

765
01:02:54,434 --> 01:02:55,435
OK.

766
01:02:56,603 --> 01:02:59,105
- OK, what?
- OK.

767
01:02:59,231 --> 01:03:01,233
Lunch... with you.

768
01:03:02,734 --> 01:03:04,653
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.

769
01:03:04,736 --> 01:03:07,405
You're not running for a flight or...?

770
01:03:07,489 --> 01:03:08,865
I wait.

771
01:03:12,786 --> 01:03:14,829
- It's me.
- You. Yes.

772
01:03:14,913 --> 01:03:17,415
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.

773
01:03:17,457 --> 01:03:20,126
You work?

774
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:22,045
- No.
- Ah.

775
01:03:22,087 --> 01:03:24,923
Three of you. Crowded.

776
01:03:25,006 --> 01:03:27,342
Stay away from me, Viktor.

777
01:03:28,426 --> 01:03:32,305
I'm... I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.

778
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:36,726
I just keep ingesting these poisonous
men until I make myself sick.

779
01:03:36,768 --> 01:03:39,646
- You're not sick, Amelia. No.
- No?

780
01:03:39,729 --> 01:03:43,066
No. You're a little... farsighted.

781
01:03:46,361 --> 01:03:49,239
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.

782
01:03:49,281 --> 01:03:52,492
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.

783
01:04:08,884 --> 01:04:11,344
Your CBP inspection's in three days.

784
01:04:11,428 --> 01:04:14,389
The FBI and Homeland Security
will tour the airport,

785
01:04:14,472 --> 01:04:19,436
spend two hours observing these offices
before your interview process begins.

786
01:04:20,187 --> 01:04:22,189
How much does Navorski make?

787
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,816
Sir?

788
01:04:24,858 --> 01:04:27,569
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?

789
01:04:28,945 --> 01:04:31,615
They're paying him cash under the table.

790
01:04:31,698 --> 01:04:33,992
I know that. How much?

791
01:04:35,035 --> 01:04:37,120
$1 9 an hour.

792
01:04:37,162 --> 01:04:41,291
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?

793
01:04:41,416 --> 01:04:43,501
That's New York City construction.

794
01:04:44,669 --> 01:04:47,380
One of my own men
came up to me the other day.

795
01:04:47,464 --> 01:04:50,175
Asked me
if I wanted to join the big pool.

796
01:04:50,258 --> 01:04:51,718
Look at him.

797
01:04:51,801 --> 01:04:55,180
Place a bet on when Navorski's
going to leave this airport.

798
01:04:55,222 --> 01:04:57,224
Have you heard about this?

799
01:04:59,059 --> 01:05:01,061
I have January 3rd.

800
01:05:05,357 --> 01:05:07,359
Bring him in.

801
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:11,154
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK? No country.

802
01:05:11,196 --> 01:05:16,159
He's a national security risk, according
to my interpretation of Section 2.1 2.

803
01:05:16,243 --> 01:05:20,205
I want you to put him in a detention
center and run a clearance on him.

804
01:05:20,288 --> 01:05:22,249
That's all I want.

805
01:05:23,917 --> 01:05:25,919
What about a federal prison?

806
01:05:27,212 --> 01:05:30,090
What about another airport?

807
01:05:30,173 --> 01:05:32,676
Hello? Hello?

808
01:05:36,221 --> 01:05:39,558
We're detaining so many people,
there's no room anywhere.

809
01:05:40,308 --> 01:05:44,688
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody. Nobody'll take him.

810
01:05:44,729 --> 01:05:47,232
You want me to bring him back
to the terminal?

811
01:05:47,315 --> 01:05:50,902
No. From now on, Navorski lives here.

812
01:06:00,704 --> 01:06:06,543
The people who are coming here today
will be observing me, inspecting me.

813
01:06:07,377 --> 01:06:11,214
But most of all they will be looking
at the way that this airport is run.

814
01:06:11,298 --> 01:06:16,469
So let's show them why this is the
number-one airport in the United States.

815
01:06:16,553 --> 01:06:20,015
We process about 600 planes a day,

816
01:06:20,098 --> 01:06:22,767
with a processing time
of 37 minutes per plane,

817
01:06:22,851 --> 01:06:24,811
about 60 seconds per passenger...

818
01:06:24,936 --> 01:06:27,439
...to be brought into the country.

819
01:06:27,564 --> 01:06:30,984
We keep it as clean as possible.

820
01:06:31,109 --> 01:06:33,361
- What do you import?
- Computer software.

821
01:06:33,445 --> 01:06:34,946
That's a lot of walnuts.

822
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:38,158
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.

823
01:06:38,241 --> 01:06:40,952
Every time I go to Brazil,
I bring her back a bag.

824
01:06:40,994 --> 01:06:43,788
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.

825
01:06:43,830 --> 01:06:45,832
Mind if I try one?

826
01:06:55,425 --> 01:06:58,345
How did you know
those weren't for his mother-in-law?

827
01:06:58,428 --> 01:07:00,305
If he's married,
where's his ring?

828
01:07:00,347 --> 01:07:03,683
And if he's divorced,
who still talks to their mother-in-law?

829
01:07:03,767 --> 01:07:08,063
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...

830
01:07:08,146 --> 01:07:09,940
- Sir.
- Yeah.

831
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:13,860
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.

832
01:07:13,944 --> 01:07:16,404
- It'll have to wait.
- No. This won't wait.

833
01:07:16,488 --> 01:07:20,992
When the 9.1 2 from Toronto landed, they
found four prescriptions without an MPL.

834
01:07:21,076 --> 01:07:23,745
They tried to take the pills away
and he went nuts.

835
01:07:23,828 --> 01:07:26,498
There he is.
We think they're for his father.

836
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:29,417
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.

837
01:07:29,543 --> 01:07:33,547
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right. We're here to help you.

838
01:07:33,672 --> 01:07:36,842
We're here to help you, sir.
All right. Give me the knife.

839
01:07:36,883 --> 01:07:38,593
- Where's he from?
- Russia.

840
01:07:38,677 --> 01:07:41,304
The only interpreter
we got is in Newark.

841
01:07:41,388 --> 01:07:45,058
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.

842
01:07:48,687 --> 01:07:50,689
Viktor.

843
01:07:51,398 --> 01:07:53,441
Viktor.

844
01:07:53,525 --> 01:07:56,111
Oh...

845
01:07:56,194 --> 01:07:58,113
I need your help.

846
01:07:59,281 --> 01:08:02,200
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.

847
01:08:02,284 --> 01:08:04,077
He may not speak your dialect,

848
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,580
but I need you to translate
and help me out.

849
01:08:06,621 --> 01:08:09,499
- I help you? Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.

850
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:10,959
This guy's very upset.

851
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:14,212
Just calm him down
and I'll let you back in the terminal.

852
01:08:14,296 --> 01:08:17,799
No. New York.
No red stamp. Green. I green.

853
01:08:17,966 --> 01:08:19,092
- New York.
- OK, yes.

854
01:08:19,176 --> 01:08:21,178
- You say yes?
- Yes.

855
01:08:21,261 --> 01:08:23,889
- OK. OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!

856
01:08:23,972 --> 01:08:28,101
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you. Go ahead.

857
01:08:28,268 --> 01:08:30,520
Stay out!

858
01:08:46,953 --> 01:08:48,246
So?

859
01:08:48,914 --> 01:08:53,919
OK, tell him in order to export
medicines from this country,

860
01:08:54,002 --> 01:09:00,383
he needs to have the proper form,
a Medicinal Purchase License.

861
01:09:00,467 --> 01:09:02,469
OK? You understand me, Viktor?

862
01:09:24,199 --> 01:09:29,204
He say he bring
the medicine for his father.

863
01:09:34,668 --> 01:09:38,964
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.

864
01:09:39,047 --> 01:09:40,382
It doesn't matter.

865
01:09:40,423 --> 01:09:45,387
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.

866
01:09:57,315 --> 01:09:59,651
He did not know
he need this document.

867
01:09:59,734 --> 01:10:01,903
No one say to him
he need document form.

868
01:10:01,987 --> 01:10:03,280
I'm saying it to him.

869
01:10:03,363 --> 01:10:08,827
He needs to have the form signed by
the hospital who is treating his father.

870
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:11,997
These medicines
have to stay in the United States.

871
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,415
They have to stay here.

872
01:10:30,849 --> 01:10:33,894
He... He's begging you.

873
01:10:33,977 --> 01:10:36,438
I know. I can see that he's begging.

874
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:42,110
I'm sorry, sir.

875
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:48,450
You'll have to take a flight in the
morning. The medicine stays here.

876
01:10:49,618 --> 01:10:51,578
I'm sorry.

877
01:10:55,165 --> 01:10:57,000
Send him down!

878
01:11:02,339 --> 01:11:05,133
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job. Let's go.

879
01:11:10,514 --> 01:11:12,516
Whoa.

880
01:11:13,225 --> 01:11:14,809
Goat.

881
01:11:14,893 --> 01:11:19,773
- What?
- Goat. It medicine is for goat.

882
01:11:20,524 --> 01:11:25,820
- Goat?
- Yes. Medicine is for goat. Goat.

883
01:11:27,572 --> 01:11:29,950
- He said that?
- Yes.

884
01:11:30,033 --> 01:11:31,993
He say...

885
01:11:32,077 --> 01:11:36,039
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".

886
01:11:37,165 --> 01:11:39,918
Why? What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?

887
01:11:40,001 --> 01:11:43,255
- It's not for his dying father?
- No. No.

888
01:11:43,338 --> 01:11:49,052
The... Krakozhia...
The name for "father"...

889
01:11:49,135 --> 01:11:51,596
sound like "goat".

890
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,682
I make mistake.

891
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:03,942
Why are you doing this, Viktor?

892
01:12:04,067 --> 01:12:07,279
Medicine is for... goat.

893
01:12:08,029 --> 01:12:09,614
- No, it's not.
- Yes.

894
01:12:09,698 --> 01:12:11,575
- No.
- Yes.

895
01:12:11,658 --> 01:12:13,869
You read the blue immigration form.

896
01:12:13,952 --> 01:12:14,995
- Blue?
- Yes. Blue.

897
01:12:15,078 --> 01:12:16,997
- Blue?
- Blue. The blue form.

898
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:20,750
The one that says if it's an animal,
he doesn't need the license.

899
01:12:20,834 --> 01:12:25,005
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor. That's very good.

900
01:12:26,882 --> 01:12:29,467
Why are you doing this? Huh?

901
01:12:29,593 --> 01:12:32,554
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.

902
01:12:32,637 --> 01:12:34,973
Look at me.

903
01:12:35,056 --> 01:12:37,017
I was going to help you.

904
01:12:38,768 --> 01:12:42,731
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.

905
01:12:42,814 --> 01:12:45,775
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.

906
01:12:45,817 --> 01:12:49,905
I want to hear him say
who the medicine is for.

907
01:12:49,946 --> 01:12:52,949
Please. Who the medicine is for.

908
01:13:02,792 --> 01:13:07,047
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?

909
01:13:13,762 --> 01:13:17,098
OK. The pills stay. He goes. That's it.

910
01:13:22,312 --> 01:13:24,272
Goat.

911
01:13:25,023 --> 01:13:27,692
Please. For goat.

912
01:13:27,776 --> 01:13:30,028
Medicine for goat.

913
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:32,739
Medicine for goat.

914
01:13:32,822 --> 01:13:34,699
Medicine for goat.

915
01:13:36,785 --> 01:13:39,120
Give him the pills.

916
01:13:39,746 --> 01:13:41,706
Medicine for goat.

917
01:13:43,124 --> 01:13:45,085
Medicine...

918
01:13:55,178 --> 01:13:57,347
Come on now, it's all over.

919
01:13:57,389 --> 01:13:59,349
He love that goat.

920
01:14:02,936 --> 01:14:05,939
Do you think I need an excuse
to put you back in that cell

921
01:14:06,022 --> 01:14:08,024
to keep you there for five years?

922
01:14:08,066 --> 01:14:11,444
You go to war with me, and you go to war
with the United States.

923
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:15,490
Then you'll know why Krakozhians
wait in line for cheap toilet paper

924
01:14:15,574 --> 01:14:18,910
while Uncle Sam wipes his ass
with Charmin two-ply.

925
01:14:27,878 --> 01:14:30,380
There was a 20 man.

926
01:14:30,422 --> 01:14:33,258
Immigration gun was drawn.

927
01:14:33,341 --> 01:14:36,303
The Dixon was ready to fire.

928
01:14:36,386 --> 01:14:39,055
To kill the little man with the pills.

929
01:14:40,098 --> 01:14:45,604
But then someone walks into the room
and stand in front of this little man.

930
01:14:45,729 --> 01:14:49,983
"Put the guns away," the man say.

931
01:14:50,066 --> 01:14:52,527
"Nobody will die today. "

932
01:14:52,611 --> 01:14:54,362
Who?

933
01:14:54,446 --> 01:14:57,282
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us. Who was it?

934
01:14:57,365 --> 01:14:59,284
Who was this man?

935
01:15:05,207 --> 01:15:09,294
Navorski. Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.

936
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:42,118
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.

937
01:15:42,202 --> 01:15:46,998
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules
and concentrate on the people.

938
01:15:47,082 --> 01:15:48,250
The people, I know.

939
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:51,878
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.

940
01:15:54,464 --> 01:15:56,925
You could learn
something from Navorski.

941
01:15:59,135 --> 01:16:02,138
Cheer up. It's not over yet.

942
01:16:28,582 --> 01:16:30,542
- Is that for me?
- Yes. Yes.

943
01:16:30,584 --> 01:16:34,421
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.

944
01:16:35,922 --> 01:16:37,799
For you.

945
01:16:37,883 --> 01:16:39,885
For you.

946
01:16:40,427 --> 01:16:42,387
For wall.

947
01:16:43,263 --> 01:16:45,223
Fish for wall.

948
01:16:51,438 --> 01:16:53,690
Why do you want to go to New York?

949
01:16:54,774 --> 01:16:56,776
And what's in the can of peanuts?

950
01:17:00,447 --> 01:17:01,948
Promise.

951
01:17:02,866 --> 01:17:05,327
- A promise in the can?
- Yes. A promise.

952
01:17:08,205 --> 01:17:10,665
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.

953
01:17:10,749 --> 01:17:14,294
And this is a promise
that comes from a man who is stuck here.

954
01:17:14,377 --> 01:17:16,922
A man who may be stuck here
for the next ten years.

955
01:17:20,467 --> 01:17:24,471
From now on, you and I are partners.

956
01:17:25,388 --> 01:17:28,600
If I stay, you stay.

957
01:17:28,642 --> 01:17:32,771
You will not set one foot
in New York City.

958
01:17:33,772 --> 01:17:37,859
Not a single toe
in the United States of America.

959
01:17:39,194 --> 01:17:41,696
Do you understand
what I am saying to you?

960
01:17:43,323 --> 01:17:45,283
Yes.

961
01:17:46,201 --> 01:17:47,953
You don't like fish.

962
01:18:09,182 --> 01:18:13,019
Do you ever feel
like you're just living in an airport?

963
01:18:20,026 --> 01:18:23,864
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.

964
01:18:23,905 --> 01:18:26,032
I can mail you
anywhere in the US.

965
01:18:26,116 --> 01:18:29,619
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.

966
01:18:29,703 --> 01:18:33,832
- No. I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.

967
01:18:33,915 --> 01:18:36,042
- I do.
- What's her name?

968
01:18:36,126 --> 01:18:37,419
Amelia Warren.

969
01:18:37,544 --> 01:18:40,380
I thought we were looking
for a way out, not a way in.

970
01:18:40,422 --> 01:18:44,050
Be careful. Those flight attendants
ain't like regular women.

971
01:18:44,092 --> 01:18:48,430
Flying back and forth between time zones
messes with their biological clock.

972
01:18:48,513 --> 01:18:52,684
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.

973
01:18:52,767 --> 01:18:56,855
I am leaving.
They will come for us.

974
01:18:56,938 --> 01:18:59,357
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.

975
01:18:59,441 --> 01:19:02,402
You go in jail. Not me.

976
01:19:02,485 --> 01:19:04,446
For... You know what? Forget it.

977
01:19:04,487 --> 01:19:06,281
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?

978
01:19:06,364 --> 01:19:08,116
- Yes. Yes.
- Warren.

979
01:19:08,241 --> 01:19:09,910
Amelia Jane Warren?

980
01:19:09,993 --> 01:19:11,953
- Jane?
- Yeah.

981
01:19:14,289 --> 01:19:16,124
Way to go, Viktor. First class.

982
01:19:16,166 --> 01:19:19,920
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.

983
01:20:01,336 --> 01:20:04,714
Amelia,
would you like to get eat to bite?

984
01:20:06,842 --> 01:20:11,263
Bite to eat? Cantaloni?

985
01:20:20,689 --> 01:20:22,858
Bite to eat?

986
01:20:22,983 --> 01:20:24,943
Bite to eat?

987
01:20:26,361 --> 01:20:28,321
Bite to eat?

988
01:20:31,867 --> 01:20:34,703
Eat to bite? Eat to bite.

989
01:20:34,786 --> 01:20:36,872
Bite to eat.

990
01:20:36,955 --> 01:20:38,206
Bite to eat.

991
01:20:38,290 --> 01:20:39,332
Bite to eat.

992
01:20:39,416 --> 01:20:41,543
Bite to eat. Bite to eat.

993
01:20:41,585 --> 01:20:43,712
Bite to eat. Bite to eat. Bite to eat.

994
01:20:43,795 --> 01:20:46,506
Bite to eat. Bite to eat.
Bite to eat. Bite to eat.

995
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:49,342
Bite to eat. Bite to eat. Bite to eat...

996
01:20:54,723 --> 01:20:58,101
Gupta, you been ever married?

997
01:20:59,311 --> 01:21:02,272
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?

998
01:21:02,314 --> 01:21:08,195
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.

999
01:21:08,278 --> 01:21:10,697
Why?

1000
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:14,993
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.

1001
01:21:15,076 --> 01:21:17,287
Made just enough money to survive.

1002
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:22,584
One day this policeman comes in
and tells me I owe him some tax.

1003
01:21:22,667 --> 01:21:27,130
I said OK.
This is common. So I pay him.

1004
01:21:27,214 --> 01:21:32,052
The next day, the same policeman
come and keep coming and keep coming.

1005
01:21:32,135 --> 01:21:36,139
And I am paying and I'm paying him
and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.

1006
01:21:36,223 --> 01:21:41,728
And finally, on the fifth day, I take
a knife and I stab him in his chest.

1007
01:21:42,562 --> 01:21:47,400
- You killed policeman?
- No. I just missed his heart.

1008
01:21:47,484 --> 01:21:49,778
When they tried to arrest me,
I run away.

1009
01:21:49,819 --> 01:21:53,031
So you never go home?

1010
01:21:53,114 --> 01:21:57,786
If I go home,
I go in the jail for seven years.

1011
01:22:00,288 --> 01:22:04,960
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.

1012
01:22:06,086 --> 01:22:10,632
As long as I keep
my floor clean, keep my head down,

1013
01:22:11,341 --> 01:22:13,677
they have no reason to deport me.

1014
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,972
They have no reason
to notice a man like me.

1015
01:22:18,348 --> 01:22:25,146
United Airlines Flight 2703
from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.

1016
01:22:33,154 --> 01:22:36,032
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

1017
01:22:40,829 --> 01:22:42,831
No, no, no. It's wet.

1018
01:22:47,961 --> 01:22:50,380
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.

1019
01:22:50,422 --> 01:22:52,424
Watch out!

1020
01:22:56,386 --> 01:22:58,054
- Amelia.
- Viktor.

1021
01:22:58,138 --> 01:23:01,099
- Hello.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

1022
01:23:01,183 --> 01:23:02,809
He nearly killed me.

1023
01:23:02,934 --> 01:23:04,895
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

1024
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:09,191
I love the suit.

1025
01:23:09,316 --> 01:23:11,067
Hugo Boss.

1026
01:23:11,109 --> 01:23:13,403
On sale, $1 49.99.

1027
01:23:14,112 --> 01:23:16,448
That's a bargain.

1028
01:23:16,531 --> 01:23:18,491
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.

1029
01:23:18,575 --> 01:23:20,410
And Josephine.

1030
01:23:20,452 --> 01:23:23,914
Do you know what Napoleon
gave Josephine on their wedding day?

1031
01:23:23,955 --> 01:23:25,540
Amelia?

1032
01:23:25,624 --> 01:23:30,420
Would you like to have eat to bite?

1033
01:23:30,462 --> 01:23:32,047
Food. Tonight?

1034
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:34,758
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.

1035
01:23:34,799 --> 01:23:36,635
Yeah. Sure.

1036
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:40,222
- What time?
- Dinnertime.

1037
01:23:40,305 --> 01:23:43,350
- Where do you want to go?
- I know place.

1038
01:23:53,735 --> 01:23:58,240
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.

1039
01:23:58,990 --> 01:24:00,992
This way, please.

1040
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:11,962
Thank you.

1041
01:24:13,713 --> 01:24:16,007
I didn't know they had a patio up here.

1042
01:24:17,175 --> 01:24:19,177
It's very nice.

1043
01:24:38,822 --> 01:24:40,824
Good night.

1044
01:24:44,619 --> 01:24:47,122
Please. Please. Please. Please.

1045
01:24:47,205 --> 01:24:51,793
Sorry. So, tonight we have
cannellonis or chicken.

1046
01:24:51,877 --> 01:24:54,671
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.

1047
01:24:54,713 --> 01:24:56,715
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

1048
01:24:56,798 --> 01:24:58,592
For you, sir?

1049
01:24:58,675 --> 01:25:01,803
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.

1050
01:25:01,887 --> 01:25:03,847
I'll be back.

1051
01:25:17,986 --> 01:25:21,448
Let me see. Enjoy.

1052
01:25:22,949 --> 01:25:25,952
Did you know the croissant
was invented in Romania?

1053
01:25:26,036 --> 01:25:28,747
- Tell me.
- OK.

1054
01:25:28,788 --> 01:25:32,501
It's 1 7 42
and the Turks invade Bucharest,

1055
01:25:32,584 --> 01:25:35,754
making a surprise attack
under the cover of night.

1056
01:25:35,795 --> 01:25:38,381
But the town bakers...

1057
01:25:40,258 --> 01:25:42,219
Sorry.

1058
01:25:59,069 --> 01:26:01,404
So, the bakers?

1059
01:26:01,488 --> 01:26:06,076
- No, never mind. It's a dumb story.
- No, please.

1060
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:07,452
I'm sorry, Viktor.

1061
01:26:07,494 --> 01:26:11,456
Nobody really cares
where the croissant was invented.

1062
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:15,126
I'll bet the Romanians themselves
don't give a shit.

1063
01:26:15,210 --> 01:26:16,545
I care.

1064
01:26:16,628 --> 01:26:19,464
Is histories. Is truth.

1065
01:26:20,549 --> 01:26:23,176
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.

1066
01:26:24,135 --> 01:26:25,637
- Yeah.
- No.

1067
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:28,682
- That's the truth.
- You are not.

1068
01:26:28,807 --> 01:26:34,354
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of
the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.

1069
01:26:34,437 --> 01:26:36,857
I'm 39.

1070
01:26:36,898 --> 01:26:39,442
So? I was 39 once.

1071
01:26:40,694 --> 01:26:44,322
I was 1 8 years old
when I started working for the airlines.

1072
01:26:44,406 --> 01:26:46,992
I've been doing this over 20 years.

1073
01:26:47,033 --> 01:26:49,619
And now there's no more pretending.

1074
01:26:49,703 --> 01:26:51,663
This is it.

1075
01:26:51,705 --> 01:26:56,877
It's why my address book is by city
and my pager goes off during dinner.

1076
01:27:00,338 --> 01:27:03,675
You can switch off pager.

1077
01:27:04,885 --> 01:27:06,386
I wish I could.

1078
01:27:06,469 --> 01:27:10,056
I've been waiting for a phone call
for seven years.

1079
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:14,519
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.

1080
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:20,066
That's why I live out of hotels and have
my little suitcase packed, ready to go,

1081
01:27:20,108 --> 01:27:22,611
just in case
he wants to meet me for the weekend.

1082
01:27:23,778 --> 01:27:25,780
Yeah.

1083
01:27:26,364 --> 01:27:28,366
I've been waiting my whole life.

1084
01:27:31,745 --> 01:27:35,874
Just don't know what the hell for.

1085
01:27:38,084 --> 01:27:40,086
I'm so sorry.

1086
01:27:58,104 --> 01:28:00,524
I live here.

1087
01:28:00,607 --> 01:28:02,734
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.

1088
01:28:02,817 --> 01:28:04,778
Gate 67.

1089
01:28:05,654 --> 01:28:08,782
- You live at the airport?
- Yes. Day and night.

1090
01:28:08,907 --> 01:28:12,494
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.

1091
01:28:12,577 --> 01:28:14,371
So I wait.

1092
01:28:14,454 --> 01:28:17,290
All frequent fliers
feel the same way you do, Viktor.

1093
01:28:17,374 --> 01:28:19,626
Everybody's waiting. Everybody.

1094
01:28:19,709 --> 01:28:24,422
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.

1095
01:28:24,506 --> 01:28:26,967
Then what are you waiting for?

1096
01:28:30,178 --> 01:28:33,181
Is OK. I understand.

1097
01:28:36,685 --> 01:28:38,687
I have an idea.

1098
01:28:39,855 --> 01:28:42,607
- Come here.
- What you do?

1099
01:28:44,901 --> 01:28:46,194
You sure?

1100
01:28:46,278 --> 01:28:48,822
More than anything, I'm sure of this.

1101
01:28:48,905 --> 01:28:50,907
Ready?

1102
01:29:05,881 --> 01:29:05,922
So, when do you come back?

1103
01:29:05,964 --> 01:29:08,967
So, when do you come back?

1104
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:12,387
13 days. How about you?

1105
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:15,182
I will be here.

1106
01:29:15,265 --> 01:29:17,726
But what if your schedule changes?

1107
01:29:17,767 --> 01:29:20,353
Maybe we should
exchange phone numbers.

1108
01:29:20,395 --> 01:29:23,398
No. I will be here.

1109
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:28,862
You know what Napoleon give
to Josephine when he win Bavaria?

1110
01:29:29,613 --> 01:29:31,615
Tell me.

1111
01:29:32,282 --> 01:29:33,742
Come on. Tell me.

1112
01:29:33,783 --> 01:29:38,288
I will show you. 1 3 days from now.

1113
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:48,775
What's he doing?

1114
01:30:48,859 --> 01:30:52,487
I can't ask him. I'm supposed
to tell him what he's doing.

1115
01:30:52,612 --> 01:30:54,489
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.

1116
01:31:12,048 --> 01:31:16,386
I'm sorry. Sorry.
You got to do this for me.

1117
01:31:16,469 --> 01:31:19,848
You'll get really fat
with all the food I'm going to give you.

1118
01:31:19,931 --> 01:31:24,519
But, please, do this for me. It will be
the last thing I ask you to do.

1119
01:31:43,246 --> 01:31:47,209
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.

1120
01:31:51,421 --> 01:31:56,551
- I have to work.
- He will wait.

1121
01:33:00,490 --> 01:33:02,450
- How was your flight?
- Good.

1122
01:33:03,827 --> 01:33:05,787
Thanks.

1123
01:33:09,791 --> 01:33:13,503
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.

1124
01:33:13,545 --> 01:33:16,965
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.

1125
01:33:17,048 --> 01:33:19,009
Please follow me.

1126
01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:21,052
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.

1127
01:33:44,409 --> 01:33:47,662
In my line of work,
there are three things that matter.

1128
01:33:47,746 --> 01:33:52,751
The person, the document and the story.

1129
01:33:54,586 --> 01:33:58,715
Find the truth of one
and you find the truth of all three.

1130
01:33:58,798 --> 01:34:01,134
I need your help finding the truth.

1131
01:34:03,011 --> 01:34:06,181
Do you know a man
named Viktor Navorski?

1132
01:34:06,264 --> 01:34:07,807
Yes.

1133
01:34:08,517 --> 01:34:11,561
Do you know why he's here
and where he's from?

1134
01:34:11,645 --> 01:34:14,481
No. We're just friends.

1135
01:34:14,564 --> 01:34:20,654
Have you noticed that he hides a can
of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?

1136
01:34:20,737 --> 01:34:22,113
So?

1137
01:34:22,197 --> 01:34:24,199
What do you make of that?

1138
01:34:25,951 --> 01:34:28,203
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.

1139
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:34,292
We know that he's planning to go
to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.

1140
01:34:34,334 --> 01:34:36,628
Has he told you why he's in New York?

1141
01:34:36,670 --> 01:34:37,921
No.

1142
01:34:38,004 --> 01:34:41,925
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No. We just met at the airport.

1143
01:34:42,008 --> 01:34:45,929
All I know is that he's a building
contractor, living out of a suitcase.

1144
01:34:45,971 --> 01:34:47,347
That's it.

1145
01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:49,850
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.

1146
01:34:49,933 --> 01:34:51,893
That's what he said?

1147
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:58,859
Amelia. I'm just curious.

1148
01:34:58,942 --> 01:35:03,071
You are the kind of woman
who can get any guy she wants.

1149
01:35:05,782 --> 01:35:07,993
Why Viktor Navorski?

1150
01:35:09,995 --> 01:35:14,457
That's something a guy like you
could never understand.

1151
01:35:37,814 --> 01:35:42,527
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.

1152
01:35:42,569 --> 01:35:44,821
Please. Sit.

1153
01:35:44,905 --> 01:35:47,908
It's OK, Viktor. All men lie.

1154
01:35:47,991 --> 01:35:51,536
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.

1155
01:35:51,661 --> 01:35:55,373
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.

1156
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:59,586
Maybe you see the man
the way you want see the man.

1157
01:35:59,669 --> 01:36:03,882
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?

1158
01:36:04,466 --> 01:36:06,885
- I...
- Unacceptable?

1159
01:36:06,927 --> 01:36:09,221
Yes. Yes.

1160
01:36:09,262 --> 01:36:11,264
You want to hear the funny part?

1161
01:36:12,057 --> 01:36:13,808
I broke up with him.

1162
01:36:13,892 --> 01:36:16,478
I was coming here to tell you
he's out of my life.

1163
01:36:16,561 --> 01:36:20,524
I'm free. I got tired of waiting.

1164
01:36:20,607 --> 01:36:22,567
At least we have that in common.

1165
01:36:27,364 --> 01:36:33,286
Amelia, you know what Napoleon
give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?

1166
01:36:35,038 --> 01:36:36,581
No.

1167
01:36:36,665 --> 01:36:38,792
I show you.

1168
01:36:43,296 --> 01:36:45,257
Please. Please.

1169
01:36:49,177 --> 01:36:51,179
Sit. Please.

1170
01:37:02,691 --> 01:37:07,404
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.

1171
01:37:07,487 --> 01:37:10,073
One thousand fountains.

1172
01:37:11,825 --> 01:37:13,410
You built this for me?

1173
01:37:13,493 --> 01:37:18,373
Please. Sit. Don't get wet.

1174
01:37:28,133 --> 01:37:30,135
Come on.

1175
01:37:31,261 --> 01:37:33,680
Oh...

1176
01:37:33,763 --> 01:37:34,848
It no work.

1177
01:37:34,973 --> 01:37:39,895
It should shoot,
big water up to ceiling.

1178
01:37:41,396 --> 01:37:46,401
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?

1179
01:37:50,322 --> 01:37:52,324
Are you a criminal?

1180
01:37:55,410 --> 01:37:57,162
You're living here, Viktor.

1181
01:37:57,245 --> 01:38:01,208
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.

1182
01:38:01,291 --> 01:38:03,293
Here. I show you.

1183
01:38:15,138 --> 01:38:16,556
My father.

1184
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:19,935
Viktor, please tell me
your father isn't in that peanut can.

1185
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,361
This is jazz.

1186
01:38:35,826 --> 01:38:38,787
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski,

1187
01:38:38,829 --> 01:38:43,708
see this photograph
in Hungarian newspaper 1 958.

1188
01:38:44,918 --> 01:38:47,629
He say he look at photograph
for seven days.

1189
01:38:47,712 --> 01:38:49,714
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...

1190
01:38:50,215 --> 01:38:52,217
Who are they?

1191
01:38:52,342 --> 01:38:55,971
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie,
Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,

1192
01:38:56,054 --> 01:38:58,014
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.

1193
01:38:58,056 --> 01:39:00,559
57 of them all together.

1194
01:39:00,642 --> 01:39:05,188
After looking at photograph
for seven days, my father has idea.

1195
01:39:05,272 --> 01:39:10,277
He begin to write letters to club,
Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.

1196
01:39:10,402 --> 01:39:15,699
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.

1197
01:39:15,782 --> 01:39:17,742
And then he wait.

1198
01:39:18,702 --> 01:39:22,539
He wait month, week, year.

1199
01:39:22,622 --> 01:39:25,625
My father wait 40 year.

1200
01:39:30,172 --> 01:39:32,507
And they all sign names.

1201
01:39:35,635 --> 01:39:37,679
One by one.

1202
01:39:53,403 --> 01:39:58,074
They all write their name
and send it to my father.

1203
01:40:04,539 --> 01:40:06,500
All but not one.

1204
01:40:08,502 --> 01:40:10,295
Benny Golson.

1205
01:40:13,882 --> 01:40:15,884
Saxophone.

1206
01:40:15,967 --> 01:40:21,306
My father die before Benny Golson
write his name and send to my father.

1207
01:40:21,389 --> 01:40:25,227
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.

1208
01:40:29,105 --> 01:40:34,653
I promise I will go New York,
find Benny Golson,

1209
01:40:34,736 --> 01:40:37,614
have him write name to put in can.

1210
01:40:38,532 --> 01:40:42,369
And you've been living here
so you could do this for your father?

1211
01:40:43,078 --> 01:40:45,038
Maybe I think he do it for me.

1212
01:40:51,211 --> 01:40:55,048
You say you are waiting for something.

1213
01:40:56,424 --> 01:41:00,220
And I say to you,
"Yes, yes. We all wait".

1214
01:41:03,723 --> 01:41:05,725
What are you waiting for?

1215
01:41:07,811 --> 01:41:12,023
You. I wait for you.

1216
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:10,415
What?

1217
01:42:14,961 --> 01:42:17,130
The war is over.

1218
01:42:17,214 --> 01:42:20,926
...the right-wing military coup
that ousted President Vagobagin...

1219
01:42:47,452 --> 01:42:50,622
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.

1220
01:42:50,705 --> 01:42:54,584
Let's have a toast to my friend,
Viktor "The Goat".

1221
01:42:56,795 --> 01:42:58,880
May he never lose his country again.

1222
01:42:59,631 --> 01:43:01,091
Krakozhia!

1223
01:43:01,174 --> 01:43:05,136
Amelia! You here early!

1224
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:07,472
Hello. Amelia, look.

1225
01:43:07,597 --> 01:43:10,141
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace. Come.

1226
01:43:10,267 --> 01:43:13,228
See, the war,
the war Krakozhia is over.

1227
01:43:13,311 --> 01:43:15,981
Peace. The war is over.

1228
01:43:19,818 --> 01:43:23,154
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.

1229
01:43:23,238 --> 01:43:26,032
He has a lot of connections. Here.

1230
01:43:26,116 --> 01:43:27,784
It's a pass, Viktor.

1231
01:43:27,826 --> 01:43:30,787
A one-day travel emergency visa
with your name on it.

1232
01:43:30,829 --> 01:43:32,622
- Wha... Visa?
- Yes.

1233
01:43:32,664 --> 01:43:34,875
- From your friend?
- Yeah.

1234
01:43:34,958 --> 01:43:38,920
Just go to New York, find that last name
and put it in the can.

1235
01:43:39,796 --> 01:43:40,881
- I go New York?
- Yes.

1236
01:43:41,006 --> 01:43:42,465
I go New York!

1237
01:43:50,682 --> 01:43:54,144
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.

1238
01:43:57,272 --> 01:44:01,985
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?

1239
01:44:04,029 --> 01:44:06,031
He did it for me.

1240
01:44:08,033 --> 01:44:12,120
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.

1241
01:44:12,204 --> 01:44:16,082
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.

1242
01:44:16,166 --> 01:44:18,793
I not confused... Not this. Not this.

1243
01:44:21,004 --> 01:44:24,799
I'm sorry. I'm running late.

1244
01:44:24,883 --> 01:44:27,928
Amelia. Why you go? Why you go?

1245
01:44:29,387 --> 01:44:32,891
You know what Napoleon
gave Josephine as a wedding present?

1246
01:44:32,974 --> 01:44:35,018
It was a gold locket.

1247
01:44:35,101 --> 01:44:38,438
And on the inside,
he made an inscription.

1248
01:44:43,235 --> 01:44:45,320
"Destiny".

1249
01:44:48,073 --> 01:44:50,075
Destiny.

1250
01:44:52,327 --> 01:44:55,580
...rejoice in the streets
as well as in their local taverns.

1251
01:44:55,664 --> 01:45:00,418
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye
from high atop the parliament buildings.

1252
01:45:00,502 --> 01:45:02,546
It is a clear sign of the power...

1253
01:45:04,714 --> 01:45:07,467
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

1254
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:09,594
I missed you.

1255
01:45:12,764 --> 01:45:14,724
Come on.

1256
01:45:27,612 --> 01:45:29,114
Next.

1257
01:45:29,865 --> 01:45:31,867
Viktor.

1258
01:45:33,785 --> 01:45:37,247
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?

1259
01:45:38,248 --> 01:45:40,250
What do you have here?

1260
01:45:44,379 --> 01:45:46,381
What do you have here?

1261
01:45:56,183 --> 01:45:58,185
Oh, no. It's not signed.

1262
01:45:59,853 --> 01:46:01,688
What?

1263
01:46:01,771 --> 01:46:04,566
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.

1264
01:46:04,649 --> 01:46:09,196
To validate authenticity, it needs
to be signed by the supervising officer.

1265
01:46:09,821 --> 01:46:11,823
Dixon?

1266
01:46:11,948 --> 01:46:13,158
Yes.

1267
01:46:13,241 --> 01:46:15,952
Dixon.

1268
01:46:19,456 --> 01:46:23,376
The war in my country is over.

1269
01:46:24,503 --> 01:46:29,424
Yeah. I know. Congratulations.

1270
01:46:29,549 --> 01:46:31,510
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?

1271
01:46:32,677 --> 01:46:35,055
When you wait so long for one thing?

1272
01:46:36,097 --> 01:46:38,475
One tiny moment.

1273
01:46:38,558 --> 01:46:41,186
I had that moment today, too.

1274
01:46:41,228 --> 01:46:43,522
You see this badge?

1275
01:46:43,563 --> 01:46:47,442
This badge means that I was made
CBP Field Commissioner.

1276
01:46:47,526 --> 01:46:52,531
It means that my authority over the
security of this airport is absolute.

1277
01:46:53,907 --> 01:46:56,326
Your ticket and your passport.

1278
01:46:58,912 --> 01:47:01,331
It's time for you to go home.

1279
01:47:05,252 --> 01:47:08,922
Officer Waylin, please show
Mr. Navorski into the terminal

1280
01:47:09,005 --> 01:47:11,925
and make sure
he does not miss his flight.

1281
01:47:12,008 --> 01:47:14,010
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.

1282
01:47:24,646 --> 01:47:26,648
I think I want go New York City.

1283
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:31,236
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.

1284
01:47:31,319 --> 01:47:34,281
I no more "unacceptable".

1285
01:47:34,322 --> 01:47:37,784
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.

1286
01:47:40,495 --> 01:47:42,497
Are you sure you want to do that?

1287
01:47:44,332 --> 01:47:46,334
I go New York City now.

1288
01:47:51,298 --> 01:47:56,761
Part of my job is to get rid of
undesirables, and there are quite a few.

1289
01:47:57,971 --> 01:48:00,473
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.

1290
01:48:00,557 --> 01:48:04,728
He's been here for 20 years, but he's
been running an after-hour poker game.

1291
01:48:04,853 --> 01:48:06,855
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.

1292
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:10,984
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.

1293
01:48:11,109 --> 01:48:12,152
Yep.

1294
01:48:12,277 --> 01:48:17,157
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.

1295
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:22,245
Enrique has been letting people
into the food preparation area.

1296
01:48:22,329 --> 01:48:24,289
That's a major security breach.

1297
01:48:24,372 --> 01:48:26,500
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.

1298
01:48:26,541 --> 01:48:28,668
But I'm going to have to let him go.

1299
01:48:28,710 --> 01:48:33,423
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.

1300
01:48:33,507 --> 01:48:37,969
But he's wanted for assaulting
a police officer back in India in 1 979.

1301
01:48:39,554 --> 01:48:41,681
I'll have to deport him.

1302
01:48:41,765 --> 01:48:43,725
I will go home.

1303
01:48:44,726 --> 01:48:48,396
- I'm sorry. What did you say?
- I will go home.

1304
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,482
Leave them alone. I will go.

1305
01:48:51,274 --> 01:48:52,943
- Today.
- Yes.

1306
01:48:53,026 --> 01:48:56,071
If you don't get on that plane,
they're all gone.

1307
01:48:56,154 --> 01:48:57,989
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1308
01:48:58,073 --> 01:48:59,699
OK. Good.

1309
01:49:01,368 --> 01:49:03,078
Your attention please.

1310
01:49:03,161 --> 01:49:09,084
Immediate boarding, gate B-20, for
flight number 309 Air Canada to Ottawa.

1311
01:49:13,588 --> 01:49:14,923
I don't believe you.

1312
01:49:15,006 --> 01:49:18,677
- Viktor, you don't have to do this.
- You can fight these guys.

1313
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:21,680
- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on. I owe you so much.

1314
01:49:21,763 --> 01:49:24,766
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.

1315
01:49:24,850 --> 01:49:27,894
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.

1316
01:49:32,482 --> 01:49:33,483
Gupta.

1317
01:49:33,567 --> 01:49:35,151
Goodbye.

1318
01:49:35,235 --> 01:49:38,155
You try to fool us.

1319
01:49:38,238 --> 01:49:42,868
You make us to think you would walk out,
that you will fight with them.

1320
01:49:42,951 --> 01:49:44,619
Why don't you fight?

1321
01:49:44,744 --> 01:49:49,457
- The war is over.
- Then go. Get lost.

1322
01:49:49,541 --> 01:49:54,087
Get lost. Go home
and tell them you never made it.

1323
01:49:54,171 --> 01:49:58,216
You come this close to America,

1324
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:02,512
but you don't have the courage
to go from here to here.

1325
01:50:03,972 --> 01:50:05,807
You are a coward.

1326
01:50:05,849 --> 01:50:08,643
The plane is on time.

1327
01:50:08,727 --> 01:50:11,021
You are a coward.

1328
01:50:11,646 --> 01:50:14,191
You are a coward!

1329
01:50:14,274 --> 01:50:15,942
You make me sick!

1330
01:50:15,984 --> 01:50:19,404
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.

1331
01:50:19,488 --> 01:50:23,450
Got people looking all around,
looking at me like I'm...

1332
01:50:25,744 --> 01:50:27,204
Look at me.

1333
01:50:28,038 --> 01:50:30,040
Come on, look at me.

1334
01:50:34,669 --> 01:50:36,922
There's something you should know.

1335
01:50:40,926 --> 01:50:44,012
Ladies and gentlemen,
United Airlines Flight 865

1336
01:50:44,054 --> 01:50:47,599
from Krakozhia has landed
and is now taxiing to the gate.

1337
01:50:47,682 --> 01:50:51,394
For those passengers holding tickets
for Flight 866 to Krakozhia,

1338
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:53,980
we expect departure
to be on schedule.

1339
01:51:09,871 --> 01:51:11,873
Get back, please.

1340
01:51:21,758 --> 01:51:22,968
Gupta.

1341
01:51:35,272 --> 01:51:37,232
Gupta!

1342
01:52:09,097 --> 01:52:11,099
I am going home.

1343
01:52:15,604 --> 01:52:17,606
Get lost.

1344
01:52:28,658 --> 01:52:30,619
Your attention, please.

1345
01:52:30,702 --> 01:52:35,790
Flight 866 to Krakozhia
will be delayed until further notice.

1346
01:52:44,299 --> 01:52:46,968
Do you have an appointment?

1347
01:52:49,262 --> 01:52:52,098
Somebody tell me
what the hell is going on down there!

1348
01:52:55,060 --> 01:52:57,062
We're right behind you.

1349
01:53:01,316 --> 01:53:02,692
Viktor's leaving.

1350
01:53:17,707 --> 01:53:21,169
- Monica, Viktor's leaving.
- I know. He's going home.

1351
01:53:21,253 --> 01:53:23,755
He's going for the front door,
out to the city.

1352
01:53:23,839 --> 01:53:25,340
What?

1353
01:53:34,891 --> 01:53:36,935
Viktor. Remember us.

1354
01:53:37,018 --> 01:53:39,688
From the Discovery Store,
I want to give you this.

1355
01:53:39,771 --> 01:53:40,897
It's good luck.

1356
01:53:41,022 --> 01:53:42,983
A digital camera for cousin Katia.

1357
01:53:43,108 --> 01:53:46,820
I don't know where you're going,
but these will keep your feet warm.

1358
01:53:55,996 --> 01:53:58,498
- Everybody in position?
- We're here.

1359
01:53:58,582 --> 01:54:00,041
Secure the door.

1360
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:14,181
Sorry, Viktor.

1361
01:54:17,642 --> 01:54:18,768
Take him, Judge.

1362
01:54:20,145 --> 01:54:23,523
Hold it, Viktor. Take it easy.

1363
01:54:25,150 --> 01:54:27,319
You see those doors?

1364
01:54:27,402 --> 01:54:29,946
Those are the entry doors
to New York City.

1365
01:54:30,030 --> 01:54:33,533
To the United States of America.
Turn around.

1366
01:54:43,335 --> 01:54:46,838
It's snowing in the city
and you're going to need that.

1367
01:54:50,884 --> 01:54:51,843
Good luck.

1368
01:54:52,802 --> 01:54:55,805
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

1369
01:54:55,847 --> 01:54:57,474
Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no.

1370
01:54:57,557 --> 01:54:58,850
I'm going to miss you.

1371
01:54:58,934 --> 01:55:01,269
Try not to get stuck
wherever you're going.

1372
01:55:01,353 --> 01:55:03,313
Arrest him! Arrest him!

1373
01:55:03,355 --> 01:55:06,274
Goddammit!

1374
01:55:50,986 --> 01:55:52,654
Taxi!

1375
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:06,835
Thank you.

1376
01:56:46,791 --> 01:56:49,211
Where you go?

1377
01:56:49,294 --> 01:56:54,382
1 61 Lexington. Please take Van Wyck
Expressway to Queensboro Bridge.

1378
01:56:54,466 --> 01:56:56,009
It's faster than BQE.

1379
01:56:56,092 --> 01:56:59,429
- Where you from?
- Krakozhia. Viktor Navorski.

1380
01:56:59,513 --> 01:57:01,806
I'm Goran. Albania.

1381
01:57:01,890 --> 01:57:06,186
- When do you come to New York?
- Thursday.

1382
01:57:15,487 --> 01:57:20,617
You want us to block the south exit
and have AP sweep every vehicle?

1383
01:57:21,618 --> 01:57:23,620
Sir?

1384
01:57:27,874 --> 01:57:30,001
5.30 from Tokyo just landed.

1385
01:57:30,085 --> 01:57:34,214
Got two planes on the tarmac.
Barcelona on approach.

1386
01:57:34,339 --> 01:57:37,759
The night is young
and 1 500 people are headed our way.

1387
01:57:40,095 --> 01:57:43,390
Everybody inside.
Everybody inside.

1388
01:57:43,431 --> 01:57:44,891
Come on, let's go.

1389
01:57:44,975 --> 01:57:46,393
Let's go.

1390
01:58:15,964 --> 01:58:20,594
- Are you checking in, sir?
- No, no. I don't check in.

1391
01:58:20,677 --> 01:58:22,512
I want to go to this place, please.

1392
01:58:22,596 --> 01:58:24,764
The lobby lounge
is around the corner.

1393
01:58:24,806 --> 01:58:28,894
They have happy hour specials
and live music. Do you like jazz?

1394
01:58:28,977 --> 01:58:30,937
The monitor's off.

1395
01:58:35,984 --> 01:58:40,280
The piano's OK. A little more
bass. More bass from the monitor.

1396
01:58:44,284 --> 01:58:48,163
Let's do Killer Joe.
It worked all right last night.

1397
01:58:48,205 --> 01:58:51,166
- Yes?
- You are Benny Golson?

1398
01:58:51,249 --> 01:58:53,627
Yeah. Yes, I am.

1399
01:58:54,878 --> 01:58:59,090
Benny Golson, I am Viktor Navorski.
I am from Krakozhia.

1400
01:58:59,174 --> 01:59:04,763
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski,
was great, great fan of your music.

1401
01:59:04,846 --> 01:59:08,350
A jazz fan. Fantastic.

1402
01:59:08,433 --> 01:59:11,770
Would you sign your name, please?

1403
01:59:11,853 --> 01:59:15,941
Can I do it a little later?
We have to get started now.

1404
01:59:16,024 --> 01:59:17,859
- Just a minute.
- I will wait.

1405
01:59:17,901 --> 01:59:19,861
OK.

1406
02:00:24,551 --> 02:00:26,511
Taxi! Taxi!

1407
02:00:48,992 --> 02:00:51,369
Where you want to go?

1408
02:00:54,122 --> 02:00:56,082
I am going home.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
I don't like people very much. I'm
just not a very nice person.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,500
The world is broken. 

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,000
You shouldn't watch scary movies close to bedtime.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,800
We may dislike Mr Foyle.We do not have to like him
to defend him.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,700
I don't do things for exposure. 

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,800
- Why then?
- Everyone deserves a defence.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,100
Given the press this case has generated,
Mr Foyle cannot be given a fair trial.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,200
I have no alternative but to
discharge the jury

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,600
and release the defendant.

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,300
Will, good man. Thank you, my
friend.

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,000
Pleasure. Take care.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,600
We'll see you up there. But hurry
up, I want to show you something.

13
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,600
Kate?! Jamie!

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,800
Dad! Jamie!

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,000
You're defending him.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,500
- Everyone deserves a defence.
- That's right.

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,300
That's right.

- Dad!! No!
- All right... All right...

24
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:56,800
It's all right, all right. It's OK.

25
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,400
It's all right, it's all right. Shh.
Ssshhhh...

26
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,200
Ssshhhh...

27
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Harris? Trevor Harris. Anyone?

28
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,900
Plea and case management
on Will's case.

29
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,800
Whole thing just got moved up.

30
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,100
- We'll have to change the dates.
- Good.

31
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,300
No, not good at all.

32
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,200
We need all the bloody time we can
get.

33
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,200
We're absolutely sure Will's son
didn't see anything.

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,500
It's just if we had two witness
statements. I mean,

35
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,300
it would take the weight off the
DNA.

36
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,600
- If it comes in.
- This is where we are.

37
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,900
This is what we've have to work
with. Blood, ID, alibi.

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,500
And God help us, a following wind.

39
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,700
No, that's what I'm trying to explain
to you.

40
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,600
Look, my wife does not wear
aftershave

41
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,500
and I am not the least bit interested
in Peter Rabbit collectibles.

42
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,800
So if you want me to join the dots
for you, someone has stolen my wife's identity.

43
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,800
Yeah, well, that's not going to
happen, is it?

44
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Well, you can't talk to her.

45
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,100
Yeah, I already identified her.

46
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,300
I walked into the mortuary and kissed
her face.

47
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,100
Yeah.

48
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,200
Did I scare you?

49
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,200
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,500
I wish things could be different,
but they're not.

51
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,100
Look, if you ever want to tell me
something, anything,

52
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,300
about what happened, I'll be here.
OK?

53
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,500
Just come right out and say it.

54
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,500
I'll be listening.

55
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,100
Yeah?

56
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,500
When it rains, what happens to all
the little animals?

57
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,900
- Do they drown, do you think?
- Mr Foyle.

58
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,400
I used to love it when it rained.

59
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,900
But now I get so sad when it's wet
out cos all I can think about is

60
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,200
all these little bodies clawing and
squeaking at the earth and the mud

61
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,400
and the water and drowning in the
dark.

62
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,000
It's a shame the plants have to
drink. I know they do,

63
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,100
but it's a shame. I get so sad when
it's wet.

64
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,300
Especially after the summer we had.

65
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,900
Mr Foyle, we need to be sure that you
understand your plea.

66
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,400
Is there any evidence that puts me
at the cottage?

67
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,300
You were charged on the basis of
one eyewitness identification.

68
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
- One.
- Yes, one.

69
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
- The son hasn't made a statement.
- Not yet.

70
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,600
Yet.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
You think he saw something?

72
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,700
There's only one witness. That's
what we're dealing with.

73
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
What's that?

74
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,200
Tea.

75
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,400
- What kind of tea?
- My tea.

76
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,500
We also need to talk about your
alibi, Ms Morris.

77
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,600
We go into considerable detail in
our defence statement about our whereabouts that evening

78
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,400
and we are confident she will
support this.

79
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,000
Then why do we need to discuss this?

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,600
Because we need to discuss this.

81
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,800
Mr Burton is the only witness in
this whole case.

82
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,200
So he can't act for himself.

83
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,900
You're well-versed in criminal
procedure.

84
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,900
I did a law course.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,300
- Oh, really, where was that?
- Cambridge.

86
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,900
Anglia Polytechnic University.

87
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,800
We probably cycled past one another
on Silver Street.

88
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,400
- It's a small world.
- Indeed.

89
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,500
Yes, you're right, Mr Burton will
not be in court.

90
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,900
As he's a witness, he cannot act for
the Crown in any way.

91
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,700
It's just that, you know, he kept
beating you, is all.

92
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,000
He's not allowed to be there.

93
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,500
So he just has to watch.

94
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,100
I suppose so.

95
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,100
Besides, it was very dark.

96
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,000
Indeed.

97
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,300
Shame about all those animals,

98
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,200
isn't it?

99
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,400
You have qualms.

100
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,000
I beg your pardon? 

101
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,100
It's your first
big defence. You're working late.

102
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,600
- You have qualms.
- He lost his wife.

103
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,400
If the tables were turned, he would
not hesitate.

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,200
This is how it works.

105
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,200
I just know that if I was Will...

106
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,700
Ah. But you're not him, are you?

107
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,200
Not yet, anyway.

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
All right?

109
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,500
I've probably only got about five minutes.
It's a bit of a crazy morning. 

110
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,700
How's it looking?

111
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,400
Every time I pass the conference room there's
a huge queue of people knocking on the door.

112
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,600
Everyone wants to help, mate.

113
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,200
- Who's leading?
- Mr Mayfield.

114
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,100
Mr Harris is his junior.

115
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,500
Everyone
else was busy.

116
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,700
Any idea what they are running with?

117
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,700
You don't have to say a thing if you
don't want to.

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,900
Forensics found a size 12 boot
print in the garden.

119
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,200
But all Foyle's footwear is a size
nine. No match on the tread.

120
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,800
So as far as I can tell they are all
waiting for the forensics' report.

121
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,400
The crime scene blood. Plus, your ID
of him.

122
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,700
- And?
- I think that's it.

123
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,300
What about his alibi?

124
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,400
His neighbour
said she had dinner with him. 

125
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,300
They
are looking into possible angles.

126
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,900
- What's this woman's name?
- Eileen Morris.

127
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,400
Say that again.

128
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,200
Eileen Morris, right? 

129
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,300
Did a little
rooting around in the old case file.

130
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,600
This is all I could come up with.

131
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,100
He's a bird fancier, if you
remember.

132
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,700
See who's presenting him with that
trophy?

133
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,700
"Parish Council Events Committee
Co-Chair Eileen Morris."

134
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,100
That's all I've got for you I'm
afraid.

135
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,500
There was something else. I'm sure
I've seen her name somewhere else.

136
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,500
Thanks, Bob.

137
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,000
You're welcome.

138
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,900
Foyle's alibi might not be as solid
as they're making out.

139
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,800
How do you know that?

140
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Doesn't seem fair.

141
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,400
Biggest legal brain in the building,

142
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,800
can't even talk to them about your
own bloody case.

143
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,600
No, I can't.

144
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,600
Not directly.

145
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,600
It's not like I am defending him
anymore, is it?

146
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,000
Do you have any idea where the Sandra
Mullins case files are?

147
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,400
I think so, yeah. Big box. Stubbed
my toe on it last week.

148
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,500
Do you think it might be near my
office?

149
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,000
I think it could be.

150
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,800
Mr Harris!

151
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,300
Did you see the Collingwood arson
brief? The private one?

152
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Yes, I caught sight of it as it flew
past me at high velocity

153
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,600
on its way to one of the silks. 

154
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,800
Why
don't you take a page out of Tara's book?

155
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,100
My nose is brown enough already,
thank you.

156
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,500
She does what she has to. Why don't
you do that now and then?

157
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,800
Because
then I'd be like Tara, wouldn't I?

158
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,500
You heading over? 

159
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,000
Foyle's making his
plea. 

160
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,400


161
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,500
How's it looking,
do you think? 

162
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,300
No sign of DNA at the scene,

163
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,200
single eyewitness, recognition under
duress. Not a lot of wiggle room.

164
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,000
Will's boy was there - but if he had
seen something, well,

165
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,100
he would have said something,
wouldn't he?

166
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,300
Mr Harris.

167
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,000
- Don't.Well,stop.
- No, I've been thinking. 

168
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I mean it.

169
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,100
Time to go.

170
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,500
Hi, Jamie, welcome back.

171
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,700
- Are you OK?
- See you. 

172
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,700
- Are you all right?
- All right.

173
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,800
Liam Michael Foyle, you are charged
on this indictment with one count of murder.

174
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,000
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty.

175
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,500
My Lord, given the lack of evidence
at this time we are serving a bail application notice.

176
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,200
- First I've heard of it.
- It was served in good time.

177
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,700
- I thought I gave it to you.
- Well, I read it.

178
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,100
Bail granted, subject to conditions
as per application.

179
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,800
Thank you. Also, I've spoken to the
List Officer who's informed me

180
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,900
a slot is available for a week-long
case on the 31st. 

181
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,100
- Very well.
- Wait.

182
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,800
That's only a few weeks away. It
hardly gives us any time to prepare the evidence? 

183
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
What evidence?

184
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Mr Foyle, you may leave the dock.

185
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,400
All rise.

186
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,500
Never said thank you. Oh, you're
welcome.

187
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,500
See you soon.

188
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,300
Yes.

189
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,600
You're in a lot of trouble.

190
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,400
I made you some crumble.

191
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,200
I must have left my cage open cos
a little birdie just bailed me out.

192
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,200
You shouldn't have done that,
Eileen, really.

193
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,900
It takes half an hour.

194
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,900
That's not what I am talking about.

195
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Oh, please. I was happy to pay.

196
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,900
Welcome home.

197
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,900
Apple or plum? 

198
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,600
Rhubarb. It's in
the fridge at the parish council,

199
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
waiting for you. 

200
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,700
It won't be there
too long, I promise.

201
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
- Lots to be getting on with.
- Oh, sure.

202
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,700
- I fed them every day, just like you asked.
- Good.

203
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
Everybody's hungry.

204
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,500
All right, let's run it again, shall
we?

205
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Post mortem indicates Kate was
strangled before he cut into her.

206
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,500
- The knife entered...
- Any update on the footprints?

207
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,400
Locus is littered with them, all the
wrong size.

208
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
After that, the blade passed through
the trachea...

209
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,300
You don't "pass
through" the trachea.

210
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,700
It's a sawing motion. The core
strength of a fast bowler.

211
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,700
- Gavin!
- One hell of a blood spatter.

212
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,700
Will's here.

213
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
- How the hell did this happen?
- The usual way.

214
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
What? He came in the front door.

215
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,000
Close the bloody folder, will you?

216
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,900
There's pictures of his wife!

217
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,600
- Call ahead if you're going to just turn up.
- I work here, too.

218
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,500
Everyone's behind you, but get
caught trying to influence the case,

219
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
you're jeopardising the enterprise.

220
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,900
You're the only witness. So hands
off. 

221
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,500
Protocol doesn't just need to
be followed,

222
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,400
it needs to be seen to be followed.

223
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,300
I know. I actually studied law.??

224
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,600
??We'd prefer it if you didn't even
come into chambers.

225
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,700
???If I have to stay home one more day,
I swear I'm going to kill somebody.

226
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,100
I need to work. Please?

227
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,400
It was today, wasn't it? The plea?

228
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,600
They didn't call you? 

229
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,400
They should've
called you.

230
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,100
- Talk to me!
- Not guilty.

231
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,300
Remanded where? The Scrubs?

232
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,300
Actually he got bail.

233
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,900
Already in custody, low risk of
absconding.

234
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,900
It's conditional. 

235
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,200
- When was this?
- This morning.

236
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,600
You should really be doing this
through the... proper channels.

237
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,600
- Lend us chewing gum.
- Yeah.

238
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,500
- Did you hear about Dr Foster?
- Yeah.

239
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,800
Dr Foster.

240
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,500
It's Will Burton, Jamie's Dad. Tell
him I'll be there to pick him up?

241
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,500
"He left with Alfie, they said they
were getting the bus together."

242
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
All right, thanks.

243
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,200
- Connor, have you seen Jamie?OK.
- No.No, I haven't.

244
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Mum, anything? 

245
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,500
Is he here? They said
he'd already left.

246
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,900
Why didn't you call me?!

247
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,900
Hi, Pat, is Jamie there? 

248
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,200
- I was wondering if he came home with Alfie?
- Have you tried the library?

249
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,600
- Is that a new phone?
- I got it recently.

250
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,800
Listen to this.

251
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,600
Yeah, I heard it on the radio
yesterday.

252
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,300
Ah, it's my stop. See you. See you
at school.

253
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,200
Did he get off at Alfie's stop?

254
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,500
OK. All right.

255
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,100
No, don't worry. Don't worry. Thanks.

256
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,700
That's it, I'm calling the police.

257
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,200
Jamie?!

258
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,100
Where have you been?!

259
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,000
We went to the
shop.

260
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,500
- Did you talk to anyone?
- No.

261
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,600
Promise me you'll not talk to anyone
you don't know, OK? 

262
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,800
Not on the
street, the playground, not anywhere.

263
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,400
I'm picking you up from school from
now on. OK? 

264
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,600
Every single day. OK?

265
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,100
- Dad!
- Just give me a minute.

266
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,400
- The sea lions of Moscow are horny this time of year.
- Up yours.

267
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,700
Oh, relax.

268
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,000
- Right, come on. Let's go upstairs.
- Why?

269
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,500
Come on, boy.

270
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
Come on.

271
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,900
- Couldn't meet in a park?
- It's the best place to hide, in a crowd.

272
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,100
- In plain sight.
- Plain stupid.

273
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,100
We're just chatting. Two blokes
having a chat.

274
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,900
What do you want to do?

275
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,200
Let's talk football.

276
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,400
I used to love our team. I still
love our team.

277
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,200
D'you know what I think the problem is? 

278
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,800
We're missing our star striker.

279
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,700
No way can he can play. It's against
the rules.

280
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,600
- He can hardly score goals from the bench.
- He can't even watch the match.

281
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,900
- He's forbidden from watching the match.
- Absolutely.

282
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,900
So I am thinking that, from time to
time,

283
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,800
maybe I could get someone to talk to
you about our attacking game. 

284
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,200
- Danny. - The door's over there if you're
feeling uncomfortable. I say a door.

285
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,900
- You need a better goalmouth strategy.
- Christ, don't do that. 

286
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,800
What's the
matter?

287
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,100
What's the matter? What's the
matter?

288
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,000
- Trevor.What's the matter?
- Hi. 

289
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,600
You do know what it is you're
doing, what we're doing, don't you?

290
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
- What is it we're doing exactly?
- We're talking.

291
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,800
About football.Here we are, men talking about
football. 

292
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,600
Nothing wrong with that.

293
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,700
Except when footballers talk about
football before a match

294
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,500
they don't lose their jobs. ??

295
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,100
I know
this is a big ask.

296
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,700
I appreciate you must have been
hoping that Mayfield would pick someone else,

297
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,500
someone more suited,
perhaps, to something like this,

298
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,700
but the fact is, everyone else was
gainfully employed

299
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,600
and, well,I'm just sorry it had to be me.

300
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,400
You're the hardest-working barrister
in the set.

301
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,700
Well, I...Thank you. All the same,

302
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,600
I need to think about it. 

303
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,100
Foyle had
a storage unit.

304
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,700
He told us about it during the Sandra
Mullins trial.

305
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,900
He cleared it out six months before
the murder.

306
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,500
It played no further part in the
proceedings. 

307
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,000
Someone took it on after
him. Eileen Morris.

308
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,400
If something's not turning up it just
might mean you need to look for it somewhere else.

309
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,000
Probatio vincit praesumptionem.

310
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,700
- Thanks for the drink.
- You're welcome.That's for you, by the way.

311
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,400
- What's that?
- Colinwood brief. Mr Spencer's off on holiday.

312
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,600
- Where's he going?
- I haven't decided
yet.

313
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,900
I need to ask you something.

314
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:55,300
In the cottage, you didn't actually
see that man, did you?

315
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,200
It was dark.

316
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,000
Sorry, I shouldn't have asked.

317
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,800
- What?
- "Am I disturbing you?"

318
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,600
- What do you want, Peter?
- "Can you spare an hour tonight?"

319
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,700
- It's late.
- "You didn't answer the
question."

320
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,000
- Tonight's a bit difficult.
- Difficult for all of us, my dear.

321
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,000
Foyle is our client. He's called a
meeting.

322
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,000
"We have a duty to listen."

323
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,800
- "He sounds very interested.
-" Yeah.

324
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,400
"Says he's remembered something."

325
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,000
I said yes.

326
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,200
Straight to voicemail.

327
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,300
Send a clerk round. 

328
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,500
Where?

329
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,700
Harrods.

330
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,200
His house. To his house.

331
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,000
We can't do that.

332
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,900
I'm not staying here all night.

333
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,300
"Hi, it's Kate. I'm not here right
now, but leave a message. Bye."

334
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,100
"Hi, it's Kate. I'm not here right
now, but leave a message. Bye!"

335
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,200
"Hi, it's Kate. I'm not here right
now, but leave a message. Bye!"

336
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,900
"Hi, it's Kate. I'm not here right
now, but leave a message. Bye!"

337
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,100
It's all right. No! It's me, it's me,
it's me.

338
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,200
Jesus. You were half a second away
from an eye patch.

339
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,500
Foyle murdered Sandra Mullins. You
need to know that.

340
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,900
You said otherwise
in court.

341
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,300
I see things differently now. 

342
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,200
If you had reservations you should have
acted on those.

343
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,700
He claimed his innocence and I spoke
for him. I lawyered him out of it, that's all.

344
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,100
But I know he killed her. 

345
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,100
He is a
murderer, there is no doubt. 

346
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,700
We differ on this point.

347
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,300
I mean it. You need to be careful.

348
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,600
You can't stand seeing me do well,
can you?

349
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,700
This is good for me. 

350
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,700
Good for you?

351
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,400
I am truly sorry for what happened
to you, but this is a job.

352
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,000
Work is work. That's it. 

353
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,500
Foyle
murdered Kate.

354
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,000
You let that man in, you are risking
everything.

355
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,700
Don't make the same mistake.

356
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,000
- Goodnight, Will.
- I mean it. Don't be alone.

357
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,700
Did your... Did your friend find
you?

358
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,500
- Friend?
- Yeah, he rang your doorbell.

359
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,900
What makes you think it was my
friend? 

360
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,300
He put your bin bag out.

361
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
She...

362
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,600
- King makes the travel arrangements -
- Blood was all Kate's.

363
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,100
No DNA match to Foyle whatsoever.

364
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,500
What does that leave exactly?

365
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,200
Will's ID of Foyle in the locus,
going for this alibi,

366
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:48,900
and that's it. 

367
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,600
Does that even get you
through the door?

368
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,700
All the same we need to collate some
skeleton arguments on how to beat

369
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,500
a Turnbull Direction should it come
to it. 

370
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,700
That's like arguing with a
tube train in a tunnel.

371
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,800
I don't see they have much choice.

372
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,400
No, well, quite.

373
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,300
Yes, thank you for all your help.

374
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,900
We said we'd be there for him.

375
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
- Yes, well we will be.
- How, exactly?

376
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,900
I think we've missed a trick. 

377
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,400
I've been digging in the old files.
There was a storage unit.

378
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,500
Foyle had one before the Sandra
Mullins murder.

379
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,300
It didn't make it into the evidence
because he'd emptied it six months before.

380
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,100
It was passed on to somebody else.

381
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,900
Want to guess who?

382
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,300
She's his alibi. She cooked him
dinner at her home.

383
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,500
OK...

384
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,800
- You're sure she was paying for this?
- Direct debit ever since.

385
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,900
If we're drawing a blank on the link to
the locus it doesn't mean there isn't one,

386
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,700
it might just mean we're looking in
the wrong place.

387
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,100
Probatio vincit praesumptionem.

388
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,900
Get a call into the OIC for me, will
you? We need a warrant in motion.

389
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,100
In the meantime, let's revisit all we
know about Eileen Murray.

390
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,200
The IOC for you.

391
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,300
It's like he's finally worked out
how to switch on his brain.

392
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
What is it? 

393
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,400
They called me again,
about my statement.

394
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,900
I thought you gave one?

395
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,800
They asked me to clarify it. Again.

396
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,800
And what did you say? 

397
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,200
Well, I told
them the truth.

398
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,800
I told them all about our evening.

399
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,400
Well, there are you, then.

400
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,000
But why did they need to check up on
me like that? 

401
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,700
I don't know.

402
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,500
But there's nothing more to worry
about,... is there?

403
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,000
No, I suppose there's not.

404
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,900
You look freezing.

405
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,900
Why don't you come in for a minute?

406
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,200
- Oh, I just have to pop home first.
- Now, if that's OK.

407
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,100
OK. OK.

408
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,300
You know anything about kettles?

409
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,400
Oh, it's switched off at the wall.
Oh.

410
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,500
These people, these lawyers,

411
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,100
they don't see you.

412
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,700
Did you know that? 

413
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,300
They don't have an ounce of mercy
in them. And I'll be honest, Eileen.

414
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,200
They can be very manipulative.

415
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,100
Eileen, I want to protect you as
best as I can, I really do,

416
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:39,300
but...I need you to be a little more
sure of yourself.

417
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,500
- Sure?
- Of yourself.

418
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,600
Yeah, I think I can do that, yes.

419
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,500
You be you... and I'll be them.

420
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:03,600
Miss Morris, can you tell the court where you were
on the evening of the 3rd of December?

421
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I was at home.

422
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,200
And what did you have to eat?

423
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,800
- Spaghetti carbonara.
- Wrong.

424
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,300
- Er... Con funghi.
- Wrong.

425
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,000
- No, it's not.
- No, it's not.

426
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,500
- Er... I don't... I don't understand.
- Have courage in your conviction.

427
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,400
Don't let them rattle you.

428
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,700
What did you have to eat?

429
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:43,900
- Spaghetti con... fu... um...I'm all confused now.
- Are you, Eileen? Are you confused?

430
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,300
Confused doesn't help us.

431
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,900
Confused makes everything go away.

432
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
Am I hurting you?

433
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,100
Yes.

434
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,900
Am... I... hurting... you?

435
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And what did you make for dinner
that night?

436
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,700
S... Spaghetti Carbonara...

437
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,200
Cup of tea?

438
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,700
Gavin, can I ask your expert opinion
on something.

439
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,300
Yes, of course. 

440
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,600
A barrister can't
coach a witness, correct?

441
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,800
Gross misconduct. He'd be out in a
flash.

442
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,500
What about a witness coaching a
barrister?

443
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:09,400
I have a friend who is displaying
a sudden and surprising burst of talent.

444
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,500
I think he's getting help.

445
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,100
Well, he's not just risking his own
neck.

446
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,800
He's risking his case, his client,
and the reputation of his Chambers.

447
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,200
So, for the sake of your chum,

448
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,200
I suggest you find out what's going
on.

449
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
Thank you.

450
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,100
Did you need to go in the other one?
They're both mine.

451
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,400
- Yes, we will.
- Well, it's a bit of a, sorry, a bit of a squeeze.

452
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,500
Cos this one's mine as well, so...

453
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,800
They found a size 12 boot in the storage unit.
It's a strong candidate to match a tread in the locus.

454
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,200
Foyle's a size nine. Doesn't stop him
wearing a bigger boot.

455
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,700
Forget the alibi, focus on the boot.
Get her on stand and make the connection.

456
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,600
But if we call her as our witness we can't
cross examine her on the alibi, can we?

457
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,600
Her alibi's based on good character.
It's a hard sell to undermine her. 

458
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:55,100
Show in court they have an undisclosed connection
through the storage unit,  her credibility's undermined.

459
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,300
You may not have to do that if you
prove this boot was at the scene.

460
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,200
A big choice. It's bite the bullet
time. That's the way you should go.

461
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,700
Tara's here. Walk away.

462
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,200
- Walk away.
- Prove the link, undermine her. Double bubble.

463
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,100
Oh, and make sure that warrant was
kosher.

464
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,200
Trev! Looking a little bit lost there.

465
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
Tara. Hi.

466
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,500
- What are you doing here?
- Is Danny around? 

467
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,200
Why, have you seen him? Huh!

468
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,400
- How bad?
- "She saw Harris. And she may have seen you too."

469
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,500
So we're burned. We're done. 

470
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
"So what
happens now?"

471
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,600
We cross our bloody fingers.

472
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,600
I'm very sorry.

473
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,800
I crossed a line. 

474
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:37,800
Yes, you did.

475
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,500
I've been so stressed about
everything.

476
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,200
I'm sure you are.

477
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,600
See you later.

478
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,700
It's the first day of trial today.

479
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,600
They'll be arguing about evidence.
Jury's not in yet. You remember the drill.

480
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,100
Probably going to take Jamie up to
the cottage this weekend, go through your stuff. 

481
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,800
It's time. It
might be good for him, you know?

482
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,400
You were always better at that sort of
stuff than me, but we'll see how it goes.

483
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,000
That way it's done before I have to
take the stand.

484
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,700
Everyone's done what they can.
Everyone's been great.

485
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,700
A lot of people really love you.

486
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,100
We'll do our best, OK?

487
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,600
I promise.

488
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,100
Relax. 

489
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,600
So they found a boot. Big
deal.

490
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,000
It's not DNA. 

491
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,200
We stick with what we
agreed. Finalise the evidence.

492
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,200
Eileen will come through for us,...

493
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,900
Mr Foyle?

494
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,900
We had dinner together. She'll confirm that under oath.
So the boot's not a problem? 

495
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,800
Not from where I'm sitting.

496
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,300
Just him and what he says he saw.

497
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,700
As it stands, yes.

498
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,400
As it stands.

499
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,000
You sure you're up for this?

500
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,600
Right.

501
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,600
Shall we start in here?

502
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,700
Hey, come here.

503
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,000
It's all right. It's all right.

504
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,300
It's OK.

505
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,500
- Dad?
- Yeah.

506
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,600
??????

507
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,200
You can do whatever you want with
them. 

508
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,200
I might do the same myself.

509
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,000
You? On eBay? You're rubbish with
computers.

510
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,900
Yes. Me. What?

511
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,900
There's no way. No way.

512
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,400
You can't even turn a computer on.

513
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,700
I mean, I would eat my hat.

514
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,200
And I don't even have a hat.

515
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,000
Dad?

516
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,400
Mum said it was a surprise.

517
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,600
A nice surprise.

518
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,200
Speed-dial five, would you, please?

519
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,300
- What's going on?
- I need to speak to someone, then we'll come back. 

520
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,900
Ready to dial?

521
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,800
- ???Can we go back now?
- Press five on that phone and hold it down.

522
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,700
- "Hello."
- When were you planning on telling me?! 

523
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,600
- "Will?"
- When he was in jail? 

524
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,000
- "Listen..."
- Never? 

525
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,100
Were you just going to send me 
an ultrasound in the post?

526
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,600
"Are you driving?" I want a meeting
with everyone tonight. You, Gavin, the coroner.

527
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,500
- Everyone!Hang up.
- "Listen to me."

528
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:21,700
Sorry, Jamie.

529
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,100
Jamie?

530
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,600
I should have fought him harder.

531
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,000
It's my fault. I'm sorry. 

532
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,200
I should've tried again.

533
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,500
Jamie, what are you saying?

534
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,400
I scratched his head.

535
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,200
You scratched him with your hands?!

536
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,900
- And then I hid.
- You were in a box by the door.

537
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,000
Not the first time.

538
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,400
- You moved?!
- Dad, look out!

539
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,000
I'm sorry.

540
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:21,800
Me too.

541
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,600
I just need you to take a nice deep
breath, OK?

542
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,300
And now I want you to explain to me
exactly what happened.

543
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:54,700
- Yep.- "Maggie, Peter. Forensic team just
found DNA at the cottage."

544
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,500
- Foyle's? - "Mmm. The boy moved, they
found a sample under the sink."

545
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,200
Get on the phone and get Maggie!

546
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,500
I want my legal team, not you,
Simpkins!

547
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,700
You're driving me up the wall. I
can't hear you speak anymore!

548
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,100
"DNA it is, Mr Foyle. It's DNA!"
What does DNA mean?!

549
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,200
Get Maggie here now!

550
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,700
"15th Floor. Doors opening."

551
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,600
What kind of DNA is the DNA that
we've got?!

552
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,800
Where did this DNA come from,
Mr Simpkins!

553
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,900
"I can't tell you, Mr Foyle."Is it from hair,
Mr Simpkins? Is it from semen?!

554
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,000
You've locked him in? 

555
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,500
He said he'll
only speak with you.

556
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,400
- You've locked him in?
- Correct.

557
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,300
We were discussing his alibi. Then
the conversation drifted to the new DNA evidence. 

558
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,200
And you let it?

559
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,900
It's only a low sample. Manifestly
unreliable if we do our job properly.

560
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,400
- He's not going to see it that way, is he? 
- I suppose not.

561
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,200
It puts me there.

562
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,400
- You're concerned about the DNA.
- It puts me in that cottage.

563
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,500
It puts me "at the locus", Margaret.

564
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,300
And now they think it's me.

565
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,000
They might think it says you were in
the cottage... 

566
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,300
Is this how it's
going to be? 

567
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,200
Here on in.

568
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:27,200
Do you think I enjoy spending my
life sitting in an airless room with his coffee breath?

569
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,700
It's like an infernal machine.
It chews you up.

570
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,300
Doesn't speak. Doesn't listen.
Just keeps moving forward.

571
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,800
There's nothing you can do!

572
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:39,800
OK,

573
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,500
- we need to back up for moment.
- We?

574
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,800
We have a very clear alibi.

575
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,700
We?

576
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,300
You love it, don't you. "We".

577
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,400
We are one and the same.

578
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,300
In terms of this trial, our fates
are intertwined.

579
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,900
But "we" don't go to prison. Do we?

580
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,500
We were not in the cottage.

581
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,300
No,... we... weren't.

582
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:16,000
So, we need to work out why the DNA
would say that.

583
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:21,800
But it's science. And you can't
argue with science.

584
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,500
I can, Mr Foyle.

585
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,400
In fact,

586
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,000
I can be very persuasive.

587
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,200
Good.

588
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,200
Be upstanding in court.

589
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:51,600
Mr Burton, I know this is going to be hard for you given
the circumstances, so please take your time.

590
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,000
I saw him through the window.

591
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,400
Him being?

592
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Liam Foyle. 

593
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,300
He was known to you?

594
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,800
Yes. I'd just defended him in a
criminal trial.

595
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,500
How often would you say you saw him
during that period? 

596
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,000
Almost daily.

597
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,000
Over the trial period, six months.

598
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,500
Is there any doubt in your mind
whatsoever

599
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:17,600
that the man you saw during those times was the same man
you saw staring at you through the kitchen window?

600
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,600
None whatsoever.

601
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,400
Ms Gardiner?

602
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,000
Mr Burton, you are a practising criminal
defence barrister, are you not? 

603
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,200
Yes.

604
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:43,600
If a situation arises where a case
against an accused

605
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,900
depends to a great extent on the
identification of the accused,

606
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:51,200
is there a warning the judge should
give the jury? 

607
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,700
Yes.

608
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,500
- What is that warning called?
- It's called a Turnbull Direction.

609
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,500
In your professional opinion, 

610
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,700
is it important for the judge to warn the
jury of the need for caution

611
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:06,600
before convicting anyone in any case
that relies so heavily on eyewitness identification? 

612
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,600
Yes.

613
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:12,100
Should the judge, in that situation,
ask the jury to closely examine

614
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:15,600
every circumstance in which the
identification was made?

615
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,200
- Yes.I can list them for you if you like.
- Would... 

616
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,600
No, thank you, I'm more than capable
of recalling them on my own.

617
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,700
When you found her body, who did you
see in the window?

618
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,900
I saw Liam Foyle.

619
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,300
- You had "no doubt whatsoever" it was him.
- Yes.

620
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,100
There was a second individual present
at the time Kate Burton was killed, wasn't there?

621
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,600
Mr Burton?

622
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,200
Yes.

623
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,900
This would be your son James, is
that right? 

624
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,100
Yes.

625
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:54,000
According to his statement, he was
unable to make "any identification

626
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,800
of the attacker whatsoever." Is that
right?

627
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,400
He's nine years old. He was hiding in
a box. 

628
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,900
So if I might ask again.

629
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,200
Is it your understanding that he was
not able to identify the attacker?

630
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,200
Yes.

631
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:14,200
So 50 percent of persons present were not able
to give a positive identification of the attacker.

632
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:21,500
Mr Burton, when a jury convicts, is
it beyond all doubt? Is... Is that the term?

633
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,600
- Reasonable doubt.
- Beyond reasonable doubt.

634
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,500
Now let's have a think about what
might be reasonable in this situation, shall we?

635
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:40,500
- When you saw the man you are
alleging was the accused, Mr Foyle, was it dark? - Yes.

636
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,600
- Were you under stress?
- Is that a serious question?

637
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,300
She was pregnant, did you know that?

638
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:46,500
Mr Burton.

639
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,400
- My Lord.
- Part Seven, Code of Conduct.

640
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:54,100
Please try and remember that you are
a witness and not counsel in this case, Mr Burton.

641
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,900
I am fully aware of the tragic
circumstances we have surrounding us

642
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:03,800
and I am keenly aware of Mr Burton's
incomprehensible loss, but in the case we have before us,

643
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:08,200
Mr Burton's distress cannot be avoided
if my client is to be givena fair trial.

644
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:09,800
Very well then.

645
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,900
When you saw the man in the garden,
were you under stress in any way?

646
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,200
Yes. 

647
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,800
What is a Bar Standards
complaint?

648
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:30,600
It's a formal letter listing a
complaint against a practising barrister.

649
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,000
Have you ever received such a
complaint?

650
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:35,400
I have.

651
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,100
Can you tell us who wrote that
complaint?

652
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,200
- A former client of mine wrote it.
- His name, please?

653
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,400
Liam Foyle.

654
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:58,800
In a dark room, in the shock and trauma of
finding your wife in a pool of blood on the floor,

655
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,900
holding her in your arms, still
unclear as to where your son was,

656
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,500
you look up at the window and you
see a man,

657
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:10,500
a man who recently had been given
cause to make a serious complaint 

658
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,200
against your conduct to the Bar Standards Board,

659
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,400
a man whose absence from your life
would be very useful indeed.

660
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:21,000
But it wasn't that man, was it,
Mr Burton?

661
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,400
You just wanted it to be.

662
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,000
- ????Stop her.
- A bit late for that. 

663
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,200
- She's twisting the facts to make them wrong.
- Doing a good job of it too.

664
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,500
If Defence had a problem, they
should've argued it at the time. 

665
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,300
The
issue has just come to light.

666
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,000
There's compelling evidence!

667
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,800
Can I come round tonight, please?
I'm freaking out.

668
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,200
How did he know? There's no way he
could have known.

669
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,400
When you killed her, did she die
quickly?

670
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,900
How do you live with yourself?

671
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,800
You had us all worried for a minute.

672
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,400
I'm just full of surprises.

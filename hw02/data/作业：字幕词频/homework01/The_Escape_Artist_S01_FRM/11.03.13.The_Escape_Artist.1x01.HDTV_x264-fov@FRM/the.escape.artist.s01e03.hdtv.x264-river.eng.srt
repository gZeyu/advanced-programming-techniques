1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Thank you, my friend.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,100
Pleasure. Take care.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,600
You shouldn't watch scary movies
so close to bedtime.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,300
Kate? Jamie!

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,900
Dad!

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,400
You're defending him.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,700
You know as well as I do, for good or bad,
everyone deserves a defence.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,600
Mr Burton will not be in court.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,900
As he's a witness, he cannot act
for the Crown in any way.

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,400
So he just has to watch.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,600
Foyle had a storage unit.
Someone took it on after him.

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,700
If something's not turning up,
look somewhere else.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And what did you make for dinner
that night?

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,700
Spaghetti carbonara!

15
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,800
- I should've fought him harder.
- What are you saying?

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,300
- I scratched his head.
- With your hands?

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,200
- And then I hid.
- You moved?!

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,200
- "The forensic team just found DNA
at the cottage."

19
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,200
Foyle's?

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,400
"They want to meet."

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,800
In the trauma of finding your wife,
you look up and see a man

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,800
whose absence from your life
would be very useful indeed,

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,300
but it wasn't that man, was it,
Mr Burton?

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,600
You just wanted it to be.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,500
Thanks

29
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,700
- Morning!
- Good morning, Doctor Lambert.

30
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,600
Sorry I'm late.

31
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,300
Remind me...

32
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,300
- Low-count DNA. Kate Burton.
- Oh, yeah.

33
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,300
They'll try and trip you on the
low count. Keep your answers simple.??

34
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,800
Thanks for the tip. I've only done
this three or 400 times.

35
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,300
Did this analysis prove conclusively

36
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,100
that the DNA discovered in the cottage
matches that of a particular individual?

37
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,400
It did.

38
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,200
Whose DNA did the sample match?

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,400
We matched the sample
to the DNA of Mr Liam Foyle.

40
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,100
We are very stringent about our quality controls.
We take our job extremely seriously.

41
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,700
That is very reassuring.

42
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,000
Were you responsible for analysing DNA samples
in connection with Crown vs Foyle last year?

43
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,500
I believe so.

44
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,200
You believe so?

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes, we were.

46
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,500
And in order to do that,
samples of my client's DNA would've been sent to 

47
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,400
and processed
by your lab, is that correct?

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,900
- Well, yes, there's a
 - Thank you.

49
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,400
So my client's DNA, at that time,

50
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,700
would've been effectively distributed throughout
that lab like dust through an old house?

51
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,300
- My Lord!
- I take it this is leading somewhere?

52
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,800
I'm just arriving now, My Lord.

53
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,200
Dr Lambert, I have a sworn statement
from your laboratory

54
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,700
that confirms a deep clean was performed in
all clean-room areas on the 12th of this month.

55
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,500
You brought the schedule forward.
Why was that?

56
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,400
Oh, come on!

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,700
Mr Mayfield...

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,300
Dr Lambert, if you please...

59
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,300
We conduct regular cleaning.

60
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,700
We recently decided to increase
the number of cleans -

61
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,600
Why was it brought forward

62
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,300
??Your cleaning schedule is normally
enacted on a regulated basis,

63
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,200
so something must've happened.

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,500
It was necessary. 

65
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,400
Are you or are you not in the process
of an internal investigation

66
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,500
into the viability of contaminants
within the laboratory?

67
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,800
Please answer yes or no.

68
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,300
But you can't answer...

69
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,100
Yes.

70
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,300
Are you concerned
about your failure rate?

71
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,300
Am I...? Everyone's concerned
about their failure rate!

72
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,700
- It's an industry-wide concern!
- Thank you.

73
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,500
My Lord, this is new information.

74
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,400
It should've been disclosed,
certainly.

75
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,400
What's clear beyond doubt is,
this evidence is utterly compromised.

76
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,600
You have to stop her.

77
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
It's a wee bit late for that.

78
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,800
She's twisting the facts around
to make them wrong.

79
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,100
Doing a good job of it, too.

80
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,800
If we don't have this DNA,
then what do we have?

81
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,700
A problem.

82
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,800
Spaghetti carbonara and an Arctic roll for afters.

83
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,000
Miss Morris,
that's a matter for defence counsel.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,400
All I want to ask you about
is the search of your storage unit,

85
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,900
not the defence alibi,
such as it is.

86
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,300
- Please stick to the matter at hand.
- My Lord!

87
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,200
Get on with it, Mr Mayfield.

88
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,200
Miss Morris, you maintain a contract
with this storage facility?

89
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,700
I do, yes.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,600
And when these premises
were searched by the police a few days ago,

91
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,000
a pair of size-12 boots
was recovered from your unit,

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,300
- isn't that right?
- Yes, er, the other unit.

93
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,500
Are these your boots?
They seem rather large for you!

94
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
What other unit?

95
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,400
My Lord, this is new information!

96
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,700
???Which was given to my learned friend
yesterday.

97
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,100
Chain of continuity, My Lord...

98
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,300
Usher.

99
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,800
The warrant was for Eileen Morris's
possessions in the storage unit.

100
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,000
They had no authority to search F38.

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,800
- If...
- Only F37.

102
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,300
The search of F38 was unlawful.

103
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,300
If defence had a problem with the evidence,
 they should've argued it at the appropriate time.

104
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,400
The issue has only just
come to light.

105
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,800
Foyle's previous use of F37
connects him to it. 

106
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,500
It falls within
the chain of continuity.

107
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,800
F38 was entirely separate!

108
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,000
Judge, obviously I ask you to exclude
this evidence under Section 78.

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,800
It was the unit next door! It...

110
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,400
And should you request,
I will no doubt accede.

111
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,100
Then, I respectfully submit,
My Lord,

112
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,400
there is no case to answer.

113
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,100
- In the absence of any viable evidence -
- There is compelling evidence!

114
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,400
The eyewitness evidence
of a broken man,

115
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
alone and devastated in the dark...

116
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:53,300
Having heard arguments from counsel as to the
strength of the evidence at this stage of the trial,

117
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,300
I have concluded the following...

118
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,600
There is insufficient evidence for the case to continue
for your consideration.

119
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,100
For that reason, on my direction,
you will return a verdict of not guilty.

120
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,500
On His Lordship's direction,

121
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,700
do you find the defendant
not guilty?

122
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,100
Not guilty.

123
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,600
And is that the verdict of you all?

124
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Yes.

125
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,900
All rise.

126
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,600
Mr Foyle, you may leave the dock.

127
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,100
Congratulations.

128
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
Oh, thanks.

129
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,700
Margaret...

130
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Thank you, my friend.

131
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,900
Pleasure. Take care.

132
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,400
Are you all right there, mate?

133
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,500
Sorry, my foot slipped.

134
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,900
Are you all right? Yeah?

135
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Jamie...

136
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,500
Ah, she blows! Pull!

137
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,800
A consummate performance.

138
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,700
First class.

139
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
This is for you.

140
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
I believe you've earned it.

141
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,800
Pretty juicy, too!

142
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,300
Ooh! Thank you.

143
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
Vadim! 

144
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Excuse me.

145
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Mr Will.

1
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,800
You're looking well.

2
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,800
I'm sorry to hear about your wife.

3
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,900
- Thank you.
- If there is anything I can do for you...

4
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,700
What time do you finish work?

5
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,000
I clone it fast.

6
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,600
The name you wanted - Beinn Alligin.

7
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,600
Hi. 

8
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,100
Look, sorry,
I just wanted to come and...

9
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,300
I'm not sure why I came, actually.

10
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,300
Was that who I think it was?

11
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,700
I thought you'd be out celebrating.

12
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
No, just...

13
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,400
I'm sorry.

14
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,500
- It's just...
- Your job.

15
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,100
Look, no hard feelings.

16
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,600
- By which I mean -
- Watch yourself, Maggie.

17
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,900
Can I...

18
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,700
Can I come round tonight, please?

19
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,100
I'm freaking out!

20
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,200
"I think this is
most inappropriate."

21
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,800
Oh, come on, think...!

22
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,600
How did he know?
There's no way he could've known!

23
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,200
"If you're that concerned, I suggest
you call the police." 

24
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,000
Oh, God!

25
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,800
Oh, God, I've just completely...

26
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,900
We have a window for appeal.

27
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,200
- Ohh!Come on!
- Maybe not now, but... 

28
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,200
- No, optimism was never...
- Forget it. We lost.

29
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,400
It's over.

30
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,100
Will!

31
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,900
Are you coming?

32
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,500
I never knew about this place.

33
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,900
Yeah, Kate's cousin lets us
use it every now and again.

34
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Cracking bottle of wine inside,
if you're interested?

35
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
??It took some real sleuthing to find
you. 

36
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,100
You know my methods, Watson.

37
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,700
Red or white?

38
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,600
Er... You chose.

39
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,100
Huhh! How are you, Danny?!

40
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,800
All the better for seeing you, mate!

41
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,100
Pop those in the pot, would you?

42
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,700
That's alive, alive-O.

43
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,900
Now you're talking.

44
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,700
Ah, here! You pasta, me sauce.

45
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,500
Don't you need a permit for those?

46
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,600
Public right to fish in tidal waters
- Malcomson v O'Dea, 1863,

47
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,900
before that, the Magna Carta.

48
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,800
To be fair, it's not mentioned
at all in the Magna Carta,

49
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,800
everyone just thinks it was.

50
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,700
So strictly speaking, right now,
we just broke the law.

51
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,300
- Well, to be precise, you did!
- Except now, you're an accessory.

52
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,500
What about me?

53
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,700
Probably just a caution. 

54
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,300
- Thanks!
- You're very welcome!

55
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,600
Stop crying and pour some wine.

56
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,300
Not even a civil suit!

57
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,300
We're not going in that direction.

58
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,300
Even if we get him, no-one wins.

59
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,800
It's not going to bring her back.

60
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,900
So, we're just going to sit here,
then?

61
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,200
Are you keeping busy?

62
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,800
I've been offered Chambers Manager
at Citadel.

63
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,300
Manchester.

64
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,400
You do know what they do
to QPR supporters there, don't you?!

65
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,200
I'm sorry you had to take that fall,
Danny.

66
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,400
You had us all worried for a minute,

67
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,800
disappearing like that.

68
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,200
Why's that?

69
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,200
You always seem so planned.

70
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,000
You haven't seen the school run.

71
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I mean, it's not like you to do
anything on the fly.

72
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,000
Well, that's me all over, Danny.

73
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,500
I'm just full of surprises.

74
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,100
How long does it take
to get to Edinburgh?

75
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,400
Ten minutes, the way you drive.

76
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,200
Try not to take off, OK.

77
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,800
I'll be back as soon as I can.

78
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,600
Look after Granny for me.

79
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,400
Dad...

80
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Yeah?

81
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,700
You're shaking.

82
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,200
Look, I mean, if you really were
thinking of coming here,

83
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,900
we'd, obviously, be very interested
in having you join the set.

84
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,100
No, I'm actively looking. My family
needs a change of scene so...

85
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,600
Oh, well, for families,
it's a lovely place!

86
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,200
You should rent a car and drive
around a bit while you're here,

87
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,700
see the scenery.

88
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,700
I might just do that.

89
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,800
What would you like?

90
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,100
Hi. Do you mind if I use your loo?

91
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,000
Thanks.

92
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,200
What's the law on home invasion
these days? I'm a little cloudy.

93
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:30,300
What's a proportionate response
to someone surprised in their home by a stranger?

94
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,700
I need to ask you something.

95
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,500
I'm on Facebook.

96
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,900
I know.

97
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,900
Well,

98
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,600
you're here now,

99
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,100
so you can ask me whatever you like.

100
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,500
When did you decide to kill my wife?

101
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,500
Please, I need to know.

102
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,500
When you killed her,

103
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,100
did she die quickly?

104
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,500
Are you playing a character?

105
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,100
Are you?

106
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,500
Are you all the way up there,
looking all the way down here?

107
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,300
And do you think
I'm a little bit stupid?

108
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,700
You're going about this all wrong.

109
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,100
Well, you're the expert.

110
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,100
"When did you decide
to kill my wife?"

111
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,100
You and your brain!

112
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,400
Have you ever seen a brain up close?

113
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,900
It looks like a cauliflower.

114
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,700
The neural cortex looks like icing.

115
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,700
They say it's what separates us
from the animals.

116
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,000
But we are animals. We're mammals.
Like a lion.

117
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,400
You wouldn't blame a lion
for being a lion, would you, Will?

118
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,100
Especially if you were the one
who let him out.

119
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,900
How do you live with yourself?

120
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,500
I forgive myself.

121
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,500
How do you live with yourself?

122
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,300
You're very clever!

123
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
My pen...

124
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,900
Get the pen!

125
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,900
Ambulance.

126
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,300
- "It's an oval tube."
- Oval tube! Yes! Yes!

127
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,400
- It's sort of grey with an orange end.
- "That's it."

128
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,500
I'm putting you on speaker.

129
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,600
Can you still hear me? 

130
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,200
- "Yes.??Are you holding the tube?"
- Yeah.

131
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,200
- "Now put your fist around the tube."
- OK.

132
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
"Hold the orange tip near the thigh."

133
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,200
He has his trousers on!

134
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,300
"The needle will go through.??

135
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,000
"Hold the orange tip near his thigh,

136
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
"with your other hand, pull off
the blue safety release." 

137
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:31,200
- Done it - "Now, swing and firmly push the tip
against the thigh until it clicks.

138
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,700
"Hold it there for ten seconds.
Did you get that?"

139
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,500
Swing, click, wait. OK. Here goes.

140
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,800
What was that?

141
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,700
"You probably heard the needle
mechanism. It's spring-loaded."

142
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,700
- OK. - "The drug in the EpiPen should keep him steady
till the ambulance gets to you.

143
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,200
-Are you still with me?
-Yeah. I'm here.

144
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,200
"You're doing great."

145
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,100
What now? 

146
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,800
OK, you can take it out.

147
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,900
"Look at the barrel. Is there
a red strip visible on the barrel?

148
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,900
"That will tell you
that the drug went in.

149
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,200
r, hang on.

150
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,300
Hang on.

151
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,300
I can't see it!

152
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,300
"Just above the writing,
there's a window."

153
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,400
Oh, yes! Yes, yes, yes, it's there!

154
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,200
"Is the patient responding?"

155
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,300
"Sir? Sir? Hello?

156
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,700
"Anybody hear me?

157
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,100
"Hello?

158
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,900
"Anybody there?

159
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,200
"Hello, sir?

160
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,100
"Can you hear me?"

161
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,000
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, just a bit of smoke.

162
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,400
- Just the two of you up there?
- Yeah.

163
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,200
Showing vasodilation.
Capillary leak.

164
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,800
Is he going to be OK?
Bad shoulder bleed here.

165
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,000
Let's concentrate on his breathing.
Here we go.

166
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,500
You're going to be all right.
We're the paramedics.

167
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,700
You'd better come with us.

168
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,600
No, my car's -

169
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,800
No, mate, we can't leave you.

170
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,700
You're going to come with us.

171
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,700
Bring that green bag, please.

172
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,500
One, two, three, lift!

173
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,300
OK, let's go. Let's go.

174
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,400
Lucky your friend was there.
He used your EpiPen.

175
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,000
We've got some more adrenalin ready.???

176
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,600
Everything is OK. 

177
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,400
I know
your breathing's not that easy,

178
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,300
but we'll be in the hospital
in five minutes. 

179
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,600
??Hang on there.
Just open your eyes.

180
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,700
Chest compressions!

181
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,700
OK, we've got one milligram
of adrenalin.

182
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,400
OK, well done. All right, mate...

183
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,600
Mind if I open a window?
I think I'm going to be sick.

184
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,100
He's arrested in the back!

185
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,100
Arrested!

186
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,100
William Burton?

187
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,100
Will you come with me, please?

188
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,800
Did you and Mr Foyle
have any interactions?

189
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,600
Yes.

190
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
He attacked me and I stabbed him.

191
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,000
With this...

192
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,000
Quite a shock, don't you think?

193
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,700
What is?

194
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,100
He's dead?

195
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,700
Keep reading.

196
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,700
Excuse me. 

197
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,000
Erm, does Vadim Kumarin
still work here?

198
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,900
Do you know where he might be?
Do you know...

199
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,700
OK.

200
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
Thank you.

201
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,400
Welcome to Scotland.

202
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,000
Oh, is that where I am?! 

203
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,500
I wondered
why everyone was Scottish.

204
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,700
Some good news from the Fiscal.

205
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,600
They'd recommend acceptance if you offered
a Section 76 plea of culpable homicide.

206
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,300
Probably a 30 percent discount
on sentence.

207
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,700
That's nine years at most.
Out in six.

208
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,900
And that's good news because...?

209
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Because you're in serious trouble.

210
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,300
If you're thinking of going
not guilty, that's a murder trial!

211
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,400
The Crown's going to be all out
for your blood.

212
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,000
Look, I typed up a draft plea offer
for you.

213
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,600
This is a choice.

214
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,800
You've got life, with a minimum
of 20 years for murder,

215
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,300
or sign the offer, do six years
and see your son finish school,

216
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,700
instead of missing the whole thing.

217
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,400
I'm not missing a single second!

218
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,200
Don't be like this. Come on.

219
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,500
You need to seriously consider this.

220
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,800
- Do you think I did it?
- No!

221
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,700
No.

222
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,000
Of course I don't.

223
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,200
Make sure you recycle that.

224
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,500
I appreciate you coming down, Jen,
but I think I'll do it myself.

225
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,100
You can't. 

226
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,300
I can. In fact, I can do all of it myself.

227
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,400
No, you can't!

228
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,000
This is Scots law, idiot.

229
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,400
- There's a thousand differences.
- Renton Brown, right?

230
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,500
That's a punchy read.

231
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,900
You've always been there for me,
and I'm sorry,

232
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,400
but this isn't going to work out.

233
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,200
What do you think you are doing?
Eh?

234
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,700
- I'm trying to help you here!
- I know.

235
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,000
Thank you,

236
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,500
but I'll take it from here.

237
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Court!

1
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,500
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,700
the charge on the indictment is that,
on the 23rd of March,

3
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,500
at a house near Kielder Forest
in Scotland,

4
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:02,900
William Burton
did assault Liam Michael Foyle

5
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:07,500
and did stab on the body with a knife
containing thereon a substance,

6
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,800
knowing that this would cause
severe injury, anaphylaxis

7
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,600
and death to the recipient,

8
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,800
and he did murder him.

9
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:21,300
Call the diet
of Her Majesty's advocate against William Burton.

10
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,200
We have no opening speeches
in Scottish courts, Mr Burton,

11
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,300
just in case you were planning on
making one at this stage.

12
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,100
Oh. Really?

13
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,800
Mr Burton, you know you have been strongly advised
against representing yourself.

14
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,500
It's been made very clear, My Lord.

15
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,700
Very well.

16
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,200
Er, can I move my papers
to the table?

17
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,600
No.

18
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,200
I can't very well run my case
from the dock, can I?

19
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,200
That, Mr Burton,
is exactly what you are going to do.

20
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,700
What are you doing?

21
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,100
- Is this a common allergy?
- Not really.

22
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:03,800
It's an allergy to a particular
gastropod. Specifically, limpets.

23
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,500
He was deathly allergic to limpets?

24
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,600
More specifically, an active protein
known as tropomyosin.

25
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,300
And where was this allergen?

26
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,500
How did Mr Foyle come into contact
with it?

27
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,000
Localised swelling at the wound site

28
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,500
suggest it may have been present
on the weapon used to injure him before he died.

29
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:22,900
Thank you, Doctor.

30
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,600
Mr Burton?

31
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,200
No, thank you, My Lord.

32
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,000
Mr Burton, you are aware, of course,

33
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,300
that once you give evidence
on your own behalf,

34
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,100
you are opening yourself up
to cross-examination by the Crown?

35
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,300
Very well aware, My Lord.

36
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,800
- "What now?"
- "OK, you can take it out.

37
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,700
"Look at the barrel. Is there
a red strip visible on the barrel?

38
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,400
"That will tell you
that the drug went in."

39
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,800
"Er, hang on. Hang on.

40
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,300
"I can't see it!"

41
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,200
"Just above the writing,
there's a window."

42
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,400
"Oh, yes!
Yes, yes, yes, it's there!"

43
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,200
"Is the patient responding?"

44
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,700
"Sir? Sir? Hello? Anybody hear me?"

45
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,600
You appear to be very calm
during this interaction.

46
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,400
- Were you?
-I was trying to be.

47
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,900
What were you doing
in Kielder Forest, Mr Burton?

48
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,100
I had a job interview in Carlisle.

49
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,800
The person I spoke to suggested
I tour around a bit.

50
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,900
Do you normally conduct
job interviews with a knife?

51
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,300
I got married with a knife.

52
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,400
Every Scotsman worth his kilt
gets married with a knife.

53
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,000
You bumped into Mr Foyle
by pure chance?

54
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,800
Yes. I saw him in a pub and I felt
compelled to confront him.

55
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,200
You sought him out
to force a confession.

56
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,600
Isn't that correct?

57
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,300
Yes.

58
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,300
Yes? 

59
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,700
Yes, that's right.

60
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,100
Double jeopardy law,
pertaining to new evidence.

61
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,200
I believe Mr Burton
has answered the question.

62
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,100
My Lord.

63
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,200
A confession -

64
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,500
something that you would've desired
very much.

65
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,100
Yes.

66
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,100
And yet when he denied you
this request,

67
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,200
you took his life.

68
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,400
- No. - You flew into a rage and attacked
him with a knife, didn't you?

69
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,400
When was this, sorry?

70
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,300
When you slashed him with the knife,

71
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,100
as you've said clearly
in your statement!

72
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,100
Oh, yes, before I carried him
out of a burning building.

73
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,300
Mr Burton!

74
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,700
Just being clear on chronology.

75
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,700
Flying close to the sun.

76
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,400
A gastropod allergy,

77
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,400
a specific kind of shellfish -

78
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,100
not exactly easy information
to find out.

79
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,600
No, I'd imagine not.

80
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,700
Have you ever had cause to access
a client's medical records?

81
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,600
Yes, though only if pertinent
to the case.

82
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,300
In the case of Sandra Mullins,

83
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,500
you were lead counsel
for Mr Foyle's defence

84
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,600
I was.

85
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:04,500
Did you ever request any medical
information regarding Mr Foyle?

86
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,900
- No.
- You did not?

87
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,300
No, I did not access his files.

88
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,300
I believe his "no" was sufficient.

89
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,600
My Lord. You cannot prove this,
of course.

90
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,500
He was your client.

91
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:21,000
You were intimately acquainted
with his information.

92
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,900
No. Erm...

93
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,900
Confidential medical files are all digitised
and kept securely at the solicitors,

94
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,700
or, presumably, equally securely
at his doctors or hospital.

95
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,500
Which is a long-winded way of saying
no, I did not access his files,

96
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,000
and, yes, I can prove it.

97
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:59,400
What Mr Burton is asking of you is
very simple, ladies and gentlemen.

98
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,300
He wants you to believe
his little story.

99
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,600
He wants you to believe that,
through an ironic twist of fate,

100
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,700
this was the wrong knife,

101
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,600
in the wrong hand,
at the wrong time.

102
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:17,900
I respectfully submit to you
that this is pure fabrication.

103
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,500
This was foreknowledge,
with malicious intent.

104
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,700
He will tell you otherwise,
but I ask only this question -

105
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,400
he tells a good story,

106
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,600
but do we really believe him?

107
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,300
I'm a lawyer.

108
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,500
I have lived and believed in the law
all my life.

109
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,000
But until the law happens to you,

110
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,100
believe me, you don't know which way
you're going to go.

111
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:53,400
The man I faced in that cabin

112
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,200
is the man I know, beyond all doubt,
murdered my wife.

113
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,000
I could've done a lot of things
to him.

114
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,800
Instead,

115
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,500
I saw him suffer
and I called an ambulance.

116
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,900
I removed him from danger.

117
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,900
I did what any decent human being
should do.

118
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,800
But make no mistake,

119
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,800
I did those things out of nothing more than a sincere
duty to our common decency.

120
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,300
I did so because that's what's expected
when you're a person in the world.

121
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,300
I risked my life to save the man
who took away my heart...

122
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,600
..my compass,

123
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,300
my anchor,

124
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,800
my best friend.

125
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,200
I faced him down with a knife
in my hand, I could've let him burn!

126
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,100
In the circumstances,

127
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,800
I believe I exerted an extraordinary
amount of restraint.

128
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,700
Liam Foyle is dead.

129
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,700
I rejoice in his passing.

130
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,900
But you should not convict me
of his murder.

131
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:37,900
- Will!
- That's your one.

132
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,200
Will.

133
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,100
Oh, hi!

134
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,200
OK, interesting...

135
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,100
I wanted to talk to you.

136
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,500
I'd hurry up if I were you,
you know what juries can be like.

137
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,000
They can't deliberate forever.

138
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:51,800
How are you feeling?

139
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,600
- How am I feeling?
- When you heard what happened.

140
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,800
Come on,
you weren't just a wee bit relieved?

141
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,000
I need to talk to you.

142
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,600
Moral support?

143
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,100
Legal advice.

144
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,000
I've been grappling with a case
that's been bothering me,

145
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,300
and wondered if you could help.

146
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,400
Be right back.

147
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,700
Shoot.

148
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,100
Something occurred to me
the other day...

149
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,500
If you wanted to break into a safe,

150
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,200
the first person you'd call
is a locksmith, and, um,

151
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,100
if you wanted to commit murder
and get away with it,

152
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
you might just want to talk
to a criminal barrister.

153
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,200
That's an interesting idea.

154
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,900
 I see enough cases turn on discovery
to know that a perfect crime only stays perfect

155
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,100
if it's done in plain sight,
wouldn't you say?

156
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:42,900
Could be.

157
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:48,500
Everyone would have all the facts
and still have no idea how he really did it.

158
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,400
Step one -
he'd find the Achilles heel.

159
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,200
A deathly allergy, say. A rare one.

160
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,600
How did this person find out
something like that?

161
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,900
What does a criminal barrister do
all day long?

162
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,200
- Chase invoices.
- Talk to criminals.

163
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,400
Wouldn't that give him an address
book, full of potential contacts?

164
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,800
For example,
on the case that I'm working on,

165
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,200
the man was seen
talking to a known criminal.

166
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,500
How would the person be sure
it was him? 

167
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,300
The criminal, I mean.

168
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,800
Presuming it was a he, of course...

169
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,200
He was well-known to the eyewitness.

170
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,900
Yeah, but was it day or night?
Was he on foot, in a vehicle?

171
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,400
Was the observer
under any stress at all?

172
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,800
Step two -

173
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,300
what if he found a natural-occurring source for
the allergen, somewhere innocent and every day?

174
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:40,700
If they argue self-defence, they might load up
a weapon with that allergen to administer the dose.

175
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,400
I'm with you so far.

176
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:48,300
But to put so much weight on one
dose of allergen might not be enough, don't you think?

177
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,800
I wouldn't know the first thing
about it.

178
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,400
Step three -

179
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,300
these people with allergies of such
severity that they cause anaphylaxis,

180
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:02,500
they carry these little life-saving pens with them,
don't they, called EpiPens?

181
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,100
Do you think it might be possible
to repurpose a pen as a poison pen?

182
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,300
By replacing the carrier solution
with a solution of allergen,

183
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:13,800
a person might sabotage the very thing
that would save a person's life.

184
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,400
- That sounds diabolical.
- It does, doesn't it?

185
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,700
You mentioned a legal question.

186
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,600
And if that person called 999,

187
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
and they talked them through
administering that pen to the victim,

188
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,900
it's almost collusion in the crime.

189
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,800
They'd be walking that person,
step by step, through the murder.

190
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,500
Oh, you mean they'd have
a public record of the conversation.

191
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,500
- Yes.
- Ah, that might fly.

192
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,700
But I really don't think anyone
would seriously attempt it.

193
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,500
- Why not?
- I think murder's against the law!

194
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,700
I mean, last time I looked...

195
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,600
- Will...
- You're drawing a line. A big red one.

196
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,200
There's a huge difference between knowing
where that line is and stepping over it.

197
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,600
I know I couldn't.

198
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,500
Why not?

199
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,400
I'd be scared of getting caught.

200
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,600
You just said it was
the perfect crime. 

201
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,500
Oh, it is!

202
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,800
It is.

203
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,700
Except for three things...

204
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,000
Three?

205
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Really?

206
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,600
One -

207
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,600
disposing the weapon.

208
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,800
There'd be two EpiPens, the innocent
one and the murder weapon.

209
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:31,200
The killer would have to discharge
the innocent EpiPen at the locus

210
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,500
so it looked like he'd done what
he talked to the emergency services about.

211
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:36,800
Then I imagine he'd have to chuck
the poisoned EpiPen into the sharps disposal bags ??

212
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,400
But there's a chance it could be found before
being incinerated if the police do a search.

213
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,300
Ah! Very clever.

214
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,400
Two -
obtaining the pen in the first place.

215
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,100
He'd have to know someone with a...
with a prescription already.

216
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,500
Hm... Good point.

217
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,400
Oh, and then there's number three...

218
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,800
"Patient suffered
IgE phylum Mollusca allergy,

219
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,100
"severe bronchospasm and anaphylaxis
and..."

220
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:07,700
under 'Additional Observations',
hidden away in the footnotes,

221
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,100
"..some local swelling at wound...

222
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,600
"..and injection site".

223
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,400
But, you know, they don't test
for epinephrine after death,

224
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,000
so there's no way of knowing
if the EpiPen had been used or not,

225
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,700
except for the puncture wound.

226
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,300
So my number three is this -

227
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,200
risk of a follow-up histology
on local puncture site.

228
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,100
You have a very creative mind.

229
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,700
But would that person
be able to sleep soundly,

230
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:50,500
knowing that at any moment, there might be another
post-mortem that identified allergen at the EpiPen site?

231
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,300
Well, I guess that depends...

232
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,300
On what?

233
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,100
On whether the body's
been cremated...

234
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:25,200
Can the foreman stand, please?

235
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,200
- Have you reached a verdict?
- We have.

236
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,000
In the case of Her Majesty's Advocate
against William Burton,

237
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,500
how do you find the accused
on the charge of murder?

238
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,500
Not proven.

239
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,100
Yes!

240
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,100
Silence, please!

241
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,100
???

242
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,500
Mr Burton! Mr Burton!
Any comments, Mr Burton?

243
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,900
Not proven, of course, the third
verdict available in Scottish law.

244
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,600
Effectively an acquittal,

245
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,800
but one which suggests
a suspicion of guilt...

246
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,300
Do you think you would've got away
with it in an English court of law? Mr Burton!

247
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,300
Take care.

248
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,100
OK...

249
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:49,900
..hold it down.

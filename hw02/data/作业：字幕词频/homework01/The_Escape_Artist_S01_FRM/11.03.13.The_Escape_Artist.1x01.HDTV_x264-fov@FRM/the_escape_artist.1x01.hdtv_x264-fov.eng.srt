4
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:31,459
Taxi!

5
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:37,803
Can you take me here, please?

6
00:00:42,863 --> 00:00:46,360
Right, Charles, sorry about that. OK,
let me fill you in on where we are.

7
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:48,343
We had the cocaine in a holdall.

8
00:00:48,343 --> 00:00:49,670
We moved into the car park 

9
00:00:49,957 --> 00:00:52,949
where we saw our friend Mr Scott walking out
from behind his van

10
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:54,936
 holding a
double-barrelled shotgun.

11
00:00:57,064 --> 00:00:59,011
OK, listen, see you in about an hour.

12
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:00,554
OK. OK, bye.

13
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:04,330
Sorry about that. I'm a lawyer.

14
00:01:07,216 --> 00:01:08,117
Honestly.

15
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:17,578
Jamie's dad, Mr Burton, has come in today
to talk about what he does at work.

16
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:21,296
Do any of you know what
a barrister does? Yes, Jamie?

17
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:23,334
He stops people from going to
prison. 

18
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:24,423
And how does he do that?

19
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:27,306
He tells a court that someone didn't
do a crime.

20
00:01:27,306 --> 00:01:29,484
And sometimes the evidence doesn't
cut it.

21
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:33,181
And sometimes that means he can't
come on holiday like he promised.

22
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:38,216
Actually, my job is mostly standing
up and talking to a judge in court.

23
00:01:38,216 --> 00:01:39,473
What do you talk about? 

24
00:01:39,473 --> 00:01:42,112
If someone said
they saw you take your classmate's pen,

25
00:01:42,277 --> 00:01:43,709
and you said you didn't,

26
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:46,781
 my job would
be to show that whoever saw you was mistaken.

27
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:48,682
What happens if I did take the pen
anyway? 

28
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:50,375
Well, then you'd be guilty.

29
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:52,742
Yeah, but what if I said I didn't
take it, 

30
00:01:52,742 --> 00:01:54,974
and the person who saw me
has bad eyesight,

31
00:01:54,974 --> 00:01:58,542
and you're so good at arguing they
can't be sure it was me who took it?

32
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:02,088
Ah! Well, then, that's what you call
a reasonable doubt.

33
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:03,507
So I get to keep the pen? 

34
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,902
Yes, but
then you'd be getting away with it.

35
00:02:05,902 --> 00:02:07,989
Only if your dad was on my side.

36
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,398
- Hi, Charles.
- Will. 

37
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:41,436
Are we ready?

38
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:44,698
Crown called. Seems Maggie Gardner's
stepping in as lead junior.

39
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:45,479
 Again?

40
00:02:45,883 --> 00:02:48,961
Surprised she could squeeze in a
case between TV appearances.

41
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,000
Suppose I'm flattered.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,866
It's like a derby match with you.
They should sell tickets.

43
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,848
It was the only object Mr Kumarin had
to hand.

44
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:59,161
A hunting knife is not a defensive
weapon! The clue is in the name.

45
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,376
- Miss Gardner.
- I apologise, My Lord.

46
00:03:02,376 --> 00:03:04,970
A man about to be attacked does not
have to wait for permission.

47
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,152
The law tells us, in the right circumstances,
a pre-emptive strike is justified.

48
00:03:09,152 --> 00:03:12,463
In this case, a loaded shotgun aimed
squarely at his head!

49
00:03:12,954 --> 00:03:16,797
We only have Mr Scott's appalling aim
to thank that Mr Kumarin is here

50
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,054
and not being scraped off the
nightclub wall with a trowel.

51
00:03:21,057 --> 00:03:22,170
Well done, Will.

52
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,751
Mr Will, thank you very much.

53
00:03:29,895 --> 00:03:32,645
- Pleasure. Take care.
- Thank you.

Come back after breakfast!

68

Mr Foyle!

69
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,665
After breakfast!!

70
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:23,986
- Well-played.
- Thank you. 

71
00:05:23,986 --> 00:05:25,835
- How's life?
- Ah, pleasure and pain.

72
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:28,827
Oh, Kate saw you on Loose Women the
other day.

73
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,780
- You're playing it very cool.
- Cool?

74
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,796
This... This whole Top 40 nonsense.

75
00:05:36,072 --> 00:05:38,623
- What are you talking about?
- You haven't heard?

76
00:05:41,903 --> 00:05:44,286
Oh, false modesty!

77
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:46,432
It's so unappealing, Will.

78
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:50,144
I don't know what you're talking
about.

79
00:05:57,244 --> 00:05:59,466
We've never had a number one.
Congratulations. 

80
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:02,018
Ah. You'd heard
already?

81
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,969
Er, no, but that explains the

warm welcome outside the robing room.

83
00:06:06,737 --> 00:06:08,104
<font color="#ffff00">***</font>
I don't think it's limited to there.

84
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:11,306
Well done, Mr Burton. That's silk
now for you, surely?

85
00:06:11,306 --> 00:06:12,613
If you say so, Mr Monk. 

86
00:06:12,613 --> 00:06:15,835
You fill out the application, I'll buy a
stamp. How's that?

87
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:19,139
- Don't do this to me!
- You should consider it.

88
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,939
Don't stay a junior all your life,
hm?

89
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:25,943
Well, Harris can, but that's red
brick education for you.

90
00:06:25,943 --> 00:06:27,260
I like getting my hands dirty. 

91
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,372
Ah, but you're different, Will. So
very... special.

92
00:06:43,682 --> 00:06:45,398
Bonus prize. 

93
00:06:45,398 --> 00:06:48,070
No, we're actually up
to the cottage for the weekend. 

94
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,804
Read
that, will you?

95
00:06:49,804 --> 00:06:51,136
Knowing you it shouldn't take long.

96
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:54,026
We're out of mobile range. Very
unfortunate. Tragic, in fact.

97
00:06:54,026 --> 00:06:55,815
Simkins Brown asked for you.

98
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,374
- Personally.
- Really? 

99
00:06:58,374 --> 00:07:01,441
Although I'd keep that
particular factoid to yourself if I were you.

100
00:07:01,441 --> 00:07:03,253
They asked for you over any of the
silks. 

101
00:07:03,253 --> 00:07:04,468
Can't say I blame them.

102
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:08,142
If I was in their client's shoes,
I'd want your record on my side.

103
00:07:08,737 --> 00:07:11,823
If you're chained up in a safe at
the bottom of a shark tank, 

104
00:07:11,823 --> 00:07:13,638
you
don't call for Paul Daniels.

105
00:07:14,858 --> 00:07:16,403
You call for Houdini.

106
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:29,994
Come on.

107
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:34,381
Nice one. Good pass. Good pass!
Come on!

108
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:37,209
There we go, now we're talking.

109
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:39,960
Come on. Keep an eye on the ball!

110
00:07:40,382 --> 00:07:44,066
Here we...
Oh, come on, referee!

111
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:46,164
Grow a sac, for God's sake!

112
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:49,894
- Potatoes, she means sack of potatoes.
- You're here!

113
00:07:52,528 --> 00:07:56,003
Oh, God... Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!

114
00:07:57,721 --> 00:07:59,091
Oh, wee man.

115
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:06,447
I found an apple in my jacket this
morning.

116
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:09,973
I was sending you a message -
through the medium of fruit.

117
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:11,966
- The message being? 
- Eat fruit. 

118
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:14,554
- You don't think I'm getting my five a day?
- No.

119
00:08:14,584 --> 00:08:17,777
I don't think you're eating anything
that isn't made from cheese.

120
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,334
I think you'll find you have to
press the button first.

121
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:40,222
I did press it. I used a pressing
motion.

122
00:08:41,005 --> 00:08:41,997
There now.

123
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:47,013
- I just did that.
- OK.

124
00:08:49,721 --> 00:08:52,019
Thanks for your support. Really
appreciate it.

125
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:54,945
Come on, we're going.

126
00:08:58,939 --> 00:08:59,884
Yeah.

127
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:03,519
Hang on.

128
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:19,109
Get your bags off the back seat. OK?

129
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:22,084
- Hey, Ben.
- All right.

130
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,700
You're the Pied Piper of bubble
baths.

131
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,300
You know, there might be room in
here for a large Scotsman.

132
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,000
- I've got to catch up on something.
- Oh, well, suit yourself.

133
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,500
It's all candles and twilight in
here though.

134
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Your loss.

135
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,300
Stop snoring.

136
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,000
Sorry, am I keeping you up?

137
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,700
Funny guy. Hmm...

138
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,100
You were quite the hit at school
yesterday. So Jamie said.

139
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,700
They seemed to enjoy it.

140
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,200
All his wee pals want you to be
their lawyer now.

141
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,800
They're all going to go out and commit GBH safe
in the knowledge you'll get them off.

142
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,300
Well, that's very reassuring.

143
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,700
Little do they know that that large
brain of yours is full of holes.

144
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,200
Your hard drive's full.

145
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,800
- That's your problem.
- I see.

146
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,600
You just need to back it up now and
again.

147
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,300
How do I do that?

148
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Well...

149
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,800
Mmm. You're so nice and warm.

150
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,500
Mr Simkins, why did you choose me to
lead this?

151
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,300
I mean, why me, over a silk? 

152
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,300
Because I've seen too many silks who try and

153
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,700
waltz in and blunderbuss their way through a case
they've only glanced at on the way to the court.

154
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:45,500
Because in a case like this I want someone
who spends days elbows deep in the evidence.

155
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:51,600
Because my client stands between
a rock and a bucket of shit

156
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,200
and he needs all the help he can
get.

157
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,700
And?

158
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,000
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

159
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,800
Hmph. Because you win.

160
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Are you sleeping here now,
Mr Burton?

161
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,100
What time is it?

162
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Tuesday.

163
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,400
I think I fancy Carlos Tevez.

164
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,800
For captain.

165
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,800
Did you look at these pictures?

166
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,200
You ever seen anything like it?

167
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,400
Before?

168
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,700
I've never.

169
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,700
She was alive for most of it, you
know?

170
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,300
She was alive.

171
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,300
"We were walking through the park,
listening to music on our iPod.

172
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,400
We did not notice the blood on our
shoes until we got home.

173
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,700
Because we'd not been paying much
attention to where we'd been walking,

174
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:39,700
and our walk had taken us through areas
of deeper undergrowth and high grasses.

175
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,800
When we first saw the blood we presumed we
had stepped in the remains of an animal."

176
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,400
A squirrel, for example?

177
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,100
Yes.                                                                                        

178
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,000
Did you know the grey squirrels are
killing all the red squirrels?

179
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:52,900
I did, yes.

180
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,900
But now they've
discovered a black squirrel.

181
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,100
Mr Foyle.

182
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,200
And that's killing all the greys.

183
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,100
Goes to show, you can't be too
careful.

184
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,600
Mr Foyle. Can we please get on?

185
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,300
What day do you take your laundry to
be service washed, Mr Foyle?

186
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,600
Tuesday's wash day.

187
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,900
Can you explain why, after months of Tuesdays,
you took your washing in on a Monday?

188
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,900
We'd run out of pants, hadn't we? 

189
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,200
We took our laundry to be washed a day early
because we'd run out of clothing.

190
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,100
- Correct. - The fact we found blood on
our shoes after our walk

191
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,300
increased our desire to do our
washing early.

192
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,400
That's the truth.

193
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,000
Do you normally wash your shoes in
the washing machine? 

194
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,000
I do if they
have blood on them.

195
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Right.

196
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,800
Erm... We're going to have to talk
about the websites.

197
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,100
The other side are going to try to
claim you habitually view images and video

198
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,000
that are commonly referred to as
"extreme pornography",

199
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,000
an umbrella term for filmed acts which threaten,
or appear to threaten, a person's life,

200
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:02,000
result in serious injury to participants
or appear to involve torture, biting,

201
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,700
sexual interference with a human
corpse.

202
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,400
And that this has a link to the nature of
the injuries sustained by the victim.

203
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,700
I don't do that kind of thing.

204
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,000
Unfortunately, your credit card
statements tell a different story.

205
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,600
They show payments to a number of websites,
which have been revealed to distribute this...

206
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,700
this kind of
material.

207
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
The credit cards are lying.

208
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Right.

209
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,500
I have to tell you, Mr Foyle, already
this is a huge challenge.

210
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,800
We're going to have to work on your
presentation style.

211
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,100
What you see is what you get.

212
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Yes, well, that's part of the
problem, isn't it?

213
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
- Does he have to be here?
- Yes, he does. Yeah.

214
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,700
Here's the thing, Mr Burton,

215
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,200
and I don't know whether you've
picked it up

216
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,500
or perhaps your sixth sense might
have spotted it.

217
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,500
I don't like people very much.

218
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,800
I'm just not a very nice person.

219
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
I'm not here to judge you.

220
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,200
No, the
man in red does that.

221
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,100
I'm here to defend you and present
your case as best as I can.

222
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,800
In order to do that... You think
I did it, don't you? 

223
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,200
- That's the problem.
- It's not what I was saying.

224
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,900
You think I did all those awful
things to that poor woman.

225
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,100
- ??Listen to me.
- I don't think I will.

226
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,100
Mr Foyle.

227
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,600
I want him gone.

228
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,900
He's your solicitor.

229
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,800
Gone.

230
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,800
He was making me nervous.

231
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,400
Do you want to take a minute?

232
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,500
Staring at me.

233
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,500
- Mr Foyle.
- Look me in the eye.

234
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,000
Shall we get on?

235
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,800
How about a nice cup of tea?

236
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,900
Mr Foyle, I'm your defence barrister.

237
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,300
If you privately confessed your guilt
to me in any way 

238
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,200
but publicly
maintained your innocence,

239
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,300
I'd be following Mr Simkins there,

240
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,900
and I would have encouraged you as I
left to enter a guilty plea.

241
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,100
I'm not guilty.

242
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,800
Then this is where we are.

243
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,500
Well, good job you're here then.

244
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,000
- Refreshing.
- Let's hope so.

245
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,500
Your manners.

246
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,700
- Full?
- Just a splash.

247
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,800
You know, it's funny.

248
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,400
The more time we spend together,

249
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,900
the more you remind me of me.

250
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Right.

251
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,400
- Mr Burton?
- Give me a minute.

252
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,100
-Are you all right?
- I just need some air.

253
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,500
- Can I have 20 Marlboro Lights, please?
- Yep.

254
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,300
- And a lighter if you have got one.
- Sure.

255
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Ah, here she is, the rising star at
57 Harlow Street.

256
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,400
Now then, Maggie, I know I should
really be rooting for you

257
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,100
without exception, but you should
know there is no ignominy in coming second.

258
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,500
Just ask Buzz Aldrin.

259
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,600
Well, I demand a recount.

260
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Takes me back to Middle Temple Moot Finals.

261
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,600
- Really?
- Yeah, you and me. Almost an exact replay.

262
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,900
It was a long time ago.

263
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,400
I heard you're up against our boy Julian on
this Liam Foyle malarkey.

264
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,700
Is that so? Our boy? 

265
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,200
Yes. Surprised
it's not you on the other side.

266
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,700
Seem to be making a habit out of it.

267
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,800
Thought I'd give you a go against
someone else for a change.

268
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,300
Had
enough, eh? 

269
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,700
Never.

270
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,900
I am just thinking of transitioning
into more defence work.

271
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,200
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

272
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,200
Anyway, this Foyle case is a little
too St Jude for my liking.

273
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,200
He's the patron saint of lost causes.

274
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,400
Oh, I didn't know that.

275
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,000
Right, well, I'll go and get us some
more rubbing alcohol.

276
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,100
Great, thank you.

277
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,200
I'm serious. I've seen the brief.
Why are you doing?

278
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,900
I'm practising
law.

279
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,700
Oh, come on. It's almost a
no-questions jobbie.

280
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,300
It might be exposure but for all the
wrong reasons.

281
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,300
I don't do things for exposure,
Maggie. 

282
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Why do you do it?

283
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,700
Because everyone deserves a defence.

284
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
There you go.

285
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,600
Yeah!

286
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,800
- Make a wish.Yes.
- I wish my mum would stop annoying me.

287
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,400
- Who wants a piece of cake?
- Me!

288
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,600
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

289
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
OK, so you're saying there's more to
find?

290
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,600
Yeah. And would you go on record with
that?

291
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,700
Great. Great, OK. Someone from my office will
call you tomorrow and set up an appointment.

292
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,500
Thanks. Thank you. Speak soon.
Bye-bye.

293
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,000
Who was that?

294
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,000
That's a clever man
who knows about computers.

295
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,600
Is he going to back up your brain?

296
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,900
No, it was for my work.

297
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,500
Will he help
you win the case? 

298
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,400
I hope so.

299
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,400
Yeah. Mmm...

300
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,200
Oh, here they come.

301
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,300
How's Kate and the family? 

302
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,100
Very
well, thank you.

303
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,800
I think Maggie's in the gallery
today.

304
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,100
Why's she doing that?

305
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,900
Checking out
the competition I expect.

306
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,300
That's the trouble with being number
one.

307
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,400
Everyone wants to knock you off your
perch.

308
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,700
Now I heard you asked for an
adjournment last week.

309
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,500
I did indeed. Trouble at t'mill?

310
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,800
- Not really. Just needed more time.
- Well, here we are, I'm afraid.

311
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
Here we are indeed.

312
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,200
I must say, I do like your game
face, old boy.

313
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,000
You haven't seen it
yet, old boy.

314
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,900
Some crimes defy description.

315
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,900
They debase our so-called civilisation
and defy every boundary of humanity left to us.

316
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,300
Now the person who took the life of
Sandra Mullins

317
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,200
can only be described as a malignant
sadist,

318
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,800
who did so with the intent to
traumatise, to terrorise,

319
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,900
and to inflict the maximum amount of
pain and suffering.

320
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,000
And we intend to prove, without
doubt, that that person was Liam Foyle.

321
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,400
Severe bruising around her neck,

322
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,700
her thyroid cartilage and hyoid bone
were badly fractured.

323
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,500
Cause of death was strangulation.

324
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,100
Other injuries were sexual in
nature,

325
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,000
internal and external,

326
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,400
both eyes were missing,

327
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,700
removed with force close to the time
of death, possibly before.

328
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,600
The park gets overgrown towards the
north eastern corner.

329
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,800
Long grass, hawthorn, lavender,
nettle beds.

330
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,000
And did you see anything unusual on
your morning route?

331
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,000
I saw a man.

332
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,300
Getting up from a lying position.

333
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,500
Mr Hughes, in your professional
capacity,

334
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,500
can you please confirm the credit
card statements before you are

335
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,700
an accurate reflection of payments
made by your bank 

336
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,600
- on behalf of the account holder, Mr Liam Foyle?
- Yes.

337
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,400
- And these payments were made by the card over the
first three months of this year, is that correct? - Yes.

338
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,300
And they were all made online to
companies across Asia and Europe,

339
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,100
all of which distribute and produce
the same... product,

340
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,300
namely pornography, is that correct?

341
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,200
Yes, that is our understanding.

342
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,600
Mr Hughes, many of these sites, and I'm afraid we have had to visit them

343
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,500
in the course of this investigation,

344
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,500
have shown acts of extreme depravity
which,

345
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
we understand from the forensic
reports,

346
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,700
show disturbingly accurate
similarities to the injuries

347
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,100
that befell Sandra Mullins
before she was murdered.

348
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,900
I talk specifically in relation to
the bite marks

349
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,000
and the mutilation of genitalia.

350
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Liar!

351
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,000
Mr Foyle! You have one chance with
me, and that was it.

352
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,400
Any more from you and I shall hold
you in contempt.

353
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
Murderer! Silence, please!

354
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,600
Mr Hughes, please answer the
question.

355
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,400
Yes, it is the same card.

356
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,700
Thank you. No further questions,
My Lord.

357
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,500
Mr Burton?

358
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,000
My Lord, before this trial began I
made a written application for an adjournment.

359
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,500
I'm asking you now to reconsider that application
in the light of the gravity of the expert testimony.

360
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,100
Oh, come on. 

361
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,400
??This is most
inappropriate.

362
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,400
??An adjournment will bring vital
evidence to light.

363
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,200
Let both sides have their expert, and
let the jury decide. 

364
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,300
Mr Burton,there is huge public interest in
having this case heard as soon as possible.

365
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,400
The fact your expert has not mustered himself to
the task at hand is neither here nor there.

366
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,300
He's not slow, he's gathering
potentially new evidence.

367
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,000
It's the same computer.

368
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,600
Both of your experts are computer
forensic specialists.

369
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,900
I can hardly see how two trained men
looking at the same equipment

370
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,700
could produce so radically different
conclusions that it would make a difference.

371
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,500
I'm afraid it simply isn't on.

372
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,800
I think if My Lord could
look a little closer...

373
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,300
Your application was refused and it
shall stay refused.

374
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,100
I will decline from pursuing you on
contempt

375
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,500
but let this be your last and final
warning.

376
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,400
We'll break for lunch now - 

377
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,900
but the
train is on the tracks, Mr Burton.

378
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,300
And for the sake of your client
I suggest you deal with it.

379
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,000
My Lord. 

380
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,700
- All rise.
- Choo-choo.

381
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
Will?

382
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,400
You should try and sleep.

383
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,700
- I'm fine.
- I mean it.

384
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,400
You think you're invincible, and
you're not.

385
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,400
We should get new locks on these
windows. 

386
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,800
Were you even listening to
me? 

387
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,600
Frame locks, with keys.

388
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,600
Oh, God. You're going to drive me crazy
for the next two months now, aren't you?

389
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,600
A colleague of mine just defended a 12-year-old boy who
poured drain cleaner down the throat of his best mate

390
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,600
because he wouldn't let him play a
game on his phone.

391
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,600
The world is broken.

392
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,200
You shouldn't watch scary movies so
close to bedtime.

393
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
Yeah.

394
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,700
Not inspiring much 
confidence up there, Will.

395
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,500
- I know what I'm doing, Mr Foyle.
- Not from where I'm sitting.

396
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,900
So sack me. Why would 
I want to do that?

397
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,700
You tell me. I work for you 
as long as you'll have me.

398
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,900
I apologise, Will. 
I know you've got my back.

399
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,100
I appreciate your 
honesty very much.

400
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,400
Shall we get on?

401
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,700
You only have one computer,
is that correct?

402
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,200
Yes. But I don't see what that's got 
to do with what happened to that woman.

403
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,000
You will.

404
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,400
Someone must pay for what 
happened to Sandra Mullins.

405
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,100
Our very humanity is at stake, 
as my learned friend has indicated.

406
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,900
It would be convenient

407
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,800
for everyone here today
If Liam Foyle was guilty.

408
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,800
The cuffs go on and
he's gone forever.

409
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,900
The evidence seems overwhelming.

410
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,000
But it is not.

411
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,100
We may dislike Mr Foyle.

412
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
We might cross the street
 if we saw him coming.

413
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,000
But we do not have to 
like him to defend him.

414
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,300
Because this is not a popularity contest,
this is not a witch-Hunt,

415
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,500
This is a court of law,

416
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,800
And in this country, 
when you're accused of a crime

417
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:17,300
You are presumed to be 
innocent until proven guilty.

418
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,600
And make no mistake, not 
a shred of what you've heard from

419
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,500
My learned friend acting
 for the Prosecution

420
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,000
Has given any proof at all.

421
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,600
I will show you 
unreliable witnesses,

422
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,400
Lazy forensic science,

423
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,200
Emotional appeals instead 
of factual accuracies.

424
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,000
Oh, yes, and the casual 
assertion that my client

425
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,000
is a consumer of 
extreme pornography.

426
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,500
First, I think, 
we will talk about that.

427
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,900
I am an expert in forensic
 computer data analysis.

428
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,300
Dr Crowe, have you had a 
chance to examine the hard drive

429
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,900
of the computer belonging to Mr Foyle?

430
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,900
Yes, I have.

431
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,300
And you did this instructed by the 
Prosecution in this case, is that correct?

432
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,300
Yes.

433
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,400
Unfortunately Dr Weeks,

434
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,400
the gentleman who has helped examine
 the computer for the Defence

435
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
Has not yet finished his work.

436
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,100
However, he has passed 
me his notes to date

437
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,300
and I'd like to ask you 
questions about them.

438
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,000
Wherever you go on the internet,
using a computer,

439
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,800
- You leave footprints. Is that correct?
- Yes, it is.

440
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,100
Even if you've deleted a file, 
someone like you is able to see it.

441
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,400
- Most of the time.
- Where is this going?

442
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,300
In the absence of my own expert,

443
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,000
My learned friend has kindly tendered
the Prosecution expert on this matter.

444
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,100
I beg some time to explore
 this point with him.

445
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,400
Very well.

446
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,900
My learned friend alleges that 
my client paid for and viewed,

447
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,600
On a regular basis,

448
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,400
Numerous depraved and abusive
 images, including...

449
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,600
"Acts of torture, mutilation,
 strangulation, and necrophilia."

450
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,700
Um, in your analysis of his computer,

451
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,400
Did you establish that Mr Foyle

452
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,200
Had actually visited 
ANY of those websites

453
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,000
that Pertained to those images?

454
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,100
- No, but his credit card bills...
- Thank you.

455
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,000
And my learned friend asserted
that my client paid for access

456
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,100
To many of those websites
 with his credit card.

457
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,800
Now,

458
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,400
Why would he pay for them if 
he didn't actually visit them?

459
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,200
It may sound reprehensible but he's 
not getting his money's worth, is he?

460
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,800
How did he pay for access to those
sites without actually visiting them?

461
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,200
Many porn sites were on
 his internet history

462
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,400
To which he submitted his
 credit card details.

463
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,300
That's how he received a password
 to unlock other content elsewhere.

464
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:49,700
Is it possible that his card 
details were falsified at that point?

465
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,100
How do you mean?

466
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,600
That when he submitted his 
details to the adult site,

467
00:34:54,700 --> 00:35:00,100
They were taken and used 
by unknown third parties

468
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,900
To pay for and unlock this 
"other content" as you call it.

469
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,500
Is that possible?

470
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,500
I suppose so, yes.

471
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,700
So given this possibility, 
if we were to prove, in this court,

472
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,900
That such falsification occurred,
 would Mr Foyle be shown to be,

473
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,100
In fact, a victim of identity fraud?

474
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,600
This is not a trial about
 extreme pornography,

475
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,200
This is about the
 horrific murder...

476
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,200
Our expert was in the 
process of proving this link.

477
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,700
Hence our application for 
an adjournment, which was refused.

478
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,700
My learned friend brought these
hideous allegations to bear on this case

479
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,700
and I reiterate my request.

480
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,000
The expert testimony cuts both ways.

481
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,900
Usher, please excuse the jury.

482
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,200
A matter of procedure has just arisen,

483
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,500
I need to talk to both 
sides about it.

484
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,100
We will call you back presently.

485
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,700
My room, I think.

486
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,400
My client has been falsely branded an
 extreme porn enthusiast by the Crown,

487
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,200
This has now leaked online
 to social media,

488
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,600
where it's been duly picked
 up by the print media,

489
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,900
Which has now tainted my client with the 
label torturer, pervert, necrophiliac,

490
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,000
So much so this jury must be 
discharged and a new jury called.

491
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,700
Even with the reporting 
restrictions,

492
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,900
Given the press this case
 has already generated,

493
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,200
Mr Foyle cannot be 
given a fair trial.

494
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,100
The application is 
to stay the indictment.

495
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,400
- This is absurd.
- I made the request in good time.

496
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,000
Yes, I know.

497
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,000
The prejudice to the accused In the 
eyes of this jury is, in my view, permanent.

498
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,500
Reluctantly, I feel that I have 
little option in these circumstances

499
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,200
- But to accede to your application.
- Judge, please.

500
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,100
I ballsed up, Julian.

501
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,100
I'm sorry. Let's get 
this over with.

502
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,000
And so, as a result, 
I have no alternative

503
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,600
But to discharge the jury 
and release the defendant.

504
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,100
All rise.

505
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,100
He's got away with murder.
He's got blood on his hands.

506
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600
You should be ashamed of yourself!

507
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,300
Congratulations, well done.

508
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,500
It was a mistake. 
I just made sure they paid for it.

509
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,600
Will, good man.

510
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,900
- Just doing my job.
- Thank you, my friend.

511
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,000
Pleasure. Take care.

512
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,400
- So show me again.
- You do it.

513
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,400
OK. But don't watch me, I can't 
do it if you watch. I'm like a kettle.

514
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,700
What do you mean 
you're like a kettle?

515
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,000
If I get this right 
I'll tell you. Go on.

516
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:30,900
OK.

517
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,300
- "When buying clothing to 
say what you want, use...
- Gostaria."

518
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
Gostaria.

519
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,100
- "I'd like a shirt.
- Gostaria uma camisa."

520
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,100
Gostaria uma camisa.

521
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:56,100
- "I'd like a pair of trousers.
- Gostaria umas calcas."

522
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,300
What?

523
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,400
"To get the right size,
use the following phrases.

524
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,000
I am a size 40."

525
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,900
"O meu numero e quarenta."

526
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,900
O meu numero e qua... quarenta.

527
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,800
"If they don't have the right colour,
here is how to ask for the same thing in blue.

528
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Do you have this in blue?"

529
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,400
Who are you waving at?

530
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,300
I don't know.

531
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,500
What do you mean you don't know?

532
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,700
That man. He just started waving.

533
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
What man?

534
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,500
He's gone now.

535
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,000
- Just go in.
- "Are you peeing?"

536
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,800
Possibly.

537
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,500
Listen, just take a deep breath
and open the door, You big Jessie.

538
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,300
I can't. I'm scared.

539
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,700
- "It's just a reunion."
- Jenny said she'd be here.

540
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,500
- Who was she again?
- Funny.

541
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,600
"At least you'll have 
something in common."

542
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,800
We had a deal. 
I can't see her anywhere.

543
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,100
"You'll be fine."

544
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,700
No, not these people.
These people are all so...

545
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,600
- Hi.
- Hi, great to see you.

546
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,700
- Two-Faced.
- "I'll tell you what.

547
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,100
If you're still hyperventilating
 by the cheese course,

548
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,100
You can always come and see us.
You know where we are.

549
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,300
And we're always 
pleased to see you.

550
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,600
OK. Thanks.

551
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I'd better go. Bye.

552
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,200
- Mum.
- Yes?

553
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,500
What you smiling at?

554
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,900
It's a surprise.

555
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,500
A nice surprise.

556
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,700
Come here.

557
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,000
What's with the questions?
 You, you're always...

558
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,800
Get off.

559
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,400
- So how's Edinburgh?
- Still mad.

560
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,100
You should come back though.

561
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,600
You get a nicer house,
 better schools.

562
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,900
- Are you considering a career change?
- I'm doing OK, thanks.

563
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,300
I know. I read the papers.

564
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,900
Don't let them start without me, OK?

565
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,100
"And still, when winter came, he..."

566
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,300
Amen.

567
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,800
Hi.

568
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,600
"Where were you? 
I've been trying for ages."

569
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,700
- What's happened?
- "God, there was a man outside."

570
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,200
I don't know, but there
 was somebody outside.

571
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,300
- We are at the cottage.
- "Man?! What man?"

572
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,200
I don't know what man it is!

573
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:36,600
- "There was a man, somebody!"
- Kate. Kate. Breathe. Tell me again.

574
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,600
"He was... He was at the window,
 and I was in the bath...

575
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,600
He was looking in at me when
 I was in the bath."

576
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,000
- How could he be at the window?!
- I don't know but he was at the window!

577
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,000
Call the police, lock the doors,
stay in the bedroom. OK?

578
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,800
Do not go outside. I'll be there 
as soon as I can. I love you, OK?

579
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,200
- Did you hear me? Are you calling them?
- I'm c-Calling.

580
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,900
Guv!

581
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,400
Is it possible that one of 
your ex-Clients has a point to prove?

582
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,000
Someone you failed to defend, 
perhaps did some time?

583
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,100
Well,... no.

584
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,900
You sound very sure.

585
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,100
Detective Chalmers, 
Mr Burton has never lost a case.

586
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,900
Have you ever refused 
to represent someone?

587
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,200
- We're not really allowed to do that.
- Allowed?

588
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,300
Cherry-Picking is frowned upon.

589
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:33,600
Everybody's hungry. 
Everybody's hungry.

590
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,100
Everybody's hungry.

591
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,400
Aye-Aye.

592
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,300
Hi. Any sign of a reply 
from the QC Selection Panel?

593
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,500
Yeah. Look, about that.

594
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,700
You might want to delay a little.

595
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,300
- What kind of complaint?
- Unprofessional conduct.

596
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,400
He didn't come to us first?

597
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,800
Looks like he wanted to cause
 you maximum discomfort.

598
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:24,800
Went straight to the Legal 
Ombudsman and the BSB. Both barrels.

599
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,000
Mr Foyle asserts

600
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,700
that you "engaged in
conduct which is dishonest

601
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,300
Or otherwise discreditable
 to a barrister

602
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,500
Contrary to paragraph 301 A1,

603
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,800
in particular that you 
expressed doubts about

604
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,500
The validity and 
honesty of his plea."

605
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,500
What?

606
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,700
- Is this true?
- Of course not.

607
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,500
This is insane. We won 
the bloody case. We won!

608
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,300
Looks like it's not enough.

609
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,000
What the hell's he doing?

610
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,600
Your silk application is going to have
 to wait till this is all sorted out.

611
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,900
I'm sorry, it's very bad luck.

612
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,700
We need to weigh in on this right away,
 stop it in its tracks.

613
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,800
Enough firepower,
it may well work.

614
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,500
Danny!

615
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,100
See who you can rope back into 
the office, will you?

616
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,800
- It's six o'clock.
- Hey!

617
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,100
We'll thrash out a strategy 
here and now, all right?

618
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,100
Yeah, there's been a bit of a 
thing at work. It's a bit weird.

619
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,900
I'm going to have to stay later but 
maybe we can all go up together?

620
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:35,800
Can you hang on?

621
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,700
"We're ready for the off.
Why don't we just see you up there, eh?

622
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,100
But hurry up, OK?
I want to show you something."

623
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,900
- That's cryptic.
- "No, not really. Oh, and listen..."

624
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,600
Oh, I am losing you.

625
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:52,800
- Nah.
- "Hello?"

626
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,500
I'll see you later, OK?

627
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,900
- "Hello? Hello?"
- OK.

628
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,800
- We are here. Yeah, we're here.
- I am really hungry.

629
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,800
I don't care.

630
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,600
Listen, we are going to wait for your dad 
to get back so we can all eat together, OK?

631
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,900
"Hi, it's Kate, I'm not here right but 
leave a message. Bye."

632
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,300
Jamie?

633
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,600
Jamie?

634
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,400
"Try to find out if 
it is day or night.

635
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,600
- What are two ways to greet someone?"
- "Muito prazer..."

636
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,300
"Bom dia. Boa tarde."

637
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
"Where is the nearest chemist?"

638
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,400
"Onde esta a farmacia?"

639
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,600
Kate?

640
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:29,700
Hi.

641
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,800
Kate?!

642
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,600
Kate?!

643
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,900
- "There is.
- Ha, sim."

644
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,500
Kate?

645
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Kate?!

646
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,900
Jamie?!

647
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,800
Kate?!

648
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,500
Kate?! Jamie?!

649
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,800
Jamie?! Jamie!!

650
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,300
Jamie!

651
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,600
Oh, Jesus!

652
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,300
Kate!

653
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,000
DAD!

654
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,000
- Jamie?! Jamie?!
- DAD!

655
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,000
Jamie!

656
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,500
Jamie!

657
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,600
Shit!

658
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:49,900
Come on!

659
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,900
Come on!

660
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,900
Yes! Police! Ambulance!

661
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,800
Words are not enough, Will.

662
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,500
Take all the time you need.

663
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,800
Chambers is a family.

664
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,200
Like all families we take 
care of one another.

665
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,800
We will run with this right
 through to the end.

666
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,300
- Whatever it takes.
- Thank you.

667
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,900
You have my word on it.

668
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,400
We'll make sure we get him.

669
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,200
How are things?

670
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,400
Sorry. Shit question.

671
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,400
I'm getting through it.

672
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,400
Sorry to call out of the blue,
 I was in the area.

673
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,000
It's really great that you called, Danny.
I really appreciate it.

674
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,900
- How's everything with you?
- Fine, fine.

675
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,600
Well, we're just...

676
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,700
..Pulling out all the big guns.
Going to blitz the bastard, yeah?

677
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
What is it?

678
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,400
- I don't know if I should tell you.
- Tell me what?

679
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,800
Liam Foyle confirmed 
defence counsel today.

680
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,800
Who is it?

681
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,600
I thought you were still on leave?

682
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,300
I am.

683
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,400
I, erm, I sent you a card. I hope...

684
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,800
You're defending him.

685
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,900
If you mean Liam Foyle, then yes.

686
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,700
Yes, you're correct.

687
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,000
Look, after everything 
that's happened, I mean...

688
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,300
I know this must be very 
hard for you. I really do.

689
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,300
Yeah.

690
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,800
You know as well as I do, 
for good or bad...

691
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,800
What can I say?

692
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,100
Everyone deserves a defence.

693
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,300
That's right, Maggie.

694
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,500
That's right.

695
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,600
next time
Foyle murdered Sandra Mullins.

696
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,500
- You need to know that.
- You said otherwise in court.

697
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,700
Let that man in, 
you're risking everything.

698
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,400
I mean it. Don't be alone.

699
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,600
It was today, the plea?

700
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,100
They should have called you.

701
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,900
- He got bail.
- When was this?

702
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,200
This morning.

703
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,900
Lawyers don't have an ounce 
of mercy in them.

704
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,600
They can be manipulative.

705
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:30,500
- Never said thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

706
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,500
See you soon.

707
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,200
When were you planning 
on telling me?

708
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,000
I want a meeting 
with everyone tonight.

709
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,300
Dad! Look out!

710
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,200
- Is he here?
- They said he'd already left.

711
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,200
- Why didn't you call me?
- Dad! Dad!

712
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,700
Dad! Dad!

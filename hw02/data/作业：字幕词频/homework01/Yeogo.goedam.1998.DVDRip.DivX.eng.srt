00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:45,688
WHISPERING CORRIDORS

2
00:01:12,545 --> 00:01:16,743
This is Hur Eun-Young.
I can't answer the phone, so leave your message.

3
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,998
2nd year, 3rd year...

4
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:37,894
2nd year, 3rd year...

5
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:47,080
2nd year, 3rd year...

6
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:08,150
Mrs. Park, you're still here?

7
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,449
Had to check something.

8
00:03:12,348 --> 00:03:13,847
I'll be leaving soon.

9
00:03:14,347 --> 00:03:17,145
Guess the new semester's keeping you busy.

10
00:03:20,644 --> 00:03:23,143
Need any help?

11
00:03:23,243 --> 00:03:24,452
I'm fine.

12
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,808
Library

13
00:04:13,998 --> 00:04:14,608
Hello?

14
00:04:14,998 --> 00:04:15,508
Eun-Young?

15
00:04:15,997 --> 00:04:17,007
Mrs. Park?

16
00:04:19,296 --> 00:04:20,505
Jin-Ju is here.

17
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:23,804
Jin-Ju?

18
00:04:25,593 --> 00:04:26,602
I don't know.

19
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,301
What are you talking about?

20
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,188
Jin-Ju has died for sure.
But she's here.

21
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:40,595
Jin-Ju's been in school for 9 years.

22
00:04:40,985 --> 00:04:41,895
Mrs. Park...

23
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:45,393
Eun-Young? Hello?

24
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:24,908
What are you doing here?

25
00:08:25,698 --> 00:08:27,807
Uh?  Waiting for you.

26
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:30,505
What?

27
00:08:34,893 --> 00:08:35,803
What did you say?

28
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:38,302
I was waiting for you.

29
00:08:39,191 --> 00:08:42,300
For me?
Why?

30
00:08:45,588 --> 00:08:47,297
Why were you waiting for me?

31
00:08:49,086 --> 00:08:50,796
We're the class clerks of the week.

32
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,968
Youn Yae-Yi, trying to make me feel guilty eh?

33
00:09:09,357 --> 00:09:14,864
I'm actually 15 minutes early, thanks to my mom.

34
00:09:16,053 --> 00:09:19,362
Of course you're not, I'm a bit early.

35
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:24,859
We never promised to meet here.

36
00:09:25,349 --> 00:09:27,858
You should have waited in the classroom. It's cold.

37
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:35,254
Empty classrooms give me the creeps, sorry...

38
00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:56,744
Stop moping.

39
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:04,940
You'll jinx my chance of spending this senior year in style.

40
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:14,216
Want to become a schoolgate ghost?
Come on.

41
00:10:34,896 --> 00:10:35,405
What's this?

42
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:09,069
I'm not sure, only that she's possessed.

43
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:10,868
Possessed?

44
00:11:12,258 --> 00:11:18,555
You know, by a grade ghost.
One with a low IQ though.

45
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:19,964
Were you good friends?

46
00:11:21,153 --> 00:11:23,962
Does she look like she would like me?

47
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,460
Oh, I forgot to bring a rag.

48
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,550
Hey!

49
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:31,648
What...?

50
00:11:33,048 --> 00:11:37,546
Give me that you dufus.
No need to take those back up.

51
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:40,254
Hurry up.

52
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:29,711
Ji-Oh.

53
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:27,163
It is your duty as her students.

54
00:13:28,852 --> 00:13:36,459
Anyone who damages her reputation with rumors
will never be forgiven.

55
00:13:37,248 --> 00:13:37,958
You heard.

56
00:13:53,640 --> 00:14:00,447
Don't distract the other students with gossip, understand?

57
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,715
It's all for the best, Okay?

58
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:14,220
Fortunately, we're swearing this oath of honor...
...before all hell breaks loose.

59
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:20,517
You'll all be held responsible if anything happens.

60
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:22,507
Got it.

61
00:14:22,906 --> 00:14:23,516
Yes sir.

62
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,314
Got it.

63
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:32,702
Yes sir.

64
00:14:32,902 --> 00:14:37,809
You'll take the blame for rumors coming from Rm.3.
Understood!

65
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:41,607
Yes sir.

66
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:52,802
Why did she do it?

67
00:14:55,091 --> 00:14:59,689
It's not clear. The police needs more leads.

68
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:10,873
You could kill yourself for any reason...
...But why do it at school?

69
00:15:28,955 --> 00:15:29,864
I'm sorry.

70
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:44,557
The principal will assign a new
homeroom teacher for Rm3.

71
00:15:45,247 --> 00:15:49,655
Special instructions will be given.

72
00:15:50,244 --> 00:15:57,951
But make sure this is kept confidential.

73
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:05,317
Hey!    Are you sure?

74
00:16:06,906 --> 00:16:08,616
Ever see me tell a lie?

75
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:10,805
Yeah.

76
00:16:13,004 --> 00:16:15,712
This is for real.

77
00:16:16,402 --> 00:16:17,411
Suicide?

78
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:22,709
Not all suicides are by hanging.
This case stinks.

79
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,797
Most of the students wanted to kill old fox.

80
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:36,402
Jin-Ju is here.

81
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,892
Really? For me?

82
00:16:58,482 --> 00:17:03,489
Isn't it a family heirloom? Thanks Jin-Ju.

83
00:17:42,031 --> 00:17:44,240
Is your Dad still drinking a lot?

84
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:46,439
I don't know.

85
00:17:48,928 --> 00:17:50,137
Don't be so cold.

86
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:56,634
Did you hear? Jung-Sook was the first to be here.

87
00:17:56,824 --> 00:18:00,332
Yeah, and she wasn't even the clerk of the week.

88
00:18:00,692 --> 00:18:02,101
She was there even before the clerks.

89
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:05,999
Remember last weeks shouting match with Old Fox?

90
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:12,296
Making out you two?

91
00:18:13,686 --> 00:18:17,094
Go work in a factory. If you can cut it?

92
00:18:17,484 --> 00:18:19,993
Or stay at home. You hear?

93
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:21,892
Degenerates.

94
00:18:42,472 --> 00:18:45,870
Look at your uniform. Hands out.

95
00:18:59,064 --> 00:19:01,373
You're such a bad influence.

96
00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:11,928
What's this smell? Incense?

97
00:19:14,427 --> 00:19:18,235
It figures.
Having a Shaman for a mother.

98
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:29,919
Miss Hur.

99
00:19:43,113 --> 00:19:44,012
Miss Hur...

100
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,119
A penny for your thoughts.

101
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:55,217
You weren't answering.

102
00:19:56,406 --> 00:19:58,415
Oh, were you calling me?

103
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:03,013
You're the only teacher by that last name.

104
00:20:03,673 --> 00:20:08,870
Sorry, I still feel like a student here.

105
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,080
Really?

106
00:20:14,368 --> 00:20:15,967
So Mrs. Park used to be your senior homeroom teacher?

107
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,975
Her death must have shocked you.

108
00:20:21,764 --> 00:20:27,571
She said she had something to check.
I assumed it was important.

109
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,270
What was she checking?

110
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,768
I'm not sure,...
...but she was staring at her class agenda book.

111
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,063
Jin-Ju's died for sure.

112
00:20:47,552 --> 00:20:52,060
But she's here.
Jin-Ju's been in school for 9 years.

113
00:20:55,448 --> 00:20:57,257
It's not you.

114
00:20:58,447 --> 00:21:02,755
I just don't feel like it.
So childish.

115
00:21:04,414 --> 00:21:05,523
Do it on your own.

116
00:21:08,412 --> 00:21:10,811
Nobody else can call the spirits.

117
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,919
Just this one time. Please?

118
00:21:50,991 --> 00:21:54,900
Oh mighty spirit, come to us...

119
00:21:58,988 --> 00:22:01,996
Draw us a circle if you are with us.

120
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:34,051
Draw us a circle if she is a virgin.
An X if she is not.

121
00:22:52,332 --> 00:22:53,442
Having fun?

122
00:22:54,431 --> 00:22:55,830
Get your asses over here.

123
00:23:01,598 --> 00:23:04,706
What the fuck is Mad Dog doing in our class?

124
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:21,398
Hasn't senior year put some sense into you?

125
00:23:22,388 --> 00:23:26,496
If you're so psychic, make a living out of it.

126
00:23:26,886 --> 00:23:28,295
Why bother with school?

127
00:23:29,384 --> 00:23:31,393
I asked her for my grades.

128
00:23:34,382 --> 00:23:37,790
Lim Ji-Oh, are you a Shaman or a witch doctor?

129
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,588
Then get better grades. You're lowering the class average.

130
00:23:44,677 --> 00:23:45,287
Get out of my sight.

131
00:23:50,574 --> 00:23:51,074
Who is it?

132
00:23:53,573 --> 00:23:55,072
Who's the smart ass who just laughed?

133
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:03,578
I see...
Everyone on your desks, now.

134
00:24:08,636 --> 00:24:12,444
I'll teach you a lesson.  Arms up!

135
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:23,239
Can't you greet your new
homeroom teacher with respect?

136
00:24:23,928 --> 00:24:24,838
Homeroom teacher?

137
00:24:30,025 --> 00:24:34,233
Due to personal matters,
Mrs. Park is unable to continu her duties.

138
00:24:35,523 --> 00:24:40,230
I will be taking over,... you hear?

139
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,428
This means two things.

140
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:49,626
One, a better chance at getting into college.

141
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:56,423
Two, no personal life for a year.

142
00:24:57,912 --> 00:25:04,309
The new semester of your senior year...
is getting you somewhat excited...

143
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:08,397
I advise you to get rid of such cheap sentimentalisms.

144
00:25:09,186 --> 00:25:11,895
They're luxuries a senior should do without.

145
00:25:12,985 --> 00:25:13,994
Got it!

146
00:25:15,983 --> 00:25:19,591
My motto is:
KEEP YOUR OWN PLACE.

147
00:25:20,581 --> 00:25:23,290
This will be the class motto from now on.

148
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:32,285
You're each other's rival,...
but frankly speaking you're each other's enemy.

149
00:25:33,675 --> 00:25:38,572
The worst enemy in war is yourself.
You CAN defeat your inner enemy.

150
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:40,581
You can be a winner.

151
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:49,577
I've re-scheduled the exercise exams for tomorrow.
Be prepared.

152
00:25:53,065 --> 00:25:56,264
Get used to it and stop whining!

153
00:25:57,763 --> 00:26:03,770
It's for evaluation purposes, so relax.

154
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,148
If you don't have what it takes, tough.

155
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:12,046
Class dismissed. Start cleaning up.

156
00:26:54,016 --> 00:26:57,025
Dang, wish we had exams every day.

157
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:57,924
What?

158
00:26:58,714 --> 00:26:59,923
Then school ends early.

159
00:27:00,193 --> 00:27:03,901
Bitch, exams never kept you from leaving early.

160
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:06,600
You're always the first to dive outta da classroom.

161
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,698
It's better to chill after the exams...

162
00:27:10,888 --> 00:27:11,898
Bullshit!

163
00:27:13,787 --> 00:27:14,796
Ow, ouch.

164
00:27:15,286 --> 00:27:16,395
Stuck?

165
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:19,094
Aw, fuck. It's blocked.

166
00:27:19,384 --> 00:27:24,092
Didn't we get pierced on the same day?

167
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,790
Ouch.

168
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:32,088
Stop whining bitch.
...see it's going in.

169
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:33,987
Stop it, it hurts.

170
00:27:34,177 --> 00:27:37,775
I'm trying to take it out you slut.
Want a bloody slit up your nose?

171
00:27:44,672 --> 00:27:45,182
Hey!

172
00:27:46,371 --> 00:27:47,581
Whatcha lookin at?

173
00:27:52,168 --> 00:27:55,177
Huh, are you ignoring me?

174
00:27:56,766 --> 00:27:58,076
What's all the fuss?

175
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,349
You psychic, mind your own business!

176
00:28:58,816 --> 00:29:00,825
Hur Eun-Young

177
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:23,095
I'll ask them to replace the missing yearbooks.

178
00:29:24,884 --> 00:29:26,893
So you're an alumni.

179
00:29:28,582 --> 00:29:29,592
How did you know?

180
00:29:29,981 --> 00:29:34,889
You were pretty famous as the student
with looks and brains.

181
00:29:36,878 --> 00:29:43,185
My grades were so so,
and the yearbook shows prettier girls.

182
00:29:44,874 --> 00:29:48,483
Why did you choose to be a teacher?

183
00:29:50,871 --> 00:29:55,379
I guess it's not so bad after all.

184
00:29:59,068 --> 00:30:01,876
Can I drop the formalities when we're alone?

185
00:30:03,445 --> 00:30:05,255
If you insist.

186
00:30:06,644 --> 00:30:09,852
The teachers often compare us together.

187
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:14,250
But they say I'm prettier and smarter.

188
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,948
You're definitely prettier,
but do you also get good grades?

189
00:30:18,848 --> 00:30:21,057
Yes, I'm applying for Seoul National University.

190
00:30:21,937 --> 00:30:22,946
What major?

191
00:30:23,436 --> 00:30:26,544
Does it matter? After all, it's the best.

192
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:30,343
There must be something that interests you.

193
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:34,241
Nothing special. Besides I hate studying.

194
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,339
Once I get admitted, I'm done with books.

195
00:30:40,028 --> 00:30:42,737
An SNU degree is a gold card for everything.

196
00:30:44,126 --> 00:30:49,233
Even with an SNU degree, it wouldn't hurt reading Joyce.

197
00:31:05,995 --> 00:31:09,304
How come you're still here?
Aren't you going home?

198
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:17,800
I didn't have the chance...to thank you in the toilet.

199
00:31:20,788 --> 00:31:22,797
You like to do girly things, don't you?

200
00:31:24,986 --> 00:31:27,295
Thanks anyway.

201
00:31:34,082 --> 00:31:35,191
Have a seat.

202
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:42,388
Practicing for art school?

203
00:31:44,377 --> 00:31:50,284
Nope. I'm supposed to have no talent...

204
00:31:50,674 --> 00:31:52,183
How would you know?

205
00:31:55,472 --> 00:32:01,679
My mom said...it's a waste of time.

206
00:32:03,248 --> 00:32:05,357
She's right.

207
00:32:06,346 --> 00:32:11,054
This is just for fun.

208
00:32:13,943 --> 00:32:15,052
Can I see...?

209
00:32:17,841 --> 00:32:22,449
?!...No. It's embarrassing.

210
00:32:24,838 --> 00:32:29,645
I guess it is embarrassing.

211
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:41,340
You're breaking my heart.
Okay, I'll show it to you.

212
00:33:00,301 --> 00:33:03,409
I told you so.

213
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:09,506
Why paint something so scary?

214
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:30,396
School can be a horrific experience...
for both students and teachers.

215
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:36,093
Like witnessing a tragic death.

216
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:40,092
Do you get it?

217
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:51,186
I guess that's why I can't erase...
the image of Old Fox from my head.

218
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:54,485
It's like an inspiration.

219
00:33:56,274 --> 00:33:57,083
Terrific.

220
00:33:58,473 --> 00:33:59,382
What is?

221
00:34:00,252 --> 00:34:02,651
You are. You speak like an artist.

222
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:07,648
You're kidding. I can't even paint.

223
00:34:08,648 --> 00:34:12,546
Of course you can. You need to improve your skills...

224
00:34:13,046 --> 00:34:16,254
...but you know how to control light.

225
00:34:17,244 --> 00:34:20,352
Bad paintings drain the life out of their objects...

226
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:25,640
...because they lack this quality.

227
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:33,146
This painting has it. You have a good eye for things,

228
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:37,544
the most important element to be a good painter.

229
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:40,942
You must have studied painting.

230
00:34:42,132 --> 00:34:44,631
A bit.

231
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,439
When? In Junior high?

232
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:51,437
Something like that. I quit though.

233
00:34:52,727 --> 00:34:57,335
No talent like you know who.

234
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:08,609
Jae-Ji, will you teach me how to paint?

235
00:35:11,698 --> 00:35:15,306
You can join me when you get bored of teaching.

236
00:35:17,395 --> 00:35:18,005
No?

237
00:35:19,194 --> 00:35:20,004
I...

238
00:35:21,893 --> 00:35:23,802
Is it a yes or no?

239
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:35,496
Allright, if you insist.
Promise that you do as I say.

240
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:42,493
Now you sound like Mad Dog.
We're mortal enemies.

241
00:35:43,982 --> 00:35:46,891
Don't tell me your his niece?

242
00:37:55,249 --> 00:37:57,158
Isn't this great Jin-Ju?

243
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:03,055
Miss Hur.

244
00:38:06,644 --> 00:38:08,553
What are you doing at my desk?

245
00:38:10,842 --> 00:38:13,850
Is this your desk?

246
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:16,449
Yes.

247
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:28,343
What brings you to our classroom?

248
00:38:30,532 --> 00:38:36,140
This used to be my senior year homeroom.
Brings back memories.

249
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:39,638
It's still pretty much the same.

250
00:38:41,827 --> 00:38:43,836
I didn't do that.

251
00:38:45,525 --> 00:38:48,824
I know...I did it.

252
00:38:50,623 --> 00:38:53,631
Was this your desk?

253
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:01,527
No, it was my friend's,... Jin-Ju's.

254
00:39:13,592 --> 00:39:14,791
Excuse me.

255
00:39:24,486 --> 00:39:28,495
Jin-Ju, this will be your desk forever.

256
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:27,388
Here.

257
00:41:34,974 --> 00:41:38,482
I found her address in my diary.
I want to meet her family.

258
00:41:41,471 --> 00:41:46,478
I explain later. It's really important that you find it.

259
00:41:46,868 --> 00:41:50,077
I'll drop by later to get it.
Bye mom.

260
00:41:52,465 --> 00:41:53,775
Looking for an old flame?

261
00:41:55,664 --> 00:41:58,872
No, a girlfriend from high school.

262
00:42:00,332 --> 00:42:02,841
Lost touch after graduation?

263
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,029
Kind of.

264
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:09,137
Can't call that friendship.

265
00:42:10,727 --> 00:42:13,935
Guess it happens when you're busy.

266
00:42:16,624 --> 00:42:21,132
She died in high school.

267
00:42:22,621 --> 00:42:28,728
Oh the student who committed suicide?
Was she your friend?

268
00:42:30,517 --> 00:42:34,625
Yes you were in Mrs. Park's class.

269
00:42:36,115 --> 00:42:38,423
But why are you looking for her family?

270
00:42:40,512 --> 00:42:42,821
Just curious.

271
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:47,719
Go to the school storage room.

272
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:54,616
Her ghost haunts the place.
You'll get to meet her in person.

273
00:42:57,504 --> 00:43:01,712
A couple of girls claim they've seen the ghost.

274
00:43:03,172 --> 00:43:07,879
She died in the art room. It used to be the art room.

275
00:43:10,068 --> 00:43:12,277
She must have jinxed the place.

276
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:16,375
Construction workers have been sick or hurt.

277
00:43:16,965 --> 00:43:19,164
That's why they can't tear down the place.

278
00:43:20,563 --> 00:43:24,072
Of all the places to die why choose school?

279
00:44:03,613 --> 00:44:06,111
Lim Ji-Oh, you piece of shit!

280
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:12,109
The vp almost had a heart attack
when he found this in the art room.

281
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:16,217
How would you explain this?

282
00:44:17,606 --> 00:44:21,514
Answer me!
Are you trying to fuck with me?

283
00:44:22,104 --> 00:44:22,813
No sir.

284
00:44:22,903 --> 00:44:24,313
Don't bullshit me!

285
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:33,098
You degenerate.

286
00:44:35,197 --> 00:44:41,105
You must be a psycho, a maniac.
Some parents you must have.

287
00:44:42,894 --> 00:44:46,602
Letting you create such a monstrosity.

288
00:44:49,391 --> 00:44:52,099
Get out of my sight. You disgust me!

289
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:54,198
Go.

290
00:44:55,588 --> 00:44:57,597
Go! Go!

291
00:44:59,556 --> 00:45:00,665
Go! Go! Go!

292
00:45:06,153 --> 00:45:07,462
I dare you.

293
00:45:13,249 --> 00:45:14,159
You psycho.

294
00:45:14,649 --> 00:45:16,658
You wanna die?

295
00:45:17,547 --> 00:45:20,456
Die! Die! You filth...

296
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,606
I told your mom not to worry.

297
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:06,904
She's sensitive about your first exam as a senior.

298
00:46:07,693 --> 00:46:09,402
If you have finished, I would like to excuse...

299
00:46:10,192 --> 00:46:12,701
What's the hurry?

300
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:15,100
I should get back to my books.

301
00:46:18,388 --> 00:46:22,996
Don't be a stranger to your own teacher.

302
00:46:23,785 --> 00:46:29,183
A woman should be like cotton candy. Understand?

303
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:35,490
So-Young.

304
00:46:44,775 --> 00:46:49,883
So-Young. Do you know where I can find
that painting of your classmate's?

305
00:46:51,872 --> 00:46:56,380
It must've been trashed.
Mad Dog chewed it to pieces.

306
00:46:57,669 --> 00:46:58,379
Mad Dog?

307
00:47:01,038 --> 00:47:04,746
I apologize.
That's what we call Mr. Oh.

308
00:47:06,135 --> 00:47:07,345
Shouldn't it be pervert?

309
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:11,942
Who's painting is it?

310
00:47:12,132 --> 00:47:13,442
Lim Ji-Oh...

311
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:16,540
I see...

312
00:47:22,027 --> 00:47:25,536
It's for the best. No more painting for me..

313
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:29,234
Giving up painting?

314
00:47:31,023 --> 00:47:32,333
Nowhere to paint.

315
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:41,928
There's one place.
The teachers will never know.

316
00:47:46,016 --> 00:47:46,726
Never mind.

317
00:47:52,713 --> 00:47:53,522
What?

318
00:47:54,812 --> 00:47:55,421
Let's go.

319
00:47:56,511 --> 00:47:59,520
Where?
I was just joking.

320
00:47:59,779 --> 00:48:03,088
You can't go there.

321
00:48:03,678 --> 00:48:05,387
Why not?

322
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:10,784
It's a mess, cobwebs and rats.

323
00:48:11,774 --> 00:48:13,383
We'll just take a look.

324
00:48:13,773 --> 00:48:18,081
Are you nuts? The place is haunted.

325
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:24,777
Then stay here.
I'll check for ghosts, okay?

326
00:49:11,125 --> 00:49:12,834
Who taught you to smoke?

327
00:49:15,523 --> 00:49:19,531
No one. Ever see me learn from anyone?

328
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:27,128
How brave of you.
Even the teachers are scared of this place.

329
00:49:29,416 --> 00:49:31,026
I prefer ghosts.

330
00:49:33,714 --> 00:49:38,222
Besides, didn't you know. I'm one myself.

331
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:45,119
So is this that infamous place?

332
00:49:48,207 --> 00:49:50,916
Then lend me some space. I need a place to paint.

333
00:49:52,805 --> 00:49:54,514
I've been banned from the art room.

334
00:49:57,803 --> 00:50:00,302
Don't you want to kill him?

335
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:05,379
Yeah, why don't you do the honors?

336
00:50:08,778 --> 00:50:12,686
You have to pay rent.
Finders keepers you know.

337
00:50:13,175 --> 00:50:15,184
Plus I'll keep my mouth shut.

338
00:50:16,674 --> 00:50:17,483
Rent?

339
00:50:19,173 --> 00:50:21,581
Aren't you supposed to be a rich bitch?

340
00:50:52,357 --> 00:50:54,466
I'm sorry.

341
00:50:55,855 --> 00:51:01,062
I came to ask you something and the door was open.

342
00:51:01,532 --> 00:51:03,741
It's okay. Have a seat.

343
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:10,938
Miss Hur, no need to feel guilty.

344
00:51:15,226 --> 00:51:19,734
Wow,... someone did quite a number on this.

345
00:51:21,723 --> 00:51:22,932
Why bring it here?

346
00:51:24,421 --> 00:51:28,529
I was curious. But the faculty lounge...

347
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:30,228
It is uncomfortable there.

348
00:51:30,918 --> 00:51:34,327
I guess I still feel like a student.

349
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:40,224
Think so?
Perhaps it's more than that.

350
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:03,593
Do you usually sketch student faces?

351
00:52:06,481 --> 00:52:08,290
I like their expressions.

352
00:52:10,979 --> 00:52:12,388
Didn't you have something to ask?

353
00:52:13,978 --> 00:52:18,186
Uh...about this painting.

354
00:52:21,074 --> 00:52:22,184
Hello there.

355
00:52:31,869 --> 00:52:32,978
You were saying.

356
00:52:35,707 --> 00:52:39,465
I was in the art club when I was in high school.

357
00:52:40,065 --> 00:52:42,974
So you used to paint.

358
00:52:43,363 --> 00:52:47,272
No, I sculpted faces in plaster.

359
00:52:47,661 --> 00:52:48,461
Sculpted?

360
00:52:49,361 --> 00:52:55,967
I used to do friend's faces as a hobby.

361
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:58,866
Must have been a great gift.

362
00:53:00,235 --> 00:53:03,244
I hope they were.

363
00:53:04,034 --> 00:53:05,343
Excuse me.

364
00:53:05,533 --> 00:53:07,042
Just a moment, Ji-Oh.

365
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:12,040
Here.

366
00:53:13,129 --> 00:53:14,239
Take it.

367
00:53:18,926 --> 00:53:20,636
Don't give up painting.

368
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:35,518
Class motto: KEEP YOUR PLACE

369
00:53:35,718 --> 00:53:37,428
Park So-Young. School rank, 1st place.

370
00:53:39,117 --> 00:53:40,426
Go ahead and give her a big hand.

371
00:53:46,413 --> 00:53:47,423
Kim Jung-Sook.

372
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:53,420
Your class rank is 2nd place, yet your school rank is 25th.

373
00:53:54,209 --> 00:54:00,317
What's the use of studying long hours
if you're not paying attention.

374
00:54:02,086 --> 00:54:07,293
If you don't have the brains, ask So-Young for some tips.

375
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:14,290
Class head.

376
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:14,890
Yes.

377
00:54:15,579 --> 00:54:17,888
Hand them out after I'm gone.
Dismissed!

378
00:54:18,378 --> 00:54:18,878
Attention.

379
00:54:19,377 --> 00:54:20,487
Don't bother.

380
00:54:21,177 --> 00:54:24,485
How can the class with the school's best student
have the worst score?

381
00:54:25,604 --> 00:54:29,013
Don't greet me until you improve the class average,
you hear!

382
00:55:02,537 --> 00:55:06,345
Do you have Mrs. Park's class agenda book?

383
00:55:07,135 --> 00:55:10,443
No, but perhaps the PE teacher would know.

384
00:55:19,928 --> 00:55:22,627
Night patrolling with female teachers...

385
00:55:23,527 --> 00:55:25,236
...the perfect solution for lonely nights.

386
00:55:25,826 --> 00:55:29,534
What do you think?
Not bad eh?

387
00:55:40,618 --> 00:55:41,328
What's wrong?

388
00:55:42,418 --> 00:55:44,527
Too much dust.
Look.

389
00:55:47,515 --> 00:55:51,423
You have a vain side to you, don't you?

390
00:55:53,112 --> 00:55:58,520
Aren't you scared of this place?
Ghosts and all...

391
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:06,796
On the contrary, I feel at ease.
Like home.

392
00:56:07,486 --> 00:56:08,195
Really?

393
00:56:09,485 --> 00:56:10,594
Why? Don't you?

394
00:56:11,384 --> 00:56:14,192
Anything you say.

395
00:58:22,881 --> 00:58:23,890
Strange.

396
00:58:40,172 --> 00:58:42,281
God damn it!

397
00:59:16,035 --> 00:59:17,944
What the...ow!

398
01:00:38,476 --> 01:00:39,085
Who's there?

399
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:50,880
Who are you?

400
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:54,980
Order.

401
01:02:56,070 --> 01:03:01,277
I'll be filling in for Mr. Oh today. So behave.

402
01:03:02,746 --> 01:03:05,055
He didn't come in today?

403
01:03:05,445 --> 01:03:06,655
Is anything wrong?

404
01:03:07,744 --> 01:03:09,553
How should I know?

405
01:03:12,742 --> 01:03:13,551
Kim Nuri.

406
01:03:14,441 --> 01:03:15,151
Choi An-Nat...

407
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:15,850
Here.

408
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:18,039
He must have fallen asleep in the sauna.

409
01:03:18,739 --> 01:03:21,048
Nothing can wake you there.

410
01:03:21,637 --> 01:03:23,936
You think a ghost got him?

411
01:03:24,036 --> 01:03:25,346
Kim Yung-Sook, Kim Yung-Sook.

412
01:03:28,034 --> 01:03:29,244
Is that her seat?

413
01:03:29,634 --> 01:03:30,143
Yes Sir.

414
01:03:30,233 --> 01:03:31,543
Is she absent or late?

415
01:03:31,633 --> 01:03:32,742
She hasn't come in yet.

416
01:03:33,832 --> 01:03:36,840
What gives? She's never late.

417
01:03:46,426 --> 01:03:51,033
It was Mad Dog's turn. The ghost got him.

418
01:03:52,723 --> 01:03:53,432
I'm positive.

419
01:03:55,421 --> 01:03:58,430
Where did you get that from?

420
01:04:01,688 --> 01:04:03,198
Do I still look like your friend?

421
01:04:53,773 --> 01:04:54,283
Hey...

422
01:04:54,763 --> 01:04:55,373
Stop it.

423
01:04:56,362 --> 01:04:59,271
Look, isn't that Jung-Sook?

424
01:05:05,927 --> 01:05:08,026
I'm sure he was killed last night.

425
01:05:09,826 --> 01:05:12,334
What makes you think so?

426
01:05:14,323 --> 01:05:20,231
I feel it. Just like the day Old Fox died.

427
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,429
I feel like I killed Mad Dog myself.

428
01:05:31,215 --> 01:05:37,822
You think I was possessed...and murdered Mad Dog?

429
01:05:39,511 --> 01:05:45,818
Whoever did it, aren't you glad that he's gone?

430
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:50,516
Look, I'm not joking. I'm serious.

431
01:05:54,204 --> 01:06:00,811
What if I'm really possessed...?

432
01:06:04,769 --> 01:06:07,578
Ji-Oh, don't be so serious.

433
01:06:12,066 --> 01:06:18,872
Don't worry. He's a die-hard.
He must be playing hooky.

434
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:33,366
Do as I say Eun-Young. You'll thank me one day.

435
01:06:37,853 --> 01:06:44,960
You won't regret it. You need to choose your friends.

436
01:06:48,448 --> 01:06:50,357
She's no good for you.

437
01:06:58,214 --> 01:06:59,423
Looking for this?

438
01:07:00,313 --> 01:07:00,922
Yes...

439
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:04,321
What for?

440
01:07:06,909 --> 01:07:09,718
It's only going to depress you.

441
01:07:38,594 --> 01:07:39,604
NAME; LIM JI-OH

442
01:07:42,093 --> 01:07:43,802
EVALUATION NOTES

443
01:07:49,089 --> 01:07:50,798
LACKS THE ABILITY AND WILL TO APPLY FOR COLLEGE

444
01:08:37,136 --> 01:08:39,945
Oh, it's you So-Young.

445
01:08:42,434 --> 01:08:43,943
Any problems?

446
01:08:44,433 --> 01:08:47,831
No,... nothing.

447
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:52,639
Did you say there were spare yearbooks?

448
01:08:52,929 --> 01:08:58,936
No, they suddenly disappeared.
So stupid.

449
01:08:59,995 --> 01:09:02,194
So typical of the school system.

450
01:09:03,993 --> 01:09:06,102
Have you found the painting?

451
01:09:07,392 --> 01:09:07,901
Huh?

452
01:09:07,991 --> 01:09:10,500
Of Ji-Oh's. You wanted to see it.

453
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:17,697
Oh yes, I did.
Do you know Ji-Oh well?

454
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:20,795
Not much. She sits next to me.

455
01:09:22,085 --> 01:09:22,894
Why?

456
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:27,392
Nothing special, apart from her ability to call the spirits.

457
01:09:30,381 --> 01:09:31,390
Call the spirits?

458
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:34,179
Probably her way of getting attention.

459
01:09:35,978 --> 01:09:41,086
If you're so curious, she's in the store room, painting...

460
01:09:59,117 --> 01:10:00,426
What's this noise?

461
01:10:10,481 --> 01:10:11,581
What are you doing?

462
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:17,088
Get your ass over here.

463
01:10:20,277 --> 01:10:22,686
Now.
I said now!

464
01:12:27,356 --> 01:12:28,565
What brings you here?

465
01:12:33,253 --> 01:12:34,462
So now you're following me.

466
01:12:38,151 --> 01:12:38,860
Forget it.

467
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:46,157
I have nothing against you. Never avoided you either.

468
01:12:49,345 --> 01:12:51,644
Let's just say we're different.

469
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:58,951
Meet me after evening studies.

470
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:03,429
Why?

471
01:13:06,717 --> 01:13:08,326
Can't we talk now?

472
01:13:12,214 --> 01:13:14,123
Is your sister coming to pick you up?

473
01:13:17,212 --> 01:13:18,022
Sister?

474
01:13:19,711 --> 01:13:23,419
Sorry, was that your stepmother?

475
01:13:25,508 --> 01:13:27,517
She looks so young.

476
01:13:32,904 --> 01:13:33,814
Kim Jung-Sook,...

477
01:13:35,803 --> 01:13:39,011
mind your own business.

478
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,208
Is your real mom still in the looney bin?

479
01:13:46,898 --> 01:13:50,706
Bitch. To think I took pity on you.

480
01:13:53,594 --> 01:13:58,502
You think you could beat me? Guess again.

481
01:14:01,071 --> 01:14:06,768
You don't have what it takes. We're different.

482
01:14:08,567 --> 01:14:12,765
Got it...?
Loser!

483
01:14:41,252 --> 01:14:44,750
Your Mother will save you.
After all she's a shaman.

484
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:50,857
I never spread those rumors about your mom.

485
01:14:52,546 --> 01:14:53,956
It was Mrs. Park who told me.

486
01:14:57,044 --> 01:15:02,451
I was scared of being ostracized for taking your side.

487
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:09,628
I never thought that anything bad would happen...

488
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:30,718
She threatened to expel you for my sake,
if I kept seeing you...

489
01:15:31,907 --> 01:15:33,017
I was afraid.

490
01:15:39,604 --> 01:15:40,713
I'm so sorry Jin-Ju.

491
01:16:20,764 --> 01:16:21,574
TO MY BEST FRIEND,
EUN-YOUNG, FROM JIN-JU

492
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:33,368
Does it look like you Jin-Ju?
Don't ever loose it.

493
01:17:18,516 --> 01:17:19,726
I told you I'm Ji-Oh.

494
01:17:20,715 --> 01:17:24,723
Then where did you get those bells?

495
01:17:25,313 --> 01:17:26,722
A friend gave them to me.

496
01:17:27,312 --> 01:17:28,421
Jin-Ju is dead.

497
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:38,717
This is where she died 9 years ago.
I saw her body with my own eyes.

498
01:17:40,905 --> 01:17:43,414
She couldn't have given those bells to you.

499
01:17:46,703 --> 01:17:51,410
What are you talking about?
These are from Jae-Yi. Yoon Jae-Yi.

500
01:19:34,811 --> 01:19:36,920
What's wrong?
What happened?

501
01:21:34,114 --> 01:21:36,123
TO MY BEST FRIEND, JIN-JU,
FROM EUN_YOUNG, 89

502
01:23:24,521 --> 01:23:27,329
We used to be close during our freshman year.

503
01:23:30,018 --> 01:23:32,217
We would share our most private secrets.

504
01:23:34,216 --> 01:23:42,722
The teachers started comparing us and we drifted apart.

505
01:23:48,409 --> 01:23:50,518
She became distant,...

506
01:23:56,206 --> 01:23:58,315
I never reached out to her...

507
01:24:06,781 --> 01:24:07,490
But...

508
01:24:11,178 --> 01:24:16,386
But, I never thought...
It would come to this.

509
01:24:18,775 --> 01:24:20,784
It's all my fault.

510
01:26:41,266 --> 01:26:42,376
KANG HYUN-JOO

511
01:27:07,434 --> 01:27:09,443
PARK JI-SUNG

512
01:27:45,915 --> 01:27:47,924
You should never have returned.

513
01:27:53,912 --> 01:27:59,409
EUN-YOUNG HAS RETURNED AS A TEACHER

514
01:28:00,478 --> 01:28:04,287
ONCE AGAIN MRS. PARK HAS BECOME THE HOMEROOM TEACHER

515
01:28:08,475 --> 01:28:10,983
JI-OH HASN'T DESERTED ME

516
01:28:41,159 --> 01:28:49,265
You're not Jae-Yi, nor are you Jin-Ju.

517
01:28:51,354 --> 01:28:52,454
You're not Eun Young.

518
01:28:55,952 --> 01:29:00,260
I've always been and still am Eun-Young.

519
01:29:03,018 --> 01:29:07,027
You can never be the old Eun-Young.

520
01:29:08,516 --> 01:29:10,425
You'll become just like Old Fox.

521
01:29:11,414 --> 01:29:12,124
You're wrong.

522
01:29:15,313 --> 01:29:19,511
I'm still Jin-Ju's friend, Eun-Young.

523
01:29:23,309 --> 01:29:24,318
It's no use now.

524
01:29:33,804 --> 01:29:35,313
I don't want to hurt you,

525
01:29:40,001 --> 01:29:41,500
but I don't have a choice.

526
01:29:51,995 --> 01:29:53,104
Jae-Yi.

527
01:32:27,830 --> 01:32:29,340
You could never kill me.

528
01:32:29,529 --> 01:32:31,738
Without you, I can continu being a student.

529
01:32:32,328 --> 01:32:32,938
Stop it...

530
01:32:34,827 --> 01:32:39,625
What good would it do?
You're a ghost, not a student anymore!

531
01:32:41,124 --> 01:32:43,033
At first, I just wanted to have a yearbook.

532
01:32:44,322 --> 01:32:48,131
But then I wanted more. I needed a friend...

533
01:32:49,220 --> 01:32:51,529
who really understood and cared about me...

534
01:32:52,119 --> 01:32:54,527
But not this way!

535
01:32:57,316 --> 01:32:58,426
You're not human!

536
01:33:05,592 --> 01:33:12,399
I only had to keep the classroom full, like these desks.

537
01:33:15,188 --> 01:33:16,597
Nothing more.

538
01:33:19,286 --> 01:33:24,193
For the past 9 years, no one suspected my identity.

539
01:33:26,082 --> 01:33:28,091
Nobody cared if I was there or not.

540
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:31,790
Whether I was human or not, it didn't matter.

541
01:33:32,979 --> 01:33:36,587
I just had to fill the empty seats,...

542
01:33:38,077 --> 01:33:40,186
and be there during headcounts.

543
01:33:42,275 --> 01:33:43,284
I understand.

544
01:33:45,873 --> 01:33:46,982
But you have to stop now.

545
01:33:47,872 --> 01:33:52,480
You don't get it now that you're a teacher...

546
01:33:54,469 --> 01:33:56,778
What happened to you will never happen again.

547
01:33:57,667 --> 01:34:04,674
It always has and always will.

548
01:34:06,543 --> 01:34:10,651
Trust me Jin-Ju. I'll do my best.

549
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:14,049
I will. Trust me.

550
01:34:14,839 --> 01:34:17,448
There's only so much a teacher can do.

551
01:34:25,734 --> 01:34:29,142
Stop it Jae-Yi.
Stop!

552
01:34:34,630 --> 01:34:39,037
I don't care if you're a ghost or not.

553
01:34:41,326 --> 01:34:43,335
But you've gone too far this time.

554
01:34:48,123 --> 01:34:56,929
Don't worry Ji-Oh.
Everything will go back to normal.

555
01:34:58,598 --> 01:35:03,306
We can never...go back.

556
01:35:04,595 --> 01:35:05,795
Don't worry Ji-Oh.

557
01:35:08,293 --> 01:35:09,603
You have to stop.

558
01:35:12,691 --> 01:35:19,898
I can't let you continu harming the teachers, for my sake.

559
01:35:21,087 --> 01:35:22,996
I've waited so long for you.

560
01:35:26,185 --> 01:35:27,494
I can't give up now.

561
01:35:28,384 --> 01:35:29,293
Stop!

562
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:37,689
It's no use Ji-Oh.

563
01:35:39,478 --> 01:35:40,978
Lay a finger on her and I'm gone.

564
01:35:44,576 --> 01:35:49,284
Stop the horrors.
I can understand you now.

565
01:35:50,873 --> 01:35:55,081
But the bloodshed has to end.

566
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:19,349
So many things I wanted to do.

567
01:36:23,337 --> 01:36:29,345
I pined for a friend...
who would reach out to me...

568
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:31,443
Now I've met that friend...

569
01:36:36,331 --> 01:36:40,639
I love you too,...really.

570
01:36:42,628 --> 01:36:51,034
But please stop...
Leave the rest to us.

571
01:36:54,323 --> 01:36:55,732
Rest in peace Jae-Yi.

572
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:09,095
I never intended to hurt anyone.
I just wanted a friend...

573
01:37:09,695 --> 01:37:14,403
and leave with good memories.
That's all...

574
01:37:17,691 --> 01:37:20,700
I can't stay like this,...

575
01:37:25,388 --> 01:37:26,697
cause I'm not human.

576
01:37:32,684 --> 01:37:33,994
I'm so sorry.

577
01:37:38,581 --> 01:37:45,678
We'll never forget you.

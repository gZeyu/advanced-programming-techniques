11
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,170
I don't know this number.

12
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,640
Hello?

13
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,290
It's Gabi, you don't have to use the fake voice.

14
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,520
I'm back from China and I had an amazing time!

15
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,740
Oh, my god, what is wrong with you?

16
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,570
I haven't heard from you in three weeks!

17
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,620
I'm sorry, but do you know

18
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,450
how much international cell phone plans cost?

19
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,460
Thousands! You can't even check your messages.

20
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,410
Wait a second, you never checked your messages?

21
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,320
Uh, no. Why? Did you leave me one?

22
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,610
No. Uh, but if someone did, when would you be hearing them?

23
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,240
Uh, when I get my luggage.

24
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,540
Come pick me up. I gotta go.

25
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,940
This guy said I could borrow his phone

26
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,180
if I carried his bag through customs,

27
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,730
and I just read a sign that said I should not do that.

28
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,850
Don't know this number.

29
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,960
Hello?

30
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,080
Josh, it's Sofia.

31
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,410
Gabi's back from China. She just called me from the airport,

32
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,350
and she never got your message.

33
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,710
W-what?

34
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,090
Her phone was off the whole time.

35
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,590
Look, she didn't reject you, she just never got your message.

36
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,810
Oh my god, then she never has to hear it!

37
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,820
Why would you not want her to hear it?

38
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,340
Because I'm a human being who can experience shame?

39
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,960
Look, I've been racking my brain

40
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,670
trying to figure out a way to make this less awkward

41
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,760
when I see her, and now I don't have to.

42
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,610
Yes, you do! She has a right to hear that message!

43
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,290
That long, awkward message.

44
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,280
No. She's moved on, I've moved on, everything's changed.

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,870
What do you mean "everything's changed"?

46
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,330
Happy two-week anniversary.

47
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,050
Who's that?

48
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,480
Who is that?

49
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,830
I'll meet you at the airport in 15 minutes.

50
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,040
I'll meet you at the airport in 16 minutes.

51
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,240
Josh, you have to tell her how you feel.

52
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,610
No, I don't.

53
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,460
That was so three weeks ago.

54
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,220
But she's going to hear the message

55
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,160
when she turns on her phone anyway.

56
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,520
Not if I get her a new phone.

57
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,490
How's that gonna happen?

58
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,320
Because in every airport, there's a...

59
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,010
I love America.

61
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,300
Sofia!

62
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,880
Welcome home! It's so good to see you!

64
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,850
You too!

65
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,340
Though I will miss being the only blonde

67
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,750
in a 10-mile radius.

68
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,270
So, what's going on? What did I miss?

70
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,020
Nothing! Nothing, everybody shut up.

71
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,530
Josh, hi! What are you doing here?

72
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,240
What are any of us doing here?

73
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,290
Really, that's the question that haunts me every day.

74
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
So, how was it? Best time of your life?

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,540
Killer, awesome, amazing?

76
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,560
Yes, it was absolutely perfect.

77
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,510
Hear that, Sofia?

78
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,940
Yes, I do.

79
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,880
Perfect because you like Cooper, or China?

80
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,740
Both.

81
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,750
No, pick one. You have to pick one.

82
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,420
Uh, okay. Cooper then.

83
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,230
I mean, he's amazing. He's sexy, he's confident,

84
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,680
and he knows everything about China.

85
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,940
Chinese people were asking him

86
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,740
where to find the best Chinese food.

87
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,180
What she's saying is she's happy with Cooper.

88
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,270
So, there's nothing left to say except, shwah!

89
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,440
A new phone?

90
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,900
Why'd you do that? I have mine right here.

91
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,900
You don't have to turn that on, no.

92
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,120
Why not?

93
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
While you were gone,

94
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,980
there was a phone virus that swept the country.

95
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,640
People everywhere were talking face-to-face. It was horrible.

96
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,340
But, hey, no worries.

97
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,130
I'll just transfer the stuff

98
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,300
from your old phone to your new phone.

99
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,840
You can grab it tomorrow when you come to work,

100
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,230
and then you can meet Jilly.

101
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,300
Jilly! Aww, did you get a kitty?

102
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,860
No. I got a girlfriend.

103
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,880
That was fast.

104
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,370
No, me and Jilly met a while ago at this tech conference,

105
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,500
which makes her sound kind of nerdy,

106
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,930
but she's not, she's just super smart,

107
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,110
and like, really hot. Did I mention she's a beauty queen?

108
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,710
Anyway, she found out me and Caroline broke up,

109
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,920
and she sent me this Facebook message, and the rest is history.

110
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,490
Well, would you look at that, we are all so happy!

111
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,270
I know, right? Like, you have Cooper, I have Jilly,

112
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,300
- Sofia has-- - A new phone.

113
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,110
As long as you keep it on silent.

114
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,610
Oh, so that's how he gets his hair to stand on end.

115
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,280
I figured he just looked at himself in the mirror naked.

116
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,780
By the way, Yolanda, I've been meaning to thank you.

117
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,590
For what?

118
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,110
Not wearing a skirt.

119
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,320
All right, done.

120
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,280
I just transferred everything

121
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,400
from Gabi's old phone onto my laptop,

122
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,740
then loaded it onto her new phone.

123
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,690
Except that awkward message, which now no one will hear.

124
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,130
After I called off my wedding,

125
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,760
you're the one I wanted to see, Gabi.

126
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,770
I even drove to your house climbed up your fire escape with roses

127
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,670
to Pretty Woman you.

128
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,300
Now, no one will hear it.

129
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,700
Ooh, here comes that fine window washer.

130
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,810
He can squeegee me any day.

131
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,260
Please, like you have a chance.

132
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,150
Half the women in the building want to get "squeegeed" by him.

133
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,760
Get out.

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,290
Hi!

135
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,900
You are hot.

136
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,920
Hey, guys!

137
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,300
Back from China, never looked finah.

138
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,460
Seems like you've been gone forever, baby!

139
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,120
Really? It already seems like you've been back forever.

140
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,000
So, how was your trip?

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,810
China was amazing! Everywhere we went,

142
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,410
they treated us like royalty.

143
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,290
Of course, they all thought I was Carrie Underwood.

145
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,440
Here you go.

146
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,930
I transferred all your info.

147
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,870
And all the messages you need to hear are in this phone.

148
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,700
Great. Okay, thanks, Josh.

149
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,860
Is this a welcome back breakfast?

150
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,750
Kinda. This magnificent feast is courtesy of Jilly.

151
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,600
The new girlfriend.

152
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,670
The one and only.

153
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,470
You must be Gabi. Aren't you cute as a button!

154
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,060
Hi, it's really nice to meet you.

155
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:27,970
I borrowed one of your aprons,

156
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,520
- I hope you don't mind. - Oh, of course not.

157
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,910
Good. Now, come sit your sweet buns down

158
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,070
and have some of my sweet buns while they're still warm.

159
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,070
Okay.

160
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,130
I always thought I hated all girls who cooked.

161
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,720
Turns out, just you.

162
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,670
These are really good.

163
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,560
You know, whenever I make waffles, I usually make--

164
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,680
Fried chicken?

165
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,700
Good thing, I've been going to the gym.

166
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,520
Seems like everybody really loves your cooking.

167
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,900
Among other things, huh?

168
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,950
Okay. Well, um...

169
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,910
Thanks for keeping everybody well-fed, Jilly,

170
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,530
But I think I'll just take it from here.

171
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,980
All right, we're confirmed.

172
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,460
That development team from Austin

173
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,260
is coming here for dinner tomorrow night.

174
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,940
Excellent! Any thoughts on the menu?

175
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,660
How about chicken pot pie?

176
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,730
Sorry. I just got so used to cooking for Josh,

177
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,100
I thought he was talking to me.

178
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,730
No, he was talking to me, 'cause, you know, I'm the chef.

179
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,090
Of course you are,

180
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,010
but I don't see why Jilly can't make the dinner.

181
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,030
Because it's my job to cook the dinner?

182
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,700
But, you've been gone for three weeks.

183
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,620
Well, what does that mean?

184
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,230
You know, things changed a little bit.

185
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,070
Since you went on vacation

186
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,590
with your boyfriend to China for three weeks.

187
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,350
But, you said I could go.

188
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,070
I said you could go because you asked me.

189
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,730
Okay, but now I'm back.

190
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,430
And now I have a girlfriend, and she likes to cook.

191
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,090
So, if she wants to make the dinner, she can.

192
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,560
Aww, thanks, baby.

193
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,930
Fun.

194
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,480
Why can't you date somebody who can do my job?

195
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,510
You are never gonna believe what Josh just told me.

196
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,380
Oh, thank God, finally!

197
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,950
You know?

198
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:12,310
I know that it's something big, and that I don't know it.

199
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,290
So, tell me.

200
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,800
Josh is having a business dinner tomorrow night,

201
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,900
and Jilly wants to cook it,

202
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,420
and he's letting her.

203
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,960
That's what this is about? Jilly?

204
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,220
Yeah, can't you see? She's moving in on my territory!

205
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,420
With her sweet buns and that adorable accent,

206
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,820
argh, I hate her!

207
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,150
Your territory? I thought you were over Josh?

208
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,860
You picked Cooper. You're happy with Cooper.

209
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,460
Yes, I am happy with Cooper

210
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,740
and I'm glad I picked Cooper,

211
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,660
I'm just not glad that Josh picked Jilly.

212
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,940
I mean, she's trying to take over my job!

213
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,250
Oh, my God. Well, I want to hear all about it.

214
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,060
But first, can you take your shoes off

215
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,020
and put them on the new shoe rack?

216
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,890
I started it while you were gone, so...

217
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,460
God, has everything changed since I left?

218
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,780
Okay, seriously, Gabi. Shoes.

219
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,500
I mean, I'm gone three weeks,

220
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,350
and Josh has a girlfriend, and you have a shoe rack.

221
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,480
Okay, it is just one dinner.

222
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,330
No. No, no, no.

223
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,380
First it's one dinner, then it's two,

224
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,940
then it's bye-bye Gabi, and she's cooking for him all the time!

225
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,700
This is a gateway dinner!

226
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,130
Well, you are cracked out on jet lag, and you need some sleep.

227
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,840
No. No, you know what I need?

228
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,440
I need to roll Jilly up in a carpet

229
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,900
and toss her off a bridge!

230
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,200
Yes, now I hear it.

231
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,220
I am cracked out on jet lag.

232
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,750
I'm gonna call Cooper, and take a little nap.

233
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,220
Hey, Gabi, could you, um... take your--

234
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,430
Thank you.

235
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,650
You okay, sugar?

236
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,420
I'm sorry.

237
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,460
Just having a hard time sleeping.

238
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,480
I know what's going on.

239
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,560
Though, I'm afraid to say it

240
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,320
because I don't want you to think I'm insecure. But...

241
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,060
I'm insecure.

242
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,520
You?

243
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,720
What are you insecure about?

244
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,750
The truth is, it's only been three weeks,

245
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,620
and I just feel like you might still be hung up on her.

246
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,310
Trust me. I'm over her.

247
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,140
She's moved on, I've moved on.

248
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,850
It's okay to say her name.

249
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,290
Your ex-fiancée Caroline.

250
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,420
Caroline?

251
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,510
Yes. Caroline.

252
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,030
That's who I'm over. Very over.

253
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,880
From now on, it's just the two of us.

254
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,440
And whoever's trying to break in downstairs.

255
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,280
Gabi, what are you doing here? It's 3:00 in the morning.

256
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,580
Not in China.

257
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,770
And, you know what they say,

258
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,610
the early bird gets to cook the bird.

259
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,090
Right?

260
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,280
No one says that.

261
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,280
We've discussed this.

262
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,570
My girlfriend is cooking the dinner.

263
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,400
Your "girlfriend."

264
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,630
Why did you put my girlfriend in quotes?

265
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,400
Why did you put my girlfriend in quotes?

266
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,270
I don't know, Josh,

267
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,150
maybe because three weeks ago you were engaged,

268
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,430
and now you have a...

269
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,340
First of all, this is none of your business, you are my chef.

270
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,790
If I am your chef, then I should be making the dinner.

271
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,840
Kind of looks like you are making the dinner.

272
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,750
I am? Oh, thank you!

273
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,640
She is?

274
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,030
No, she's not.

275
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,350
She's going home.

276
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,750
We're going to bed.

277
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,090
Sweetie, just give me one second.

278
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,330
I'll be up in a jiff.

279
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,540
Hon, I'm sorry that I worried you so much

280
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,190
you felt like you had to come over here.

281
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,640
But, here's the thing. Josh and I are in a new relationship,

282
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,970
and I think he may be a little hung up on his ex still,

283
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,280
so I'm using every biscuit in my basket to win him over.

284
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,800
You understand, right?

285
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,570
I do, yeah, I totally do.

286
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,560
But, here's my thing: I need this job.

287
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,440
Well, appears we have a situation.

288
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,270
Appears we do.

289
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,470
How do you suggest we remedy that?

290
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,830
Well, how about we both cook the dinner

291
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,960
and we see which one Josh likes the best.

292
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,050
If you're asking for a cook-off, you got one.

293
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,460
Okay, well, if I win, then I cook the dinner,

294
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,980
and you stay out of my kitchen.

295
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,910
And if I win, I cook the dinner,

296
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,950
and any other dinner I want to from now on.

297
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,180
In Josh's kitchen.

298
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,840
- Game on! - So on!

299
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,110
Let's wait till the sun comes up.

300
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,420
- Good idea. - Okay.

301
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,550
Ooh, something smells good in here.

302
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,900
Thank you.

303
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,780
She was talking to me!

304
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,400
Crazy white girls.

305
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,140
Look at you.

306
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,550
I don't know who's working harder, you or those spanx.

307
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,300
The spanx.

308
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,860
I am one popcorn shrimp away from blowing a button

309
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,240
and killing the man.

310
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,330
I still don't know how you got a date

311
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,600
with the world's sexiest window washer.

312
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,580
We have a connection.

313
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,280
We were able to communicate with just our hands.

314
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,660
Oh, that's cute, window man.

315
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,240
But, let's talk with our voices now.

316
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,350
We can talk with our hands later.

317
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,980
You know I'm deaf, right?

318
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,710
No.

319
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,720
No, I did not.

320
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,750
Hold on.

321
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,210
He's deaf. What do I do?

322
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,610
Go out with him. He's hot.

323
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,790
But, I've never been out with a deaf guy before.

324
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,540
So? You've never been out with a hot guy before.

325
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,940
How are we supposed to communicate?

326
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,480
Why are we whispering? He can't hear us.

327
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,800
I can read lips, mamacita.

328
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,030
Well, look at that, you finally have a date who can read.

329
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,960
Here's the research on the guys coming to dinner tonight.

330
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,470
Only one of them is cute.

331
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,000
Did you figure out a way to make sure

332
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,860
I pick Jilly's pie over Gabi's pie?

333
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,810
Can we please stop talking about their pies?

335
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,380
It's making me dry heave.

336
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,070
I'm serious.

337
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,910
I need to pick Jilly's.

338
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,090
It's easy. Jilly's using the aubergine ramekin,

339
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,620
Gabi's using the chartreuse.

340
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,910
Can you say that again in hetero?

341
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,370
Jilly's purple, Gabi's green.

342
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,050
And a ramekin's a small dish you bake in.

343
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,080
Gotcha.

344
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,710
Why does it matter who wins?

345
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,630
Because Jilly's starting to feel insecure.

346
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,290
She's worried that I'm not over Gabi.

347
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,980
Caroline. She's worried I'm not over Caroline.

348
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,830
So, I have to pick Jilly's pie to prove that I'm into Gabi.

349
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,880
Jilly! I'm into Jilly! Jilly, Jilly!

350
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,020
Who's green again?

351
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,630
Okay, first we have to blindfold you.

352
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,850
No. Why do I have to be blindfolded?

353
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,260
Didn't seem to bother you last night.

354
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,830
This is so not that.

355
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,490
Okay, here we go.

356
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,460
So good.

357
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,910
And, number two.

358
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,360
Also delicious.

359
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,840
So, which do you choose?

360
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,890
Which one do I choose?

361
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,260
Just pick one!

362
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,110
Fine.

363
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,320
I... pick...

364
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,230
the first one.

365
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,230
- That's mine. - What?

366
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,980
I won! I beat a professional chef.

367
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,810
You picked mine, sweetie!

368
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:29,910
Thank god.

369
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,600
Well, congrats. You won fair and square.

370
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,060
Chin up, Gabi. There's no shame in being runner-up.

371
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,510
Or so I've been told.

372
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,570
Gabi, wait.

373
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,060
Here.

374
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,100
Take one of my pies.

376
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,380
It looks like you could use a little bit of comfort food.

377
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,240
Thanks.

378
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,660
You're back early. It didn't work out?

379
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,810
No, it did not.

380
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,420
Well, maybe next time you should date a blind guy.

381
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,580
What happened?

382
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,730
When the check came, he wanted to go dutch.

383
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,230
I can't blame him. I've seen how much you can eat.

384
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,960
And then, he paid for his half with a two-for-one coupon.

385
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,760
You gotta dump his cheap, but well-sculpted ass.

386
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,830
I can't. He'll think I'm prejudiced against the deaf.

387
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,870
But, I'm just prejudiced against the cheap.

388
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,190
Yeah. If a man wants your milk,

389
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,770
he's gotta buy the whole cow.

390
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,020
Except for no-dairy Gary, I'd say dinner was a hit.

391
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,700
I'd say you were a hit.

392
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,700
I like the music you picked.

393
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,310
Really? Let's turn it up.

394
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,770
May I have this dance, m'lady?

395
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,170
Aww, handsome, and he can dance.

396
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,690
Wait till thriller comes on.

397
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,860
Hey, Gabi, I'm calling you from...

398
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,630
- No, no, no, no! - The airport, actually.

399
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,100
Last night, after I called off my wedding,

400
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,570
- Wrong song. - You're the one I wanted to see.

401
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,430
- This is... - I even drove to your house

402
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,980
and climbed up your fire escape with roses to--

403
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,910
So, where were we?

404
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,830
- Oh, my god! - No, I can explain!

405
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,470
It's not Caroline you're still hung up on, it's Gabi.

406
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,800
No! No, no, no, no. Okay, no, no, no.

407
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,250
You don't understand.

408
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,030
The reason why that's on my laptop,

409
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,820
is because I took it off her phone.

410
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,600
See, I didn't want her to listen to

411
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,090
it because I'm so happy with you.

412
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,830
So, you don't have feelings for Gabi?

413
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,120
That's what I thought.

414
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,070
Josh, you are adorable and a good man,

415
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,120
But I am never runner-up.

416
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,650
Don't go.

417
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,640
I'll be fine.

418
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,670
Goodbye, Josh.

419
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,690
Goodbye, Gabi. Jilly!

420
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,400
I could be a valet parker.

421
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,210
Really? Can you drive a stick?

422
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,660
No.

423
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,180
Can you parallel park?

424
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,060
No.

425
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,800
Then, can you be a valet parker?

426
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,160
No.

427
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,340
God, what happened? Everything was so perfect.

428
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,240
I had an amazing time in China, I had a great time with Cooper,

429
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,790
I had a job.

430
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,540
Hey, Gabi, it's Josh, I need to talk to you.

431
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,830
Go ahead. Get it over with quick.

432
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,090
I'm fired, right?

433
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,580
You're not fired.

434
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,740
How could you not fire me? I would fire me!

435
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,420
I can't even cook a pot pie better than a civilian.

436
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,520
Gabi, stop.

437
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,140
I picked hers on purpose.

438
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,710
Nice try. It was a blind taste test.

439
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,820
And I knew which one was yours.

440
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,770
- How? - Bacon in the crust.

441
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,080
Signature Gabi move.

442
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,370
Also, no onions, 'cause I hate them.

443
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,220
Extra peas, 'cause I love them.

444
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,310
You did know.

445
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,980
Well, then why did you pick hers?

446
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,550
For the sex reasons.

447
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,070
I just really wanted things to work out with Jilly.

448
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,750
What do you mean "wanted"? What happened?

449
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,020
We broke up.

450
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,380
What! Why?

451
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,350
She didn't like my music.

452
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,650
And I also think that maybe it was a little too soon for me

453
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,360
to have a "girlfriend."

454
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,760
Aww, Josh.

455
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,230
Someday, you're gonna find a girlfriend

456
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,950
you don't have to put quotes around.

457
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,100
I mean, somebody who's incredible for you,

458
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,240
who totally gets you, and who, hopefully, can't cook.

459
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,280
- You think so? - Yeah.

460
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,260
You're gonna find somebody who's perfect for you.

461
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,450
Just like me and Cooper.

462
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,720
Just like you and Cooper.

463
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,980
Yeah.

464
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,420
Hey, do you want to see pictures of my trip to China with Cooper?

465
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,980
Not even a little.

466
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,190
Okay, I just finished my breakup text.

467
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,750
How does this sound?

468
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,900
George, it was really nice to meet you,

469
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,530
but I have to be honest,

470
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,110
I have three months to live.

471
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,190
And it will be cruel to give you so much,

472
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,930
only to take it away.

473
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,420
It's good, really really good.

474
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,860
So you don't think he'll be too crushed?

475
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,580
Uhhh... no, I think he'll be okay.

我們配不上這甘藍
We don't even deserve this kale.

14

我想甘藍[殺]了自己

22
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,070
居然還有空吹噓自己
she certainly had plenty of time to brag about herself.

23
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,780
難以置信我們23歲時就已經失敗了
I can't believe we're 23 and already washed up.

24

我不認識什么成功人士

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,910
上一層樓是什么

45
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,900
你記得你讀過的那些美食文章嗎
You know all those food articles you read about?

46
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,190
你說  我也可以寫得出
You're like, "I could've written that,"

47
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,490
但你什么也沒寫
but you never write anything?

48
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,160
是啊  我很擅長
Yeah, I'm really good at that.

49
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,670
不如你為她的雜志寫一篇美食文章吧
Well, why don't you write a food article for her magazine?

50
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,220
好主意  索菲亞
That is a great idea, Sofia.

51

你是我認識的最聰明的廢柴

102
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,420
他不該意識到你有多沒價值嗎
Shouldn't he realize how worthless you are?

103
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,160
少來了
Oh, stop it.

104
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,480

All you got to do is walk in there and ask for a raise.

但我小時候
But, when I was a kid,

112
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,320
我就有一次要求多給點零花錢

113
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,410
我爸就瘋了

我是個很棒的大廚
I am a great chef.

145
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,090
我可以坐在這里
I could sit here and toss out

146
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,710
說出一堆可以寫的很棒的食物

147

- Wait, did you just say... pot cakes? - No.

151
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,940
也許吧
Maybe.

152
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,340
-這主意很棒  -所以我才說
- That's a fantastic idea. - Which is why I said it.

153
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,770
大麻食物現在很流行
Pot edibles are so hot right now.

154
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,860
是啊
Yeah. Yeah they are.

155
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,200
大家都在說它
Everybody's talking about it,

156
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,950
然后忘記了自己在說什么
then forgetting what they're talking about.

157
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,770
不幸的是  這毀掉了食物的味道
Unfortunately, it ruins the way food tastes.

158
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,020
很難烹飪
It's hard to cook with.

159
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,900
相信我  沒人在我的食物中嘗到過大麻的味道
Trust me, no one has ever tasted pot in any of my food.

160
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,870
好吧  兩天內給我
Okay, get me a killer 500-word piece

161
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,460

- Really? - No, I'm gonna need two.

165
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,640
說成功不會在一夜之間發生的人
Whoever said success doesn't happen overnight

166
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,530
肯定沒跟我過過夜

167
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,960
洛根想要我給她的雜志寫篇文章

天啊  我要跟經理合伙人開會
Oh my god. I got a meeting with one of the managing partners

169
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,800
談談我的升職問題
to talk about a promotion.

170
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,990
好棒  我們買一大袋大麻來慶祝吧
That's amazing. Let's celebrate by buying a big bag of marijuana.

171
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,590
你說啥
Uh, what?

172
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,500
我的文章內容是關于烹飪大麻的
My article's about cooking with pot.

173
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,390
-大麻  -沒錯
- Pot? - Yeah.

174
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,280
加比  說真的  你從沒做過大麻食物
Gabi. Seriously, you've never cooked with pot.

175
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,840
的確  我也不知道怎么用襪子粉刷
Yeah, I didn't know how to paint with socks either,

176
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,310
可我們的廁所刷得不錯啊
but our bathroom turned out great.

177
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,610
知道嗎  你說得對  看看我們
You know what? You're right. Look at us.

178
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,870
我們自我鞭策  世界的大門就對我們敞開了
We push ourselves and the world opens up.

179
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,040
說到毒販子[推手]
Speaking of pushers,

180
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,990
"十元"戴夫還住在樓下嗎
does dime-bag Dave still live downstairs?

181
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,000
他搬走了  搬去監獄住了
No, he moved. To jail.

182
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,140
要是你想做這道菜  至少別走歪路
If you're gonna do it, at least do it honestly.

183
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,160
裝病去搞一張藥用大麻卡
Fake an illness and get a cannabis card

184
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,800
我奶奶就是這么做的
like my nana did.

185
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,460
不知道行不行  我只會在認識的人面前撒謊
I don't know. I'm only good at lying to people I know.

186
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,820
這事讓我開始感到有點緊張焦慮了
I'm starting to get nervous and anxious about this.

187
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,310
太好了  我們只要跟醫生說
That's perfect. Just tell the doctor

188
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,340
你需要大麻來緩解緊張情緒
you need weed to calm your nerves.

189
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,980
真是個好主意
Hey, that's a great idea.

190
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,880
那我就不用撒謊了
Then I won't be lying.

191
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,940
但我不撒謊的話就不會緊張
But since I won't be lying, I won't be nervous.

192
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,460
所以我得撒謊
So I will be lying.

193
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,400
但同時又不撒謊
But I also won't be.

194
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,630
你已經嗑嗨了嗎
Are you stoned already?

195
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,270
-你確定這招管用嗎  -讓我去跟醫生說
- Are you sure this is gonna work? - Let me do the talking.

196
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,890
我知道該怎么做  姐是街頭混大的
I know what I'm doing. I'm from the streets.

197
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,790
你是在有警衛的高檔社區長大的
You grew up in a gated community.

198
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,980
是的  但那沒攔住外人
Yeah, but was it keeping people out

199
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,640
也沒關住我們  小妞
or us in, chica?

200
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,270
得了吧  索菲亞
Come on, Sofia.

201
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,670
永遠別說真名
Never say your real name.

202
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,550
叫我小索
Call me Lil So-So.

203
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,820
你好啊
Sup?

204
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,490
我姐們在"來得快"窗口弄傷了脖子
So my homegirl here jacked up her neck in a drive-by.

205
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,330
其實是"得來速"窗口
Actually, it was a drive-thru.

206
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,820
我的兒童餐沒送玩具
My kid's meal didn't come with a toy

207
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,690
我就說了句"該死..."
and I was all "hell no--"

208
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,700
-能讓醫生看看嗎  -當然
- Could I see the doctor? - Sure.

209
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,710
-他馬上就來  -好的
- He'll be with you in a moment. - OK.

210
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,510
-裝成很痛的樣子  -什么
- Act like you're in pain. - What?

211
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,330
我們先檢查一下你的生命體征
Okay, we'll start by checking your vitals.

212
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,050
你既是收銀員又是醫生
Wow, you're a cashier and a doctor.

213
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,360
-二面手啊  -我還是名公證員
- You're a double threat. - I'm also a notary public,

214
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,840
別說我了  治療費兩百元

內含半盎司大麻
And it includes a half-ounce.

216
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,880
半盎司要兩百元
Uh, 200 for a half-sack?

217
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,470
簡直是明搶啊  哥們

220
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,880
要是你能找到更便宜的  請便
If you can find a better price somewhere else, hit the road. 

221
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,220
我是能找到更便宜的

222
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,620
但我不想大晚上去乘公交車

艾略特  喬什一個人在辦公室里

這正是向他申請加薪的好時機
It's a perfect time to ask for a raise.

225
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,530
我剛又加了一次薪

226
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,780
我不能這么做
I can't do that.

227
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,470
要是他罵我怎么辦  我已經冒汗了
What if he yells at me? I'm already starting to sweat.

228
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,180
艾略特  喬什不是你的爸爸
Elliot, Josh isn't your daddy.

229
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,040
不管你有多少次想坐在他大腿上
No matter how many times you try to sit on his lap.

230
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,110
爸爸...我是說  喬什
Hey, dad-- I mean, Josh?

231
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,740
我有事想跟你聊聊

好吧
Okay, look,

233
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,390
我知道加比跟庫珀打電話的時候
I know when Gabi was talking to Cooper,

234
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,210
我情緒有些不穩
I let my feelings bubble up a little bit,

235
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,760
但這情況不會再出現了
but it's not gonna happen again.

236
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,020
我得專注于當她的老板這一身份

說得太好了  喬什
That's brilliant, Josh.

239
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,520
要是我手里有杯酒

240
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,440
我會為你而舉杯

That's a funny word, huh?

243

你沒事吧  艾略特
Everything okay, Elliot?

我做這菜是為了我的文章

而且我得在三點前交稿

Gabi, don't taste too much of that.

276
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,970
我有個朋友嗑藥嗑多了  她跟豆袋椅做愛了
I had a friend get so high, she had sex with a beanbag chair.

277
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,690
別擔心  我只吃一點點
Don't worry. I'm only taking tiny tastes.

278
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,000
我得確保吃上去沒有大麻味
I have to make sure it doesn't taste like pot 

279
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,620
不然洛根不會用這篇文章的
or Logan's not gonna use it in the article.

280
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,730
好吧
Fine.

281
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,750
正常性愛滿足不了你時
Don't coming running to me

282
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,260
別跑來找我
when normal sex doesn't feel good anymore.

283
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,070
引人入勝  有趣
Engaging, funny.

284
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,310
"大麻"這個詞里沒有w這字母
Oh, there's no "w" in "marijuana."

285
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,700
你的文章讓我印象深刻
But I'm impressed.

286
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,010
真的嗎  -別高興得太早
Really? - Don't get too excited.

287
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,060
-我得先嘗下你的菜  -好
- I have to try your food first. - Ok.

288
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,910
天了嚕  你確定這里面放大麻了
Son of a bitch. Are you sure there's marijuana in this?

289
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,870
放了好多呢  就像是塞斯·羅根的電影
Tons. It's like a Seth Rogan movie in there.

290
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,780
恭喜你  加比  你的第一篇文章通過了
Congrats, Gabi. You got your first article.

291
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,100
天吶  太感謝你了
Oh my God, thank you so much.

292
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,800
洛根  抱歉打擾
Logan, I'm sorry to interrupt.

293
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,830
什么事  我正在會見一名天才新寫手
What? I'm meeting with a very talented new writer.

294
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,860
我們有麻煩了
We've got a problem.

295
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,200
特麗莎剛剛簽約了新的廚藝節目
Trisha just got offered her own cooking show

296
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,350
不在這干了
and quit.

297
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,330
-不是吧[出去]  -不  這是真的
- Get out. - No, it's true.

298
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,260
我是對你說的  出去
No, I'm talking to you. Get out.

299
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,450
那個梨形身材的賤人兼職就賺了六位數的薪水
That pear-shaped bitch was making six figures working part time.

300
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,390
這么短的時間里我要去哪
Where the hell am I gonna find another food editor

301
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,000
再找一名美食編輯
on such short notice?

302
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,370
你說的是六位數還是簡筆畫
Did you say six figures or stick figures?

303
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,840
有個瘋狂的主意
Crazy idea.

304
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,180
加比  你對擔任我們的
Gabi, you wouldn't have any interest

305
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,870
美食編輯有興趣嗎
in being our food editor, would you?

306
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,470
-真的嗎  -當然
- Seriously? - Absolutely.

307
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,440
我覺得你是當今美食的代言人
I think you're the modern voice of food today.

308
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,620
而且比那個母牛特麗莎漂亮多了
And so much prettier than that cow Trisha.

309
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,290
天吶  洛根  謝謝你
Oh my God, Logan, thank you so much.

310
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,790
這是我夢寐以求的工作
This would be my dream job.

311
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,350
我同意
The answer is yes!

312
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,410
一千一萬個同意
Yes, yes, yes,

313
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,400
加比
Gabi.

314
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,960
醒醒
Wake up.

315
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,190
喬什
Josh?

316
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,900
我覺得那你試吃太多你做的菜
I think you sampled too many of your recipes.

317
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,490
不省人事了
You passed out hard.

318
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,930
我不是《舊金山月刊》的美食編輯嗎
I'm not the food editor of San Francisco Monthly?

319
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,830
不是
No.

320
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,390
我的親娘啊
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

321
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,190
天了嚕  我三點就該把這些東西送去的
Oh my God, oh my God, I have to get these in by 3:00

322
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,620
現在外面天都已經黑了
and it's totally dark outside.

323
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,280
告訴我那是日食
Tell me there's a solar eclipse!

324
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,840
-現在是晚上九點  -不
- It's 9:00 pm. - No!

325
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,210
我錯過了截止時間就因為我嗑多了
I missed my deadline 'cause I was stoned!

326
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,660
大麻該被禁才對
This stuff should be illegal.

327
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,150
猜猜看誰又當回了23歲的失敗者
Guess who's back to being a 23-year-old loser?

328
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,810
{\an8}高管培訓手冊

329
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,530
不是我  那肯定就是你了
Well, not me, so it must be you.

330
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,410
這話真刻薄
Hey, that's mean.

331
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,040
抱歉
I'm sorry.

332
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,820
成功改變了我
Success has changed me.

333
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,520
快  告訴我發生了什么
Come on, tell me everything.

334
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,310
我被我自己做的菜嗨暈了
Well, I got stoned off my own food,

335
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,610
在一堆臟衣服上睡著了  還錯過了截止時間
fell asleep in a pile of laundry and missed my deadline

336
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,950
現在洛根根本不肯見我
now Logan won't even see me!

337
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,930
如果說我還有什么拿手的  那一定是失敗
At least I'm a success at failing.

338
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,380
瞧瞧你  失敗了還這么樂觀
Look at you finding the silver lining.

339
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,930
積極向上  正是斯度納先生書里的第五章
Positive attitude. That's Chapter V of Mr. Stubner's book.

340
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,670
我還重看了他的TED演講
I am also rewatching his TED talk

341
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,520
關注了他家狗的推特
and following his dog on twitter.

342
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,520
明天的面試我一定能成功
I am gonna nail this interview tomorrow.

343
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,280
我不想再見到這些
I don't even want to see these anymore.

344
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,290
別啊  我們花了不少錢在里面呢
Whoa, no, we put a lot of money into these.

345
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,240
第八章  絕不浪費庫存
Chapter VIII-- never waste inventory.

346
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,570
我來嘗嘗味道怎么樣
Let me see if these are any good.

347
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,730
等等  這玩意勁很大的
Wait. Hold on. They're really strong.

348
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,710
得了吧  妹子
Bitch, please.

349
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,590
你覺得小索這點大麻都受不了嗎
You think lil so-so's afraid of a little chronic?

350
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,060
天吶  加比  真好吃
Oh my god. Gabi, these are delicious.

351
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,950
我想到了一個超棒的主意
I just had a great idea.

352
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,630
天吶  這些太好吃了
Oh my god, these are amazing.

353
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,990
要不是我已經抽嗨了  我真想再吃幾個
They make me wish I wasn't already stoned.

354
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,060
沒錯  就是這么贊
Yeah, they're that good.

355
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,920
而且它們很小
And they're small, 

356
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,520
這樣你抽嗨了以后再想吃東西也不會撐著
so you won't be full when you get the munchies.

357
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,820
你怎么說
So what do you think?

358
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,180
我出5塊錢一個
I'll give you five bucks a piece.

359
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,910
-10塊  -8塊再加個海豚煙筒
- 10. - Eight and I'll throw in a dolphin bong.

360
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,910
9塊  加兩個蒸餾器
Nine. Make it two vaporizers

361
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,730
再幫我把護照公證了
and I'm gonna need a copy of my passport notarized.

362
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,670
你真會講價  成交
You drive a hard bargain, but deal.

363
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,240
下周給我100個可以嗎
Can you get me 100 by next week?

364
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,520
100個
A hundred?

365
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,360
9塊一個
At $9 a piece.

366
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,000
那可是9000塊啊
That's $9,000.

367
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,780
沒錯  是的
Yes. Yes, it is.

368
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,220
-羅德里格斯小姐  -斯度納先生
- Miss Rodriguez? - Mr. Stubner.

369
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,850
你怎么會在這
What are you doing here?

370
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,630
我怎么會在這  天吶
What am I doing here? Oh my god.

371
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,610
我不是來這給盲人讀書的
This is not where I read to the blind.

372
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,690
索菲亞  我們都知道我的工作壓力很大
Sofia, we both know my job is stressful.

373
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,680
你以為我這么頻繁去洗手間是為什么
What do you think I do during all those bathroom breaks?

374
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,350
我以為你有腸易激綜合癥
I thought you had I.B.S.

375
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,040
要來點迷你乳蛋餅嗎  斯度納先生
Mini quiche, Mr. Stubner?

376
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,590
那我就不客氣了
Oh, oh, don't mind if I do.

377
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,770
順便說句  你剛才談判很厲害
Very impressive negotiation, by the way.

378
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,460
真的嗎  謝謝
Really? Thank you.

379
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,730
你果斷直接  毫不遲疑
You were direct and no nonsense.

380
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,230
公司里需要的就是這種人
We admire that at the firm.

381
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,430
知道嗎
You know what?

382
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,520
你不需要面試  升職機會是你的了
You don't need to interview. The promotion is yours.

383
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,890
天吶  太感謝了
Oh my god. Thank you!

384
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,800
謝謝  謝謝  謝謝
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

385
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,650
索菲亞  醒醒
Sofia. Sofia, wake up!

386
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,580
我不會讓你失望的  斯度納先生
I won't let you down, Mr. Stubner.

387
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,080
什么  快醒醒  你睡著了
What? Wake up. You fell asleep.

388
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,720
什么  真的嗎
What? I did?

389
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,470
這么說我不是斯度納先生的新任初級副總裁嗎
So I'm not Mr. Stubner's new junior vice president?

390
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,300
不是
No.

391
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,080
幾點了
What time is it?

392
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,460
早上10點
10:00 am.

393
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,940
老天  我睡過了面試的時間
Oh my god, I slept through my interview!

394
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,190
你為什么不叫醒我
Why didn't you wake me up?

395
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,320
我最不負責任了  你知道的
I'm irresponsible! It's kind of my thing!

396
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,520
斯度納先生的書里有一整章講的都是
Mr. Stubner has an entire chapter in his book

397
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,340
守時的重要性
about the importance of being punctual.

398
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,070
他一定不會再給我升職了
He'll never promote me now.

399
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,960
老天  這下我又變回23歲的廢柴了
God. I'm a 23-year-old loser again.

400
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,140
這樣的話  歡迎回來
Well, welcome back.

401
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,860
塑料刀叉和偷來的番茄醬包
The plastic silverware and stolen ketchup packets

402
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,190
都很想念你呢
have missed you.

403
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,870
至少我們還有工作
Well, at least we still have jobs.

404
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,350
是啊
Yeah.

405
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,610
除非我們因為遲到被炒了  快走
Unless we get fired for being totally late! Come on!

406
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,540
我做到了
I did it!

407
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,720
我終于想到了一個好辦法要求加薪
I finally came up with a way to ask for a raise.

408
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,780
我用手機錄了一段
I made a recording on my phone

409
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,990
自己沉著自信地要求加薪的錄音
of me asking for one in a calm confident voice.

410
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,920
然后去見喬什的時候對嘴型就好了
That I'm going to lip sync to when I meet with Josh.

411
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,430
你是被領結勒得大腦缺氧了嗎
Is your bow tie on too tight?

412
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,750
你就看著吧
You just watch.

413
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,220
喬什  是我
Josh, it's me...

414
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,230
艾略特  這么多年來
Elliot, your hardworking,

415
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,410
一直勤勤懇懇  兢兢業業
competent and favorite employee.

416
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,890
你最喜歡的員工
of many years.

417
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,130
毛球  別鬧
Fluffykins, no!

418
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,300
我會處理掉的
I'll edit that out.

419
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,840
總而言之
So in summation,

420
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,940
我希望你能給我提升一點待遇
I would really appreciate an increase in salary,

421
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,720
也就是大家常說的加薪
more commonly known as a raise.

422
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,420
你覺得怎么樣
So what do you think?

423
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,790
這是我看過最爛的功夫片了
That was the worst kung fu movie I've ever seen.

424
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,680
-午餐好了嗎  -當然了
- Hey, is lunch ready? - Sure is!

425
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,080
這是什么
What's all this?

426
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,020
是我為你準備的特別午餐
It's a special lunch that I made for you.

427
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,620
不是每個老板都會允許他的員工
Not a lot of bosses will let their employees

428
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,970
在洗衣房地上睡上五小時的
take a five-hour nap on the laundry room floor.

429
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,430
是啊  也沒多少員工會這樣
Yup. Not a lot of employees would do that.

430
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,010
我能問你個問題嗎
Listen, can I ask you something?

431
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,630
-私人問題嗎  -不  完全是工作上的
- Is it personal? - No, it's completely work-related.

432
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,540
-那盡管問  -好吧
- Ask away. - Okay.

433
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,810
你有沒有試過
So have you ever been so close

434
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,800
最渴望的東西在你面前唾手可得
to getting something that you really wanted

435
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,990
到頭來卻又失之交臂
and then it just slipped through your fingers?

436
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,620
我的意思是
What I'm asking is

437
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,690
你都是怎么面對失敗的
how do you deal with failure?

438
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,080
這個嘛  首先
Well, first of all,

439
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,740
-失敗很不爽  -可不是嗎
- it sucks. - Right?

440
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,030
你會感覺糟透了
Yeah, you feel horrible.

441
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,720
試著不再去想
You try to stop thinking about it,

442
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,110
卻總忍不住在腦海中反復重演那一幕
but you keep playing it over in your head over and over,

443
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,530
然后你的朋友會開始可憐你
and then your friends start pitying you,

444
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,400
你怎么辦  只能告訴他們你已經看開了
so what do you do? You have to tell them you've moved on.

445
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,970
但你怎么真正放下呢
But how do you get past it?

446
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,020
我也不知道  假裝你沒事就好
I don't know. Just pretend you're fine.

447
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,500
或許這樣能給你足夠的時間想明白
It buys you time until hopefully you realize that...

448
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,850
任何事情發生都是有原因的
everything happens for a reason

449
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,380
或許有時候失敗
and maybe things didn't work out

450
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,430
是因為有更好的事在等著你
because there's something better out there for you.

451
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,230
比用大麻烹飪更好的事
Something better than cooking with drugs?

452
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,870
我想你說得對
I think you're right.

453
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,930
-謝謝你  喬什  你真是個好朋友  -老板
- Thanks, Josh. You're a really good friend. - Boss.

454
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,510
-好友老板  -老板好友
- Friend-boss. - Boss-friend.

455
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,950
好吧
Okay.

456
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,230
你是有什么要緊事要跟我說
So what's this important thing you needed to talk to me about?

457
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,430
喬什
Josh.

458
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,100
我可不可以
May I...

459
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,360
要求
have a...

460
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,000
加薪
...raise?

461
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,030
這就是你為什么總怪怪的嗎
Is this why you've been acting so weird?

462
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,880
{\an8}是的

463
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,710
好吧  你想加多少
Okay, so how much were you thinking?

464
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,380
跟尤蘭達一樣
What Yolanda makes.

465
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,640
再多一塊錢
Plus one dollar.

466
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,880
行  艾略特  沒問題
Okay, Elliot, sure.

467
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,040
{\an8}好棒

468
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,210
好棒
Yay!

469
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,770
看  其實沒有這么難吧
See? That wasn't difficult, was it?

470
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,640
我想讓你知道  你可以跟我說任何事
I want you to know you can come to me for anything.

471
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,850
-謝謝你  喬什  -不客氣
- Thanks, Josh. - You're welcome.

472
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,610
既然這是你第一次要求加薪
Since this was your first time asking for a raise,

473
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,620
還有什么別的要求嗎
anything else I can do for you?

474
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,620
我也不知道  不然你把衣服脫了如何
I don't know. How about you take your shirt off?

475
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,500
-艾略特  -抱歉
- Elliot. - Sorry.

476
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,640
知道嗎
You know what?

477
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,240
你付出了這么多
After all you've done,

478
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,070
脫就脫吧
I'll do it.

479
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,350
再脫  再脫
More, more, more!

480
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,120
-艾略特  醒醒  你睡著了  -什么
- Elliot, wake up. You fell asleep! - What?

481
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,030
這么說喬什沒有給我跳脫衣舞
So Josh didn't take his clothes off and dance for me?

482
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,330
沒有
No.

483
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,510
你的工資還是比我高
And you still make more money than me?

484
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,410
沒錯
Yeah.

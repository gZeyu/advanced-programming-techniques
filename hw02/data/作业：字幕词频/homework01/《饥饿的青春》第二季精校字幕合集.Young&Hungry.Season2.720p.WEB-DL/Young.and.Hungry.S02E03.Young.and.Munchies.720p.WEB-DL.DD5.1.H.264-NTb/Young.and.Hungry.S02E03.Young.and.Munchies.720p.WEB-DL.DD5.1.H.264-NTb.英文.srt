11
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,800
I am so depressed.

12
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,030
I never want to go to the farmer's market again.

13
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,380
We don't even deserve this kale.

14
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,990
I wanna kale myself.

15
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,130
Why did we have to run into Lizette?

16
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,990
- Lizette. - Lizette?

17
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,250
How does "Thin-lipped" Lizette from high school

18
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,860
have a lip-balm empire?

19
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,650
Remember when people used to call her "Lizard lips"?

20
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,730
Yeah. Wow, we were so mean.

21
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,460
Yeah, for someone so busy,

22
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,070
she certainly had plenty of time to brag about herself.

23
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,780
I can't believe we're 23 and already washed up.

24
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,180
Right? What happened to our dreams?

25
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,800
You were gonna be the next Julia Child

26
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,140
with your own restaurant and cookbook and TV show. 

27
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,600
You were gonna have an empire.

28
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,290
Yeah, I don't have that.

29
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,970
And I don't have a corner office on Wall Street

30
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,290
with a hot assistant who's secretly in love with me.

31
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,600
- This is a wake-up call. - Yes it is.

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,610
- We got to start networking. - Yes we do.

33
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,770
We've got to start emailing

34
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,110
all the successful people we know

35
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,630
to help us get to the next level.

36
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,050
Yes, I'm doing that right now.

37
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,020
Okay.

38
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,730
Wow, I don't know any successful people.

39
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,560
Ooh, do you remember Logan Rawlings?

40
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,060
The lesbian magazine editor

41
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,060
- you fake-dated to help Josh. - Yeah!

42
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,270
She's totally successful

43
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,670
and could totally help me get to the next level.

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,910
What is the next level?

45
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,900
You know all those food articles you read about?

46
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,190
You're like, "I could've written that,"

47
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,490
but you never write anything?

48
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,160
Yeah, I'm really good at that.

49
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,670
Well, why don't you write a food article for her magazine?

50
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,220
That is a great idea, Sofia.

51
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,260
You are the smartest loser I know.

52
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,600
Morning, guys. 

53
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,880
How's it going, buddy?

54
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,610
Are you okay? Do you need a hug?

55
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,910
Look, I know it's been a rough few weeks

56
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,390
with my wedding being called off

57
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,810
and Gabi getting back with Cooper, but I'm over it.

58
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,340
I'm fine.

59
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,850
Sure you are.

60
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,770
- Such a trooper. - Yeah.

62
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,880
Hey, stop it. I'm serious.

64
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,130
I've moved on.

65
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,300
If you guys want your paychecks, you will too.

67
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,200
Wow, look how fit you are.

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,260
Must be all that moving on you're doing.

70
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,110
Hey, guys, guess what?

71
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,250
You're moving to China. So sad. Bye!

72
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,920
No.

73
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,970
I decided I needed to take my career to the next level,

74
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,000
So I called Logan Rawlings--

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,550
Remember? The lesbian that Elliot pimped me out to?

76
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,250
That was funny.

77
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,650
Well, she called me back and she wants to hear my ideas

78
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,690
on a food article written by me.

79
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,530
Gabi, that's great. I feel nothing...

80
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,380
but happiness...

81
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,710
for you.

82
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,500
Oh, that's Cooper.

83
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,990
Hi, sweetcakes. I have the best news.

84
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,620
See? She's talking to Cooper

85
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,550
and I'm fine.

86
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,100
No, my news isn't that I miss you.

87
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,060
That wouldn't be news. I miss you all the time,

88
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,620
my super Cooper bear.

89
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,420
See, I'm--

90
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,600
Not fine. I will be in my office

91
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,510
with my noise-canceling headphones.

92
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,710
My check's wrong.

93
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,740
Josh overpaid me.

94
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,820
Like way overpaid me.

95
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,870
Well, he way underpaid me.

96
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,220
Oh wait.

97
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,700
This is your check.

98
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,580
You make more money than me?

99
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,250
You're his housekeeper. I'm his publicist!

100
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,690
So? I've been with Josh for a long time.

101
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,910
Exactly.

102
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,420
Shouldn't he realize how worthless you are?

103
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,160
Oh, stop it.

104
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,480
All you got to do is walk in there and ask for a raise.

105
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,470
I do it every other month.

106
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,440
I could never do that.

107
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,770
Why not?

108
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,340
Look, I know I come off

109
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,910
as this confident self-assured renaissance man...

110
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,040
To who?

111
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,240
But, when I was a kid,

112
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,320
the one time I asked for a bigger allowance,

113
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,410
my dad went crazy.

114
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,060
I made 50 cents a week till I was 18.

115
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,890
By the time I saved up enough money to go to a Wham! Concert,

116
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,270
they broke up!

117
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,210
Miss Gabi Diamond.

118
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,160
Hey, Logan, thank you so much for seeing me.

119
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,250
When I told my friends that I had a meeting

120
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,640
- with the great Logan Rawlings-- - Don't.

121
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,660
Don't do that.

122
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,750
Don't do what?

123
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,080
Kiss my ass. 

124
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,440
No, no, no, I wouldn't. I mean, I couldn't.

125
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,460
I mean-- you should talk now.

126
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,460
I want a totally unique and hip 

127
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,060
take on the San Francisco food scene 

128
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,160
that hasn't been done before.

129
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,100
Well, I have a ton of cool ideas.

130
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,670
And I have two minutes.

131
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,510
Are you stroking out? Go.

132
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,430
Okay, well, you know how everybody these days is eating pretzels?

133
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,750
No.

134
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,680
Well, they are. I was thinking

135
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
"30 new twists on pretzels."

136
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,630
Get it? Pretzel? Twist.

137
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,270
Here's a twist. I love it 0%.

138
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,120
Okay, well, I have a ton of other ideas.

139
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,510
"How to impress with a panini."

140
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,360
Get it? Panini? Impress?

141
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,790
You know what I'm gonna press?

142
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,230
This button. Rafael, please show Miss Diamond out.

143
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,350
No, no, no, listen, Logan.

144
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,980
I am a great chef.

145
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,090
I could sit here and toss out

146
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,710
a bunch of great foods to write about,

147
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,040
- but I'm not gonna do that. - 30 seconds.

148
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,700
Blt's, tetrazzini,

149
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,980
fancy cheeses, nougat, hotcakes, lasagna--

150
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,620
- Wait, did you just say... pot cakes? - No.

151
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,940
Maybe.

152
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,340
- That's a fantastic idea. - Which is why I said it.

153
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,770
Pot edibles are so hot right now.

154
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,860
Yeah. Yeah they are.

155
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,200
Everybody's talking about it,

156
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,950
then forgetting what they're talking about.

157
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,770
Unfortunately, it ruins the way food tastes.

158
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,020
It's hard to cook with.

159
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,900
Trust me, no one has ever tasted pot in any of my food.

160
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,870
Okay, get me a killer 500-word piece

161
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,460
about cooking with pot in two days

162
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,160
and I'll run it in this month's issue.

163
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,200
Please, two days? I could have it for you in one.

164
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,980
- Really? - No, I'm gonna need two.

165
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,640
Whoever said success doesn't happen overnight

166
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,530
has never spent the night with me.

167
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,960
Logan wants me to write an article for her magazine.

168
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,160
Oh my god. I got a meeting with one of the managing partners

169
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,800
to talk about a promotion.

170
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,990
That's amazing. Let's celebrate by buying a big bag of marijuana.

171
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,590
Uh, what?

172
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,500
My article's about cooking with pot.

173
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,390
- Pot? - Yeah.

174
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,280
Gabi. Seriously, you've never cooked with pot.

175
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,840
Yeah, I didn't know how to paint with socks either,

176
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,310
but our bathroom turned out great.

177
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,610
You know what? You're right. Look at us.

178
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,870
We push ourselves and the world opens up.

179
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,040
Speaking of pushers,

180
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,990
does dime-bag Dave still live downstairs?

181
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,000
No, he moved. To jail.

182
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,140
If you're gonna do it, at least do it honestly.

183
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,160
Fake an illness and get a cannabis card

184
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,800
like my nana did.

185
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,460
I don't know. I'm only good at lying to people I know.

186
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,820
I'm starting to get nervous and anxious about this.

187
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,310
That's perfect. Just tell the doctor

188
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,340
you need weed to calm your nerves.

189
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,980
Hey, that's a great idea.

190
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,880
Then I won't be lying.

191
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,940
But since I won't be lying, I won't be nervous.

192
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,460
So I will be lying.

193
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,400
But I also won't be.

194
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,630
Are you stoned already?

195
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,270
- Are you sure this is gonna work? - Let me do the talking.

196
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,890
I know what I'm doing. I'm from the streets.

197
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,790
You grew up in a gated community.

198
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,980
Yeah, but was it keeping people out

199
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,640
or us in, chica?

200
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,270
Come on, Sofia.

201
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,670
Never say your real name.

202
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,550
Call me Lil So-So.

203
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,820
Sup?

204
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,490
So my homegirl here jacked up her neck in a drive-by.

205
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,330
Actually, it was a drive-thru.

206
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,820
My kid's meal didn't come with a toy

207
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,690
and I was all "hell no--"

208
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,700
- Could I see the doctor? - Sure.

209
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,710
- He'll be with you in a moment. - OK.

210
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,510
- Act like you're in pain. - What?

211
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,330
Okay, we'll start by checking your vitals.

212
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,050
Wow, you're a cashier and a doctor.

213
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,360
- You're a double threat. - I'm also a notary public,

214
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,840
but enough about me. Consultation's 200 bucks

215
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,480
And it includes a half-ounce.

216
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,880
Uh, 200 for a half-sack?

217
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,470
That's a straight ripoff, g.

219
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,800
Cut the act, Dora the Explorer.

220
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,880
If you can find a better price somewhere else, hit the road. 

221
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,220
Oh, I can find a better price.

222
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,620
But I don't like to take the bus after dark.

223
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,550
Elliot, Josh is alone in his office.

224
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,690
It's a perfect time to ask for a raise.

225
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,530
I just got another one.

226
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,780
I can't do that.

227
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,470
What if he yells at me? I'm already starting to sweat.

228
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,180
Elliot, Josh isn't your daddy.

229
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,040
No matter how many times you try to sit on his lap.

230
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,110
Hey, dad-- I mean, Josh?

231
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,740
I was wondering if I could talk to you about something.

232
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,650
Okay, look,

233
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,390
I know when Gabi was talking to Cooper,

234
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,210
I let my feelings bubble up a little bit,

235
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,760
but it's not gonna happen again.

236
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,020
I've just got to focus on being her boss

237
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,500
and being professional.

238
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,890
That's brilliant, Josh.

239
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,520
If I had a glass,

240
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,440
I would raise it to you.

241
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,880
Raise.

242
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,200
That's a funny word, huh?

243
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,070
Everything okay, Elliot?

244
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,760
See, I've worked for you for a while,

245
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,970
and this place is like a home to me,

247
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,390
except there's no shrine to Anderson Cooper.

248
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,320
Are you sick?

249
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,290
You're sweating, like, a lot.

250
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,890
Am I? 

251
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,260
- Are you okay? - Never better.

252
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,110
Good talk. Gotta go.

253
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,360
Girl, are you cooking with weed?

254
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,830
What is wrong with you?

255
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,190
It's cool, Yolanda. Josh is letting me.

256
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,100
Then fix me up a gin and juice

257
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,670
and let's blow this penthouse party up!

258
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,530
I'm making edibles for my article

259
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,990
and I have to turn these in by 3:00.

260
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,030
- Hey, guys. - Oh, hey, Josh.

261
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,920
Thank you so much for letting me use the kitchen.

262
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,540
- You're my hero. - No.

263
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,550
Just your boss

264
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,450
who thinks of you in a completely professional capacity only.

265
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,130
Oh, I know what's going on.

266
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,930
You're worried that I'm gonna get another job and leave you.

267
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,520
Ha ha, well, if you left,

268
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,600
I'd let you go

269
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,590
because I am very good at letting go.

270
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,400
You don't have to worry about that.

271
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,380
I'm not. That would be a feeling and I don't have those.

272
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,620
Bye-e-e.

273
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,940
He seems really stressed.

274
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,520
I'm gonna put a few of these aside for him.

275
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,990
Gabi, don't taste too much of that.

276
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,970
I had a friend get so high, she had sex with a beanbag chair.

277
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,690
Don't worry. I'm only taking tiny tastes.

278
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,000
I have to make sure it doesn't taste like pot 

279
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,620
or Logan's not gonna use it in the article.

280
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,730
Fine.

281
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,750
Don't coming running to me

282
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,260
when normal sex doesn't feel good anymore.

283
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,070
Engaging, funny.

284
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,310
Oh, there's no "w" in "marijuana."

285
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,700
But I'm impressed.

286
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,010
Really? - Don't get too excited.

287
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,060
- I have to try your food first. - Ok.

288
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,910
Son of a bitch. Are you sure there's marijuana in this?

289
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,870
Tons. It's like a Seth Rogan movie in there.

290
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,780
Congrats, Gabi. You got your first article.

291
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,100
Oh my God, thank you so much.

292
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,800
Logan, I'm sorry to interrupt.

293
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,830
What? I'm meeting with a very talented new writer.

294
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,860
We've got a problem.

295
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,200
Trisha just got offered her own cooking show

296
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,350
and quit.

297
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,330
- Get out. - No, it's true.

298
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,260
No, I'm talking to you. Get out.

299
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,450
That pear-shaped bitch was making six figures working part time.

300
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,390
Where the hell am I gonna find another food editor

301
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,000
on such short notice?

302
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,370
Did you say six figures or stick figures?

303
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,840
Crazy idea.

304
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,180
Gabi, you wouldn't have any interest

305
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,870
in being our food editor, would you?

306
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,470
- Seriously? - Absolutely.

307
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,440
I think you're the modern voice of food today.

308
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,620
And so much prettier than that cow Trisha.

309
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,290
Oh my God, Logan, thank you so much.

310
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,790
This would be my dream job.

311
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,350
The answer is yes!

312
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,410
Yes, yes, yes,

313
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,400
Gabi.

314
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,960
Wake up.

315
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,190
Josh?

316
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,900
I think you sampled too many of your recipes.

317
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,490
You passed out hard.

318
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,930
I'm not the food editor of San Francisco Monthly?

319
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,830
No.

320
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,390
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

321
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,190
Oh my God, oh my God, I have to get these in by 3:00

322
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,620
and it's totally dark outside.

323
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,280
Tell me there's a solar eclipse!

324
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,840
- It's 9:00 pm. - No!

325
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,210
I missed my deadline 'cause I was stoned!

326
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,660
This stuff should be illegal.

327
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,150
Guess who's back to being a 23-year-old loser?

329
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,530
Well, not me, so it must be you.

330
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,410
Hey, that's mean.

331
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,040
I'm sorry.

332
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,820
Success has changed me.

333
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,520
Come on, tell me everything.

334
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,310
Well, I got stoned off my own food,

335
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,610
fell asleep in a pile of laundry and missed my deadline

336
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,950
now Logan won't even see me!

337
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,930
At least I'm a success at failing.

338
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,380
Look at you finding the silver lining.

339
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,930
Positive attitude. That's Chapter V of Mr. Stubner's book.

340
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,670
I am also rewatching his TED talk

341
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,520
and following his dog on twitter.

342
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,520
I am gonna nail this interview tomorrow.

343
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,280
I don't even want to see these anymore.

344
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,290
Whoa, no, we put a lot of money into these.

345
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,240
Chapter VIII-- never waste inventory.

346
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,570
Let me see if these are any good.

347
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,730
Wait. Hold on. They're really strong.

348
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,710
Bitch, please.

349
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,590
You think lil so-so's afraid of a little chronic?

350
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,060
Oh my god. Gabi, these are delicious.

351
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,950
I just had a great idea.

352
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,630
Oh my god, these are amazing.

353
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,990
They make me wish I wasn't already stoned.

354
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,060
Yeah, they're that good.

355
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,920
And they're small, 

356
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,520
so you won't be full when you get the munchies.

357
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,820
So what do you think?

358
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,180
I'll give you five bucks a piece.

359
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,910
- 10. - Eight and I'll throw in a dolphin bong.

360
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,910
Nine. Make it two vaporizers

361
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,730
and I'm gonna need a copy of my passport notarized.

362
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,670
You drive a hard bargain, but deal.

363
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,240
Can you get me 100 by next week?

364
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,520
A hundred?

365
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,360
At $9 a piece.

366
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,000
That's $9,000.

367
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,780
Yes. Yes, it is.

368
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,220
- Miss Rodriguez? - Mr. Stubner.

369
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,850
What are you doing here?

370
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,630
What am I doing here? Oh my god.

371
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,610
This is not where I read to the blind.

372
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,690
Sofia, we both know my job is stressful.

373
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,680
What do you think I do during all those bathroom breaks?

374
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,350
I thought you had I.B.S.

375
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,040
Mini quiche, Mr. Stubner?

376
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,590
Oh, oh, don't mind if I do.

377
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,770
Very impressive negotiation, by the way.

378
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,460
Really? Thank you.

379
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,730
You were direct and no nonsense.

380
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,230
We admire that at the firm.

381
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,430
You know what?

382
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,520
You don't need to interview. The promotion is yours.

383
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,890
Oh my god. Thank you!

384
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,800
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

385
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,650
Sofia. Sofia, wake up!

386
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,580
I won't let you down, Mr. Stubner.

387
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,080
What? Wake up. You fell asleep.

388
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,720
What? I did?

389
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,470
So I'm not Mr. Stubner's new junior vice president?

390
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,300
No.

391
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,080
What time is it?

392
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,460
10:00 am.

393
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,940
Oh my god, I slept through my interview!

394
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,190
Why didn't you wake me up?

395
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,320
I'm irresponsible! It's kind of my thing!

396
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,520
Mr. Stubner has an entire chapter in his book

397
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,340
about the importance of being punctual.

398
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,070
He'll never promote me now.

399
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,960
God. I'm a 23-year-old loser again.

400
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,140
Well, welcome back.

401
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,860
The plastic silverware and stolen ketchup packets

402
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,190
have missed you.

403
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,870
Well, at least we still have jobs.

404
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,350
Yeah.

405
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,610
Unless we get fired for being totally late! Come on!

406
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,540
I did it!

407
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,720
I finally came up with a way to ask for a raise.

408
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,780
I made a recording on my phone

409
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,990
of me asking for one in a calm confident voice.

410
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,920
That I'm going to lip sync to when I meet with Josh.

411
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,430
Is your bow tie on too tight?

412
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,750
You just watch.

413
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,220
Josh, it's me...

414
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,230
Elliot, your hardworking,

415
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,410
competent and favorite employee.

416
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,890
of many years.

417
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,130
Fluffykins, no!

418
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,300
I'll edit that out.

419
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,840
So in summation,

420
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,940
I would really appreciate an increase in salary,

421
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,720
more commonly known as a raise.

422
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,420
So what do you think?

423
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,790
That was the worst kung fu movie I've ever seen.

424
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,680
- Hey, is lunch ready? - Sure is!

425
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,080
What's all this?

426
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,020
It's a special lunch that I made for you.

427
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,620
Not a lot of bosses will let their employees

428
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,970
take a five-hour nap on the laundry room floor.

429
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,430
Yup. Not a lot of employees would do that.

430
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,010
Listen, can I ask you something?

431
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,630
- Is it personal? - No, it's completely work-related.

432
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,540
- Ask away. - Okay.

433
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,810
So have you ever been so close

434
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,800
to getting something that you really wanted

435
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,990
and then it just slipped through your fingers?

436
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,620
What I'm asking is

437
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,690
how do you deal with failure?

438
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,080
Well, first of all,

439
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,740
- it sucks. - Right?

440
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,030
Yeah, you feel horrible.

441
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,720
You try to stop thinking about it,

442
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,110
but you keep playing it over in your head over and over,

443
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,530
and then your friends start pitying you,

444
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,400
so what do you do? You have to tell them you've moved on.

445
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,970
But how do you get past it?

446
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,020
I don't know. Just pretend you're fine.

447
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,500
It buys you time until hopefully you realize that...

448
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,850
everything happens for a reason

449
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,380
and maybe things didn't work out

450
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,430
because there's something better out there for you.

451
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,230
Something better than cooking with drugs?

452
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,870
I think you're right.

453
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,930
- Thanks, Josh. You're a really good friend. - Boss.

454
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,510
- Friend-boss. - Boss-friend.

455
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,950
Okay.

456
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,230
So what's this important thing you needed to talk to me about?

457
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,430
Josh.

458
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,100
May I...

459
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,360
have a...

460
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,000
...raise?

461
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,030
Is this why you've been acting so weird?

463
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,710
Okay, so how much were you thinking?

464
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,380
What Yolanda makes.

465
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,640
Plus one dollar.

466
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,880
Okay, Elliot, sure.

468
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,210
Yay!

469
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,770
See? That wasn't difficult, was it?

470
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,640
I want you to know you can come to me for anything.

471
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,850
- Thanks, Josh. - You're welcome.

472
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,610
Since this was your first time asking for a raise,

473
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,620
anything else I can do for you?

474
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,620
I don't know. How about you take your shirt off?

475
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,500
- Elliot. - Sorry.

476
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,640
You know what?

477
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,240
After all you've done,

478
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,070
I'll do it.

479
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,350
More, more, more!

480
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,120
- Elliot, wake up. You fell asleep! - What?

481
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,030
So Josh didn't take his clothes off and dance for me?

482
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,330
No.

483
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,510
And you still make more money than me?

484
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,410
Yeah.

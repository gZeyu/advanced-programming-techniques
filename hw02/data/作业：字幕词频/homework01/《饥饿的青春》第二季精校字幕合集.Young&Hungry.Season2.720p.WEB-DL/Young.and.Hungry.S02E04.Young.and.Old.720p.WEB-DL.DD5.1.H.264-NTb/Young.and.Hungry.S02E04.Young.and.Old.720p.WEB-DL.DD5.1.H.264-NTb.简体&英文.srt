没事  我来
No worries. I'll do it.

17
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,840
因为你不想让我肮脏的农民手碰吗
'Cause you don't want my grubby peasant hands on it?

18
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,370
不是  傻瓜
No, silly billy.

19
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,800
我可以自己来
I can do it myself.

20
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,960
我还在床上做梦  我上班要迟到了
Okay, I'm still in bed dreaming, and I'm gonna be late for work.

21
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,690
艾略特  你心情很好
Elliot, you're in a pretty good mood,

22
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,680
明天就是你40岁生日了
considering your big 4-0 is tomorrow.

23
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,210
我还以为你会惊慌失措呢
I thought you might be freaking out.

24
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,010
更像是十分激动
More like getting my freak on.

25
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,680
和安德烈一起
With Andre.

26
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,440
这是我第一次生日时有男朋友
This is the first time I've ever had a boyfriend on my birthday.

27
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,960
39年的悲伤
39 years of sorrow,

28
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,320
我终于可以穿着生日礼服
and I finally get to celebrate my birthday

29
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,210
庆祝生日了

Oh my god, I love Elliot with a boyfriend.

31
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,150
他开心时我也开心
When he's happy, I'm happy.

32
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,580
也许我们还会成为朋友  那就太棒了
Maybe we'll even be friends, which would be great,

33
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,030
因为人不会告诉朋友
because friends don't tell friends

34
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,070
她看起来像廉价商店的妓女
they look like dime store hookers.

35
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,440
朋友会说  你穿这条裙子好漂亮
Friends say, "Hey, you look cute in that dress."

36
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,310
裙子真漂亮
Hey, cute dress.

37
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,670
好了  我们得让这辆爱情火车继续开
Okay, that's it. We've got to keep this love train going.

38
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,510
我要给安德烈打电话
I'm calling Andre.

Elliot's about to have the most romantic birthday dinner ever.

40
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,000
那主意很棒
That's a pretty good idea.

41
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,320
真可惜  那比不过我的礼物
Too bad it's not gonna top my present.

42
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,530
因为我赚的钱最多
Because I make the most money here,

43
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,200
还被顶尖杂志称为创意天才
and I was called a creative genius by a top publication.

44
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,060
是《每月吹嘘》吗
Oh, was it Bragging Monthly?

45
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,870
怎么  你想看是什么礼物吗  好我去拿
What's that? You want to see what it is? Okay, I'll get it.

46
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,440
我找安德烈花店的安德烈
Hi, can I speak to Andre of Flowers by Andre?

47
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,920
你好  安德烈  我是加比
Hey, Andre, it's Gabi.

48
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,190
是的  烦人的金发厨师
Yes, the annoying blonde cook.

49
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,050
艾略特要过40岁生日了  我想给他个惊喜
Listen, I'm surprising Elliot for his 40th birthday

50
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,170
做一顿浪漫晚餐  显然也想请你做他的约会对象
with a romantic dinner, and obviously I want you to be his date.

51
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,560
好  看看日程然后打给我
Okay, great. Check your schedule, get back to me.

52
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,720
怎么了
What?

53
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,680
天啊
Oh my god.

54
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,630
艾略特和安德烈  好有爱
Elliot and Andre. That's so cute.

55
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,420
这肯定让你觉得自己的礼物很烂
I bet this makes you feel pretty lousy about your gift.

56
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,150
天啊
Oh my god!

57
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,930
安德烈刚发现我今年40而不是32岁
Andre just found out I'm turning 40 instead of 32

58
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,520
跟我分手了
and broke up with me.

59
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,830
什么
What?

60
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,540
这真是最烂的生日
This is officially the worst birthday ever!

61
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,450
天啊
Oh my god!

62
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,970
别担心  艾略特
Don't worry, Elliot.

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,780
-安德烈不会是你最后一个约会对象  -是啊
- Andre's not the last guy you'll ever date. - Yeah.

64
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,830
你肯定会被很多男人甩掉的
I'm sure you'll get dumped by tons of guys.

65
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,650
我这辈子只爱过三个人
I've only ever loved three men in my life.

66
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,090
安德烈  大学里暗恋的埃兰
Andre, my college crush Alan,

67
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,570
还有骚当
and Adam Levine.

68
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,470
我知道这听起来很疯狂
And I know it sounds crazy,

69
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,730
但安德烈是唯一一个也爱我的人
but Andre's the only one who loved me back.

70
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,280
我知道这可能不是提的最佳时机
I know this might not be the best time to bring this up,

71
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,370
但《连线》的人明天要来拍我的桌面了
but the guys from Wired are coming to photograph my desk tomorrow

72
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,210
要发表在"成功之桌"专栏上
for the Desk For Success column.

73
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,010
我们准备好了吗
Are we ready?

74
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,570
-没有  -那么
- No. - So...

75
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,600
我这话是很友好的
And I mean this in the nicest possible way,

76
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,880
你觉得什么时候能好啊
when do you think we'll be ready?

77
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,280
等有人再爱上我怎么样
How about when someone loves me again?

78
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,740
所以是永远不会
So never!

79
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,250
早上好  亲爱的们
Good morning, beautiful people!

80
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,790
我说这是个很棒的早上
I said what a good morning it is.

81
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,500
安德烈和艾略特分手了  因为他40岁了
Andre broke up with Elliot because he's turning 40.

82
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,780
那么多原因  他只选了这个吗
Out of all the reasons, that's what he picked?

83
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,230
真遗憾  亲爱的
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

84
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,080
你想听听别人的痛苦的故事吗
You want to hear a story about somebody else's pain?

85
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,850
那总是能让你开心
That always cheers you up.

86
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,430
我前夫科尔曼
My ex-husband Coleman,

87
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,190
为了一个更年轻的女人甩了我

88
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,550
刚被一个更年轻的女人甩了

89
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,120
在结婚典礼上
at the altar.

90
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,320
至少他俩结婚了
At least he got to the altar.

91
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,020
安德烈是怎么知道我真实年龄的
How did Andre find out my real age anyway?

92
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,970
只有你们三个人知道
The only people who knew were you three.

93
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,770
哪一个告诉的他
Which one of you told him?

94
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,700
不是我
Not me.

95
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,250
我还以为你50呢
I thought you were 50.

96
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,470
对不起  是我
I am so sorry. It was me.

97
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,020
天啊  是你
Oh my god, it was you!

98
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,010
艾略特  我真的很抱歉
Listen, Elliot, I'm really sorry.

99
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,510
我只是想为你做点好事
I was just trying to do something nice for you.

100
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,180
那本来是个惊喜的  我们要成为朋友的
It was gonna be a surprise. We were gonna be friends.

101
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,370
你毁了那一切  对吧
Well, you ruined that, didn't you?

102
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,380
我永远也不会原谅你  加比·戴蒙德
I will never forgive you, Gabi Diamond!

103
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,820
他只是需要一点时间
He just needs some time.

104
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,250
永远不会
Never!

105
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,080
你还好吗
How you doin'?

106
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,320
我的人生结束了
My life's over.

107
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,140
你不明白
You don't understand.

108
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,290
基佬年里  40岁等于是80岁
40 is 80 in gay years.

109
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,340
拜托  我不明白吗
Please. I don't understand?

110
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,730
跟我一样大的男人想要20岁的女人
Men my age want women in their 20s.

111
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,810
这意味着我只能拥有120岁的男人
Which means the only man I can get is 120.

112
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,840
真好  我跟你一样又胖又老了
Great. I'm in the same fat, old boat as you.

113
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,690
没错
That's right.

114
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,820
你知道当我觉得自己老时怎么做吗
You know what I do when I'm feeling old?

115
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,750
我涂上睫毛膏  打理头发
I get my lashes done, I freshen up the weave,

116
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,140
买新唇膏
I buy new lipstick--

117
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,970
我是基佬  但没那么基
I'm gay, but not that gay.

118
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,530
我刚有了个主意
Oh, I just got an idea.

119
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,460
你知道我前夫科尔曼
You know my ex Coleman

120
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,100
是城里最棒的整形医生

121
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,360
你觉得我需要整形吗
You think I need plastic surgery?

122
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,190
整一下我能像32的
I could pass for 32.

123
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,350
整一下我还能像霉霉呢
And I could pass for Taylor Swift.

124
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,990
来看看
Let's see.

125
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,790
这里
Over here...

126
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,830
我好美
I'm beautiful.

127
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,070
好了
Okay.

128
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,780
我这就去给科尔曼打电话
I'm gonna call Coleman right now.

129
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,680
好  等等  别打
Yes. Wait, no.

130
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,490
你不能为了我去跟那劈腿男打交道
I can't make you deal with that cheater for me.

131
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,810
别说傻话了
Oh, that's ridiculous.

132
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,350
我带你去
I'll take you myself.

133
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,420
-我希望你开心  -从什么时候开始
- I want you to be happy. - Since when?

134
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,500
因为是你的生日
Since it's your birthday.

135
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,120
因为科尔曼被甩了  你想当面嘲笑他吧
And since Coleman got dumped, you want to rub it in his face?

136
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,220
贱男不就是该被这么教训吗
Isn't that how you teach a dog a lesson?

137
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,060
我觉得我有办法...
Okay, I think I've figured out a way...

138
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,330
来帮我吗
To help me?

139
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,150
上个月  《连线》 拍了伊隆·马斯克的飘浮桌
Last month, Wired featured Elon Musk at his hover-desk.

140
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,150
{\an8}特斯拉汽车首席执行官

141
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,040
是的  我看到了  好酷的
Oh yeah! I saw that. That was really cool!

142
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,430
我帮不上忙  对吗
I'm not helping, am I?

143
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,870
我知道这对你来说或许算不上什么大事
Look, I know this might not seem like a big deal to you,

144
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,830
但我这行的所有人都会看这个专栏
But everybody in my business reads this column.

145
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,010
风险投资家  潜在客户  软件开发者
Venture capitalists, potential clients, software developers--

146
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,300
所以你想看起来酷一点吗
So you want to seem cool?

147
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,850
-没错  -别担心  好吗
- Yes! - Don't worry, okay?

148
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,790
他会在你接受拍摄前调整好情绪的
You're gonna have him back in time for your shoot.

149
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,040
我想出了最能表达
I figured out the perfect

150
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,280
"抱歉  我毁了你的生日"的礼物
"I'm sorry I ruined your birthday" present.

151
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,530
他爸妈知道他40了  对吗
His parents know he's 40, right?

152
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,360
-怎么会不知道  -我是这么计划的
- Why wouldn't they? - So here's my plan.

153
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,540
因为艾略特少有机会见他的父母
Since Elliot rarely gets a chance to see his parents,

154
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,140
所以我想请他们一家吃一顿丰盛的韩式晚餐
I'm inviting them to a five-course Korean dinner.

155
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,400
他会喜欢的
He'll love that.

156
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,290
-现在就给他们打电话  -好的
- Here, let's call them now. - Okay.

157
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,900
喂  帕克先生吗  我是加比·戴蒙德
Hi, Mr. Park? It's Gabi Diamond.

158
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,250
艾略特的同事
I work with Elliot.

159
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,080
对  那个讨人厌的金发厨师
Yes, the annoying blonde cook.

160
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,020
艾略特的男友跟他分手了
Anyway, Elliot's boyfriend broke up with him

161
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,810
我不希望他孤单一人过生日
and I don't want him to be alone on his big day,

162
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,050
所以我想问问你们是否愿意飞过来
so I was wondering if maybe you could fly in

163
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,720
明晚和他一起吃生日晚餐
for a birthday dinner tomorrow night.

164
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,430
太好了  问一下帕克夫人  给我回电
Okay, great. Check with Mrs. Park. Call me back.

165
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,840
你打算请他们在哪吃晚餐
So, where are you planning on having this dinner?

166
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,110
我以为你不会问呢  你家阳台
I thought you'd never ask. Your terrace.

167
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,480
没问题  晚餐费用我出
No problem. And I want to pay for the dinner.

168
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,470
但你已经出了他们的机票钱了
Oh, but you're already paying for their flights.

169
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,940
天呐
Oh my God!

170
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,710
刚刚有人代我向我爸妈出柜了
Someone just outed me to my parents!

171
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,410
等等
Wait.

172
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,110
你爸妈不知道你是基佬吗
Your parents didn't know you were gay?

173
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,470
不知道  他们超级传统的
No. They're super traditional.

174
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,380
甚至都不怎么过性生活
They don't even like sex with each other.

175
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,290
-他们是怎么知道的  -加比干的
- How the hell did they find out? - Gabi did it.

176
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,040
我需要他  他是我的"桌语者"
I need him. He's the desk whisperer.

177
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,210
知道吗  乔什
You know what, Josh?

178
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,410
我想到了最好的生日礼物
I just thought of the perfect birthday gift.

179
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,470
让那个小婊砸从我眼前消失
Tell that dime store hooker to get out of my face.

180
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,360
-好吧  我能...  -加比  请回家
- Okay, can I-- - Gabi, home.

181
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,380
再见
Bye.

182
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,770
说你裙子可爱  我是骗你的
And that cute dress? I lied!

183
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,360
你回来的真早
You're home early.

184
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,640
你做了什么
What'd you do?

185
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,740
我导致了艾略特的男友跟他分手
I caused Elliot's boyfriend to break up with him,

186
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,030
然后还向他爸妈出柜了
and then I outed him to his parents,

187
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,880
要是我再这么说下去  听起来一切都不错
and if I keep talking like this, everything sounds great!

188
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,320
我勒个去
Holy crap.

189
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,390
对了  我有没有提到明天是他的生日
Oh yeah. And did I mention it's his birthday tomorrow?

190
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,740
等等  乔什炒你鱿鱼了吗
Wait. So, Josh fired you?

191
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,050
没  索菲亚  乔什没解雇我
No, Sofia, Josh didn't fire me.

192
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,310
只是我们都觉得
We just have a mutual agreement

193
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,380
我不在他家会好些
that things are better when I'm not around.

194
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,290
我该怎么弥补
How do I fix this?

195
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,800
你毁了他的恋情
Okay, well, you destroyed his relationship,

196
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,490
告诉了他爸妈他是基佬
you told his parents he was gay.

197
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,810
你有时间做饭吗
When do you find time to cook?

198
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,490
我知道了  我给艾略特找个新男友就行了
Hey, I know. I'll just find Elliot a new boyfriend.

199
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,950
他说他这一生只爱过三个男人
He said he's only loved three men in his entire life.

200
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,120
安德烈  骚当
Andre, Adam Levine,

201
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,520
还有个名叫埃兰的大学同学
and some guy named Alan from college.

202
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,600
太好了  我们去找大学同学埃兰吧
That's great. So we find Alan from college.

203
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,230
我刚要说这句话
I was gonna say that!

204
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,030
你不让我说完  我永远学不聪明
If you don't let me get there, I'm never gonna learn.

205
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,440
好了  开工
Okay, all right.

206
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,300
-我打开了艾略特的脸书主页  -好的
- I'm on Elliot's Facebook page. - Okay.

207
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,110
只有两个人叫埃兰
There's only two Alans.

208
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,690
埃兰·锡克和埃兰·洛文斯汀
Alan Thicke and Alan Lowenstein.

209
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,690
{\an8}前一个埃兰是加拿大演员  生于1947年

210
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,500
我知道了  是埃兰·洛文斯汀
I know. It's Alan Lowenstein

211
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,790
因为他是伯克利毕业的
because he went to Berkeley

212
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,870
艾略特也是这所学校毕业的
and that is also where Elliot went to college.

213
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,060
是啊  只有这个原因了
Yes, that's the only reason we know which Alan.

214
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,280
今天正式是你的生日了
Well, today is officially your birthday.

215
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,680
生日快乐  看见没
Happy birthday. See?

216
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,650
我把安德烈的脸改成了我的
It's my face instead of Andre's.

217
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,020
这代表了我们的友情
It represents our friendship--

218
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,660
老板  公关
Boss, publicist.

219
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,060
互帮互助
Always there for each other.

220
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,550
别说了  我决定不庆祝我的生日
Stop. I've decided not to celebrate my birthday.

221
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,050
我明白了  好兄弟
I get it, big guy.

222
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,530
你想专心在《连线》的拍照上
You want to focus on the photo shoot with Wired.

223
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,190
乔什  在整容咨询结束后
Josh, I'm gonna be able to focus better

224
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,670
我会更好地专心的
after my cosmetic surgery consultation.

225
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,080
什么
What?

226
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,230
艾略特  你不需要整容
Elliot, you don't need plastic surgery.

227
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,340
让詹姆斯医生决定吧
We'll let Dr. James decide that.

228
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,360
尤兰达的前夫吗
Yolanda's ex-husband?

229
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,320
是的  她替我预约的
Yes, she got me an appointment.

230
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,780
正要带我去呢
She's taking me right now.

231
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,530
她想见他是因为她听说他现在单身
She wants to see him because she heard he's single.

232
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,510
不  她不喜欢他
No, she doesn't like him.

233
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,910
只是想当面嘲笑他被甩
She just wants to rub the breakup in his face.

234
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,000
我不觉得她这打扮是想要当面嘲笑他
I don't think that's what she wants to rub in his face.

235
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,780
-能走了吗  -我知道是怎么一回事了
- You ready? - Look, I see what's going on here.

236
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,980
你利用艾略特作为见科尔曼的借口
You're using Elliot as an excuse to see Coleman.

237
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,180
拜托  看看他这张松弛的脸
Oh, please. Look at his saggy face.

238
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,100
他看起来就像一条等人解救的巴哥犬
He looks like a rescue pug.

239
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,650
这样谁会救他啊
That's never gonna get rescued.

240
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,290
尤兰达
Yolanda.

241
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,730
你辛勤工作多年
You worked day and night for years

242
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,120
供科尔曼读医学院
to put Coleman through medical school.

243
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,320
他一当上医生
The minute he became a doctor,

244
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,890
就跟他的助手私奔了
he ran off with his assistant.

245
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,140
现在是报应的时候了
And now it is payback time.

246
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,730
他单身  又脆弱
He is single and vulnerable.

247
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,510
我要施展魅力
I am gonna turn on the charm,

248
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,350
让他约我出去
and get him to take me out,

249
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,740
等把他玩弄于鼓掌之中以后
and right when I got him wrapped around my finger,

250
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,980
再狠狠甩了他  就像他当初一样
I'm gonna dump his sorry ass like he dumped mine.

251
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,060
不敢相信能找到你  埃兰  艾略特一定很高兴
I can't believe I found you, Alan. Elliot's gonna be so excited.

252
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,470
你觉得高兴的是他吗
You think he's gonna be excited.

253
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,970
我在专业定向会上就对他有好感了
I've had a crush on him since freshman orientation.

254
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,550
老实说  我就是那样给自己"定向"的
In fact, that's the way I discovered my orientation.

255
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,030
你真有趣
That's funny. You're funny.

256
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,050
"有趣"吗  人不帅才会这么说吧
Funny? That's what people say when someone's not cute.

257
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,500
天啊  我紧张的要汗流浃背了
Oh god, I'm so nervous I'm schvitzing up a storm.

258
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,100
我不知道那词什么意思
I don't know what schvitzing is,

259
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,910
但我觉得你没有
but I can't tell you're doing it.

260
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,750
别担心  没事的
Don't worry. You're gonna be fine.

261
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,970
-你还单着  多棒呀  -是啊
- How lucky is it that you're single? - Yeah.

262
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,730
就像中彩票一样棒
I'm like a lotto winner.

263
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,220
不敢相信艾略特还是单身
I can't believe Elliot's still single.

264
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,920
他那么抢手
He's such a catch.

265
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,220
艾略特·帕克吗
Elliot... Park?

266
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,260
真希望你能提前几周通知我
You know, I wish you would've given me a few weeks' notice.

267
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,850
我好减几斤肥
I would've lost five pounds.

268
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,490
我骗谁呢
Eh, who am I kidding?

269
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,320
我懂的  你想给他个惊喜
Oh, I get it. You want to surprise him.

270
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,110
终于做件对的事惊喜他吧
Surprise him by doing something right.

271
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,480
稍等
Wait here.

272
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,540
加比
Gabi.

273
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,700
艾略特回来不能发现你在这
Elliot cannot come home and find you here.

274
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,250
他不在真好  听着  我有其它办法了
Oh good. He's gone. Listen, I have another plan.

275
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,480
我觉得你还不懂"计划"这词
I think you're using the word "plan" wrong.

276
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,630
这回不会错  好了  有请...
This one's a winner. Okay, meet...

277
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,830
埃兰·洛文斯汀  艾略特久违的大学爱人
Alan Lowenstein, Elliot's long lost college love.

278
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,980
知道他的真实年龄  他的性向
He knows his real age, knows he's gay,

279
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,510
还一直是单身
and he's still single.

280
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,090
你干嘛总提这茬
Why do you keep saying that?

281
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,130
你也不对任何药物过敏吗
And you're not allergic to any medications?

282
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,340
如果有  我也不在乎
If I am, I don't care.

283
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,260
麻晕我  撕下这张老皮
Dope me up, peel this off,

284
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,940
换个新脸上去
and slap a new face on me.

285
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,530
我觉得该进来跟科尔曼打声招呼
Just thought I'd poke my head in and say a quick hey to Coleman.

286
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,070
尤兰达  你没说你会来啊
Yolanda, you didn't tell me you were coming.

287
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,020
快  去检查下我保时捷的车胎
Quick, go check the tires on my Porsche.

288
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,270
不  真的  去看看
No, seriously, go check.

289
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,300
看看你
Wow, look at you.

290
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,660
如果我不知道
If I didn't know better,

291
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,990
还以为你也动过刀子了呢
I would think you went to one of my competitors.

292
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,160
-别闹  -对  闭嘴
- Oh, stop. - Yeah, stop.

293
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,540
因为如果你觉得她好看  我走人
Because if you think she looks good, I'm out of here.

294
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,030
抱歉  我就是被她
Sorry. I just got a little distracted

295
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,020
那双大"眼睛"
by those big beautiful...

296
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,560
分了神
eyes.

297
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,600
你的确很喜欢我的"眼睛"
You always did get lost in my... eyes.

298
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,860
我们都懂  你在说她的奶子
We get it. You're talking about her boobies.

299
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,000
真是易如反掌
It's like taking candy from a baby.

300
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,700
艾略特  我觉得首先要
So, Elliot, I think the first thing to do

301
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,780
给你的脸微整一下
is a subtle facelift.

302
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,180
不要"微整"
The hell with subtle.

303
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,840
我要你把我皮拉到像高空跳伞那么紧
I want to get pulled so tight I look like I'm sky-diving.

304
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,810
你怎么样  尤尤
So, how you been, Yo-yo?

305
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,980
挺好的  科科
Oh, can't complain, Co-co.

306
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,850
听说你分手了真抱歉
I was so sorry to hear about your breakup.

307
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,730
等尤尤和科科调完情
If Yo-yo and Co-co are done flirting,

308
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,410
艾艾想整成韩版的马特·达蒙
El-el wants to look like the Korean Matt Damon.

309
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,980
真希望你是我今天最后一个病人了
I wish I didn't have another patient after this.

310
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,040
为什么  我要动那么多吗
Why? Do I need that much work?

311
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,510
我今晚想请你吃晚餐
I'd like to take you to dinner tonight.

312
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,880
-没问题  -真棒
- That would be fine. - Excellent.

313
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,250
会很有趣的
This is gonna be fun.

314
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,580
你绝对想不到
Oh, you have no idea.

315
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,710
我有个主意
Hey, here's an idea.

316
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,000
别拍她马屁了  赶快整整我屁股
Quit kissing her ass and start lifting mine.

317
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,260
是门卫打来的
Okay, that was the doorman.

318
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,910
艾略特在上楼了
Elliot's on his way up right now.

319
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,660
我看起来如何
How do I look?

320
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,490
解开一个  两个还是三个扣子好
One button unbuttoned? Or two? Or three?

321
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,330
我又不是亚瑟小子  还是一个吧
Who am I? Usher? I'll do one.

322
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,480
你看起来很可爱  埃兰·洛文斯汀
You look adorable, Alan Lowenstein.

323
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,150
现在你乖乖坐着  我去走廊找他
Now you sit right there, and I'm gonna go meet him in the hall.

324
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,150
好
Okay.

325
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,720
我过生日可没请你
I did not invite you to my birthday.

326
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,710
但你结婚会请我的哦
But you will invite me to your wedding.

327
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,530
我有个生日惊喜给你
I have a birthday surprise for you.

328
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,650
你这次又干什么了  杀了我的猫吗
What'd you do this time, kill my cat?

329
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,790
不  还记得你大学暗恋的埃兰吗
No. Do you remember your college crush Alan?

330
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,140
-他来了  -什么
- Well, he's here. - What?

331
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,550
没错  小寿星
Yeah, you heard me, birthday boy.

332
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,310
他现在就坐在屋里
He's sitting on the other side of that door right now,

333
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,820
很高兴地想见你
and he's so excited to see you.

334
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,200
真的吗
Seriously?

335
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,540
-真的吗  -真的
- Seriously? - Yeah.

336
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,510
你怎么找到埃兰·奥夏的
How did you find Alan O'Shay?

337
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,940
奥夏吗
O'Shay?

338
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,380
我擦
Oh, ----.

339
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,560
加比  让开  我要见埃兰
Gabi, move! I want to see Alan.

340
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,040
不行
No.

341
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,660
你可不想太猴急
You don't want to seem too eager.

342
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,510
但那是我的招牌动作啊
But that's my signature move.

343
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,490
如果你的新招牌动作
What if your new signature move

344
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,240
是姗姗来迟呢
is being fashionably late?

345
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,980
怎么样  再见  在这等着哦
Ooh, what about that? Okay, bye. Wait here!

346
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,860
他来了吗
Is he here?

347
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,200
还没
Uh, not quite yet.

348
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,160
坏消息  埃兰  艾略特病了
Bad news, Alan. Elliot's sick.

349
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,820
你要是传染上可不好
And I would hate for you to get it.

350
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,030
是啊  我很容易生病的
Well, I don't want it. I am very susceptible.

351
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,790
没错  我也是这么想的
Yeah, uh-huh. That's what I thought.

352
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,290
我们从这走  从那走  走
Let's go this way. Go that way, go that way.

353
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,970
艾略特·帕克
Elliot Park?

354
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,100
埃兰·洛文斯汀
Alan Lowenstein?

355
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,670
-真惊喜  -是啊
- Surprise. - Yes.

356
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,260
真是惊喜
What a surprise.

357
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,820
好吧  怎么回事
All right. What's happening here?

358
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,730
感觉像回到我是希伯莱语学校里唯一没被
It feels like when I was the only boy in Hebrew school

359
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,040
邀请去珍妮·施耐德成人礼的男生一样
not invited to Jenny Schneider's bat mitzvah.

360
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,520
管她呢  反正那贱人也肥成猪了
Whatever. Bitch got fat.

361
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,470
埃兰  我犯了个大错
Listen, Alan, I made a horrible mistake.

362
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,520
你不是那个埃兰
You're the wrong Alan.

363
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,310
她以为你是埃兰·奥夏
She thought you were Alan O'Shay.

364
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,980
埃兰·奥夏吗
Alan O'Shay?

365
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,640
我倒是想
Oh, I wish.

366
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
看来你们都喜欢同一个埃兰嘛
Hey, looks like you both love the same Alan.

367
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,060
不如你们边享用我
Why don't you talk about him

368
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,330
给你们准备的丰盛大餐  边聊聊他吧
over the magnificent dinner that I made you?

369
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,400
所以我都不该来这的
So, I'm not even supposed to be here.

370
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,510
真是丢脸
This is so embarrassing.

371
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,710
-我该走了  -别走
- I should go. - No, don't.

372
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,080
这是她办砸的事  她该走
She's the one who screwed this up. She should go.

373
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,500
你留下
You stay.

374
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,060
否则我等下也会泡在浴缸里暴食那桌菜的
Otherwise I'm just gonna shame-eat all this in the bathtub later.

375
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,170
艾略特·帕克泡在浴缸里
Elliot Park in the bathtub?

376
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,970
谁给我跟冰棒降降温
Oy, I need a popsicle.

377
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,810
真是绅士
Oh, such a gentleman.

378
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,700
你不用一直送我回乔什家的
You didn't have to walk me all the way back to Josh's.

379
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,050
但我很高兴你送了
But I'm glad you did.

380
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,200
我想告诉艾略特我可以挤出个
I wanted to tell Elliot I could squeeze him in

381
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,070
下周的手术时间给他
for surgery appointment next week.

382
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,580
只是因为这个吗
That's the only reason?

383
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,100
不
No.

384
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,710
我在拥有的时候从来不懂珍惜
I never knew what I had when I had it.

385
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,740
现在懂了  我很怀念
Now that I do, I miss it.

386
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,640
你在说我  是吗
You're talking about me, right?

387
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,950
当然
Damn right.

388
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,220
所以...
So?

389
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,900
埃兰和艾略特怎么样
How are Alan and Elliot doing?

390
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,980
我只能说这是我开的第二瓶酒了
Let's just say I'm opening another bottle of wine.

391
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,340
那进展不错咯
So it's going well.

392
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,460
我不知道  是我自己喝的
I have no idea. This is for me.

393
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,960
幸福小俩口回来了
There's the happy couple.

394
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,570
幸福过分了吧
Almost too happy.

395
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,050
看  艾略特在那呢
Look, there's Elliot.

396
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,410
不如你去告诉他手术日程的好消息吧
Why don't you go tell him the good news about your schedule.

397
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,020
看到他表情没  乔什
You see his face, Josh?

398
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,570
你是说跟你一样的傻笑吗
You mean that same stupid grin I see on yours?

399
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,530
我搞得定  亲爱的  一切尽在掌握
Oh, I got this. It's all part of an act, baby.

400
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,000
等一下  他会送我去电梯
Next up, he's gonna walk me to the elevator.

401
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,440
我会给他毕生难忘的一个吻
I'm gonna give him the kiss of a lifetime.

402
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,280
然后说  "等等  科尔曼
Then I'm gonna say, "Hold up, Coleman.

403
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,420
我有话跟你说
I have something to say to you.

404
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:56,020
报应是个叫尤兰达的婊子"
Payback's a bitch named Yolanda!"

405
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,770
你要先测个血型
You'll just need to get your bloodwork done,

406
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,010
不过下周肯定可以了
but you should be all set for next week.

407
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,190
谢谢你帮我排进去
Thanks for squeezing me in.

408
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,130
还有给我亲友折扣
And thanks for the friends and family discount.

409
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,760
等等  我没说有...
Wait. We didn't say anything about--

410
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,230
再见
Bye!

411
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,250
-怎么了  -我不想说
- What? - I don't want to say anything.

412
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,060
但还是要说
But I will.

413
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,670
不敢相信你要去整容
I can't believe you're getting plastic surgery.

414
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,260
干嘛要乱动自己完美的脸呢
Why do you want to mess with perfection?

415
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,060
就像那些做无麸百吉饼的人一样
It's like those people who make the gluten-free bagels.

416
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,550
什么
What?

417
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,250
你的脸那么帅  那么年轻
Your face is so handsome and youthful.

418
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,170
那两条浓眉
Those thick luscious eyebrows.

419
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,770
就像两只美丽的毛毛虫
They're like two magnificent caterpillars

420
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,480
在说着"我才不要当蝴蝶"
who said, "To hell with becoming butterflies."

421
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,830
如果我不知道我们一样大
If I didn't know we were the same age,

422
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,350
我只敢相信你最多32
I'd swear you weren't a day over 32.

423
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,960
知道吗
You know,

424
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,090
加比今晚请你来
Gabi inviting you here tonight

425
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,430
或许是她犯过最好的错了
might have been the best mistake she's ever made.

426
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,640
敬错误
To mistakes.

427
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,410
尤兰达
Yolanda...

428
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,330
今晚真的很棒
today was amazing.

429
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,980
就像以前一样
Just like old times.

430
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,680
比以前更好  是你请客的
Better. You paid.

431
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,500
知道吗  如果按不到电梯钮
You know, if I don't push that button,

432
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,400
我可走不掉
I will never leave.

433
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,330
那你按啊
So push it.

434
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,360
等等
Hold it.

435
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,650
科尔曼  我有话跟你说
Coleman, I have something to say to you.

436
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,370
说什么
What's that?

437
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,130
你周五晚上有空吗
Are you free friday night?

438
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,370
我知道今天不能再糟
I know this day was a disaster,

439
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,890
但每个人过生日都该有蛋糕吃
but everybody deserves a cake on their birthday.

440
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,720
这是分层草莓松饼
It's a tiered strawberry shortcake

441
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,220
配塔希提香草奶油和鲜莓
with Tahitian-vanilla whipped cream and fresh berries.

442
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,440
他会很期待把它扔你脸上的
Ooh, he is gonna love throwing that in your face.

443
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,920
那我还是等下再点蜡烛吧
I'll hold off on lighting the candles.

444
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,340
怎么样
So?

445
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,180
报复成功了吗
Did you get your revenge?

446
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,950
杀得他片甲不留
Oh, I made out like a bandit.

447
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,100
艾略特  不像你的人生
Elliot, unlike your life,

448
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,870
你的蛋糕可没被我搞砸
your cake is one thing I'd never screw up.

449
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,670
-唱  -等等
- Sing-- - Hold on.

450
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,330
我要先说句话
I'd like to say something first.

451
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,100
-这个生日很糟  -是我  我干的
- This birthday has sucked. - That was me. I did that.

452
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,640
但还有一件好事
There's been one bright spot

453
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,390
就是又和埃兰见面了
and that's been reconnecting with Alan.

454
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,520
是我  我干的
That was me. I did that.

455
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:30,250
这位可爱  风趣  英俊的男人
This sweet, funny, adorable man

456
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,490
让我知道我不需要整容
made me realize I don't need plastic surgery.

457
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,260
我觉得40岁会是我最好的年华
I think 40 could be my best year yet.

458
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,130
等等  我都42了  你怎么会40
Wait. How can you be 40 if I'm 42?

459
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,730
怎么样
How's it going?

460
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,640
他说这次是自己拍过最精彩的照片
He says it's going to be one of the best ones yet.

461
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,660
一个还在白纸上记录自己
The tech guy who still writes out his ideas

462
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,280
创意的程序员
on butcher block paper.

463
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,870
我可不是一般帅  我是复古小开
I'm not just cool. I'm retro cool.

464
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,790
谢谢你  艾略特
Thank you, Elliot.

465
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,400
也谢谢你过去几天为我做了那么多
Thank you for putting up with me the last few days.

466
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,090
都搞定了
All done here.

467
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,220
我能说我超爱这幅画吗
Can I just say I love the painting?

468
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,470
现在我知道该送我丈夫什么生日礼物了
Now I know what to get my husband for his birthday.

469
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,500
我很高兴我们终于做了次
I'm so thrilled we're finally doing

470
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,370
成功同志的桌面拍照
a gay desk for success.

471
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,180
至少我爸妈会高兴我嫁了个百万富翁
Well, at least my parents will be happy I married a millionaire.

472
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,320
先生
Sir?

對不起  我現在就煮咖啡
Oh, sorry. I'll make some more coffee right now.

16
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,770
沒事  我來
No worries. I'll do it.

17
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,840
因為你不想讓我骯臟的農民手碰嗎
'Cause you don't want my grubby peasant hands on it?

18
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,370
不是  傻瓜
No, silly billy.

19
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,800
我可以自己來
I can do it myself.

20
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,960
我還在床上做夢  我上班要遲到了
Okay, I'm still in bed dreaming, and I'm gonna be late for work.

21
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,690
艾略特  你心情很好
Elliot, you're in a pretty good mood,

22
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,680
明天就是你40歲生日了
considering your big 4-0 is tomorrow.

23
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,210
我還以為你會驚慌失措呢
I thought you might be freaking out.

24
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,010
更像是十分激動
More like getting my freak on.

25
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,680
和安德烈一起
With Andre.

26
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,440
這是我第一次生日時有男朋友
This is the first time I've ever had a boyfriend on my birthday.

27
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,960
39年的悲傷
39 years of sorrow,

28
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,320
我終于可以穿著生日禮服
and I finally get to celebrate my birthday

29
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,210
慶祝生日了
in my birthday suit.

30
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,470
天啊  我真喜歡有男朋友的艾略特
Oh my god, I love Elliot with a boyfriend.

31
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,150
他開心時我也開心
When he's happy, I'm happy.

32
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,580
也許我們還會成為朋友  那就太棒了
Maybe we'll even be friends, which would be great,

33
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,030
因為人不會告訴朋友
because friends don't tell friends

34
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,070
她看起來像廉價商店的妓女
they look like dime store hookers.

35
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,440
朋友會說  你穿這條裙子好漂亮
Friends say, "Hey, you look cute in that dress."

36
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,310
裙子真漂亮
Hey, cute dress.

37
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,670
好了  我們得讓這輛愛情火車繼續開
Okay, that's it. We've got to keep this love train going.

38
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,510
我要給安德烈打電話
I'm calling Andre.

39
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,080
艾略特會擁有最浪漫的生日晚餐
Elliot's about to have the most romantic birthday dinner ever.

40
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,000
那主意很棒
That's a pretty good idea.

41
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,320
真可惜  那比不過我的禮物
Too bad it's not gonna top my present.

42
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,530
因為我賺的錢最多
Because I make the most money here,

43
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,200
還被頂尖雜志稱為創意天才
and I was called a creative genius by a top publication.

44
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,060
是《每月吹噓》嗎
Oh, was it Bragging Monthly?

45
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,870
怎么  你想看是什么禮物嗎  好我去拿
What's that? You want to see what it is? Okay, I'll get it.

46
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,440
我找安德烈花店的安德烈
Hi, can I speak to Andre of Flowers by Andre?

47
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,920
你好  安德烈  我是加比
Hey, Andre, it's Gabi.

48
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,190
是的  煩人的金發廚師
Yes, the annoying blonde cook.

49
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,050
艾略特要過40歲生日了  我想給他個驚喜
Listen, I'm surprising Elliot for his 40th birthday

50
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,170
做一頓浪漫晚餐  顯然也想請你做他的約會對象
with a romantic dinner, and obviously I want you to be his date.

51
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,560
好  看看日程然后打給我
Okay, great. Check your schedule, get back to me.

52
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,720
怎么了
What?

53
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,680
天啊
Oh my god.

54
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,630
艾略特和安德烈  好有愛
Elliot and Andre. That's so cute.

55
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,420
這肯定讓你覺得自己的禮物很爛
I bet this makes you feel pretty lousy about your gift.

56
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,150
天啊
Oh my god!

57
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,930
安德烈剛發現我今年40而不是32歲
Andre just found out I'm turning 40 instead of 32

58
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,520
跟我分手了
and broke up with me.

59
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,830
什么
What?

60
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,540
這真是最爛的生日
This is officially the worst birthday ever!

61
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,450
天啊
Oh my god!

62
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,970
別擔心  艾略特
Don't worry, Elliot.

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,780
-安德烈不會是你最后一個約會對象  -是啊
- Andre's not the last guy you'll ever date. - Yeah.

64
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,830
你肯定會被很多男人甩掉的
I'm sure you'll get dumped by tons of guys.

65
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,650
我這輩子只愛過三個人
I've only ever loved three men in my life.

66
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,090
安德烈  大學里暗戀的埃蘭
Andre, my college crush Alan,

67
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,570
還有騷當
and Adam Levine.

68
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,470
我知道這聽起來很瘋狂
And I know it sounds crazy,

69
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,730
但安德烈是唯一一個也愛我的人
but Andre's the only one who loved me back.

70
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,280
我知道這可能不是提的最佳時機
I know this might not be the best time to bring this up,

71
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,370
但《連線》的人明天要來拍我的桌面了
but the guys from Wired are coming to photograph my desk tomorrow

72
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,210
要發表在"成功之桌"專欄上
for the Desk For Success column.

73
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,010
我們準備好了嗎
Are we ready?

74
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,570
-沒有  -那么
- No. - So...

75
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,600
我這話是很友好的
And I mean this in the nicest possible way,

76
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,880
你覺得什么時候能好啊
when do you think we'll be ready?

77
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,280
等有人再愛上我怎么樣
How about when someone loves me again?

78
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,740
所以是永遠不會
So never!

79
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,250
早上好  親愛的們
Good morning, beautiful people!

80
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,790
我說這是個很棒的早上
I said what a good morning it is.

81
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,500
安德烈和艾略特分手了  因為他40歲了
Andre broke up with Elliot because he's turning 40.

82
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,780
那么多原因  他只選了這個嗎
Out of all the reasons, that's what he picked?

83
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,230
真遺憾  親愛的
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

84
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,080
你想聽聽別人的痛苦的故事嗎
You want to hear a story about somebody else's pain?

85
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,850
那總是能讓你開心
That always cheers you up.

86
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,430
我前夫科爾曼
My ex-husband Coleman,

87
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,190
為了一個更年輕的女人甩了我
who dumped me for a younger woman,

88
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,550
剛被一個更年輕的女人甩了
just got dumped by a younger woman...

89
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,120
在結婚典禮上
at the altar.

90
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,320
至少他倆結婚了
At least he got to the altar.

91
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,020
安德烈是怎么知道我真實年齡的
How did Andre find out my real age anyway?

92
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,970
只有你們三個人知道
The only people who knew were you three.

93
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,770
哪一個告訴的他
Which one of you told him?

94
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,700
不是我
Not me.

95
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,250
我還以為你50呢
I thought you were 50.

96
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,470
對不起  是我
I am so sorry. It was me.

97
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,020
天啊  是你
Oh my god, it was you!

98
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,010
艾略特  我真的很抱歉
Listen, Elliot, I'm really sorry.

99
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,510
我只是想為你做點好事
I was just trying to do something nice for you.

100
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,180
那本來是個驚喜的  我們要成為朋友的
It was gonna be a surprise. We were gonna be friends.

101
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,370
你毀了那一切  對吧
Well, you ruined that, didn't you?

102
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,380
我永遠也不會原諒你  加比·戴蒙德
I will never forgive you, Gabi Diamond!

103
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,820
他只是需要一點時間
He just needs some time.

104
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,250
永遠不會
Never!

105
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,080
你還好嗎
How you doin'?

106
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,320
我的人生結束了
My life's over.

107
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,140
你不明白
You don't understand.

108
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,290
基佬年里  40歲等于是80歲
40 is 80 in gay years.

109
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,340
拜托  我不明白嗎
Please. I don't understand?

110
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,730
跟我一樣大的男人想要20歲的女人
Men my age want women in their 20s.

111
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,810
這意味著我只能擁有120歲的男人
Which means the only man I can get is 120.

112
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,840
真好  我跟你一樣又胖又老了
Great. I'm in the same fat, old boat as you.

113
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,690
沒錯
That's right.

114
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,820
你知道當我覺得自己老時怎么做嗎
You know what I do when I'm feeling old?

115
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,750
我涂上睫毛膏  打理頭發
I get my lashes done, I freshen up the weave,

116
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,140
買新唇膏
I buy new lipstick--

117
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,970
我是基佬  但沒那么基
I'm gay, but not that gay.

118
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,530
我剛有了個主意
Oh, I just got an idea.

119
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,460
你知道我前夫科爾曼
You know my ex Coleman

120
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,100
是城里最棒的整形醫生
is the top plastic surgeon in the city.

121
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,360
你覺得我需要整形嗎
You think I need plastic surgery?

122
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,190
整一下我能像32的
I could pass for 32.

123
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,350
整一下我還能像霉霉呢
And I could pass for Taylor Swift.

124
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,990
來看看
Let's see.

125
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,790
這里
Over here...

126
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,830
我好美
I'm beautiful.

127
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,070
好了
Okay.

128
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,780
我這就去給科爾曼打電話
I'm gonna call Coleman right now.

129
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,680
好  等等  別打
Yes. Wait, no.

130
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,490
你不能為了我去跟那劈腿男打交道
I can't make you deal with that cheater for me.

131
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,810
別說傻話了
Oh, that's ridiculous.

132
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,350
我帶你去
I'll take you myself.

133
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,420
-我希望你開心  -從什么時候開始
- I want you to be happy. - Since when?

134
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,500
因為是你的生日
Since it's your birthday.

135
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,120
因為科爾曼被甩了  你想當面嘲笑他吧
And since Coleman got dumped, you want to rub it in his face?

136
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,220
賤男不就是該被這么教訓嗎
Isn't that how you teach a dog a lesson?

137
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,060
我覺得我有辦法...
Okay, I think I've figured out a way...

138
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,330
來幫我嗎
To help me?

139
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,150
上個月  《連線》 拍了伊隆·馬斯克的飄浮桌
Last month, Wired featured Elon Musk at his hover-desk.

140
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,150
{\an8}特斯拉汽車首席執行官

141
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,040
是的  我看到了  好酷的
Oh yeah! I saw that. That was really cool!

142
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,430
我幫不上忙  對嗎
I'm not helping, am I?

143
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,870
我知道這對你來說或許算不上什么大事
Look, I know this might not seem like a big deal to you,

144
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,830
但我這行的所有人都會看這個專欄
But everybody in my business reads this column.

145
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,010
風險投資家  潛在客戶  軟件開發者
Venture capitalists, potential clients, software developers--

146
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,300
所以你想看起來酷一點嗎
So you want to seem cool?

147
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,850
-沒錯  -別擔心  好嗎
- Yes! - Don't worry, okay?

148
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,790
他會在你接受拍攝前調整好情緒的
You're gonna have him back in time for your shoot.

149
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,040
我想出了最能表達
I figured out the perfect

150
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,280
"抱歉  我毀了你的生日"的禮物
"I'm sorry I ruined your birthday" present.

151
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,530
他爸媽知道他40了  對嗎
His parents know he's 40, right?

152
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,360
-怎么會不知道  -我是這么計劃的
- Why wouldn't they? - So here's my plan.

153
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,540
因為艾略特少有機會見他的父母
Since Elliot rarely gets a chance to see his parents,

154
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,140
所以我想請他們一家吃一頓豐盛的韓式晚餐
I'm inviting them to a five-course Korean dinner.

155
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,400
他會喜歡的
He'll love that.

156
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,290
-現在就給他們打電話  -好的
- Here, let's call them now. - Okay.

157
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,900
喂  帕克先生嗎  我是加比·戴蒙德
Hi, Mr. Park? It's Gabi Diamond.

158
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,250
艾略特的同事
I work with Elliot.

159
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,080
對  那個討人厭的金發廚師
Yes, the annoying blonde cook.

160
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,020
艾略特的男友跟他分手了
Anyway, Elliot's boyfriend broke up with him

161
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,810
我不希望他孤單一人過生日
and I don't want him to be alone on his big day,

162
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,050
所以我想問問你們是否愿意飛過來
so I was wondering if maybe you could fly in

163
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,720
明晚和他一起吃生日晚餐
for a birthday dinner tomorrow night.

164
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,430
太好了  問一下帕克夫人  給我回電
Okay, great. Check with Mrs. Park. Call me back.

165
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,840
你打算請他們在哪吃晚餐
So, where are you planning on having this dinner?

166
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,110
我以為你不會問呢  你家陽臺
I thought you'd never ask. Your terrace.

167
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,480
沒問題  晚餐費用我出
No problem. And I want to pay for the dinner.

168
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,470
但你已經出了他們的機票錢了
Oh, but you're already paying for their flights.

169
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,940
天吶
Oh my God!

170
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,710
剛剛有人代我向我爸媽出柜了
Someone just outed me to my parents!

171
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,410
等等
Wait.

172
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,110
你爸媽不知道你是基佬嗎
Your parents didn't know you were gay?

173
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,470
不知道  他們超級傳統的
No. They're super traditional.

174
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,380
甚至都不怎么過性生活
They don't even like sex with each other.

175
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,290
-他們是怎么知道的  -加比干的
- How the hell did they find out? - Gabi did it.

176
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,040
我需要他  他是我的"桌語者"
I need him. He's the desk whisperer.

177
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,210
知道嗎  喬什
You know what, Josh?

178
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,410
我想到了最好的生日禮物
I just thought of the perfect birthday gift.

179
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,470
讓那個小婊砸從我眼前消失
Tell that dime store hooker to get out of my face.

180
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,360
-好吧  我能...  -加比  請回家
- Okay, can I-- - Gabi, home.

181
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,380
再見
Bye.

182
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,770
說你裙子可愛  我是騙你的
And that cute dress? I lied!

183
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,360
你回來的真早
You're home early.

184
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,640
你做了什么
What'd you do?

185
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,740
我導致了艾略特的男友跟他分手
I caused Elliot's boyfriend to break up with him,

186
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,030
然后還向他爸媽出柜了
and then I outed him to his parents,

187
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,880
要是我再這么說下去  聽起來一切都不錯
and if I keep talking like this, everything sounds great!

188
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,320
我勒個去
Holy crap.

189
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,390
對了  我有沒有提到明天是他的生日
Oh yeah. And did I mention it's his birthday tomorrow?

190
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,740
等等  喬什炒你魷魚了嗎
Wait. So, Josh fired you?

191
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,050
沒  索菲亞  喬什沒解雇我
No, Sofia, Josh didn't fire me.

192
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,310
只是我們都覺得
We just have a mutual agreement

193
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,380
我不在他家會好些
that things are better when I'm not around.

194
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,290
我該怎么彌補
How do I fix this?

195
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,800
你毀了他的戀情
Okay, well, you destroyed his relationship,

196
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,490
告訴了他爸媽他是基佬
you told his parents he was gay.

197
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,810
你有時間做飯嗎
When do you find time to cook?

198
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,490
我知道了  我給艾略特找個新男友就行了
Hey, I know. I'll just find Elliot a new boyfriend.

199
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,950
他說他這一生只愛過三個男人
He said he's only loved three men in his entire life.

200
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,120
安德烈  騷當
Andre, Adam Levine,

201
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,520
還有個名叫埃蘭的大學同學
and some guy named Alan from college.

202
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,600
太好了  我們去找大學同學埃蘭吧
That's great. So we find Alan from college.

203
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,230
我剛要說這句話
I was gonna say that!

204
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,030
你不讓我說完  我永遠學不聰明
If you don't let me get there, I'm never gonna learn.

205
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,440
好了  開工
Okay, all right.

206
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,300
-我打開了艾略特的臉書主頁  -好的
- I'm on Elliot's Facebook page. - Okay.

207
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,110
只有兩個人叫埃蘭
There's only two Alans.

208
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,690
埃蘭·錫克和埃蘭·洛文斯汀
Alan Thicke and Alan Lowenstein.

209
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,690
{\an8}前一個埃蘭是加拿大演員  生于1947年

210
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,500
我知道了  是埃蘭·洛文斯汀
I know. It's Alan Lowenstein

211
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,790
因為他是伯克利畢業的
because he went to Berkeley

212
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,870
艾略特也是這所學校畢業的
and that is also where Elliot went to college.

213
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,060
是啊  只有這個原因了
Yes, that's the only reason we know which Alan.

214
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,280
今天正式是你的生日了
Well, today is officially your birthday.

215
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,680
生日快樂  看見沒
Happy birthday. See?

216
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,650
我把安德烈的臉改成了我的
It's my face instead of Andre's.

217
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,020
這代表了我們的友情
It represents our friendship--

218
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,660
老板  公關
Boss, publicist.

219
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,060
互幫互助
Always there for each other.

220
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,550
別說了  我決定不慶祝我的生日
Stop. I've decided not to celebrate my birthday.

221
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,050
我明白了  好兄弟
I get it, big guy.

222
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,530
你想專心在《連線》的拍照上
You want to focus on the photo shoot with Wired.

223
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,190
喬什  在整容咨詢結束后
Josh, I'm gonna be able to focus better

224
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,670
我會更好地專心的
after my cosmetic surgery consultation.

225
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,080
什么
What?

226
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,230
艾略特  你不需要整容
Elliot, you don't need plastic surgery.

227
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,340
讓詹姆斯醫生決定吧
We'll let Dr. James decide that.

228
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,360
尤蘭達的前夫嗎
Yolanda's ex-husband?

229
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,320
是的  她替我預約的
Yes, she got me an appointment.

230
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,780
正要帶我去呢
She's taking me right now.

231
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,530
她想見他是因為她聽說他現在單身
She wants to see him because she heard he's single.

232
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,510
不  她不喜歡他
No, she doesn't like him.

233
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,910
只是想當面嘲笑他被甩
She just wants to rub the breakup in his face.

234
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,000
我不覺得她這打扮是想要當面嘲笑他
I don't think that's what she wants to rub in his face.

235
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,780
-能走了嗎  -我知道是怎么一回事了
- You ready? - Look, I see what's going on here.

236
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,980
你利用艾略特作為見科爾曼的借口
You're using Elliot as an excuse to see Coleman.

237
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,180
拜托  看看他這張松弛的臉
Oh, please. Look at his saggy face.

238
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,100
他看起來就像一條等人解救的巴哥犬
He looks like a rescue pug.

239
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,650
這樣誰會救他啊
That's never gonna get rescued.

240
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,290
尤蘭達
Yolanda.

241
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,730
你辛勤工作多年
You worked day and night for years

242
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,120
供科爾曼讀醫學院
to put Coleman through medical school.

243
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,320
他一當上醫生
The minute he became a doctor,

244
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,890
就跟他的助手私奔了
he ran off with his assistant.

245
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,140
現在是報應的時候了
And now it is payback time.

246
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,730
他單身  又脆弱
He is single and vulnerable.

247
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,510
我要施展魅力
I am gonna turn on the charm,

248
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,350
讓他約我出去
and get him to take me out,

249
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,740
等把他玩弄于鼓掌之中以后
and right when I got him wrapped around my finger,

250
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,980
再狠狠甩了他  就像他當初一樣
I'm gonna dump his sorry ass like he dumped mine.

251
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,060
不敢相信能找到你  埃蘭  艾略特一定很高興
I can't believe I found you, Alan. Elliot's gonna be so excited.

252
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,470
你覺得高興的是他嗎
You think he's gonna be excited.

253
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,970
我在專業定向會上就對他有好感了
I've had a crush on him since freshman orientation.

254
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,550
老實說  我就是那樣給自己"定向"的
In fact, that's the way I discovered my orientation.

255
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,030
你真有趣
That's funny. You're funny.

256
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,050
"有趣"嗎  人不帥才會這么說吧
Funny? That's what people say when someone's not cute.

257
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,500
天啊  我緊張的要汗流浹背了
Oh god, I'm so nervous I'm schvitzing up a storm.

258
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,100
我不知道那詞什么意思
I don't know what schvitzing is,

259
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,910
但我覺得你沒有
but I can't tell you're doing it.

260
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,750
別擔心  沒事的
Don't worry. You're gonna be fine.

261
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,970
-你還單著  多棒呀  -是啊
- How lucky is it that you're single? - Yeah.

262
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,730
就像中彩票一樣棒
I'm like a lotto winner.

263
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,220
不敢相信艾略特還是單身
I can't believe Elliot's still single.

264
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,920
他那么搶手
He's such a catch.

265
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,220
艾略特·帕克嗎
Elliot... Park?

266
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,260
真希望你能提前幾周通知我
You know, I wish you would've given me a few weeks' notice.

267
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,850
我好減幾斤肥
I would've lost five pounds.

268
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,490
我騙誰呢
Eh, who am I kidding?

269
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,320
我懂的  你想給他個驚喜
Oh, I get it. You want to surprise him.

270
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,110
終于做件對的事驚喜他吧
Surprise him by doing something right.

271
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,480
稍等
Wait here.

272
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,540
加比
Gabi.

273
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,700
艾略特回來不能發現你在這
Elliot cannot come home and find you here.

274
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,250
他不在真好  聽著  我有其它辦法了
Oh good. He's gone. Listen, I have another plan.

275
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,480
我覺得你還不懂"計劃"這詞
I think you're using the word "plan" wrong.

276
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,630
這回不會錯  好了  有請...
This one's a winner. Okay, meet...

277
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,830
埃蘭·洛文斯汀  艾略特久違的大學愛人
Alan Lowenstein, Elliot's long lost college love.

278
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,980
知道他的真實年齡  他的性向
He knows his real age, knows he's gay,

279
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,510
還一直是單身
and he's still single.

280
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,090
你干嘛總提這茬
Why do you keep saying that?

281
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,130
你也不對任何藥物過敏嗎
And you're not allergic to any medications?

282
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,340
如果有  我也不在乎
If I am, I don't care.

283
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,260
麻暈我  撕下這張老皮
Dope me up, peel this off,

284
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,940
換個新臉上去
and slap a new face on me.

285
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,530
我覺得該進來跟科爾曼打聲招呼
Just thought I'd poke my head in and say a quick hey to Coleman.

286
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,070
尤蘭達  你沒說你會來啊
Yolanda, you didn't tell me you were coming.

287
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,020
快  去檢查下我保時捷的車胎
Quick, go check the tires on my Porsche.

288
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,270
不  真的  去看看
No, seriously, go check.

289
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,300
看看你
Wow, look at you.

290
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,660
如果我不知道
If I didn't know better,

291
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,990
還以為你也動過刀子了呢
I would think you went to one of my competitors.

292
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,160
-別鬧  -對  閉嘴
- Oh, stop. - Yeah, stop.

293
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,540
因為如果你覺得她好看  我走人
Because if you think she looks good, I'm out of here.

294
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,030
抱歉  我就是被她
Sorry. I just got a little distracted

295
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,020
那雙大"眼睛"
by those big beautiful...

296
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,560
分了神
eyes.

297
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,600
你的確很喜歡我的"眼睛"
You always did get lost in my... eyes.

298
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,860
我們都懂  你在說她的奶子
We get it. You're talking about her boobies.

299
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,000
真是易如反掌
It's like taking candy from a baby.

300
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,700
艾略特  我覺得首先要
So, Elliot, I think the first thing to do

301
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,780
給你的臉微整一下
is a subtle facelift.

302
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,180
不要"微整"
The hell with subtle.

303
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,840
我要你把我皮拉到像高空跳傘那么緊
I want to get pulled so tight I look like I'm sky-diving.

304
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,810
你怎么樣  尤尤
So, how you been, Yo-yo?

305
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,980
挺好的  科科
Oh, can't complain, Co-co.

306
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,850
聽說你分手了真抱歉
I was so sorry to hear about your breakup.

307
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,730
等尤尤和科科調完情
If Yo-yo and Co-co are done flirting,

308
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,410
艾艾想整成韓版的馬特·達蒙
El-el wants to look like the Korean Matt Damon.

309
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,980
真希望你是我今天最后一個病人了
I wish I didn't have another patient after this.

310
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,040
為什么  我要動那么多嗎
Why? Do I need that much work?

311
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,510
我今晚想請你吃晚餐
I'd like to take you to dinner tonight.

312
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,880
-沒問題  -真棒
- That would be fine. - Excellent.

313
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,250
會很有趣的
This is gonna be fun.

314
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,580
你絕對想不到
Oh, you have no idea.

315
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,710
我有個主意
Hey, here's an idea.

316
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,000
別拍她馬屁了  趕快整整我屁股
Quit kissing her ass and start lifting mine.

317
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,260
是門衛打來的
Okay, that was the doorman.

318
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,910
艾略特在上樓了
Elliot's on his way up right now.

319
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,660
我看起來如何
How do I look?

320
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,490
解開一個  兩個還是三個扣子好
One button unbuttoned? Or two? Or three?

321
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,330
我又不是亞瑟小子  還是一個吧
Who am I? Usher? I'll do one.

322
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,480
你看起來很可愛  埃蘭·洛文斯汀
You look adorable, Alan Lowenstein.

323
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,150
現在你乖乖坐著  我去走廊找他
Now you sit right there, and I'm gonna go meet him in the hall.

324
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,150
好
Okay.

325
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,720
我過生日可沒請你
I did not invite you to my birthday.

326
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,710
但你結婚會請我的哦
But you will invite me to your wedding.

327
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,530
我有個生日驚喜給你
I have a birthday surprise for you.

328
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,650
你這次又干什么了  殺了我的貓嗎
What'd you do this time, kill my cat?

329
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,790
不  還記得你大學暗戀的埃蘭嗎
No. Do you remember your college crush Alan?

330
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,140
-他來了  -什么
- Well, he's here. - What?

331
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,550
沒錯  小壽星
Yeah, you heard me, birthday boy.

332
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,310
他現在就坐在屋里
He's sitting on the other side of that door right now,

333
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,820
很高興地想見你
and he's so excited to see you.

334
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,200
真的嗎
Seriously?

335
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,540
-真的嗎  -真的
- Seriously? - Yeah.

336
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,510
你怎么找到埃蘭·奧夏的
How did you find Alan O'Shay?

337
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,940
奧夏嗎
O'Shay?

338
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,380
我擦
Oh, ----.

339
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,560
加比  讓開  我要見埃蘭
Gabi, move! I want to see Alan.

340
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,040
不行
No.

341
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,660
你可不想太猴急
You don't want to seem too eager.

342
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,510
但那是我的招牌動作啊
But that's my signature move.

343
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,490
如果你的新招牌動作
What if your new signature move

344
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,240
是姍姍來遲呢
is being fashionably late?

345
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,980
怎么樣  再見  在這等著哦
Ooh, what about that? Okay, bye. Wait here!

346
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,860
他來了嗎
Is he here?

347
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,200
還沒
Uh, not quite yet.

348
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,160
壞消息  埃蘭  艾略特病了
Bad news, Alan. Elliot's sick.

349
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,820
你要是傳染上可不好
And I would hate for you to get it.

350
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,030
是啊  我很容易生病的
Well, I don't want it. I am very susceptible.

351
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,790
沒錯  我也是這么想的
Yeah, uh-huh. That's what I thought.

352
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,290
我們從這走  從那走  走
Let's go this way. Go that way, go that way.

353
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,970
艾略特·帕克
Elliot Park?

354
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,100
埃蘭·洛文斯汀
Alan Lowenstein?

355
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,670
-真驚喜  -是啊
- Surprise. - Yes.

356
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,260
真是驚喜
What a surprise.

357
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,820
好吧  怎么回事
All right. What's happening here?

358
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,730
感覺像回到我是希伯萊語學校里唯一沒被
It feels like when I was the only boy in Hebrew school

359
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,040
邀請去珍妮·施耐德成人禮的男生一樣
not invited to Jenny Schneider's bat mitzvah.

360
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,520
管她呢  反正那賤人也肥成豬了
Whatever. Bitch got fat.

361
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,470
埃蘭  我犯了個大錯
Listen, Alan, I made a horrible mistake.

362
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,520
你不是那個埃蘭
You're the wrong Alan.

363
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,310
她以為你是埃蘭·奧夏
She thought you were Alan O'Shay.

364
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,980
埃蘭·奧夏嗎
Alan O'Shay?

365
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,640
我倒是想
Oh, I wish.

366
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
看來你們都喜歡同一個埃蘭嘛
Hey, looks like you both love the same Alan.

367
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,060
不如你們邊享用我
Why don't you talk about him

368
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,330
給你們準備的豐盛大餐  邊聊聊他吧
over the magnificent dinner that I made you?

369
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,400
所以我都不該來這的
So, I'm not even supposed to be here.

370
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,510
真是丟臉
This is so embarrassing.

371
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,710
-我該走了  -別走
- I should go. - No, don't.

372
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,080
這是她辦砸的事  她該走
She's the one who screwed this up. She should go.

373
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,500
你留下
You stay.

374
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,060
否則我等下也會泡在浴缸里暴食那桌菜的
Otherwise I'm just gonna shame-eat all this in the bathtub later.

375
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,170
艾略特·帕克泡在浴缸里
Elliot Park in the bathtub?

376
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,970
誰給我跟冰棒降降溫
Oy, I need a popsicle.

377
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,810
真是紳士
Oh, such a gentleman.

378
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,700
你不用一直送我回喬什家的
You didn't have to walk me all the way back to Josh's.

379
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,050
但我很高興你送了
But I'm glad you did.

380
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,200
我想告訴艾略特我可以擠出個
I wanted to tell Elliot I could squeeze him in

381
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,070
下周的手術時間給他
for surgery appointment next week.

382
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,580
只是因為這個嗎
That's the only reason?

383
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,100
不
No.

384
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,710
我在擁有的時候從來不懂珍惜
I never knew what I had when I had it.

385
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,740
現在懂了  我很懷念
Now that I do, I miss it.

386
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,640
你在說我  是嗎
You're talking about me, right?

387
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,950
當然
Damn right.

388
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,220
所以...
So?

389
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,900
埃蘭和艾略特怎么樣
How are Alan and Elliot doing?

390
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,980
我只能說這是我開的第二瓶酒了
Let's just say I'm opening another bottle of wine.

391
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,340
那進展不錯咯
So it's going well.

392
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,460
我不知道  是我自己喝的
I have no idea. This is for me.

393
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,960
幸福小倆口回來了
There's the happy couple.

394
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,570
幸福過分了吧
Almost too happy.

395
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,050
看  艾略特在那呢
Look, there's Elliot.

396
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,410
不如你去告訴他手術日程的好消息吧
Why don't you go tell him the good news about your schedule.

397
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,020
看到他表情沒  喬什
You see his face, Josh?

398
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,570
你是說跟你一樣的傻笑嗎
You mean that same stupid grin I see on yours?

399
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,530
我搞得定  親愛的  一切盡在掌握
Oh, I got this. It's all part of an act, baby.

400
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,000
等一下  他會送我去電梯
Next up, he's gonna walk me to the elevator.

401
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,440
我會給他畢生難忘的一個吻
I'm gonna give him the kiss of a lifetime.

402
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,280
然后說  "等等  科爾曼
Then I'm gonna say, "Hold up, Coleman.

403
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,420
我有話跟你說
I have something to say to you.

404
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:56,020
報應是個叫尤蘭達的婊子"
Payback's a bitch named Yolanda!"

405
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,770
你要先測個血型
You'll just need to get your bloodwork done,

406
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,010
不過下周肯定可以了
but you should be all set for next week.

407
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,190
謝謝你幫我排進去
Thanks for squeezing me in.

408
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,130
還有給我親友折扣
And thanks for the friends and family discount.

409
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,760
等等  我沒說有...
Wait. We didn't say anything about--

410
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,230
再見
Bye!

411
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,250
-怎么了  -我不想說
- What? - I don't want to say anything.

412
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,060
但還是要說
But I will.

413
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,670
不敢相信你要去整容
I can't believe you're getting plastic surgery.

414
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,260
干嘛要亂動自己完美的臉呢
Why do you want to mess with perfection?

415
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,060
就像那些做無麩百吉餅的人一樣
It's like those people who make the gluten-free bagels.

416
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,550
什么
What?

417
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,250
你的臉那么帥  那么年輕
Your face is so handsome and youthful.

418
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,170
那兩條濃眉
Those thick luscious eyebrows.

419
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,770
就像兩只美麗的毛毛蟲
They're like two magnificent caterpillars

420
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,480
在說著"我才不要當蝴蝶"
who said, "To hell with becoming butterflies."

421
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,830
如果我不知道我們一樣大
If I didn't know we were the same age,

422
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,350
我只敢相信你最多32
I'd swear you weren't a day over 32.

423
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,960
知道嗎
You know,

424
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,090
加比今晚請你來
Gabi inviting you here tonight

425
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,430
或許是她犯過最好的錯了
might have been the best mistake she's ever made.

426
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,640
敬錯誤
To mistakes.

427
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,410
尤蘭達
Yolanda...

428
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,330
今晚真的很棒
today was amazing.

429
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,980
就像以前一樣
Just like old times.

430
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,680
比以前更好  是你請客的
Better. You paid.

431
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,500
知道嗎  如果按不到電梯鈕
You know, if I don't push that button,

432
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,400
我可走不掉
I will never leave.

433
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,330
那你按啊
So push it.

434
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,360
等等
Hold it.

435
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,650
科爾曼  我有話跟你說
Coleman, I have something to say to you.

436
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,370
說什么
What's that?

437
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,130
你周五晚上有空嗎
Are you free friday night?

438
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,370
我知道今天不能再糟
I know this day was a disaster,

439
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,890
但每個人過生日都該有蛋糕吃
but everybody deserves a cake on their birthday.

440
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,720
這是分層草莓松餅
It's a tiered strawberry shortcake

441
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,220
配塔希提香草奶油和鮮莓
with Tahitian-vanilla whipped cream and fresh berries.

442
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,440
他會很期待把它扔你臉上的
Ooh, he is gonna love throwing that in your face.

443
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,920
那我還是等下再點蠟燭吧
I'll hold off on lighting the candles.

444
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,340
怎么樣
So?

445
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,180
報復成功了嗎
Did you get your revenge?

446
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,950
殺得他片甲不留
Oh, I made out like a bandit.

447
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,100
艾略特  不像你的人生
Elliot, unlike your life,

448
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,870
你的蛋糕可沒被我搞砸
your cake is one thing I'd never screw up.

449
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,670
-唱  -等等
- Sing-- - Hold on.

450
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,330
我要先說句話
I'd like to say something first.

451
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,100
-這個生日很糟  -是我  我干的
- This birthday has sucked. - That was me. I did that.

452
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,640
但還有一件好事
There's been one bright spot

453
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,390
就是又和埃蘭見面了
and that's been reconnecting with Alan.

454
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,520
是我  我干的
That was me. I did that.

455
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:30,250
這位可愛  風趣  英俊的男人
This sweet, funny, adorable man

456
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,490
讓我知道我不需要整容
made me realize I don't need plastic surgery.

457
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,260
我覺得40歲會是我最好的年華
I think 40 could be my best year yet.

458
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,130
等等  我都42了  你怎么會40
Wait. How can you be 40 if I'm 42?

459
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,730
怎么樣
How's it going?

460
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,640
他說這次是自己拍過最精彩的照片
He says it's going to be one of the best ones yet.

461
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,660
一個還在白紙上記錄自己
The tech guy who still writes out his ideas

462
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,280
創意的程序員
on butcher block paper.

463
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,870
我可不是一般帥  我是復古小開
I'm not just cool. I'm retro cool.

464
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,790
謝謝你  艾略特
Thank you, Elliot.

465
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,400
也謝謝你過去幾天為我做了那么多
Thank you for putting up with me the last few days.

466
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,090
都搞定了
All done here.

467
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,220
我能說我超愛這幅畫嗎
Can I just say I love the painting?

468
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,470
現在我知道該送我丈夫什么生日禮物了
Now I know what to get my husband for his birthday.

469
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,500
我很高興我們終于做了次
I'm so thrilled we're finally doing

470
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,370
成功同志的桌面拍照
a gay desk for success.

471
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,180
至少我爸媽會高興我嫁了個百萬富翁
Well, at least my parents will be happy I married a millionaire.

472
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,320
先生
Sir?

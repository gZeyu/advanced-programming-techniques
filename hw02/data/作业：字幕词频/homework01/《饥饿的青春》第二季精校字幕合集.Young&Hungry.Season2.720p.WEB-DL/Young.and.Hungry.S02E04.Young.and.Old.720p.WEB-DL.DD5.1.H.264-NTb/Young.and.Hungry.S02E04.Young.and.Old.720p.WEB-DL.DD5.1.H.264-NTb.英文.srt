15
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,740
Oh, sorry. I'll make some more coffee right now.

16
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,770
No worries. I'll do it.

17
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,840
'Cause you don't want my grubby peasant hands on it?

18
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,370
No, silly billy.

19
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,800
I can do it myself.

20
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,960
Okay, I'm still in bed dreaming, and I'm gonna be late for work.

21
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,690
Elliot, you're in a pretty good mood,

22
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,680
considering your big 4-0 is tomorrow.

23
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,210
I thought you might be freaking out.

24
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,010
More like getting my freak on.

25
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,680
With Andre.

26
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,440
This is the first time I've ever had a boyfriend on my birthday.

27
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,960
39 years of sorrow,

28
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,320
and I finally get to celebrate my birthday

29
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,210
in my birthday suit.

30
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,470
Oh my god, I love Elliot with a boyfriend.

31
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,150
When he's happy, I'm happy.

32
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,580
Maybe we'll even be friends, which would be great,

33
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,030
because friends don't tell friends

34
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,070
they look like dime store hookers.

35
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,440
Friends say, "Hey, you look cute in that dress."

36
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,310
Hey, cute dress.

37
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,670
Okay, that's it. We've got to keep this love train going.

38
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,510
I'm calling Andre.

39
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,080
Elliot's about to have the most romantic birthday dinner ever.

40
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,000
That's a pretty good idea.

41
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,320
Too bad it's not gonna top my present.

42
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,530
Because I make the most money here,

43
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,200
and I was called a creative genius by a top publication.

44
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,060
Oh, was it Bragging Monthly?

45
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,870
What's that? You want to see what it is? Okay, I'll get it.

46
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,440
Hi, can I speak to Andre of Flowers by Andre?

47
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,920
Hey, Andre, it's Gabi.

48
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,190
Yes, the annoying blonde cook.

49
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,050
Listen, I'm surprising Elliot for his 40th birthday

50
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,170
with a romantic dinner, and obviously I want you to be his date.

51
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,560
Okay, great. Check your schedule, get back to me.

52
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,720
What?

53
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,680
Oh my god.

54
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,630
Elliot and Andre. That's so cute.

55
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,420
I bet this makes you feel pretty lousy about your gift.

56
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,150
Oh my god!

57
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,930
Andre just found out I'm turning 40 instead of 32

58
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,520
and broke up with me.

59
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,830
What?

60
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,540
This is officially the worst birthday ever!

61
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,450
Oh my god!

62
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,970
Don't worry, Elliot.

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,780
- Andre's not the last guy you'll ever date. - Yeah.

64
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,830
I'm sure you'll get dumped by tons of guys.

65
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,650
I've only ever loved three men in my life.

66
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,090
Andre, my college crush Alan,

67
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,570
and Adam Levine.

68
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,470
And I know it sounds crazy,

69
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,730
but Andre's the only one who loved me back.

70
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,280
I know this might not be the best time to bring this up,

71
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,370
but the guys from Wired are coming to photograph my desk tomorrow

72
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,210
for the Desk For Success column.

73
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,010
Are we ready?

74
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,570
- No. - So...

75
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,600
And I mean this in the nicest possible way,

76
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,880
when do you think we'll be ready?

77
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,280
How about when someone loves me again?

78
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,740
So never!

79
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,250
Good morning, beautiful people!

80
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,790
I said what a good morning it is.

81
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,500
Andre broke up with Elliot because he's turning 40.

82
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,780
Out of all the reasons, that's what he picked?

83
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,230
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

84
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,080
You want to hear a story about somebody else's pain?

85
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,850
That always cheers you up.

86
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,430
My ex-husband Coleman,

87
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,190
who dumped me for a younger woman,

88
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,550
just got dumped by a younger woman...

89
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,120
at the altar.

90
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,320
At least he got to the altar.

91
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,020
How did Andre find out my real age anyway?

92
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,970
The only people who knew were you three.

93
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,770
Which one of you told him?

94
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,700
Not me.

95
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,250
I thought you were 50.

96
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,470
I am so sorry. It was me.

97
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,020
Oh my god, it was you!

98
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,010
Listen, Elliot, I'm really sorry.

99
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,510
I was just trying to do something nice for you.

100
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,180
It was gonna be a surprise. We were gonna be friends.

101
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,370
Well, you ruined that, didn't you?

102
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,380
I will never forgive you, Gabi Diamond!

103
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,820
He just needs some time.

104
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,250
Never!

105
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,080
How you doin'?

106
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,320
My life's over.

107
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,140
You don't understand.

108
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,290
40 is 80 in gay years.

109
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,340
Please. I don't understand?

110
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,730
Men my age want women in their 20s.

111
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,810
Which means the only man I can get is 120.

112
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,840
Great. I'm in the same fat, old boat as you.

113
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,690
That's right.

114
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,820
You know what I do when I'm feeling old?

115
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,750
I get my lashes done, I freshen up the weave,

116
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,140
I buy new lipstick--

117
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,970
I'm gay, but not that gay.

118
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,530
Oh, I just got an idea.

119
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,460
You know my ex Coleman

120
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,100
is the top plastic surgeon in the city.

121
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,360
You think I need plastic surgery?

122
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,190
I could pass for 32.

123
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,350
And I could pass for Taylor Swift.

124
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,990
Let's see.

125
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,790
Over here...

126
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,830
I'm beautiful.

127
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,070
Okay.

128
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,780
I'm gonna call Coleman right now.

129
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,680
Yes. Wait, no.

130
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,490
I can't make you deal with that cheater for me.

131
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,810
Oh, that's ridiculous.

132
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,350
I'll take you myself.

133
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,420
- I want you to be happy. - Since when?

134
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,500
Since it's your birthday.

135
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,120
And since Coleman got dumped, you want to rub it in his face?

136
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,220
Isn't that how you teach a dog a lesson?

137
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,060
Okay, I think I've figured out a way...

138
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,330
To help me?

139
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,150
Last month, Wired featured Elon Musk at his hover-desk.

141
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,040
Oh yeah! I saw that. That was really cool!

142
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,430
I'm not helping, am I?

143
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,870
Look, I know this might not seem like a big deal to you,

144
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,830
But everybody in my business reads this column.

145
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,010
Venture capitalists, potential clients, software developers--

146
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,300
So you want to seem cool?

147
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,850
- Yes! - Don't worry, okay?

148
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,790
You're gonna have him back in time for your shoot.

149
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,040
I figured out the perfect

150
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,280
"I'm sorry I ruined your birthday" present.

151
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,530
His parents know he's 40, right?

152
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,360
- Why wouldn't they? - So here's my plan.

153
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,540
Since Elliot rarely gets a chance to see his parents,

154
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,140
I'm inviting them to a five-course Korean dinner.

155
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,400
He'll love that.

156
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,290
- Here, let's call them now. - Okay.

157
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,900
Hi, Mr. Park? It's Gabi Diamond.

158
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,250
I work with Elliot.

159
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,080
Yes, the annoying blonde cook.

160
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,020
Anyway, Elliot's boyfriend broke up with him

161
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,810
and I don't want him to be alone on his big day,

162
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,050
so I was wondering if maybe you could fly in

163
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,720
for a birthday dinner tomorrow night.

164
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,430
Okay, great. Check with Mrs. Park. Call me back.

165
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,840
So, where are you planning on having this dinner?

166
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,110
I thought you'd never ask. Your terrace.

167
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,480
No problem. And I want to pay for the dinner.

168
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,470
Oh, but you're already paying for their flights.

169
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,940
Oh my God!

170
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,710
Someone just outed me to my parents!

171
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,410
Wait.

172
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,110
Your parents didn't know you were gay?

173
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,470
No. They're super traditional.

174
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,380
They don't even like sex with each other.

175
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,290
- How the hell did they find out? - Gabi did it.

176
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,040
I need him. He's the desk whisperer.

177
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,210
You know what, Josh?

178
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,410
I just thought of the perfect birthday gift.

179
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,470
Tell that dime store hooker to get out of my face.

180
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,360
- Okay, can I-- - Gabi, home.

181
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,380
Bye.

182
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,770
And that cute dress? I lied!

183
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,360
You're home early.

184
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,640
What'd you do?

185
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,740
I caused Elliot's boyfriend to break up with him,

186
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,030
and then I outed him to his parents,

187
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,880
and if I keep talking like this, everything sounds great!

188
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,320
Holy crap.

189
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,390
Oh yeah. And did I mention it's his birthday tomorrow?

190
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,740
Wait. So, Josh fired you?

191
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,050
No, Sofia, Josh didn't fire me.

192
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,310
We just have a mutual agreement

193
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,380
that things are better when I'm not around.

194
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,290
How do I fix this?

195
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,800
Okay, well, you destroyed his relationship,

196
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,490
you told his parents he was gay.

197
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,810
When do you find time to cook?

198
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,490
Hey, I know. I'll just find Elliot a new boyfriend.

199
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,950
He said he's only loved three men in his entire life.

200
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,120
Andre, Adam Levine,

201
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,520
and some guy named Alan from college.

202
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,600
That's great. So we find Alan from college.

203
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,230
I was gonna say that!

204
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,030
If you don't let me get there, I'm never gonna learn.

205
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,440
Okay, all right.

206
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,300
- I'm on Elliot's Facebook page. - Okay.

207
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,110
There's only two Alans.

208
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,690
Alan Thicke and Alan Lowenstein.

210
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,500
I know. It's Alan Lowenstein

211
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,790
because he went to Berkeley

212
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,870
and that is also where Elliot went to college.

213
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,060
Yes, that's the only reason we know which Alan.

214
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,280
Well, today is officially your birthday.

215
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,680
Happy birthday. See?

216
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,650
It's my face instead of Andre's.

217
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,020
It represents our friendship--

218
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,660
Boss, publicist.

219
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,060
Always there for each other.

220
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,550
Stop. I've decided not to celebrate my birthday.

221
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,050
I get it, big guy.

222
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,530
You want to focus on the photo shoot with Wired.

223
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,190
Josh, I'm gonna be able to focus better

224
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,670
after my cosmetic surgery consultation.

225
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,080
What?

226
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,230
Elliot, you don't need plastic surgery.

227
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,340
We'll let Dr. James decide that.

228
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,360
Yolanda's ex-husband?

229
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,320
Yes, she got me an appointment.

230
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,780
She's taking me right now.

231
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,530
She wants to see him because she heard he's single.

232
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,510
No, she doesn't like him.

233
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,910
She just wants to rub the breakup in his face.

234
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't think that's what she wants to rub in his face.

235
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,780
- You ready? - Look, I see what's going on here.

236
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,980
You're using Elliot as an excuse to see Coleman.

237
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,180
Oh, please. Look at his saggy face.

238
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,100
He looks like a rescue pug.

239
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,650
That's never gonna get rescued.

240
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,290
Yolanda.

241
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,730
You worked day and night for years

242
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,120
to put Coleman through medical school.

243
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,320
The minute he became a doctor,

244
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,890
he ran off with his assistant.

245
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,140
And now it is payback time.

246
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,730
He is single and vulnerable.

247
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,510
I am gonna turn on the charm,

248
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,350
and get him to take me out,

249
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,740
and right when I got him wrapped around my finger,

250
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,980
I'm gonna dump his sorry ass like he dumped mine.

251
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,060
I can't believe I found you, Alan. Elliot's gonna be so excited.

252
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,470
You think he's gonna be excited.

253
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,970
I've had a crush on him since freshman orientation.

254
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,550
In fact, that's the way I discovered my orientation.

255
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,030
That's funny. You're funny.

256
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,050
Funny? That's what people say when someone's not cute.

257
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,500
Oh god, I'm so nervous I'm schvitzing up a storm.

258
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,100
I don't know what schvitzing is,

259
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,910
but I can't tell you're doing it.

260
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,750
Don't worry. You're gonna be fine.

261
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,970
- How lucky is it that you're single? - Yeah.

262
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,730
I'm like a lotto winner.

263
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,220
I can't believe Elliot's still single.

264
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,920
He's such a catch.

265
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,220
Elliot... Park?

266
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,260
You know, I wish you would've given me a few weeks' notice.

267
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,850
I would've lost five pounds.

268
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,490
Eh, who am I kidding?

269
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,320
Oh, I get it. You want to surprise him.

270
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,110
Surprise him by doing something right.

271
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,480
Wait here.

272
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,540
Gabi.

273
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,700
Elliot cannot come home and find you here.

274
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,250
Oh good. He's gone. Listen, I have another plan.

275
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,480
I think you're using the word "plan" wrong.

276
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,630
This one's a winner. Okay, meet...

277
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,830
Alan Lowenstein, Elliot's long lost college love.

278
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,980
He knows his real age, knows he's gay,

279
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,510
and he's still single.

280
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,090
Why do you keep saying that?

281
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,130
And you're not allergic to any medications?

282
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,340
If I am, I don't care.

283
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,260
Dope me up, peel this off,

284
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,940
and slap a new face on me.

285
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,530
Just thought I'd poke my head in and say a quick hey to Coleman.

286
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,070
Yolanda, you didn't tell me you were coming.

287
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,020
Quick, go check the tires on my Porsche.

288
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,270
No, seriously, go check.

289
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,300
Wow, look at you.

290
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,660
If I didn't know better,

291
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,990
I would think you went to one of my competitors.

292
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,160
- Oh, stop. - Yeah, stop.

293
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,540
Because if you think she looks good, I'm out of here.

294
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,030
Sorry. I just got a little distracted

295
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,020
by those big beautiful...

296
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,560
eyes.

297
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,600
You always did get lost in my... eyes.

298
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,860
We get it. You're talking about her boobies.

299
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,000
It's like taking candy from a baby.

300
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,700
So, Elliot, I think the first thing to do

301
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,780
is a subtle facelift.

302
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,180
The hell with subtle.

303
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,840
I want to get pulled so tight I look like I'm sky-diving.

304
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,810
So, how you been, Yo-yo?

305
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,980
Oh, can't complain, Co-co.

306
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,850
I was so sorry to hear about your breakup.

307
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,730
If Yo-yo and Co-co are done flirting,

308
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,410
El-el wants to look like the Korean Matt Damon.

309
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,980
I wish I didn't have another patient after this.

310
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,040
Why? Do I need that much work?

311
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,510
I'd like to take you to dinner tonight.

312
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,880
- That would be fine. - Excellent.

313
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,250
This is gonna be fun.

314
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,580
Oh, you have no idea.

315
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,710
Hey, here's an idea.

316
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,000
Quit kissing her ass and start lifting mine.

317
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,260
Okay, that was the doorman.

318
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,910
Elliot's on his way up right now.

319
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,660
How do I look?

320
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,490
One button unbuttoned? Or two? Or three?

321
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,330
Who am I? Usher? I'll do one.

322
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,480
You look adorable, Alan Lowenstein.

323
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,150
Now you sit right there, and I'm gonna go meet him in the hall.

324
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,150
Okay.

325
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,720
I did not invite you to my birthday.

326
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,710
But you will invite me to your wedding.

327
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,530
I have a birthday surprise for you.

328
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,650
What'd you do this time, kill my cat?

329
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,790
No. Do you remember your college crush Alan?

330
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,140
- Well, he's here. - What?

331
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,550
Yeah, you heard me, birthday boy.

332
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,310
He's sitting on the other side of that door right now,

333
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,820
and he's so excited to see you.

334
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,200
Seriously?

335
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,540
- Seriously? - Yeah.

336
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,510
How did you find Alan O'Shay?

337
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,940
O'Shay?

338
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,380
Oh, ----.

339
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,560
Gabi, move! I want to see Alan.

340
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,040
No.

341
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,660
You don't want to seem too eager.

342
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,510
But that's my signature move.

343
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,490
What if your new signature move

344
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,240
is being fashionably late?

345
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,980
Ooh, what about that? Okay, bye. Wait here!

346
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,860
Is he here?

347
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,200
Uh, not quite yet.

348
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,160
Bad news, Alan. Elliot's sick.

349
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,820
And I would hate for you to get it.

350
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,030
Well, I don't want it. I am very susceptible.

351
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,790
Yeah, uh-huh. That's what I thought.

352
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,290
Let's go this way. Go that way, go that way.

353
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,970
Elliot Park?

354
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,100
Alan Lowenstein?

355
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,670
- Surprise. - Yes.

356
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,260
What a surprise.

357
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,820
All right. What's happening here?

358
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,730
It feels like when I was the only boy in Hebrew school

359
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,040
not invited to Jenny Schneider's bat mitzvah.

360
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,520
Whatever. Bitch got fat.

361
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,470
Listen, Alan, I made a horrible mistake.

362
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,520
You're the wrong Alan.

363
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,310
She thought you were Alan O'Shay.

364
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,980
Alan O'Shay?

365
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,640
Oh, I wish.

366
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Hey, looks like you both love the same Alan.

367
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,060
Why don't you talk about him

368
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,330
over the magnificent dinner that I made you?

369
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,400
So, I'm not even supposed to be here.

370
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,510
This is so embarrassing.

371
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,710
- I should go. - No, don't.

372
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,080
She's the one who screwed this up. She should go.

373
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,500
You stay.

374
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,060
Otherwise I'm just gonna shame-eat all this in the bathtub later.

375
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,170
Elliot Park in the bathtub?

376
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,970
Oy, I need a popsicle.

377
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,810
Oh, such a gentleman.

378
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,700
You didn't have to walk me all the way back to Josh's.

379
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,050
But I'm glad you did.

380
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,200
I wanted to tell Elliot I could squeeze him in

381
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,070
for surgery appointment next week.

382
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,580
That's the only reason?

383
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,100
No.

384
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,710
I never knew what I had when I had it.

385
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,740
Now that I do, I miss it.

386
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,640
You're talking about me, right?

387
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,950
Damn right.

388
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,220
So?

389
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,900
How are Alan and Elliot doing?

390
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,980
Let's just say I'm opening another bottle of wine.

391
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,340
So it's going well.

392
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,460
I have no idea. This is for me.

393
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,960
There's the happy couple.

394
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,570
Almost too happy.

395
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,050
Look, there's Elliot.

396
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,410
Why don't you go tell him the good news about your schedule.

397
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,020
You see his face, Josh?

398
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,570
You mean that same stupid grin I see on yours?

399
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,530
Oh, I got this. It's all part of an act, baby.

400
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,000
Next up, he's gonna walk me to the elevator.

401
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,440
I'm gonna give him the kiss of a lifetime.

402
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,280
Then I'm gonna say, "Hold up, Coleman.

403
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,420
I have something to say to you.

404
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:56,020
Payback's a bitch named Yolanda!"

405
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,770
You'll just need to get your bloodwork done,

406
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,010
but you should be all set for next week.

407
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,190
Thanks for squeezing me in.

408
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,130
And thanks for the friends and family discount.

409
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,760
Wait. We didn't say anything about--

410
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,230
Bye!

411
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,250
- What? - I don't want to say anything.

412
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,060
But I will.

413
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,670
I can't believe you're getting plastic surgery.

414
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,260
Why do you want to mess with perfection?

415
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,060
It's like those people who make the gluten-free bagels.

416
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,550
What?

417
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,250
Your face is so handsome and youthful.

418
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,170
Those thick luscious eyebrows.

419
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,770
They're like two magnificent caterpillars

420
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,480
who said, "To hell with becoming butterflies."

421
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,830
If I didn't know we were the same age,

422
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,350
I'd swear you weren't a day over 32.

423
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,960
You know,

424
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,090
Gabi inviting you here tonight

425
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,430
might have been the best mistake she's ever made.

426
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,640
To mistakes.

427
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,410
Yolanda...

428
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,330
today was amazing.

429
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,980
Just like old times.

430
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,680
Better. You paid.

431
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,500
You know, if I don't push that button,

432
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,400
I will never leave.

433
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,330
So push it.

434
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,360
Hold it.

435
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,650
Coleman, I have something to say to you.

436
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,370
What's that?

437
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,130
Are you free friday night?

438
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,370
I know this day was a disaster,

439
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,890
but everybody deserves a cake on their birthday.

440
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,720
It's a tiered strawberry shortcake

441
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,220
with Tahitian-vanilla whipped cream and fresh berries.

442
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,440
Ooh, he is gonna love throwing that in your face.

443
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,920
I'll hold off on lighting the candles.

444
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,340
So?

445
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,180
Did you get your revenge?

446
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,950
Oh, I made out like a bandit.

447
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,100
Elliot, unlike your life,

448
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,870
your cake is one thing I'd never screw up.

449
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,670
- Sing-- - Hold on.

450
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,330
I'd like to say something first.

451
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,100
- This birthday has sucked. - That was me. I did that.

452
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,640
There's been one bright spot

453
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,390
and that's been reconnecting with Alan.

454
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,520
That was me. I did that.

455
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:30,250
This sweet, funny, adorable man

456
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,490
made me realize I don't need plastic surgery.

457
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,260
I think 40 could be my best year yet.

458
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,130
Wait. How can you be 40 if I'm 42?

459
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,730
How's it going?

460
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,640
He says it's going to be one of the best ones yet.

461
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,660
The tech guy who still writes out his ideas

462
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,280
on butcher block paper.

463
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,870
I'm not just cool. I'm retro cool.

464
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,790
Thank you, Elliot.

465
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,400
Thank you for putting up with me the last few days.

466
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,090
All done here.

467
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,220
Can I just say I love the painting?

468
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,470
Now I know what to get my husband for his birthday.

469
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,500
I'm so thrilled we're finally doing

470
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,370
a gay desk for success.

471
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,180
Well, at least my parents will be happy I married a millionaire.

472
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,320
Sir?

15
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,860
-明天要见面了我好激动  -我也是
- I am so excited to see you tomorrow. - Me too.

16
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,490
我们终于要完善我们的关系了
We're finally going to consummate our relationship!

17
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,560
还要第一次滚床单
And we're gonna have sex for the first time.

18
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,130
说到这里  我拿到性病检测结果咯
Speaking of which, I got my STD test.

19
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,560
你是说"可以做爱"的结果吗
You mean your "Safe To Do It" test?

20
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,740
是啊  我像口哨一样干净
Yup, clean as a whistle,

21
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,640
虽然口哨一点也不干净
though whistles aren't actually very clean at all.

22
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,270
嘴就是有害细菌的港湾
The mouth is a haven for harmful bacteria.

23
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,750
好吧  留在卧室里说吧
All right. Save that for the bedroom.

24
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,530
我下班后去检查  但是别担心
Well, I'm getting my test after work, but don't worry.

25
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,110
自从我上次检测过后  我只跟一个人做过
I've only been with one person since the last time I was tested.

26
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,890
我随便问一下  那人是谁啊
Yeah, and just casually asking, who was that one other guy?

27
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,910
那不重要
Uh... it's not important.

28
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,220
重要的是下次我们在一起时
What is important is the next time we're together,

29
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,480
我们会水乳交融
we're gonna be together.

30
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,470
明天见
I'll see you tomorrow.

31
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,940
虽然对我来说  算上时差
Though for me, with the time change,

32
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,570
所以其实是昨天  我们已经做完爱了
it'll actually be yesterday, in which case, we already had sex.

33
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,470
-怎么样  -超棒
- How were we? -Amazing!

34
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,140
谢谢你  在线技术支持人员
Thank you, online tech support person man.

35
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,460
-好啊  乔什  -加比
- Hello, Josh. - Gabi.

36
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,210
如果你电脑有问题  可以来找我
If you have a computer problem, you can come to me.

37
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,610
就是上一个跟你做爱的人
You know... the last guy you had sex with.

38
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,060
你在偷听我的私人谈话吗
Were you listening to my private conversation?

39
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,480
你是说在我的厨房里  用我的电脑  我的网络
Your private conversation that you were having in my kitchen

40
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,510
-进行的私人谈话吗  -天啊  这很有道理
- with my Internet on my laptop? - My god, that's a good point.

41
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,670
等等  你和库珀在中国待了三周
So wait, you were with Cooper in China for three weeks,

42
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,170
同床共枕  但什么都没干吗
sharing a bed, and nothing?

43
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,580
-我认识你不到三小时就...  -我知道
- I knew you for less than three hours and we-- - I know!

44
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,540
所以我要小心点
That's why I was being careful.

45
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,000
上次跟我做爱的人
I mean, the last person I had sex with,

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,170
最后搞得一团糟
it kind of ended up a big mess.

47
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,920
我听到的是
So, what I'm hearing

48
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,390
没人能达到
is that no man could possibly measure up

49
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,870
那个帅哥的标准
to that big... handsome mess.

50
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,870
不  你听到的是我礼貌地询问
No, what you're hearing is me politely asking

51
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,830
我能不能早点下班去诊所
if I can leave work early and go to the clinic.

52
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,690
好让你进行"可以做爱
So you can get your "Safe to do it"

53
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,760
-因为你还没做过"的检查吗  -就是这个
- cause you haven't "Done it yet" test? - Yes, that's the one.

54
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,340
你可以去  但是
Yes, you can go, but look,

55
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,590
你没什么好担心的  我很安全
you have nothing to worry about. I'm safe.

56
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,790
是啊  但你知道俗话说得好
Yeah, you are, but you know how they say

57
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,650
跟一个人上过床
when you have sex with someone,

58
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,530
就等于跟他睡过的所有人上床了
you have sex with everybody they've had sex with?

59
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,960
加比  我跟你上床时唯一
Gabi, the only other person I was sleeping with

60
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,320
另外的床伴就是卡洛琳
when I slept with you was Caroline.

61
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,020
新计划
New plan.

62
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,050
我们都做检查  我打电话给医生
We're both getting tested. I'll call my doctor.

63
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,060
你医生的办公室好棒啊
Your doctor's office is really nice.

64
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,070
在我去的那家诊所
At the clinic that I go to,

65
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,480
如果你进去时没病
if you didn't have something walking in,

66
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,050
那出来时就肯定有病了
you're gonna have something walking out.

67
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,330
你付钱  对吧
You're paying, right?

68
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,840
如果是好消息的话
Only if it's good news!

69
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,860
对不起  我只是很紧张
I'm sorry. I'm just really nervous.

70
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,820
这是我和库珀的第一次
This is mine and Cooper's first time.

71
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,070
天啊  如果我有病怎么办
Oh god! What if I have something?

72
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,560
整个晚上都毁了
That could kill the whole night!

73
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,340
-加比  你没事的  -你又不知道
- Gabi, you're fine. - You don't know that!

74
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,090
我们等了好长时间
I mean, we waited such a long time,

75
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,610
他为酒店房间付了好多钱
and he paid so much for the hotel room.

76
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,200
不是他告诉我的
I mean, not that he told me how much,

77
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,800
而是我上网查的
but I definitely looked it up online.

78
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,640
他想让这一切对我来说很特别
And he's trying to make it so special for me,

79
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,570
我已经买了毕业礼服呢
and I already bought the cap and gown.

80
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,480
毕业礼服吗
Cap and gown?

81
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,030
天啊  你觉得太过了吗
Oh. God, do you think it's too much?

82
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,240
我觉得这会很性感
I thought it'd be really hot

83
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,370
如果我穿着性感的毕业礼服
if I rolled up my test results like a diploma...

84
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,300
像卷毕业证一样卷起我的检测结果
...dress up in a sexy cap and gown,

85
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,450
懂吗  因为我们毕业了
Get it? 'cause we're graduating

86
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,080
进入了我们关系的下一级
to the next level of our relationship--

87
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,040
-性爱级  -我懂
- the sex level. - I get it.

88
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,340
我在想办法忘记
I'm trying to un-get it.

89
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,610
对不起  我话太多了吗
I'm sorry, am I saying too much?

90
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,930
我不知道你是否知道  但我紧张的时候
I don't know if you know this, but when I'm nervous,

91
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,650
-话很多  -是啊  只在你紧张的时候
- I really seem to talk a lot. - Yeah. Only when you're nervous.

92
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,610
好了  我看了你的全血球计数化学-7试验盘
All right, I've looked over your C.B.C. Chem-7 test panel,

93
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,480
还看了性传播感染血清学检查结果
and checked out your S.T.I. serologic test--

94
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,050
天啊  我要死了
Oh my god! I'm dying!

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,340
-冷静点  你们都没事  -真好
- Calm down, you're both fine. - Oh good.

96
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,360
我要说一句  你俩一起来
And may I just say, it was really responsible

97
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,770
做测试真是太负责了
for the two of you to come in to be tested together.

98
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,510
我真的希望更多情侣跟你们一样
I really wish more couples were like you.

99
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,820
耶  现在我可以和我男朋友做爱了
Yay! Now I get to go have sex with my boyfriend.

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,210
谢谢你  老板
Thanks, boss.

101
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,230
别问
Don't ask.

102
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,370
尤兰达
Oh, Yolanda.

103
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,330
尤兰达
Yolanda?

104
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,780
搞什么啊
What the hell?

105
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,100
我是来拔牙的
I come get my tooth pulled,

106
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,750
醒来后就在走廊上
and I wake up in the hallway

107
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,390
和我的前夫亲热吗  难以置信
making out with my ex-husband? Unbelievable.

108
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,850
是啊
Yes, it is.

109
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,540
加比  你认识科尔曼
Gabi, you know Coleman.

110
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,030
他出轨了  伤了尤兰达的心
He's the guy that broke Yolanda's heart by cheating on her.

111
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,660
一般情况下我会对这事很感兴趣  但是
You know, normally, I'd be eating this up, but...

112
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,300
库珀和我今晚要第一次做爱了
Cooper and I are having sex for the first time tonight,

113
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,700
所以拜拜了
so bye!

114
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,940
拜托  乔什  我们不能重新开始吗
Come on, Josh. Can't we just start over?

115
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,990
如果你是说你和尤兰达  不行
If you mean you and Yolanda, no.

116
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,520
但如果你是说你和我  那也不行
But if you mean you and me, no.

117
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,290
那你有别的原因留在这里吗
Well, then do you have another reason to be here?

118
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,510
没有  拜拜  乔什
No. Bye-bye, Josh.

119
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,440
我们回头谈
We'll talk about this later.

120
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,030
那有点不舒服
That was a little uncomfortable.

121
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,700
-还用说  -是啊
- You're telling me. - Yeah.

122
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,600
我们到哪了
Now where were we?

123
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,450
索菲亚  这是家五星旅馆
Sofia, this is a five-star hotel.

124
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,420
简直全是星啊
That's, like, all of the stars!

125
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,040
别在那傻站着
Well, don't just stand there.

126
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,630
帮我洗劫小冰箱
Help me raid the mini-bar.

127
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,490
我已经帮你拿了洗发水和护发素
I already got the shampoo and condish for ya.

128
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,260
要开始性感起来噜
Things are about to get sexy.

129
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,520
没错
Yes.

130
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,690
-五星级的性感  -是
- A five-star sexy! - Yeah.

131
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,840
这张床真性感
This bed is so sexy.

132
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,420
枕头上放着巧克力
Chocolates on the pillow!

133
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,420
太性感了
Super sexy.

134
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,010
喂
Hello?

135
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,570
是我  从浴室给你打电话呢
It's me, calling you from the bathroom!

136
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,360
我来啦
I'm here!

137
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,520
-你也来了  -天啊
- And you are here. - Oh my god!

138
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,340
这面镜子好棒
There's the coolest mirror in here!

139
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,970
索菲亚也来了
And Sofia's here!

140
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,340
你好  库珀  你俩好好享受吧
Hey, Cooper! Have fun, you two.

141
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,000
我要回去洗头喝小酒了
I'm gonna wash my hair and make tiny drinks.

142
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,730
-等等  让我弄点情调  -好
- Wait, wait, let me set the mood. - Okay.

143
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,470
你记得你喜欢的浪漫电影里
You know how in those romantic movies you like,

144
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,750
-床上总是撒玫瑰花瓣吧  -是的
- there's always rose petals on the bed? - Yeah.

145
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,460
它们该散开落下来的
They were supposed to cascade and flutter,

146
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,410
但我手上太潮了  因为我真的很紧张
but my hands are sweaty, 'cause I'm really nervous.

147
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,340
也许这能让你放松点
Well, maybe this will calm you down.

148
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,120
不不不
No, no, no.

149
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,730
我没撒开花瓣真的那么糟吗
Did I really blow it with the rose-petal clump that bad?

150
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,860
不  我有个惊喜给你  坐下  闭上眼
No, I have a surprise for you. Sit down, close your eyes.

151
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,300
-我不想你偷看  -别担心
- I don't want you to see. - Don't worry.

152
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,950
我眼镜上已经起雾了
My glasses are already fogged up.

153
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,350
好  要开始了
Okay, this is happening.

154
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,360
真的要开始了
This is really happening.

155
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,450
淡定  库珀
Calm down, Cooper.

156
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,430
你也是  小库珀
You too, mini-Cooper.

157
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,390
好了  睁眼吧
Okay, open your eyes.

158
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,280
这比我麻省理工的毕业典礼赞多了
This is so much better than my graduation from M.I.T.

159
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,010
因为没我这么美的姑娘吗
'Cause the girls weren't as pretty?

160
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,670
还有我妈也不在这
And my mother isn't here.

161
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,390
确诊我没有病哦
Proof positive that I am negative.

162
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,980
-你真棒  -而且绝对安全
- You are amazing. - And safe to do it.

163
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,820
-这上面怎么写的"乔什·卡明斯基"  -什么
- Why does this say, "Josh Kaminski"? - What?

164
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,390
他们就是拼不对我的名字
They can never spell my name right!

165
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,740
加比  我是程序员  不擅长跟人打交道
Gabi, I work with computers, so I'm not too good with people,

166
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,060
但我确信你给我
But I'm pretty sure you handing me

167
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,650
乔什的性病检测是有史以来最糟的前戏了
Josh's S.T.D. test results is the worst foreplay ever.

168
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,780
好吧  记得我说过不让你干的那件事吗
Okay, remember that one thing I said I'd never let you do?

169
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,390
你可以干
I'll let you.

170
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,780
加比  怎么回事
Gabi, what's going on?

171
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,220
听着  别慌
Okay, listen, don't freak out,

172
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,970
因为这什么都代表不了
because it meant absolutely nothing.

173
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,730
-天啊  你在跟乔什上床  -上过床
- Oh god, you're sleeping with Josh! - No, slept with.

174
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,260
那都是老早以前的事了
It's like when I got my hair cornrowed?

175
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,960
只发生过一次  我很后悔
It was one time, in the past, and I totally regretted it!

176
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,650
他就是跟你上床的那一个人吗
He's the one guy you had sex with?

177
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,130
那是我做试用晚餐应聘乔什大厨的晚上
It was the night of my trial dinner to be Josh's new chef.

178
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,520
-你是这么应聘上的吗  -不
- That's how you got the job? - No!

179
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,270
我是得到工作以后才跟他上床的
I slept with him after I got the job.

180
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,320
他和卡洛琳刚分手  伤心欲绝
Him and Caroline had just broken up, he was devastated,

181
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,980
我喝醉了...
I was drunk...

182
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,300
是啊  我现在两件事都要干
Yeah, well, I'm about to be both of those things.

183
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,310
好吧  你生气了
Okay. You're mad.

184
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,620
你能化悲愤为激情把我扔床上吗
Can you channel that passion and throw me onto the bed?

185
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,250
我走了
I'm outta here.

186
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,600
库珀  你不能走
Cooper, you can't just leave.

187
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,040
你说得对
You're right.

188
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,610
我坐了十三小时飞机
I spent 13 hours on a plane,

189
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,030
花八百块订下这间漂亮的旅馆套房
paid $800 for this beautiful hotel suite,

190
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,370
还做了男士脱毛
tried a little something called manscaping...

191
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,770
就为了和你共度这奇妙之夜
all so we could have this magical night together.

192
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,650
所以你猜怎么着  我不走
So you know what? I am gonna stay.

193
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,010
谢天谢地
Oh, thank god.

194
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,170
你走
You're leaving.

195
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,920
我羞愧地离开吗
Leaving? In shame?

196
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,020
这简直是我高中毕业重演
This is like my high school graduation all over again,

197
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,960
除了上次  我的确上了床
except that time, I did have sex,

198
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,510
还没拿到毕业证
and I did not get a diploma.

199
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,960
签在这里
Sign there...

200
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,450
这里
and there.

201
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,590
首字母签那里
Initial there.

202
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,990
你就正式成为同志啦
And you are officially gay!

203
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,580
没反应吗  这招一般很成功的
Nothing? That gay stuff usually kills.

204
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,450
抱歉  艾略特  我就是忍不住想
I'm sorry, Elliot, I just can't stop thinking

205
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,290
尤兰达和科尔曼亲热那事
about Yolanda making out with Coleman.

206
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,310
我懂  就像是他掉进了动物园的河马池
I know. It's like he fell into the hippo pit at the zoo,

207
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,910
好不容易爬了出来
managed to escape,

208
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,740
然后又转头跳了进去
and then jumped right back in again!

209
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,750
我知道天很晚  我也下班了
Look, I know it's late and my day off,

210
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,450
所以如果你给我加班工资  我没意见
so if you wanna pay me overtime, go right ahead.

211
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,390
但这不是我来的原因
But that's not why I'm here.

212
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,170
我想聊聊大家心知肚明的那事
I want to talk about the elephant in the room.

213
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,170
{\an8}房间里的大象

214
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,360
闭嘴  艾略特
Shut up, Elliot!

215
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,400
尤兰达  我知道我只是你老板
Look, Yolanda, I know I'm just your boss,

216
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,290
但每次他劈腿  惹你伤心的时候
but I'm also the boss whose couch you cried on

217
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,750
看到你哭的也是我
every time he cheated on you.

218
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,460
我知道  我想告诉你我和他结束了
I hear you, and I want you to know I ended it with him,

219
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,950
所以我这周末要去纳帕
which is why I'm going to Napa this weekend

220
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,840
和我的朋友们一起
with my girlfriends to drown myself

221
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,630
喝黑皮诺喝到天昏地暗
in a big barrel of pinot noir.

222
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,870
好忘了科尔曼的黑大X
You know, to forget Coleman's pinot noir.

223
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,550
很好  很好
Good. Good.

224
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,160
我觉得这样最好
I really think this is for the best.

225
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,490
不过  你去医生办公室干什么
By the way, what were you doing at the doctor's offce, anyway?

226
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,430
是担心到要跟踪我吗
Were you so worried you were following me?

227
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,590
不是
Uh, no.

228
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,190
加比和我去做性病检测的
Gabi and I were actually getting S.T.D. tests.

229
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,180
拜托  承认吧
Come on, you can admit it.

230
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,110
不  我说真的  看
No, I'm being serious. Look.

231
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,960
加比的维生素D含量好低哦
Gabi's Vitamin D is really low.

232
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,070
-什么  -这是加比的检测结果
- What? - These are Gabi's results.

233
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,710
什么叫"加比的检测结果"
What do you mean, "Gabi's results"?

234
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,890
天啊  我得马上打电话给她
Oh my god, I gotta call her right now.

235
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,080
冷静  亲爱的
Calm down, baby.

236
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,470
那小白妞真要好好晒晒太阳
That little pale girl just needs to get some sun.

237
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,920
这是加比的检测结果  就说明我的结果在她那
These are Gabi's results, which means she has my results,

238
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,580
她要穿上情趣的毕业礼服
and she's gonna dress up all sexy in a cap and gown

239
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,330
把它当成证书交给库珀
and hand 'em to Cooper like a diploma.

240
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,970
人们还觉得同志爱爱奇怪
And people think gay sex is weird.

241
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,680
库珀
Hey, Cooper.

242
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,750
送你们小鸳鸯一瓶香槟哦
A bottle of bubbly for the lovebirds.

243
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,820
加比不在
Gabi's not here...

244
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,190
我看到你检测结果了
and I saw your test results.

245
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,830
怎么样  很棒对吧
How about 'em, huh? Weren't they great?

246
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,190
所以我才给员工人手一份
That's why I gave a copy to my employees.

247
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,260
行了
Stop.

248
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,560
加比什么都说了
Gabi told me everything,

249
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,910
我知道你们上过床
I know you guys had sex together,

250
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,060
很显然你对她有感觉
and obviously you have feelings for her.

251
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,720
-什么  才没有  -这样就说得通了
- What? No, that's so-- - It all makes sense--

252
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,950
为什么我替你工作的时候你不想我们约会
why you didn't want us to date when I was working for you,

253
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,690
为什么你要揍我
why you punched me in the face.

254
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,050
这跟加比没关系  我们是喝多了
That had nothing to do with Gabi. We were drunk.

255
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,160
这里真的人人都拿喝酒当借口
Alcohol really seems to be the excuse for everyone around here.

256
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,530
知道吗  你们真是有病
You know what? You people really have a problem!

257
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,730
库珀  就算我喜欢过她
Cooper, look, even if I were into her,

258
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,820
事实是  她喜欢的是你
the reality is, she's into you.

259
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,920
她总是说起你
She's always talking about you,

260
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,670
和你视频聊天也满面春风
her face lights up during your video chats,

261
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,260
还很激动自己要穿上毕业礼服
and she was so excited to dress up in the cap and gown.

262
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,980
这她也跟你说了吗
She told you about that?

263
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,310
她一紧张话就很多
She talks a lot when she's nervous.

264
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,710
男人之间  你坦白说
Just tell me, man to man...

265
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,300
你喜欢她吗
do you have feelings for her?

266
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,230
如果喜欢  我现在会在这
If I did, would I be here right now,

267
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,100
劝你们两个和好吗
trying to get you two to work things out?

268
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,250
别这样  你喜欢她
Come on, man! You like her,

269
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,450
她喜欢你  去追她吧
she likes you. Go get her.

270
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,270
别教我怎么做
Don't tell me what to do!

271
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,960
我会去追她的  但不是因为你说了
I will go get her. Not because you told me to.

272
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,800
尤兰达
Yolanda?

273
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,060
-乔什  -你不是该在纳帕吗
- Josh! - Aren't you supposed to be at Napa?

274
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,920
不  我说我要睡个小觉
No! I said I was gonna take a napa.

275
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,200
宝贝  怎么走了那么久
Baby, what's taking so long?

276
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,500
那是塔米  她重感冒了
That's Tammy. She's got a nasty cold.

277
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,180
嗓子哑得很
Ooh, throat just raw.

278
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,430
快呀  尤兰达
Come on, Yolanda.

279
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,990
来啊
Bring it.

280
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,980
亲爱的  你还是闭嘴吧
Sweetie, you should stop talking.

281
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,630
开口只能弄得更糟
You're only making it worse.

282
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,240
不  你才弄得更糟
No, you're making it worse.

283
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,230
好吧  塔米就是科尔曼
All right, fine! Tammy's Coleman.

284
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,980
-不是吧  -乔什
- No! - Look, Josh,

285
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,190
我知道你在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

286
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,640
我该马上了断  跟你走的
I should just end it and leave with you right now.

287
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,110
-没错  我们走  -我不能丢下他
- Exactly. Let's go. - I can't just leave him.

288
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,860
为什么  因为你一点自制力都没吗
Why? Because you have no willpower?

289
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,640
-因为你又爱上他了吗  -不
- Because you're falling for him again? - No!

290
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,000
因为我还把他铐在床头呢
Because he's handcuffed to the headboard.

291
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,770
天啊
Oh my god.

292
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,570
我的胸好大
My boobs are huge!

293
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,030
索菲亚  我为什么不早对库珀坦白乔什的事
God, Sofia, why didn't I tell Cooper about Josh earlier?

294
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,160
因为男生不想听我们过去的情史
Because guys don't want to hear about past hookups.

295
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,320
-他们受不了  -为什么
- They can't handle it. - Why?

296
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,000
我是说  为什么情侣不能像闺蜜一样
I mean, why can't couples be like best friends

297
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,400
无话不谈
and tell each other everything...

298
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,900
就像我们
like us?

299
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,050
-没错  -对  我们就不用担心
- Totally. - Yeah, and we would never have to worry about

300
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,310
骗对方或者有事情瞒着对方
lying or keeping secrets from each other.

301
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,800
绝对的
Total.

302
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,880
天啊  索菲亚  有闺蜜的感觉真好
Oh god, Sofia, it so great having a best friend,

303
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,400
因为无论多难听的事情
'cause no matter if something's hard to hear,

304
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,490
我们都会直说  因为我们相信对方
we just still say it, because we trust each other.

305
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,480
必须的
Totally.

306
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,450
不过  我不是有所指啦
Although-- and I'm not thinking of anything in particular here,

307
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,290
但我们或许也没什么事...
but we might not tell each other...

308
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,950
-都告诉对方  -怎么会
- Everything. - Oh please!

309
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,850
还记得你剪的那个哈莉·贝瑞发型吗
Do you remember your Halle Berry haircut?

310
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,640
是谁跟你说看着活像约翰·雷吉扎莫的
Who told you that it made you look like John Leguizamo?

311
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,570
-你说的  -我为什么要说呢
- You did. - And why would I do that?

312
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,080
因为你爱我  为我好
Because you love me and want the best for me.

313
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,620
没错  换你对我也是一样
That's right, and you would do the same for me.

314
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,910
不论如何  我们都会无话不说
We tell each other everything, no matter what.

315
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,870
这就叫"信任"
It's called "trust."

316
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:50,470
实际上我或许有件事故意瞒了你
There's actually one thing I might have neglected to tell you,

317
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,670
但说之前我们得喝瓶大的
but we're gonna need the big bottle for that one.

318
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,500
好
Okay.

319
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,550
我等了很久想告诉你这事
I've waited a really long time to tell you this,

320
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,910
天啊  憋死我了
and, god, it's been killing me,

321
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,380
但我发誓我不说的唯一原因
but I swear the only reason I didn't tell you

322
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,010
是因为你和库珀看起来很幸福
was because you seemed so happy with Cooper and...

323
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,650
好吧
okay.

324
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,080
在乔什取消婚礼的那晚
The night that Josh broke off his wedding,

325
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,110
他爬上了逃生梯
he climbed up the fire escape

326
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,490
想告诉你自己喜欢你
to tell you he had feelings for you,

327
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,440
但他看见你和库珀在接吻
but then he saw you kissing Cooper,

328
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,510
他伤心欲绝  然后离开了
and he was devastated, so he left.

329
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,420
当我发现的时候  他要我保守秘密
And then when I found out, he swore me to secrecy.

330
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,040
天啊  我早该告诉你的
Oh god, I should've told you.

331
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,050
真对不起
I'm so sorry.

332
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,280
你能原谅我吗
Do you forgive me?

333
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,770
天啊  我的话你根本没听见
Oh my god, you didn't hear a word I said.

334
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,120
对  但我听见了
No, but I did.

335
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,040
我猜猜  加比又把钥匙忘门上了
Well, let me guess. Gabi left her keys in the door again!

336
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,280
库珀  抱歉你是这样知道
Cooper, I'm sorry you had to find out

337
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,000
乔什和加比这事的
about Josh and Gabi this way.

338
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,320
不过是时候让大家知道了
But, you know, it's time everybody knew.

339
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,150
-很显然  大家都知道了  -不  除了加比
- Apparently, everyone did know. - No, not Gabi,

340
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,360
但她醒了以后也会知道
but she's gonna find out as soon as she wakes up,

341
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,630
-因为我不能再瞒着她了  -你说得对
- because I cannot keep this from her anymore. - You're right.

342
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,100
她要知道
She needs to know.

343
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,310
只是  让我告诉她吧
Just... let me be the one to tell her.

344
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,340
-为什么  -我要看见她知道后的表情
- Why? - I need to see her face when she finds out.

345
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,530
只有这样我才能清楚她喜不喜欢乔什
It's the only way I'll know if she has feelings for Josh.

346
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,350
好吧  但是我瞒了她那么久
Okay, but I'm the one that's been keeping this from her,

347
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,570
该做告诉她的那个
so I should be the one to tell her.

348
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,150
你可以住我的旅馆房间
You can stay in my hotel room.

349
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,700
我不觉得...  真的吗
I don't think that-- really?

350
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,310
好吧  但你要告诉她我跟她说了
Okay, but she needs to know that I tried to tell her the truth.

351
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,180
你保证
Promise me you'll tell her.

352
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,760
我保证
I will.

353
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,400
-还有  库珀...  -你可以叫客房服务
- Oh, and, Cooper... - Yes, you can order room service.

354
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,290
-还有...  -还有看一部电影
- And...? - And a movie.

355
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,620
尤兰达赌咒发誓自己不会再见科尔曼了
Yolanda promised up and down she's never gonna see Coleman again,

356
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,860
-我们还来这干什么  -因为尤兰达太软弱
- so why are we at his office? - Because Yolanda is weak.

357
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,190
科尔曼只要打她电话  她就后悔了
All Coleman has to do is call her, and she caves.

358
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,480
所以我们要和科尔曼对质
So we're gonna confront Coleman,

359
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,970
确保他不会再联系她
make sure he never contacts her again.

360
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,830
所以你才要带我来哈
Oh, so that's why you brought me.

361
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,530
我是唱黑脸的  我是动手的
I'm the bad cop! I'm the muscle!

362
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,230
我是用拳头的
I'm the heavy!

363
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,160
我的船鞋上掉了一根穗呢
I'm missing a tassel on my loafer.

364
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,020
科尔曼
Coleman.

365
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,020
-我们得像个男人样聊聊  -像男人
- Look, we need to talk man to man. - To man!

366
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,760
-好吧  -我爱尤兰达
- O-- okay. - I love Yolanda.

367
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,940
我是她同事
And I... work with her.

368
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,040
我们都很关心她
And we both care about her.

369
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,120
好吧  所以有什么问题
Okay, so... what's the problem?

370
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,460
问题是  我们很担心
The problem is, we are worried.

371
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,060
你根本毫无情感
You are emotionally closed off

372
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,560
还拈花惹草
and prone to infidelity.

373
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,520
好了  你悠着点
All right, let's put the tiger back in the cage.

374
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,300
科尔曼...
Coleman, look...

375
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,910
尤兰达看不出来  但她又爱上你了
Yolanda can't see it, but she's falling for you again,

376
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,260
这样很危险
and that's dangerous.

377
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,970
如果你关心她  就别招惹她
So, if you care about her, you gotta leave her alone,

378
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,170
因为只要涉及到你  她就没有自制力
because when it comes to you, she has no self-control.

379
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,160
我当然有
The hell I don't!

380
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,170
只要我想  随时都能跟科尔曼分手
I can end it with Coleman any time I want!

381
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,260
等等  尤兰达
Wait, hold up. Yolanda...

382
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,230
你是又爱上我了吗
are you falling in love with me?

383
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,450
科尔曼
Well, Coleman...

384
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,550
我没想到会这样
I did not see this coming.

385
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,080
这改变了一切
This changes everything.

386
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,610
尤兰达  对不起
Yolanda, I'm sorry.

387
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,510
因为我也又爱上你了
Because I am falling for you again, too.

388
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,880
是吗
You are?

389
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,470
当然
Damn right I am.

390
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,010
我很庆幸自己能有机会补偿你
I'm lucky I get a second chance to make things right.

391
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,690
也正准备这么做
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

392
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,550
因为你插手
Because you butted in,

393
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,900
他们反而感情更好了
they're actually closer than they were before.

394
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,900
谢谢  艾略特
Thank you, Elliot.

395
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,150
我是说  如果你不来这里
I mean, if it wasn't for you coming down here,

396
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:53,410
他们或许还成不了一对  但你一来
they might not be a couple, but because you did,

397
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:58,470
-他们成了  -我懂了  艾略特
- they are. - I get it, Elliot.

398
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,590
现在给我出去  好让我来
Now get out, so I can get it.

399
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,060
他们马上要打的那炮
The sex that's about to happen

400
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,160
正是因为你
is because of you.

401
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,720
索菲亚  你的皮肤好嫩哦
Sofia, you have the soft skin of a little girl.

402
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,200
我是库珀  我偶尔保湿的
It's Cooper, and I occasionally moisturize.

403
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,070
库珀  你怎么在这里
Cooper, what are you doing here?

404
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,860
我是说  你在我很高兴  但是...
I mean, I 'm happy you're here, but...

405
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,240
昨晚把你从旅馆赶走我真的很抱歉
I feel horrible that I kicked you out of the hotel room last night.

406
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,150
是啊  那不是我想的
Yeah, that was not the way

407
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,000
我们被赶走的方式
I was hoping we were gonna get kicked out.

408
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,200
是我在吃醋  无理取闹
I was being insecure and irrational.

409
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,660
通常  我只占一样的
Normally, I'm only one of those things.

410
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,260
我也早该跟你说乔什那事的
And I should've told you about Josh.

411
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,630
瞒着你是我不对
It was wrong not to tell you.

412
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,820
我不会再有事骗你了
I will never keep anything from you again.

413
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,580
我也不会  所以我...
Neither will I, which is why...

414
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,220
加比  我有话要跟你说
Gabi, there's something I need to tell you.

415
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,950
我也有话要跟你说
There's something I need to tell you, too.

416
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,940
或许我该先说
Well, maybe I should go first,

417
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,760
因为这真的是大事  我想让你
'cause this is really big, and I really want you

418
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,050
好好消化一下
to take it in before you react.

419
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,210
-我爱你  -什么
- I love you. - What?

420
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,610
抱歉  我等不及了  我爱你
I'm sorry. I couldn't wait. I love you.

421
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,720
你想跟我说什么来着
Now, what did you want to tell me?

422
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,100
我要辞了中国的工作
That I'm quitting my job in China

423
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,750
搬回来和你一起
and moving back to be with you.

424
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,290
是吗
You are?

425
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,370
是的
Yes, of course.

426
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,440
因为我也爱你
Because I love you, too.

427
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,320
太棒了
Yes!

428
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,360
真的很抱歉  我太紧张了
I'm really sorry. I was just really nervous,

429
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,490
因为不确定你是不是会回应我
because I wasn't sure if you were gonna actually say it, too.

430
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,360
-我还有另一个秘密  -什么
- Oh, and I have another secret. - Yeah?

431
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,880
我把旅馆门卡给索菲亚了  家里只剩我们
I gave Sofia the hotel room key, so we're alone.

432
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,460
谢天谢地
Oh, thank god.

433
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,650
天呐
Oh my god.

434
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,260
天呐
Oh my god.

435
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,970
天呐
Oh my god.

436
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,340
天呐
Oh my god.

437
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,760
天呐
Oh my god.

438
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,680
天呐
Oh my god.

439
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,100
我懂  是吧
I know. Right?

440
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,190
不  旅馆刚发来了账单
No, the hotel just sent me the bill.

441
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,010
天呐
Oh my god!

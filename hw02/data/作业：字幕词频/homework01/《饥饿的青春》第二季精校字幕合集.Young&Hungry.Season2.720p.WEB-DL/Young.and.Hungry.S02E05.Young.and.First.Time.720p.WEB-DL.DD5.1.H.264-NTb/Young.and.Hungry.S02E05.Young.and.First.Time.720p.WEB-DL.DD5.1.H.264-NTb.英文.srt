15
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,860
- I am so excited to see you tomorrow. - Me too.

16
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,490
We're finally going to consummate our relationship!

17
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,560
And we're gonna have sex for the first time.

18
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,130
Speaking of which, I got my STD test.

19
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,560
You mean your "Safe To Do It" test?

20
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,740
Yup, clean as a whistle,

21
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,640
though whistles aren't actually very clean at all.

22
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,270
The mouth is a haven for harmful bacteria.

23
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,750
All right. Save that for the bedroom.

24
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,530
Well, I'm getting my test after work, but don't worry.

25
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,110
I've only been with one person since the last time I was tested.

26
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,890
Yeah, and just casually asking, who was that one other guy?

27
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,910
Uh... it's not important.

28
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,220
What is important is the next time we're together,

29
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,480
we're gonna be together.

30
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,470
I'll see you tomorrow.

31
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,940
Though for me, with the time change,

32
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,570
it'll actually be yesterday, in which case, we already had sex.

33
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,470
- How were we? -Amazing!

34
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,140
Thank you, online tech support person man.

35
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,460
- Hello, Josh. - Gabi.

36
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,210
If you have a computer problem, you can come to me.

37
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,610
You know... the last guy you had sex with.

38
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,060
Were you listening to my private conversation?

39
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,480
Your private conversation that you were having in my kitchen

40
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,510
- with my Internet on my laptop? - My god, that's a good point.

41
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,670
So wait, you were with Cooper in China for three weeks,

42
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,170
sharing a bed, and nothing?

43
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,580
- I knew you for less than three hours and we-- - I know!

44
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,540
That's why I was being careful.

45
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,000
I mean, the last person I had sex with,

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,170
it kind of ended up a big mess.

47
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,920
So, what I'm hearing

48
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,390
is that no man could possibly measure up

49
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,870
to that big... handsome mess.

50
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,870
No, what you're hearing is me politely asking

51
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,830
if I can leave work early and go to the clinic.

52
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,690
So you can get your "Safe to do it"

53
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,760
- cause you haven't "Done it yet" test? - Yes, that's the one.

54
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,340
Yes, you can go, but look,

55
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,590
you have nothing to worry about. I'm safe.

56
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,790
Yeah, you are, but you know how they say

57
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,650
when you have sex with someone,

58
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,530
you have sex with everybody they've had sex with?

59
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,960
Gabi, the only other person I was sleeping with

60
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,320
when I slept with you was Caroline.

61
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,020
New plan.

62
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,050
We're both getting tested. I'll call my doctor.

63
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,060
Your doctor's office is really nice.

64
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,070
At the clinic that I go to,

65
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,480
if you didn't have something walking in,

66
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,050
you're gonna have something walking out.

67
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,330
You're paying, right?

68
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,840
Only if it's good news!

69
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,860
I'm sorry. I'm just really nervous.

70
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,820
This is mine and Cooper's first time.

71
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,070
Oh god! What if I have something?

72
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,560
That could kill the whole night!

73
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,340
- Gabi, you're fine. - You don't know that!

74
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,090
I mean, we waited such a long time,

75
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,610
and he paid so much for the hotel room.

76
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,200
I mean, not that he told me how much,

77
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,800
but I definitely looked it up online.

78
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,640
And he's trying to make it so special for me,

79
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,570
and I already bought the cap and gown.

80
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,480
Cap and gown?

81
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,030
Oh. God, do you think it's too much?

82
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,240
I thought it'd be really hot

83
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,370
if I rolled up my test results like a diploma...

84
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,300
...dress up in a sexy cap and gown,

85
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,450
Get it? 'cause we're graduating

86
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,080
to the next level of our relationship--

87
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,040
- the sex level. - I get it.

88
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,340
I'm trying to un-get it.

89
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,610
I'm sorry, am I saying too much?

90
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,930
I don't know if you know this, but when I'm nervous,

91
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,650
- I really seem to talk a lot. - Yeah. Only when you're nervous.

92
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,610
All right, I've looked over your C.B.C. Chem-7 test panel,

93
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,480
and checked out your S.T.I. serologic test--

94
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,050
Oh my god! I'm dying!

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,340
- Calm down, you're both fine. - Oh good.

96
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,360
And may I just say, it was really responsible

97
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,770
for the two of you to come in to be tested together.

98
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,510
I really wish more couples were like you.

99
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,820
Yay! Now I get to go have sex with my boyfriend.

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,210
Thanks, boss.

101
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,230
Don't ask.

102
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,370
Oh, Yolanda.

103
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,330
Yolanda?

104
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,780
What the hell?

105
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,100
I come get my tooth pulled,

106
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,750
and I wake up in the hallway

107
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,390
making out with my ex-husband? Unbelievable.

108
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,850
Yes, it is.

109
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,540
Gabi, you know Coleman.

110
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,030
He's the guy that broke Yolanda's heart by cheating on her.

111
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,660
You know, normally, I'd be eating this up, but...

112
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,300
Cooper and I are having sex for the first time tonight,

113
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,700
so bye!

114
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,940
Come on, Josh. Can't we just start over?

115
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,990
If you mean you and Yolanda, no.

116
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,520
But if you mean you and me, no.

117
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,290
Well, then do you have another reason to be here?

118
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,510
No. Bye-bye, Josh.

119
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,440
We'll talk about this later.

120
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,030
That was a little uncomfortable.

121
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,700
- You're telling me. - Yeah.

122
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,600
Now where were we?

123
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,450
Sofia, this is a five-star hotel.

124
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,420
That's, like, all of the stars!

125
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,040
Well, don't just stand there.

126
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,630
Help me raid the mini-bar.

127
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,490
I already got the shampoo and condish for ya.

128
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,260
Things are about to get sexy.

129
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,520
Yes.

130
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,690
- A five-star sexy! - Yeah.

131
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,840
This bed is so sexy.

132
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,420
Chocolates on the pillow!

133
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,420
Super sexy.

134
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,010
Hello?

135
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,570
It's me, calling you from the bathroom!

136
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,360
I'm here!

137
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,520
- And you are here. - Oh my god!

138
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,340
There's the coolest mirror in here!

139
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,970
And Sofia's here!

140
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,340
Hey, Cooper! Have fun, you two.

141
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm gonna wash my hair and make tiny drinks.

142
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,730
- Wait, wait, let me set the mood. - Okay.

143
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,470
You know how in those romantic movies you like,

144
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,750
- there's always rose petals on the bed? - Yeah.

145
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,460
They were supposed to cascade and flutter,

146
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,410
but my hands are sweaty, 'cause I'm really nervous.

147
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,340
Well, maybe this will calm you down.

148
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,120
No, no, no.

149
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,730
Did I really blow it with the rose-petal clump that bad?

150
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,860
No, I have a surprise for you. Sit down, close your eyes.

151
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,300
- I don't want you to see. - Don't worry.

152
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,950
My glasses are already fogged up.

153
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,350
Okay, this is happening.

154
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,360
This is really happening.

155
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,450
Calm down, Cooper.

156
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,430
You too, mini-Cooper.

157
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,390
Okay, open your eyes.

158
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,280
This is so much better than my graduation from M.I.T.

159
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,010
'Cause the girls weren't as pretty?

160
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,670
And my mother isn't here.

161
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,390
Proof positive that I am negative.

162
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,980
- You are amazing. - And safe to do it.

163
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,820
- Why does this say, "Josh Kaminski"? - What?

164
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,390
They can never spell my name right!

165
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,740
Gabi, I work with computers, so I'm not too good with people,

166
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,060
But I'm pretty sure you handing me

167
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,650
Josh's S.T.D. test results is the worst foreplay ever.

168
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,780
Okay, remember that one thing I said I'd never let you do?

169
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,390
I'll let you.

170
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,780
Gabi, what's going on?

171
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,220
Okay, listen, don't freak out,

172
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,970
because it meant absolutely nothing.

173
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,730
- Oh god, you're sleeping with Josh! - No, slept with.

174
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,260
It's like when I got my hair cornrowed?

175
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,960
It was one time, in the past, and I totally regretted it!

176
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,650
He's the one guy you had sex with?

177
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,130
It was the night of my trial dinner to be Josh's new chef.

178
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,520
- That's how you got the job? - No!

179
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,270
I slept with him after I got the job.

180
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,320
Him and Caroline had just broken up, he was devastated,

181
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,980
I was drunk...

182
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,300
Yeah, well, I'm about to be both of those things.

183
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,310
Okay. You're mad.

184
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,620
Can you channel that passion and throw me onto the bed?

185
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,250
I'm outta here.

186
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,600
Cooper, you can't just leave.

187
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,040
You're right.

188
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,610
I spent 13 hours on a plane,

189
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,030
paid $800 for this beautiful hotel suite,

190
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,370
tried a little something called manscaping...

191
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,770
all so we could have this magical night together.

192
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,650
So you know what? I am gonna stay.

193
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,010
Oh, thank god.

194
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,170
You're leaving.

195
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,920
Leaving? In shame?

196
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,020
This is like my high school graduation all over again,

197
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,960
except that time, I did have sex,

198
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,510
and I did not get a diploma.

199
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,960
Sign there...

200
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,450
and there.

201
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,590
Initial there.

202
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,990
And you are officially gay!

203
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,580
Nothing? That gay stuff usually kills.

204
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,450
I'm sorry, Elliot, I just can't stop thinking

205
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,290
about Yolanda making out with Coleman.

206
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,310
I know. It's like he fell into the hippo pit at the zoo,

207
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,910
managed to escape,

208
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,740
and then jumped right back in again!

209
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,750
Look, I know it's late and my day off,

210
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,450
so if you wanna pay me overtime, go right ahead.

211
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,390
But that's not why I'm here.

212
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,170
I want to talk about the elephant in the room.

214
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,360
Shut up, Elliot!

215
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,400
Look, Yolanda, I know I'm just your boss,

216
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,290
but I'm also the boss whose couch you cried on

217
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,750
every time he cheated on you.

218
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,460
I hear you, and I want you to know I ended it with him,

219
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,950
which is why I'm going to Napa this weekend

220
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,840
with my girlfriends to drown myself

221
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,630
in a big barrel of pinot noir.

222
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,870
You know, to forget Coleman's pinot noir.

223
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,550
Good. Good.

224
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,160
I really think this is for the best.

225
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,490
By the way, what were you doing at the doctor's offce, anyway?

226
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,430
Were you so worried you were following me?

227
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,590
Uh, no.

228
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,190
Gabi and I were actually getting S.T.D. tests.

229
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,180
Come on, you can admit it.

230
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,110
No, I'm being serious. Look.

231
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,960
Gabi's Vitamin D is really low.

232
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,070
- What? - These are Gabi's results.

233
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,710
What do you mean, "Gabi's results"?

234
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,890
Oh my god, I gotta call her right now.

235
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,080
Calm down, baby.

236
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,470
That little pale girl just needs to get some sun.

237
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,920
These are Gabi's results, which means she has my results,

238
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,580
and she's gonna dress up all sexy in a cap and gown

239
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,330
and hand 'em to Cooper like a diploma.

240
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,970
And people think gay sex is weird.

241
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,680
Hey, Cooper.

242
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,750
A bottle of bubbly for the lovebirds.

243
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,820
Gabi's not here...

244
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,190
and I saw your test results.

245
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,830
How about 'em, huh? Weren't they great?

246
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,190
That's why I gave a copy to my employees.

247
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,260
Stop.

248
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,560
Gabi told me everything,

249
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,910
I know you guys had sex together,

250
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,060
and obviously you have feelings for her.

251
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,720
- What? No, that's so-- - It all makes sense--

252
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,950
why you didn't want us to date when I was working for you,

253
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,690
why you punched me in the face.

254
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,050
That had nothing to do with Gabi. We were drunk.

255
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,160
Alcohol really seems to be the excuse for everyone around here.

256
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,530
You know what? You people really have a problem!

257
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,730
Cooper, look, even if I were into her,

258
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,820
the reality is, she's into you.

259
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,920
She's always talking about you,

260
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,670
her face lights up during your video chats,

261
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,260
and she was so excited to dress up in the cap and gown.

262
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,980
She told you about that?

263
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,310
She talks a lot when she's nervous.

264
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,710
Just tell me, man to man...

265
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,300
do you have feelings for her?

266
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,230
If I did, would I be here right now,

267
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,100
trying to get you two to work things out?

268
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,250
Come on, man! You like her,

269
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,450
she likes you. Go get her.

270
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,270
Don't tell me what to do!

271
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,960
I will go get her. Not because you told me to.

272
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,800
Yolanda?

273
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,060
- Josh! - Aren't you supposed to be at Napa?

274
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,920
No! I said I was gonna take a napa.

275
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,200
Baby, what's taking so long?

276
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,500
That's Tammy. She's got a nasty cold.

277
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,180
Ooh, throat just raw.

278
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,430
Come on, Yolanda.

279
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,990
Bring it.

280
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,980
Sweetie, you should stop talking.

281
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,630
You're only making it worse.

282
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,240
No, you're making it worse.

283
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,230
All right, fine! Tammy's Coleman.

284
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,980
- No! - Look, Josh,

285
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,190
I know what you're thinking.

286
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,640
I should just end it and leave with you right now.

287
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,110
- Exactly. Let's go. - I can't just leave him.

288
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,860
Why? Because you have no willpower?

289
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,640
- Because you're falling for him again? - No!

290
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,000
Because he's handcuffed to the headboard.

291
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,770
Oh my god.

292
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,570
My boobs are huge!

293
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,030
God, Sofia, why didn't I tell Cooper about Josh earlier?

294
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,160
Because guys don't want to hear about past hookups.

295
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,320
- They can't handle it. - Why?

296
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,000
I mean, why can't couples be like best friends

297
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,400
and tell each other everything...

298
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,900
like us?

299
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,050
- Totally. - Yeah, and we would never have to worry about

300
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,310
lying or keeping secrets from each other.

301
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,800
Total.

302
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,880
Oh god, Sofia, it so great having a best friend,

303
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,400
'cause no matter if something's hard to hear,

304
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,490
we just still say it, because we trust each other.

305
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,480
Totally.

306
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,450
Although-- and I'm not thinking of anything in particular here,

307
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,290
but we might not tell each other...

308
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,950
- Everything. - Oh please!

309
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,850
Do you remember your Halle Berry haircut?

310
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,640
Who told you that it made you look like John Leguizamo?

311
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,570
- You did. - And why would I do that?

312
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,080
Because you love me and want the best for me.

313
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,620
That's right, and you would do the same for me.

314
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,910
We tell each other everything, no matter what.

315
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,870
It's called "trust."

316
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:50,470
There's actually one thing I might have neglected to tell you,

317
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,670
but we're gonna need the big bottle for that one.

318
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,500
Okay.

319
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,550
I've waited a really long time to tell you this,

320
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,910
and, god, it's been killing me,

321
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,380
but I swear the only reason I didn't tell you

322
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,010
was because you seemed so happy with Cooper and...

323
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,650
okay.

324
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,080
The night that Josh broke off his wedding,

325
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,110
he climbed up the fire escape

326
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,490
to tell you he had feelings for you,

327
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,440
but then he saw you kissing Cooper,

328
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,510
and he was devastated, so he left.

329
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,420
And then when I found out, he swore me to secrecy.

330
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,040
Oh god, I should've told you.

331
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,050
I'm so sorry.

332
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,280
Do you forgive me?

333
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,770
Oh my god, you didn't hear a word I said.

334
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,120
No, but I did.

335
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,040
Well, let me guess. Gabi left her keys in the door again!

336
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,280
Cooper, I'm sorry you had to find out

337
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,000
about Josh and Gabi this way.

338
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,320
But, you know, it's time everybody knew.

339
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,150
- Apparently, everyone did know. - No, not Gabi,

340
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,360
but she's gonna find out as soon as she wakes up,

341
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,630
- because I cannot keep this from her anymore. - You're right.

342
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,100
She needs to know.

343
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,310
Just... let me be the one to tell her.

344
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,340
- Why? - I need to see her face when she finds out.

345
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,530
It's the only way I'll know if she has feelings for Josh.

346
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,350
Okay, but I'm the one that's been keeping this from her,

347
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,570
so I should be the one to tell her.

348
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,150
You can stay in my hotel room.

349
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,700
I don't think that-- really?

350
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,310
Okay, but she needs to know that I tried to tell her the truth.

351
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,180
Promise me you'll tell her.

352
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,760
I will.

353
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,400
- Oh, and, Cooper... - Yes, you can order room service.

354
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,290
- And...? - And a movie.

355
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,620
Yolanda promised up and down she's never gonna see Coleman again,

356
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,860
- so why are we at his office? - Because Yolanda is weak.

357
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,190
All Coleman has to do is call her, and she caves.

358
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,480
So we're gonna confront Coleman,

359
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,970
make sure he never contacts her again.

360
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,830
Oh, so that's why you brought me.

361
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,530
I'm the bad cop! I'm the muscle!

362
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,230
I'm the heavy!

363
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,160
I'm missing a tassel on my loafer.

364
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,020
Coleman.

365
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,020
- Look, we need to talk man to man. - To man!

366
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,760
- O-- okay. - I love Yolanda.

367
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,940
And I... work with her.

368
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,040
And we both care about her.

369
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,120
Okay, so... what's the problem?

370
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,460
The problem is, we are worried.

371
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,060
You are emotionally closed off

372
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,560
and prone to infidelity.

373
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,520
All right, let's put the tiger back in the cage.

374
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,300
Coleman, look...

375
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,910
Yolanda can't see it, but she's falling for you again,

376
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,260
and that's dangerous.

377
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,970
So, if you care about her, you gotta leave her alone,

378
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,170
because when it comes to you, she has no self-control.

379
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,160
The hell I don't!

380
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,170
I can end it with Coleman any time I want!

381
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,260
Wait, hold up. Yolanda...

382
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,230
are you falling in love with me?

383
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,450
Well, Coleman...

384
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,550
I did not see this coming.

385
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,080
This changes everything.

386
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,610
Yolanda, I'm sorry.

387
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,510
Because I am falling for you again, too.

388
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,880
You are?

389
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,470
Damn right I am.

390
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,010
I'm lucky I get a second chance to make things right.

391
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,690
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

392
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,550
Because you butted in,

393
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,900
they're actually closer than they were before.

394
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,900
Thank you, Elliot.

395
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,150
I mean, if it wasn't for you coming down here,

396
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:53,410
they might not be a couple, but because you did,

397
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:58,470
- they are. - I get it, Elliot.

398
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,590
Now get out, so I can get it.

399
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,060
The sex that's about to happen

400
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,160
is because of you.

401
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,720
Sofia, you have the soft skin of a little girl.

402
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,200
It's Cooper, and I occasionally moisturize.

403
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,070
Cooper, what are you doing here?

404
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,860
I mean, I 'm happy you're here, but...

405
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,240
I feel horrible that I kicked you out of the hotel room last night.

406
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,150
Yeah, that was not the way

407
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,000
I was hoping we were gonna get kicked out.

408
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,200
I was being insecure and irrational.

409
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,660
Normally, I'm only one of those things.

410
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,260
And I should've told you about Josh.

411
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,630
It was wrong not to tell you.

412
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,820
I will never keep anything from you again.

413
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,580
Neither will I, which is why...

414
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,220
Gabi, there's something I need to tell you.

415
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,950
There's something I need to tell you, too.

416
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,940
Well, maybe I should go first,

417
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,760
'cause this is really big, and I really want you

418
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,050
to take it in before you react.

419
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,210
- I love you. - What?

420
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,610
I'm sorry. I couldn't wait. I love you.

421
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,720
Now, what did you want to tell me?

422
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,100
That I'm quitting my job in China

423
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,750
and moving back to be with you.

424
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,290
You are?

425
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,370
Yes, of course.

426
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,440
Because I love you, too.

427
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,320
Yes!

428
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,360
I'm really sorry. I was just really nervous,

429
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,490
because I wasn't sure if you were gonna actually say it, too.

430
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,360
- Oh, and I have another secret. - Yeah?

431
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,880
I gave Sofia the hotel room key, so we're alone.

432
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,460
Oh, thank god.

433
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,650
Oh my god.

434
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,260
Oh my god.

435
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,970
Oh my god.

436
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,340
Oh my god.

437
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,760
Oh my god.

438
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,680
Oh my god.

439
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,100
I know. Right?

440
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,190
No, the hotel just sent me the bill.

441
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,010
Oh my god!

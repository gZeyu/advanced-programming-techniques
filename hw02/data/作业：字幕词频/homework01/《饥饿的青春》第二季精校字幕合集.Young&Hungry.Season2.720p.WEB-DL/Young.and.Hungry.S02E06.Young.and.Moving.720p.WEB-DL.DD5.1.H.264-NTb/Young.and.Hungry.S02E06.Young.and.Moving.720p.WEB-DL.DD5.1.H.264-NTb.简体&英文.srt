00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,210
的青春

10
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,210
第二季  第六集

11
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,190
我去上班了
Okay, I'm off to work.

12
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,310
想得美
The hell you are!

13
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,380
怎么了
What?

14
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,000
加比  这地方比你的人生还混乱
Gabi, this place is messier than your life.

15
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,740
我在外面睡觉时  这是我的卧室
Okay, well, when I sleep out here, this is my bedroom.

16
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,650
但你醒来后  这是我们的客厅
Okay, but when you wake up, it is our living room.

17
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,220
好吧
Fine.

18
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,910
打扫好难啊
Cleaning is so hard.

19
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,290
-开心了吗  -等我们住进两卧公寓我就开心了
- Happy? - I will be when we get a two-bedroom apartment.

20
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,410
你永远也不会的
Well, you're never gonna be, then,

21
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,670
因为没人会离开这栋租金管制大楼
because nobody leaves this rent-controlled building

22
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,640
除非死了被抬出去
unless they're rolled out of here.

23
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,150
天啊
Oh, my god!

24
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,190
这是2B的雅各布森太太
That's Mrs. Jacobsen from 2B.

25
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,680
出什么事了
What happened?

26
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,550
中风
Stroke.

27
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,210
她跌跌撞撞地从主卧室走过客浴室
She stumbled from the master bedroom, through the guest bathroom,

28
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,900
在洗烘衣机上撞到了头
hit her head on the washer/dryer,

29
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,670
然后在次卧里昏倒
then collapsed in the second bedroom.

30
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,030
死了
Dead.

31
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,410
天啊  难以置信雅各布森太太
Oh, my god, I can't believe Mrs. Jacobsen...

32
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,050
居然有次卧
had a second bedroom!

33
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,890
加比  可怜的雅各布森太太  愿她安息
Gabi, poor Mrs. Jacobsen! May she rest in peace.

34
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,660
是啊  愿我在她的次卧安息
Yes, and may I rest in her second bedroom!

35
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,110
那太刻薄了
Okay, that is so mean.

36
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,660
真的吗  比你穿裤子她说你是妓女
Really? Meaner than when she called you a whore

37
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,900
还要刻薄吗
for wearing pants?

38
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,350
对
Oh, that's right.

39
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,050
我们一定要弄到那个死婊子的公寓
We are so getting that dead bitch's apartment.

40
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,740
怎么做啊  这里是旧金山
Well, how? I mean, this is San Francisco.

41
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,360
很难找公寓的
Apartments are really hard to find.

42
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,310
那个医护人员肯定都申请了那间公寓
I bet that paramedic already has an application in for it.

43
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,710
但我们认识房东啊
Yeah, but we know the landlord.

44
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,650
我们只用说服他租给我们
So, all we gotta do is convince him to give it to us.

45
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,650
我读过一篇文章
And, I read an article that

46
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,690
说如果你提供食物或者性爱  
said you can get anything you want from a man

47
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,800
就可以从男人那得到一切
if you give him food or sex.

48
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,530
你得读文章才知道这点吗
You had to read an article to know that?

49
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,970
-我给食物  -等等
- Dibs on food! - Wait!

50
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,930
你给乔什做了这么丰盛的早餐
Wow, you're going all out for Josh's breakfast.

51
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,100
这次又犯了什么错想弥补啊
What mistake are you making up for this time?

52
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,960
实际上我在做土豆芝士饺讨好我的俄罗斯房东
Actually, I'm making pirogies to butter up my Russian landlord.

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,220
你不止毁了我们的生活啊
So you don't just screw up our lives?

54
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,840
不  我没跟你说好消息吗
No. Didn't I tell you the good news?

55
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,810
走廊对面的女人中风死了
The lady across the hall died of a stroke!

56
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,770
早上好  帅哥美女们
Good morning, beautiful people!

57
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,440
知道谁饿了吗  我
You know who's starving? Me.

58
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,730
知道为什么吗  滚床单了
You know why? Sex.

59

62
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,250
你知道大家常说中年妇女
You know how they say older women

63
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,190
床技高超  因为她们花样百出吗
are awesome 'cause they know all kinds of stuff?

64
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,980
{\an4} 时间轴  aaaBao

{\an4} 后期  斯人   总监  roaddog

67
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,380
中年妇女  那幸运的女士是谁
Older women? Who's the lucky lady?

68
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,890
不  你选了她而不是我吗
No! You picked her over me?

69
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,130
抱歉  艾略特  我有乔什想要的东西
Sorry, Elliot. I got a little something Josh wants.

70
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,050
你有他不想要的东西
You got a little something he doesn't.

71
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,180
我不想要你俩的任何东西
I don't want anything from either of you.

72
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,930
因为我从肖娜身上得到够多了
Because I'm getting plenty from Shauna.

73
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,100
乔什只是让我住在这里
Josh is just letting me stay here

74
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,760
因为我跟科尔曼吵架了
 'cause I got in a fight with Coleman.

75
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,320
什么  你们刚同居就吵架了吗
What? You guys just moved in together? You're already fighting?

76
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,740
我知道  但我不喜欢他给女服务员小费的方式
I know. But, I didn't like the way he tipped the waitress.

77
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,120
-他给了她什么  -他的电话
- Oh, what'd he leave her? - His phone number.

78
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,410
好啊  爱人
Hi, lover.

79
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,430
我在跟高个白人说话呢
And I'm talking to the tall, white one.

80
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,190
各位  这是我女朋友
Guys, this is my girlfriend.

81
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,640
天啊  你才不是姑娘  你是肖娜·史蒂文斯
Oh my god, you're not a girl, you're Shauna Stevens!

82
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,680
ABC新闻的科技记者
You're the tech reporter for ABC news.

83
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,790
我男朋友是个程序员
My boyfriend's a programmer,

84
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,240
他床头贴着你的海报
and he has a poster of you above his bed.

85
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,480
原来那张是他买的啊
Oh, so he's the one who bought that.

86
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,370
她在谦虚
She's being modest.

87
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,640
她实际上得了两次皮博迪奖
She actually has two Peabody Awards

88
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,620
快速拨号还存了安德森·库珀的号码
and Anderson Cooper on speed dial.

89
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,500
我床头有一张他的海报
I have a poster of him over my bed.

90
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,810
肖娜  我想着
So, Shauna, I was wondering,

91
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,140
今晚去你家过吧
maybe we spend the night at your place, tonight?

92
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,510
我还没去过呢
You know, I still haven't been there.

93
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,780
不行  我刚请人清洁了地板
Uh, we can't. I just had the floors cleaned,

94
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,220
有点脏
and it's kind of a mess.

95
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,490
我不介意脏[淫荡]的东西
Well, you know I don't mind things a little bit dirty.

96
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,090
我刚想起来  我家也停水了
Oh, and I just remembered, the water's also been shut off.

97
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,230
也许我们该找人去修
Well, maybe we should call somebody to fix it?

98
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,590
听说安德森·库珀很会修水管[JJ]
I hear Anderson Cooper's good with pipes...

99
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,200
肖娜  如果我不了解你
You know, Shauna, if I didn't know any better,

100
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,070
我会觉得你是想隐瞒什么呢
I'd think you were trying to hid something from me?

101
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,210
这样吧  不如我们之后藏点东西吧
I'll tell you what. How about we hide something later...

102
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,990
今晚见
See you tonight?

103
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,280
她身上有很棒的地方藏东西
Oh, she's got good hiding places.

104
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,800
那是房东
That's the landlord!

105
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,870
他在上来的路上了
He's on his way up.

106
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,590
我的土豆芝士饺准备好了
My pirogies are hot and ready.

107
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,260
我的也是
So are mine.

108
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,970
你看起来美呆了
You look amazing.

109
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,940
但是我觉得你两边不一样高
But, um, I think you're a little lopsided.

110
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,160
这个嘛
Oh, well, you know,

111
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,730
我还没塞完左胸  咱家的卫生纸就用完了
we ran out of toilet paper before I could finish stuffing lefty.

112
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,930
你怎么这么快就让他来了啊
So, how'd you get him up here, so fast?

113
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,720
我跟他说水槽堵了
Oh, well, I told him the sink was clogged.

114
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,730
因为我们的枕头大战
From all of our pillow fights.

115
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,020
真棒
Great, great.

116
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,070
我这样问是因为我了解你
Um, I only ask you this because I know you.

117
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,990
你记得去堵水槽了吗
Did you remember to clog the sink?

118
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,350
-快  放一点卫生纸进去  -天啊
- Quick! Put a little of your bigger boobie in there! - Oh, god!

119
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,630
是他
That's him.

120
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,820
快点快点
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

121
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,070
请进吧
Come in.

122
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,550
姑娘们  哪个水槽堵了啊
Hello, girls. Which sink is clogged?

123
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,630
我觉得水槽可能是我在
I think it may have gotten clogged

124
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,300
做世界闻名的土豆芝士饺时堵塞的
while I was making my world famous pirogies.

125
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,940
你想吃一个吗
Do you want one?

126
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,530
不想
No.

127
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,730
水槽修好了  我走了
Sink fixed. I go now.

128
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,010
等等
Wait! Um...

129
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,790
我们听说2B单元对外招租了
We heard that apartment 2B opened up?

130
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,030
大家都想租2B单元
Everyone wants 2B.

131
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,310
住4A的姑娘为了租2B都愿意献出肉体了
Girl in 4A offered to do disgusting things for 2B.

132
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,290
而且她拥有一对D杯大乳
And she's got two D's.

133
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,880
因为我丧妻
Just because I lost wife

134
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,310
她们就认为可以跟我上床来换那套房子
they think they can sex me for apartment.

135
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,410
真不要脸
Oh, that is pathetic.

136
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,760
我过敏了
I have allergies.

137
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,700
我走了
I go now.

138
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,280
或许我再待一会吧
Or, maybe I stay.

139
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,460
姑娘们  乔什正忙着和女主播亲热
Hey, girls. Josh was getting busy with the anchorwoman.

140
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,800
声音可不比采访直升机的动静小
And the buzz in her hair was not from the news chopper.

141
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,520
我能在这看《法律与秩序》吗
So, is it cool if I watch Law & Order here?

142
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,040
我超爱看《法律与秩序》
I... I love the Law & Order.

143
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,900
而且我老婆死了
And my wife's dead.

144
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,320
太好了  你俩快进来  请坐
Well, great, come on in, sit down, both of you!

145
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,390
还有什么比边看《法律与秩序》
Yeah, what goes better with the Law & Order

146
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,190
边吃饺子更配的呢
than the pirogies?

147
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,750
比如配白俄罗斯鸡尾酒[俄罗斯白人]
Maybe a White Russian?

148
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,150
要是有人问  你就说是来问我借车的
Okay, if anybody asks, you're here to borrow my car.

149
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,020
是吗
Oh, really?

150
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,600
我不是该说我是来骗尤兰达
I shouldn't say that I'm here to trick Yolanda

151
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,410
跟我们的房东约会
into dating our landlord

152
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,910
好让我们租到那套房的吗
so we can get that apartment?

153
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,560
但愿你能把讥讽的话留到
You know, hopefully, you can keep your sarcasm

154
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,430
我们新的步入式衣帽间里说
in our new walk-in closet.

155
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
我超想租下那套房
I just really want this.

156
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,410
我是两卧狂热爱好者
I have two bedroom fever.

157
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,440
-尤兰达  -姑娘们
- Hey, Yolanda. - Hey, girls.

158
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,260
-没什么  我只是来找她借车的  -什么
- Nothing, I'm just here to borrow her car. - What?

159
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,730
你和科尔曼怎么样了
So, how's it going with Coleman?

160
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,880
你还想让他在公交车前面走吗
Do you still want him to walk in front of a bus?

161
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,180
当然不  亲爱的
Oh, no, honey.

162
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,640
我想推他迎面撞上公交车
I wanna push him in front of one.

163
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,640
我想到了个主意
Well, you know, I actually just had an idea.

164
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:12,780
正好想到
Just now.

165
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,570
我觉得需要给科尔曼点教训
Um, I feel like Coleman needs a taste of his own medicine.

166
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,820
或许你该和别人约会  让他吃醋
Maybe you should go out with another guy and make him jealous?

167
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,270
真是个好主意  加比  给他个教训
That's a great idea, Gabi. That'll teach him.

168
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,760
这办法可行  但有个问题
It would teach him. Only one problem.

169
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,490
要是我认识其他人  就不会跟我前夫约会了
If I knew a guy, I wouldn't date my ex-husband.

170
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,000
我又想到了个主意
Well, I just had another idea.

171
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,540
才想到的
Just now.

172
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,890
你觉得迪米特里怎么样
Um, what about Dmitri?

173
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,000
又是个好主意  加比
Another great idea, Gabi!

174
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,960
你们性感的俄罗斯房东吗  那家伙不错
Your sexy Russian landlord? That guy is fine.

175
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,880
你觉得你们俩能...
You think you two can...

176
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,300
晚上八点  三藩咖啡馆  别迟到
Sanfran Cafe 8:00 pm. Don't be late.

177
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,490
跑得如何  姐们
How was your run, mate?

178
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,460
要不要来点刚做好的早餐餐呢
Would you like a spot o' brekkie?

179
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,450
我学了点澳洲俚语  我真贴心
I googled Australian slang. I'm a delight.

180
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,720
能给我杯茶茶吗
Can I have a cuppa?

181
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,060
这词的意思是"一杯茶"
That means "cup of tea."

182
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,550
好的  抱歉  我还没看到C打头的那些
Oh, right, sorry. I didn't make it to the c's.

183
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,640
加比  你好像跟乔什关系很好
Gabi, you seem close with Josh.

184
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,940
为什么  他跟你说了什么
Why, what'd he tell you?

185
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,730
我开玩笑的  我们关系不错
I mean, I'm just kidding. We're close.

186
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,030
我能问你个问题吗
Can I ask you a question?

187
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,540
问题题吗
A questie?

188
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,030
你觉得暂时对人保守秘密
Do you think it's wrong to keep a secret

189
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,980
是不对的吗  当然是在
from someone just for a little while

190
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,820
出于善意的情况下
with only good intentions, of course.

191
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,290
你我之间
Well, between you and me,

192
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,660
我都不需要知道是出于善意
I don't even need the good intentions part.

193
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,020
你真是贴心
Yeah, you are a delight.

194
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,070
什么秘密
So, what's the secret?

195
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,640
我是位母亲
I'm a mum.

196
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,730
什么  真的吗
What? You are?

197
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,270
我共享七岁儿子布雷特的抚养权
I share custody of my seven-year-old son, Brett.

198
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,360
我很怕告诉乔什
And, I'm afraid to tell Josh.

199
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,710
这就是我言辞闪烁的原因
That's why I've been acting so dodgy.

200
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,320
"闪烁"  这调子不错
"Dodgy." That's a good one.

201
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,590
听着  乔什这个人
Well, listen, about Josh,

202
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,450
我觉得你不用担心
I don't think you have anything to worry about.

203
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,020
乔什喜欢小孩子[小个子]
Josh loves little guys.

204
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,420
你见过艾略特吗
You've met Elliot?

205
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,640
你说的对  加比
You're right, Gabi.

206
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,220
现在我只要找个合适的时机告诉他
Now I just need to find the right time to tell him.

207
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,650
为何不在吃完早餐餐后
Why don't you tell him after brekkie,

208
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,460
他喝茶茶的时候告诉他
when he's had a cuppa,

209
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,930
除非你觉得这太闪躲了
unless you think that's too dodgy.

210
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,090
你好
G'day!

211
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,760
乔什  我做坏事了
Josh, I did something bad.

212
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,780
我搞到了安德森·库珀的电话号码
I got Anderson Cooper's phone number.

213
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,240
这有什么不好的呢
Why is that bad?

214
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,790
我偷了肖娜的手机才搞到的
I stole Shauna's phone to get it.

215
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,580
-艾略特  -还有更糟的事
- Elliot! - Oh, it gets worse.

216
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,630
在这过程中
In the midst of my mischief making,

217
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,040
我发现肖娜对你不忠
I discovered Shauna is cheating on you.

218
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,430
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

219
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,080
我偶然看到了几条她发给一个
I stumbled upon a few texts she sent

220
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,650
名叫布雷特的男妓的短信
to some manwhore named Brett.

221
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,820
荒唐至极
You're being ridiculous,

222
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,740
而且你侵犯了她的隐私
and you invaded her privacy!

223
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,140
读给我听
Read 'em to me.

224
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,930
"我想亲亲你的脸蛋"
"I miss kissing your face."

225
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,700
这不算什么
That's not so bad.

226
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,080
"等不及爬上床  今晚与你共眠了"
"Can't wait to crawl into bed with you tonight."

227
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,280
性质严重了
Getting worse.

228
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,260
"买了一堆新玩具  我们能一起玩"
"Bought a bunch of new toys we can play with together."

229
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,050
天呐
Oh, God.

230
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,570
她也给我买了"玩具"一起玩
She bought us toys to play with, too.

231
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,620
天呐  毛巾加热器在打折
Oh my God, they got towel warmers on sale.

232
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,470
我该买一个吗
Should I get one?

233
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,060
不  买两个  一个浴室放一个
No. Get two. One for each bathroom!

234
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,300
你觉得吗  我们兴奋的太早了
You know what, we're getting too excited about this.

235
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,480
还不知道迪米特里和尤兰达约会得如何了
We don't even know how Dmitri and Yolanda's date went.

236
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,160
但是他们三小时前就去约会了
But, they left on their date three hours ago.

237
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,110
我能先把它放进购物车吗
Can I at least just add to cart?

238
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,070
天呐  我们太专注于这件事了
Man, we are obsessing over this.

239
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,020
得找点别的事来做
We gotta find something

240
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,760
好转移我们对公寓的注意力
that's gonna take our mind of the apartment.

241
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,400
公寓  什么公寓
Apartment. Heh. What apartment?

242
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,260
天呐  不管用
Oh my God, it's not working.

243
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,690
-我们得过去看看  -好的
- We have to go over there! - Okay.

244
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
-姑娘们  -迪米特里
- Oh, girls. - Oh, Dmitri.

245
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:42,990
约会进行得如何
How did your date go?

246
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,840
这是我第一次和人约会
This is first date I've been on.

247
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,310
在我妻子死后
Well, since wife dead.

248
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,860
我还以为再也不会了
I thought it never happen,

249
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,540
-但我恋爱了  -他恋爱了
- But I'm in love! - He's in love!

250
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,370
尤兰达真的很棒
Yolanda is bee's knees!

251
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,770
是  她的确很棒
Yeah. She is totally bee's knees.

252
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,980
那你还记得你说
So, do you remember that one time

253
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,530
欠我人情那事吗  我记得
where you said that you owe me? Well, I do.

254
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,170
我就是在想...
Um, I was just wondering,

255
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,070
如果有可能的话
if maybe this could possibly--

256
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,620
-我们想租2B单元  -对
- We want apartment 2B! - Yeah.

257
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,940
姑娘们  你们照应我  我也想着你们
Girls, you scratch my back, I scratch yours...

258
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,770
两居公寓是你们的了
with two-bedroom apartment!

259
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,320
-耶  -谢谢
- Yay! - Thank you!

260
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,650
这是我从劳改营出来以后最开心的事了
I've not been so happy since release from labor camp.

261
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,440
谢谢你们  谢谢
Thank you, thank you.

262
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,260
我周一把租约带来
I bring you lease on Monday.

263
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,520
好的
Okay.

264
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,560
公寓是我们的啦
We got the apartment!

265
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,760
肖娜  我有事想跟你聊聊
Shauna, there's something I wanna talk to you about.

266
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,840
不是事后才聊天吗
Isn't talk what we do after sex?

267
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,950
今晚  我们事前就聊
Well, tonight, we're talking before.

268
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,210
我知道布雷特的事了
I know about Brett.

269
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,400
天啊  你怎么知道的
Oh my god, how'd you find out?

270
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,090
没关系  乔什  我发誓要告诉你的
That doesn't matter, Josh. I swear I was gonna tell you.

271
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,020
但你没有
But, you didn't.

272
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,940
我不说是因为我真的很喜欢你
I was holding back because I'm crazy about you.

273
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,450
是吗
Are you?

274
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,250
是的
Yes.

275
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,130
所以我才很想你们见面
That's why I would love for you to meet him.

276
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,770
见他  布雷特吗
Meet him? Brett?

277
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,340
为...什么
Why... why?

278
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,670
因为你们是我生命里的两个男人
Because you're the two men in my life.

279
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,970
你觉得我们三个找时间玩玩可以吗
How would you feel if the three of us had a little playdate?

280
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,320
"玩...玩"吗
A play what now?

281
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,140
好吧
Uh, okay.

282
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:31,680
你想让布雷特过来
You want Brett to come here.

283
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,370
和我们两个玩吗
And play with me and you?

284
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,360
我们三个一起
All of us together.

285
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,540
一起哈...一起
Together... wow, together...

286
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,990
乔什  我知道这不太好接受
Look, Josh, I know this is a lot to take in.

287
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,490
但如果你不喜欢
But, if you're not into it,

288
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,780
很抱歉  我们也没法继续了
I'm sorry, it's kind of a dealbreaker for me.

289
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,220
没法继续...
Dealbreaker...

290
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,150
没法继续
dealbreaker.

291
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,180
是工作  我得去演播室了
Ugh, it's work. I gotta get down to the studio.

292
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,230
阿肯色州一个男人向Siri求婚  她答应了
A man in arkansas proposed to Siri, and she said yes!

293
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,240
抱歉  我得走了
I'm sorry. I have to run.

294
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,020
你怎么说  我明晚能带布雷特来吗
But, what do you say? I can bring Brett here tomorrow night?

295
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,250
好吧  说实话我有点紧张
Okay, honestly, I'm a little nervous about this.

296
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,540
不用紧张
Don't be.

297
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,350
我们三个一定会很开心的
The three of us are gonna have so much fun together!

298
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,800
好好休息吧  布雷特很磨人的
Now rest up. Brett can really wear you out.

299
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,080
乔什  你有不用的家具吗
Josh, is there any furniture that you don't need in here?

300
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,380
因为我明天就要
Because I am signing the lease

301
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,960
租下我的两卧公寓了
on my new two-bedroom apartment tomorrow...

302
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,750
你怎么了
What's going on with you?

303
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,670
你不会相信肖娜
You will never believe the bomb

304
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,100
昨晚跟我说了什么的
that Shauna dropped on my last night.

305
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,990
她终于跟你说了布雷特吗
Oh, did she finally tell you about Brett?

306
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,860
没错  你怎么知道他的
Yeah! How do you know about Brett?

307
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,810
淡定  好吗  这不是什么大事
Calm down, okay? It's not that big a deal.

308
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,470
可能对有的人不是
Maybe not for some guys.

309
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,790
你不是那些人
You are not some guys.

310
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,420
你不会面对恋爱里第一个问题[曲线球]
You're not gonna freak out at the first curveball

311
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,090
就措手不及的
your relationship throws you.

312
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,820
曲线[女人]我不怕  我怕的是球[男人]啊
I'm fine with the curves. It's the balls I'm worried about.

313
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,380
加比  约会真的很棒
Gabi, the date was perfect!

314
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,560
我们最后在厨房地板上啪啪了
It ended with sex on the kitchen floor.

315
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,550
迪米特里一定挺有本事
Dmitri must have some moves.

316
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,760
他把你哄得高兴吗
Did he have you on your bee's knees?

317
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,570
迪米特里  我说的是科尔曼
Dmitri? I'm talking about Coleman.

318
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,080
你让他吃醋的计划起效了
Your plan to make him jealous worked.

319
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,020
-我又搬回去啦  -不
- Girl, I'm moving back in. - No!

320
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,830
真是糟糕...你这么快就原谅他
That's awful...ly fast for you to forgive him.

321
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,850
你得再和迪米特里约一次会
You have to go on another date with Dmitri.

322
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,280
-为什么  -因为租...
Why would I do that? Because of the lease...

323
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:43,160
最...起码你还能让他继续吃醋
it's the "lease" you could do to keep him super jealous.

324
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,910
加比  我知道你不习惯自己能出好主意
Gabi, I know you're not used to one of your plans working,

325
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,730
但现在是你该高兴的时候
but this is the part where you should be happy!

326
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,060
是啊  我很高兴
Oh, yeah, I'm totally happy.

327
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,030
一个小问题  一台九成新的
Hey, quick question. Can I interest you

328
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,660
毛巾加热器你感兴趣吗
in some slightly used towel warmers?

329
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,440
尤兰达和科尔曼复合了吗
Yolanda's back with Coleman?

330
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,510
天啊  迪米特里会发现的
Oh my god, Dmitri's gonna find out.

331
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,690
我们租不到那公寓了
We're not gonna get that apartment

332
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,620
雅各布森太太死得好冤
and Mrs. Jacobsen died for nothing.

333
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,070
行了  听着  我们还能补救
Stop, okay, listen. We can still save this.

334
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,490
只要保证迪米特里在我们明早
We just have to make sure that Dmitri doesn't call Yolanda

335
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,000
签租约之前不联系尤兰达就好
until after we sign the lease tomorrow morning.

336
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,690
算了  有什么用呢  都结束了
Stop it, okay. What's the point? It's over.

337
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,390
我去最后看一眼加斯顿  和他吻别
I'm just gonna go take one last look and kiss Gaston goodbye.

338
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,940
加斯顿是谁
Uh, who is Gaston?

339
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,380
洗碗机
The dishwasher.

340
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,410
我给他取了名字
I named him.

341
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,670
金发女
Blonde one!

342
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,220
我需要建议
I need advice.

343
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,420
我该请尤兰达去纳帕的红酒间谍之旅吗
Should I invite Yolanda for wine and spy experience in the Napa?

344
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,420
{\an8}一般为"红酒温泉之旅"

345
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,450
我有优惠券
I have groupon.

346
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,720
听着  迪米特里  我有话要说
Listen, Dmitri, I have to tell you something.

347
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,430
尤兰达不喜欢你
Yolanda doesn't like you.

348
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,720
浴缸里还有喷水龙头
There are jets in the bathtub!

349
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:53,960
她爱你
She loves you.

350
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,790
-真的吗  -没错
- Really? - Uh, yes.

351
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,520
但我们发誓保密
But, we were sworn to secrecy.

352
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,480
所以别告诉她是我说的  好吗
So, you can't tell her that I told you, okay?

353
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,080
就...你懂的...不要
It just-- you know, just don't-- actually,

354
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,730
干脆你就别跟她说话了
you know what, don't talk to her at all.

355
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,900
如果她爱我我为什么不跟她说话
What? Why I no talk if she's in love?

356
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,440
因为在美国你打电话给女人之前
Because in America you have to wait three days

357
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,630
要等三天的
before calling a woman.

358
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,330
否则看起来就很猴急
Otherwise you look needy.

359
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,380
但我不想等
But, I don't want to wait.

360
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,680
在俄罗斯  我们有句话
In Russia, we have saying,

361
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,600
"事不宜迟  否则冻死"
"You snooze, you freeze to death."

362
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,610
我们现在是在美国
Well, we live in America.

363
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,910
所以如果你想让尤兰达把你当成男人
So, if you want Yolanda to think you're a man,

364
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,540
就周一之后再打电话给她
you know, just don't call her until after Monday.

365
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,930
你们美国佬真是麻烦
You Americans so confusing.

366
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,210
我向我第一任妻子求婚
With my first wife, I ask her to marry me,

367
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,700
她说"呃"  第二天早上我们就结婚了
she say "Eh." Next morning we married.

368
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,410
好了  来吧
Okay. Here we go.

369
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,040
《阿比阿弟的激情冒险》
Bill and Ted's Sexcellent Adventure.

370
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,290
我们来看看两男一女到底怎么回事
Let's see what this whole two guys one girl stuff is about.

371
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,650
或许没那么糟呢
Maybe it's not so bad.

372
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,750
很糟
It is bad.

373
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,120
那女的夹在片子里干什么呢
Eww, what's that girl doing in there?

374
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,270
记得布雷特吗  肖娜背着我劈腿的那家伙
Remember Brett? Guy Shauna's cheating on me with?

375
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,600
他们正在过来要和我3P
They're on their way over here to have a threesome with me.

376
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:11,710
真的吗
Really?

377
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:14,600
作为你的公关  我觉得这样不行
Well, as your publicist, I think that's a bad idea.

378
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,560
但作为朋友  上吧姑娘
But, as your friend, you go, girl.

379
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,820
我答应只是因为肖娜那么酷炫
Look, I only said yes because Shauna's so cool.

380
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,100
我不想显怂
I didn't want to seem uncool,

381
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,600
但我就是怂啊  艾略特  我怕那样
but I am uncool, Elliot. I am uncool in that way.

382
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,700
其他样子  我还是很酷炫的
In every other way, I am cool.

383
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,140
乔什  振作一点
Josh, pull yourself together.

384
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,700
-他们来了  -好吧
- That's them. - Okay, look.

385
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,880
你出去告诉他们我不想这样  好吗
Go out there and tell them I can't do this, okay?

386
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,610
-就说太难了  -太难了
- Just go-- it's too hard. - Too hard.

387
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,910
不  我...
No, I--

388
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,030
别这么说  说我反悔了
Don't say that. Uh, I gotta back out.

389
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,930
反悔了
Back out.

390
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,170
这更...  艾略特
That's even-- Elliot!

391
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,700
说我在工作  你出去告诉他们我在工作
I'm working. You go out and there and you tell them I'm working.

392
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,940
艾略特  这是我儿子  布雷特
Hey, Elliot, meet my son, Brett.

393
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,140
这就是布雷特吗
This is Brett?

394
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,820
还有你的新玩具
And there's one of your new toys.

395
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,440
这下一定很有趣
Well, this is gonna be funny.

396
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,120
他们走了吗
Are they gone?

397
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,640
抱歉  乔什  但你最好还是出去
Sorry, Josh, but you should go out there.

398
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,910
布雷特很可爱的
Brett is cute.

399
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,460
或许比你还可爱
Might even be cuter than you.

400
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,290
看  我就怕这个
See, that's the problem!

401
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,530
要么我是那个多余的
Either I'm gonna be second banana,

402
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,810
要么他是那个多余的
or he's gonna be second banana.

403
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,610
无论如何  都多了个人啊
Either way, it's too many bananas!

404
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,930
你自己去说吧
Well, tell them yourself.

405
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,100
但温柔点
But, be nice.

406
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,160
我觉得如果你伤害了他感情  布雷特会哭的
I get the sense that if you hurt his feelings, Brett might cry.

407
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,700
我经历过
Been there.

408
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,000
乔什  我想让你见见...
Hi, Josh. I want you to meet--

409
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,230
肖娜
Shauna...

410
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,190
抱歉  我做不来
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

411
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,670
这是我儿子  布雷特
This is my son, Brett.

412
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,100
我生命里的另一个男人
The other man in my life.

413
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,010
布雷特  这是乔什

415
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,050
布雷特

416
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,560
你真是个可爱的小家伙

叔叔给你买辆真卡车

418
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,190
好  一切就绪
Okay, everything's ready.

419
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,290
签字的笔有了  庆祝的香槟有了
Pens ready to sign, champagne ready to pop.

420
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,310
唯一缺的就是带着租约的迪米特里
Well, the only thing missing is Dmitri with the lease,

421
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,000
可他说好9点整会来的
and he said he'd be here at 9:00.

422
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,210
淡定  才9:02呢
Relax, it's only 9:02.

423
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,190
有这两分钟
That is two extra minutes

424
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,350
我们都能租下那公寓了
we could have been renting that apartment.

425
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,380
天啊  是他
Oh my god, that's him.

426
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,790
你好  迪米特里
Hey, Dmitri!

427
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,520
你有何贵干呀  对哦
What are you doing here? Oh, right!

428
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,950
是来和我们签租约的
You're here to help us sign the lease.

429
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,910
是啊

00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,070
交出来
Give it.

431
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,330
你想我用哪支笔呢
So, which pen should I use?

432
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,890
我有圆珠笔  签字笔  香味记号笔
I'm thinking a ball point, roller ball, scented marker,

433
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,470
闪粉笔  还有一根筷子

我的肾上腺素注射笔
My epipen!

435
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,870
不用笔
No pen!

436
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,150
因为俄国传统是用血签字吗
Because it's a Russian custom to sign in blood?

437
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,930
我们没问题的哦
Because we are fine with that.

438
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,170
你们没问题吗  我可有问题
Are you fine? Because Dmitri not so fine.

439
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,220
你说别打电话给尤尤斯基  我就不打
You tell me not to call Yoyoski, I no call.

440
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,150

But I am passionate man, so I go to her house

441
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,480
伏特加和熏鲑鱼登门拜访她
bearing gifts of vodka and smoked salmon.

442
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,890

443
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,480
然后她和男朋友吵起来了
And she get in huge fight with boyfriend.

444
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,250
天惹
Oh, boy.

445
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,440
回家路上我就在想你们为什么要骗我
All the way home I thinking why would girls lie to me?

446
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,200
然后  我恍然大悟
And then, it hit me like a ton of brick.

447
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,160
你们操纵我好得到公寓
You manipulate me to get apartment!

448
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,180
你们这些坏姑娘
You bad girls!

449
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,160
听着  迪米特里  我们真的很抱歉
Well, listen, Dmitri, we're really, really sorry.

450
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,010
是  请让我们补偿你吧
Yes, please let us make it up to you.

451
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,670
你们别想要公寓了
No. No apartment for you!

452
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,240
我租给别人了
I give to someone else.

453
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,360
配得上那公寓的人
Someone who deserve it.

454
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,350
什么  不要啊  是谁
What? No! Who?

455
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,480
有笔吗
Got a pen?

456
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,690
这是我吃过最美味的"道歉味"炸鱿鱼圈了
Now that was the best "I'm sorry" calamari I've ever had.

457
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,260
那你原谅我们把你生活搞得一团糟了吗
So, you forgive us for totally screwing up your life?

458
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,820
某些角度来说  你们帮了我忙
Well, in a way, you two girls did me a favor.

459
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,200
科尔曼被迪米特里气昏了头
Coleman got so mad about Dmitri,

460
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,920
最后承认自己真的跟那服务员有一腿
he wound up admitting he did cheat with the waitress.

461
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,130
还有他的发型师
And his hairdresser.

462
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,110
他的遛狗员
And the dogwalker.

463
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,590
我们根本没养狗
We don't even have a dog!

464
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,630
好了  第一个电影之夜我们看什么呢  邻居
Okay, so what are we watching for our first movie night, neighbor?

我还不知道基努是黑人呢
I didn't know Keanu was black.

469
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,620
为什么大家都没穿衣服
Why is everybody naked?

470
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,550
他们在那电话亭里真是火热啊

11
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,230
那是什么气味  今天是垃圾日吗
What's that smell? Is it garbage day?

12
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,840
不  我做了早餐
No, I made breakfast.

13
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,300
用垃圾做的吗
Did you make it with garbage?

14
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,160
自从你妈妈去世后
Since your mom passed away,

15
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,760
我知道她生日时你会很难过
I know how hard it is for you on her birthday,

16
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,690
所以我给你做了鸡蛋  培根和酪乳煎饼
So I made you a feast of eggs, bacon and buttermilk pancakes!

17
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,050
太贴心了
That is so sweet.

18
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,220
那些东西在哪儿啊
Where are those things?

19
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,350
而且我放了二十块
Also, I put $20

20
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,290
到史密森尼博物馆茱莉亚·蔡尔德旅行罐里
in the Julia Child Smithsonian trip jar

21
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,890
如果有人不再从罐子里偷硬币
and if someone would stop taking quarters out of the jar,

22
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,490
我们就终于能去你和你妈妈
we would finally be able to take that trip

23
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,140
梦寐以求的旅行了
you and your mom always dreamed about.

24
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,630

25
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,380
妈妈说你是最棒的闺蜜

00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,630
早餐应该是一天中最重要的一餐
Breakfast should be your most important meal of the day,

29
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,350
不是最不重要的

30
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,110
我觉得她很聪明
I think she's a smart lady.

31
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,290
-我来给你做早餐吧  -好主意

39
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,410
我两天没睡了
I haven't slept in two days.

40
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,620
看来某人很走运啊
Sounds like somebody's getting lucky.

41
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,090
真是肮脏人做肮脏事啊
That puts the "nasty" in "doing the nasty."

42
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,030
和埃兰的性爱很狂野

我感觉自己是丛林女王艾略特
I feel like Elliot, Queen of the Jungle.

44
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,880
昨晚我们在一个特别疯狂的地方做了
Last night we did it in the craziest place...

45
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,960
卧室地板上
the bedroom floor.

46
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,280
拜托  我在卫浴寝具批发商城的
Oh please, I've done it on the floor

47
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,070
地板上做过
of Bed, Bath & Beyond.

48
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,590
我带着八折优惠券进去
I went in with a 20% off coupon,

49
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,860
结果他们免单了
and got 100% off.

50
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,810
话说...
So...

51
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,390
在我超棒的女朋友下来之前  我需要你的帮助
Before my amazing girlfriend comes down, I need your help.

52
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,520

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,600
要给肖娜颁奖
by the San Francisco Journalists Association,

54
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,970
我得想出一个超棒的礼物
and I need to think of an awesome gift.

55
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,550

瞧瞧我
Oh, look at me.

58
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,370
哥有钱  买得起摩天轮

在摩天轮上

I can.

我女儿七岁生日时
My daughter's seventh birthday

65
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,920
在充气城堡里
in the bouncy castle

66
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,160
和小丑来了一发
with the clown.

67
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,460
原来小丑们
It turns out noses aren't

68
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,640
喜欢捏的不只是鼻子
the only thing clowns like to honk.

69
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,460
孩子  小丑  异性性行为
Kids, clowns, hetero sex--

70

这里没我事了
there's nothing for me here.

71
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,220
除了布雷特...你还有个孩子吗
You have another kid... besides Brett?

72
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,490
是啊  丹妮尔  她25岁了

74
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,190
没别的了吧
Is that it?

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,010
我不常说起丹妮尔
I don't talk about Danielle that often.

76
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,590
不幸的是  我们很多年没说过话了
Unfortunately, we haven't spoken in years.

77
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,770
什么  母女不睦吗  出了什么事
What? A mother-daughter not close? What happened?

78
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,800
加比  这听起来像是私事
Gabi, sounds like it's kind of a private thing.

79
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,260
是啊  所以我才问
Yeah, yeah, that's why I'm asking.

80
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,640
没事  乔什
It's okay, Josh.

我怀她是自己也是个孩子
I was a child myself when I had her.

82
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,520
要是说实话  我觉得我们太像了
And if I'm truthful, I think we're just too much alike.

83
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,910
现在我们可以说说早餐了吗  
Now can we talk about breakfast?

84
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,380
是的  你想吃蛋吗
Yes. Would you like eggs?

85
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,280
你们互相发圣诞卡片吗
And do you at least send each other Christmas cards?

86
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,730
我发的  但她没有回过我
Well, I do. I just-- I never get one back.

87
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,660
电子贺卡都没吗
Not even an E-card?

88
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,710
那是免费的呀
But they're free.

89
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,340
最近一次的消息
Last I heard,

90
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,270
是她在佛蒙特州做手工枫糖浆
she was making artisanal maple syrup in Vermont.

91
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,080
我先失陪了  要去车里哭了
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to go cry in my car.

92
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,830
-肖娜  -我开玩笑的  有司机来接我
- Shauna! - I'm just kidding. A driver's picking me up.

93
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,690
我要去他的车里哭
I'm gonna cry in his car.

94
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,380
你知道给肖娜什么礼物好吗
Hey, you know what a great gift for Shauna would be?

95
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,310
心理医生  多谢了你

97
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,740
不  那是肖娜的私事
No, that's Shauna's personal business.

98
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,060
-我不该插手  -是啊  所以
- It's not my place to get involved. - Yeah, that's why

99
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,140
这会是个很棒的惊喜  她不会料到的
it would be such a great surprise-- she'd never see it coming.

100

每个母亲和女儿都想亲密
Every mother and daughter want to be close.

101

Okay.

110
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,680
我的妈呀
Oh my damn.

111
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,930
毯子下面藏着头猪
A pig in a blanket.

112
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,930
{\an8}"毯包猪"在美国指香肠面包

113
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,430
我不知道怎么回事
I don't know what happened.

114
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,680
我进来拿乔什要送去干洗的西装
I came to get Josh's tux for the cleaner's,

115
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,820
闻到了他枕头的气味  于是我就...
I smelled his pillow, and the next thing I know--

116
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,930
晚安好梦
Okay, night-night.

117
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,560
好了  亲爱的  肯定出什么事了
Okay, baby, something definitely isn't right.

118
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,930
快起来  以前我四点才哄你午睡的
Come on. I don't usually put you down for your nap until 4:00.

119
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,520
我第一次在埃兰家过周末  根本睡不着
I spent my first weekend at Alan's place and couldn't sleep,

120
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,970
因为我怕自己出丑
'cause I was afraid I might do something embarrassing.

121
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,620
没什么比你醒着的时候做的事更囧的了
It can't be more embarrassing than what you do when you're awake.

122
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,390
我想到一个办法
Hey, I just got an idea.

123
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,800
你能来我家看我睡觉吗
Can you come over to my house and watch me sleep?

124
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,050
我也想  但是正在放《驱魔人》
I would, but The Exorcist is on,

125
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,050
{\an8}美国经典恐怖片

126
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,700
看它都没看你睡觉吓人
and watching that sounds a little less scary.

127
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,250
我能帮你弄到亚瑟小子演唱会的前排票
I can get you front-row seats to see Usher!

128
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,400
给我你家地址  钥匙  备好圣水
I'm gonna need your address, a key, and some holy water.

129
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,790
乔什  我给你做了点点心
Hey, Josh, I made you a little snack--

130
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,220
炸鸡配华夫饼
chicken and waffles.

131
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,310
不  谢谢  我不饿
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

132
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,850
你是问"枫糖浆在哪"吗
"Where's the maple syrup," you say?

133
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,220
我没问
I didn't say.

134
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,260
你这话是什么意思
What are you saying?

135
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,040
我是说糖浆在从佛蒙特州
I'm just saying the syrup's on the way over...

136
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,670
来这里的路上
from Vermont.

137
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,250
-你不是吧  -是的
- You didn't. - I did.

138
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,390
我给丹妮尔打了电话  她非常想见她妈妈
I called Danielle, and she really wants to see her mom.

139
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,160
我知道你让我别这么做  但这是对的
I know you told me not to, but it was the right thing to do.

140
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,260
-我必须这么做  -加比  取消见面
- I had to! - Gabi, call it off.

141
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,970
太晚了
Too late.

142
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,560
肖娜  能下来一下吗
Shauna, would you come down here, please?

143
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,710
你胆子真大  我明明说了不行
How dare you! I clearly said no.

144
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,620
都没别的话  就一句"不行"
There were no other words surrounding it. One word. "No."

145
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,100
吵什么呢
What's all the commotion?

146
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,510
肖娜  我希望你明白
Shauna, I want you to know

147
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,130
这件事跟我毫无关系
I had nothing to do with this.

148
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,160
你好  妈妈
Hi, mom.

149
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,880
天呐  丹妮
Oh my God! Dani!

150
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,320
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

151
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,110
她飞过整个美国
Well, she flew all the way across the country

152
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,250
就因为她想见你  对吗  丹妮尔
because she wanted to see you. Isn't that right, Danielle?

153
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,760
加比给我打电话的时候  我就决定来了
When Gabi called me, I jumped at the chance.

154
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,300
你想知道她为什么从不给你寄贺卡吗
And you wanna know why she never sent you any cards?

155
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,600
你说吧
Well, you tell her.

156
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,650
-因为...  -她非常想要独立
- It's-- it's-- - She really needed her independence,

157
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,110
但现在她意识到...  你说吧
but now she realizes that-- you tell her.

158
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,430
没有你的生活一点都不美妙
My life is nowhere near as good without you in it.

159
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,310
你能原谅我吗
Can you ever forgive me?

160
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,580
我能吗
Can I?

161
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,710
她能  她能
She can. She can.

162
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,100
乔什 看到没  跟你说这办法管用吧
See, Josh? I told you this would all work out.

163
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,890
要是你想帮我报销她的机票钱
Now, if you wanna pay me back for her plane ticket,

164
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,700
-就再好不过了  -糟了
- that would be really great. - Not cool.

165
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,070
出大事了  这简直是场灾难
This is totally not cool. This is a disaster.

166
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,020
真的吗  我们看到的是一回事吗
Seriously? Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

167
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,680
因为我看到的是一幅在我们面前
Because what I'm seeing is a beautiful mother-daughter reunion

168
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,170
母女重聚的温馨景象
happening right in front of us.

169
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,140
这种情况下会出什么问题啊
What could possibly be wrong with this picture?

170
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,640
她就是摩天轮女孩
That's ferris-wheel girl!

171
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,190
你确定那就是摩天轮女孩吗
Are you sure that's ferris-wheel girl?

172
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,920
那都是几年前的漆黑夜晚了
I mean, it was years ago in the dark.

173
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,910
"漆黑"吗  她整个人都是亮的
Dark? She was all lit up.

174
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,690
她身上一会红  一会蓝
Her body was red, then blue,

175
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,110
一会黄...  然后又变成红色的了
then yellow... then red again.

176
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,450
或许她不记得你了
Well, maybe she won't remember you.

177
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,130
得了吧  加比  是我哎
Come on, Gabi. It's me!

178
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,200
乔什  我太激动了
Josh, I'm so excited to say this,

179
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,030
认识一下我的女儿丹妮尔
meet my daughter Danielle.

180
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,430
你好  我叫乔什
Hi, I'm Josh.

181
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,190
很高兴见到你
Hey, nice to meet you.

182
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,120
我也很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you, too.

183
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,210
-这时候该来杯香槟  -好主意
- Well, this calls for champagne. - Great idea!

184
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,970
抱歉  丹妮  是安德森·库珀打来的
Oh! I'm sorry, Dani. It's Anderson Cooper.

185
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,910
要是不接他会发牢骚  我马上回来
He gets real whiny if you don't pick up. I'll be right back.

186
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,000
枫糖浆是吧
So... maple syrup, huh?

187
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,710
是的  也是机缘巧合  但挺适合我
Yeah, it's kinda random, but it suits me.

188
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,150
佛蒙特州
Vermont!

189
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,620
那里挺冷的  冬天冰天雪地
Pretty cold there. Gets kind of cold there in the winter.

190
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,750
是啊  冷得没办法在摩天轮上嘿咻
Yeah. Way to cold to have sex on a ferris wheel.

191
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,980
我就知道  我知道你记得我
I knew it! I knew you remembered me!

192
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,870
当然  谁忘得了  你一会红
Yeah, who could forget? You were red,

193
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,950
一会蓝  一会黄  然后又变成红色的了
then blue, then yellow, and then red again.

194
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,020
-香槟来了  -就是她  我说了吧
- Champagne is served. - It's her. I told you.

195
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,030
你是摩天轮女孩吗
You're ferris-wheel girl?

196
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,600
该死
Damn it!

197
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,130
看看你都做了些什么
Do you see what you did?

198
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,050
你都做了些什么
Do you see what you did

199
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,500
我叫你不要做你非要做的事情
when you did the thing I told you not to do?

200
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,000
要是你没做你不该做的事情
Well, if you didn't do the thing that you shouldn't have done,

201
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,630
那么我做的这事
then the thing I did

202
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,240
就会变成我该做的了
would've been the thing that I should've done!

203
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,010
我们现在怎么办
So what are we gonna do?

204
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,010
大家别吵了  好吗
Okay, everybody just shut up, all right?

205
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,170
今天是个宝贵的日子
This is a very precious day.

206
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,600
你知道你对他做了什么
You know what you did to him.

207
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,930
他知道他对你做了什么  关键是
He knows what he did to you. The important thing is

208
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,170
绝不能让你妈妈知道你们之间做的事
your mother can never find out what you did to each other.

209
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,080
你想让我欺骗肖娜吗
You want me to lie to Shauna?

210
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,350
我会很难受的
That puts me in a very uncomfortable position.

211
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,070
是吗  总不会比你们俩
Oh, really? Well, it can't be any more uncomfortable

212
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,770
在摩天轮上更难受了吧
than the position you guys were in on the ferris wheel!

213
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,870
加比  晚餐太美味了
Gabi, this dinner was absolutely delicious.

214
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,620
而且非常顺利
And completely uneventful.

215
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,690
妈妈  你发现
Mom, do you realize

216
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,950
这是三年来我俩第一次共进晚餐吗
this is the first dinner we've had together in three years?

217
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,730
-为了补偿失去的时光  -干杯
- To making up for lost time. - Cheers!

218
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,610
准备好  因为此时此刻
Well, get ready, 'cause now it's time

219
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,320
该是三年来你们俩第一次一起品尝甜品了
for the first dessert you've had together in three years.

220
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,460
我好高兴
I'm so happy.

221
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,350
没事的  肖娜  我来收拾吧
Oh, don't worry, Shauna. I've got it.

222
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,100
让我来吧  你为我做的已经太多了
I insist. You've done so much for me.

223
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,510
谢谢
Thanks.

224
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,010
这真是个奇迹
I mean, this is a miracle.

225
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,420
-一切都太顺利了  -我知道
- Things are going great. - I know.

226
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,110
-她什么都不知道  -太好了
- She doesn't have a clue. - Well, thank God.

227
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,960
-我真的很喜欢你妈妈  -是啊  她棒极了
- I really like your mom. - Yeah, she's great.

228
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,170
我真的很爱她
I love her... so much,

229
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,770
-还有  你知道吗  -知道什么
- and you know what? - What?

230
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,230
我也爱你
I love you, too.

231
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,320
自从我们在摩天轮上嘿咻以后
I've thought about you every single night

232
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,650
我每天晚上都在想着你
ever since we made love on that ferris wheel.

233
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,310
那幕一直在我脑海中转啊转
It just keeps going round and round in my mind,

234
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,640
-就像...  -就像摩天轮一样吗
- like a... - I don't know-- ferris wheel?

235
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,190
没错  就是这样
Yes! That's it!

236
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,950
你太懂我了
You totally get me,

237
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,710
如今我在这里
and now here I am,

238
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,040
坐在你身边  就像是...
sitting next to you. It's like...

239
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,220
命中注定
destiny!

240
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,140
-谁想去阳台上吃甜点  -我想  妈妈
- Who's ready for dessert on the terrace? - I am, mommy!

241
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,590
还有  能帮我做点热巧克力吗
Oh, and can you make some hot cocoa?

242
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,210
什么都行  亲爱的
Anything for you, darling.

243
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,960
她真是阴魂不散
I thought she'd never leave.

244
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,040
你是怎么了  简直像疯了一样
What is wrong with you? You're acting crazy!

245
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,960
不  我没有
No, I am not.

246
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,080
我只是好想在你脖子上种草莓
I just wanna bite your neck!

247
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,190
-我先出去了  -我也去
- I'll be outside! - We'll be outside!

248
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,790
时间刚刚好  甜品也准备好了
Perfect timing. I've got the dessert.

249
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,960
加比  麻烦大了
Gabi, we have a problem.

250
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,440
-丹妮尔爱上我了  -你怎么会这么想
- Danielle's in love with me. - What? Why would you think that?

251
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,890
她说了"我爱你"  一直爱着我
She said, "I love you," she's never stopped loving me...

252
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,860
-她想在我脖子上种草莓  -我明白了
- She wants to bite my neck. - I see what's going on here.

253
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,660
你只是不高兴我不按你说的做
You're just upset because I went against your wishes,

254
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,390
而一切又这么顺利  所以你无法接受
it all worked out, and you can't stand it.

255
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,590
加比  给丹妮尔冲热巧克力的水开了吗
Gabi, is the water warm yet for Danielle's cocoa?

256
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,030
一切都准备好了
Everything's ready to go.

257
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,700
给你
Here you go.

258
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,420
去吧  快去啊
Go! Go!

259
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,480
你忘了拿棉花糖
Oh, you forgot the marshmallows.

260
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,750
不不不  别走啊
No, no, no, no. Don't go.

261
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,000
你好啊
Hi.

262
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,390
你不能再这样了
Okay, look, this has to stop.

263
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,650
没错  你说得对
You're right. No, you're right.

264
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,230
我是来修复和妈妈的关系的
I came here to fix my relationship with my mother,

265
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,200
所以我们不能这样
so this can't happen.

266
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,500
-谢谢你  -但这个可以
- Thank you. - But this can.

267
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,410
天啊
Oh god!

268
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,760
真高兴能看到你跟丹妮尔重聚
I'm just so happy that you and Danielle are back together!

269
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,030
我也是  但你快把棉花糖挤坏了  亲爱的
Me too. You're smushing the marshmallows, darling.

270
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,560
原来你说的不是胸
Oh, the actual marshmallows.

271
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,630
你找到棉花糖了  真棒
Hey, you found the marshmallows. Awesome.

272
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,150
原来已经这么晚了  我得去演播室了
I just noticed the time. I've got to get down to the studio.

273
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,320
我今晚有节目
I'm on air tonight.

274
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,400
-乔什  你会帮我好好招待女儿的对吗  -不
- Josh, I trust you'll entertain my daughter while I'm out. - No!

275
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,040
我的意思是...  加比
I mean... Gabi?

276
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,250
我在想  既然你要工作
Uh, I was thinking, since you have to work,

277
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,250
或许丹妮尔今晚可以去我那  跟我住
maybe Danielle should come with me and spend the night at my place.

278
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,630
-这主意不错  -太棒了
- Great idea. - Yes.

279
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,920
不
No!

280
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,620
我只是不想太麻烦你们
I... just don't want to be any trouble.

281
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,430
真的吗
Really?

282
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,590
没事的  一点都不麻烦
I mean, yeah, that's no trouble at all.

283
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,520
对啊  你们女生好好去玩玩吧
Yeah, you girls run and have some fun.

284
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,940
见见帅哥什么的  去吧  亲爱的
Maybe meet some boys. Come on, darling.

285
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,260
你一直待在佛蒙特那种乡下地方
You've been stuck in the woods of Vermont.

286
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,100
有多久都没出去好好疯狂一番了
When was the last time you went and got crazy?

287
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,560
好了  咱们走
Okay, let's go.

288
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,680
我准备好了  来吧
Okay, let's do this.

289
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,890
老天  你这睡衣是什么做的
Oh my god! How did you make those pajamas?

290
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,700
剥了整间动物园的皮吗
Did you skin an entire zoo?

291
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,020
我也挺喜欢你的睡衣
I like your pajamas, too.

292
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,940
是跟芭比娃娃一起卖的  还是可以单买
Did it come with Barbie, or was it sold separately?

293
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,750
你睡的是哪张床
Which bed do you sleep in?

294
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,710
那是毛球的床
That's Fluffykins' bed.

295
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,330
他睡得比较晚  要等《法律与秩序》播完以后
He turns in late, after Law & Order.

296
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,250
你在做什么  我要你睡到床上来
What are you doing? I need you in the bed,

297
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,100
这样我才能假装有人睡在我身边
so I can simulate having a person next to me while I sleep.

298
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,220
我才不要跟你假装什么
I'm not simulating anything!

299
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,020
知道吗  老娘不干了
You know what? Forget this whole thing.

300
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,460
我给你弄到了亚瑟小子的票  我们说好了的
I got you tickets to Usher. We had a deal!

301
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,310
好吧  那我要用枕头堆座墙
Fine! But I'm building a pillow wall.

302
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,330
跟一个男人同床共枕却不能碰
Getting into bed with a man and not touching him.

303
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,560
就跟老娘当年结婚时一模一样
It's like I'm married all over again.

304
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,300
她在狂亲她老妈的男朋友
She was kissing all over her mother's boyfriend?

305
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,830
我在浪漫肥皂剧里看过这桥段
Ooh! I saw this on a telenovela once.

306
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,380
她是刚刚从昏迷中苏醒吗
Did she just come out of a coma?

307
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,750
小声点  我不想让她听见
I don't want her to hear.

308
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,430
别担心  她在洗澡呢
Don't worry about it. She's in the shower.

309
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,370
回来的这一路上
I mean, the whole way over here

310
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,540
我都在劝她  如果她要勾引乔什
I was trying to convince her that if she went for Josh,

311
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,640
就会彻底毁了她跟她老妈的关系
then she would ruin her relationship with her mother forever.

312
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,970
你知道她说什么吗
And you know what she said?

313
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,530
"乔什尝起来像棉花糖"
"Josh tastes like cotton candy!"

314
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,090
她还得在这待两天呢
I mean, she's here for two more days.

315
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,050
-我该怎么办  -不  你没时间了
- What am I gonna do? - Oh, no, no, you don't have two more days.

316
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,500
这疯女人随时都会爆发  你得赶紧弄走她
That crazy bomb is ticking. You need to get rid of her now.

317
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,380
或者  我可以
Or-- I mean, what if I pull out

318
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,730
把我和妈妈的相册拿给她看
all the photo albums of me and my mother, I mean,

319
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,620
让她明白什么是真正的母女关系
and show her what a real relationship looks like?

320
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,640
我觉得这是我妈妈会想让我做的
I feel like that's what my mom's telling me to do.

321
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,180
真的吗  你再好好听听
Really? Listen again.

322
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,330
因为我觉得她说的是
Because what I'm hearing is...

323
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,010
"赶紧把那疯婆子送去机场
"Drive that crazy bitch to the airport

324
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,680
让她坐飞机回佛蒙特去"
"and put her on a plane to Vermont."

325
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,470
知道吗  我还是去把相册拿出来
You know what? I think I'm gonna get out the photo albums,

326
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,510
这样等她洗完澡出来
so when she gets out of the shower,

327
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,860
-就可以...  -等等
- then she's-- - Wait, wait, wait, wait.

328
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,630
她在里面待了好久
She's been in there for forever.

329
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,050
热水应该二十分钟前就用光了
She should've run out of hot water 20 minutes ago.

330
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,920
天呐
Oh god!

331
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,120
天呐  天呐  天呐
Oh god! Oh god! Oh god!

332
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,170
或许你说的没错
Maybe my mom really was talking to you,

333
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,610
那疯婆子居然从浴室窗户里爬出去了
because that crazy bitch climbed out the bathroom window!

334
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,740
就跟浪漫肥皂剧里一样
Just like the telenovela.

335
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,290
不不不不
No, no, no, no, no!

336
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,620
不
No! No!

337
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,650
不不不不不
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

338
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,470
丹妮尔  停下
Danielle, stop!

339
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,780
就算你和乔什以前在摩天轮上嘿咻过
Just because you once had sex with Josh on a ferris wheel,

340
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,290
也不代表你现在能偷偷爬上他床啊
doesn't mean you can sneak into be with him now!

341
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,610
我可以解释
I can explain.

342
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:33,410
我让你不要把肖娜女儿接过来
I asked you not to fly Shauna's daughter out here,

343
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,170
但你接了
but you did.

344
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,930
本来没人会告诉肖娜
And no one was supposed to tell Shauna

345
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,580
我和她女儿上过床
that I had sex with her daughter,

346
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,760
但你说了
but you did.

347
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,640
或许会没事的呢
Maybe it's gonna be okay.

348
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,360
在度过最初的震惊期之后
I mean, after she gets over her initial shock,

349
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,970
肖娜会没事的
Shauna's gonna be fine.

350
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,170
乔什  和你一起的这两周真的很愉快
Josh, these two weeks have been some of the best times I've ever had,

351
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,960
我真是没想到结局会是这么羞辱  再见
and I never imagined it would come to such a humiliating end. Goodbye!

352
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,100
肖娜  等等
Shauna, wait.

353
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,440
我们都有过去
Look... we all have pasts.

354
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,700
重要的是我想和你在一起
The important thing is I wanna be with you.

355
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:06,910
不  你睡了我女儿
No, you had sex with my daughter!

356
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,980
你们美国人怎么说的来着
What's that thing all the Americans say?

357
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,780
对了  恶心
Oh yeah. Eww!

358
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,380
是丹妮尔的短信
Oh, it's Danielle.

359
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,540
"妈妈  枫糖厂出了急事  得回家了
"Mom, maple syrup emergency. Had to fly home.

360
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,600
见到你和乔什在一起真高兴
So thrilled about you and Josh, and...

361
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,430
喜欢看你幸福的样子  亲亲抱抱  丹妮尔"
I loved seeing you so happy. Kiss, hug, Danielle."

362
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,370
看到了吗  你和乔什她选了你
See? See? She chose you over Josh.

363
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,170
我做的很对
I did the right thing.

364
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,650
虽然可笑  但没错
I guess, in a funny way, you did.

365
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,380
再见  加比
Goodbye, Gabi.

366
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,120
再见  乔什
Goodbye, Josh.

367
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,660
我只抱没睡过我女儿的人
Hugs are for people who haven't slept with my daughter.

368
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:50,810
为什么
Why?

369
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,090
为什么  为什么
Why? Why?

370
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,230
为什么
Why? Why? Why?

371
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,650
为什么  为什么  为什么
Why? Why, why, why? Why?

372
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,300
为什么  你猜怎么着  不用回答
Why? You know what? Don't answer that question!

373
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,390
请你出去
Get out!

374
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,970
出去
Out!

375
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,570
埃兰  我想说"太阳晒屁股了"
Alan, I would say, "Rise and shine,"

376
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,370
可在我屁股上的不是太阳嘛
but it appears somebody already has.

377
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,720
我不是埃兰
I'm not Alan,

378
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,710
那是我的发卷
and that's one of my hair rollers!

379
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,760
尤兰达
Yolanda!

380
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,080
你该看着我睡觉的
You were supposed to be watching me,

381
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,500
不是沾我一身女人臭味
not getting your woman stink on me.

382
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,650
对不起  我就闭了一下眼
I'm sorry! I closed my eyes for one second,

383
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,150
{\an8}美国演员  身高仅152

384
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,150
然后就发现搂着亚洲版的丹尼·德维托醒来了
next thing I know, I woke up spooning an Asian Danny DeVito!

385
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,800
等等  所以你整晚都睡过去了吗
Wait, so you slept the whole night?

386
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,600
没看我干了什么吗
You didn't see me do anything?

387
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,350
放心  我们晚上都在睡觉
Oh, relax! We both slept through the night.

388
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,140
能发生什么奇怪的事
What's the weirdest thing that could've happened?

389
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,690
等等  你怎么会...
Wait. How did you get my--

390
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,230
你又怎么穿了...
And how did you manage to put on...

391
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,350
你怎么会来  一定不是好事
Why are you here? It can't be good.

392
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,550
加比  开门
Gabi, open the door.

393
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,800
首先  我要跟你说我真的对这一切
Okay, first, let me start by saying I'm really, really sorry

394
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,020
很抱歉  为了补偿你
about everything, and to make it up to you,

395
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,390
我做了你最喜欢的菜
I made your favorite dish.

396
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,540
-松露奶酪通心粉吗  -你第二喜欢的
- Truffle mac and cheese? - Your second favorite dish.

397
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,210
索菲亚打电话给我  我知道这周是你妈妈的生日
Sofia called me, and I know it was your mother's birthday this week.

398
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,140
这也就解释了你昨天的行为
And I think that explains your behavior yesterday.

399
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,950
但不包括其他天的
Not every other day.

400
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,740
我猜每年的这个时候我都很难受
I guess this time of year's really hard for me.

401
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,340
如果你想聊聊  我的门永远对你敞开
I want you to know my door's always open if you need to talk.

402
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,720
不是卧室门
Not my bedroom door.

403
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,040
在你说了那么多"为什么"以后
I guess after you said, "Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?",

404
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,730
让我也开始思考  为什么呢
it really made me think, "Why?"

405
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,100
然后我明白了我只是
And I realized I was just trying

406
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,400
想从丹妮尔和肖娜身上产生共鸣
to live vicariously through Danielle and Shauna.

407
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,350
觉得如果我能让她俩团聚  那...
I thought maybe if I could get them back together, then...

408
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,670
天啊  能再和妈妈团聚我干什么都可以
God, I would do anything to have one more moment with my mom.

409
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,390
我知道
I know...

410
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,070
所以这周剩下的时间我给你放假
which is why I'm giving you the rest of the week off

411
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,710
送你和索菲亚去玩一趟
and sending you and Sofia on a little trip.

412
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,760
什么  去哪里
What? Where are we going?

413
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,070
让我给你个小提示
Let me... give you a little hint.

414
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,030
史密森尼博物馆的茱莉亚·蔡尔德烹饪展吗
Julia Child's kitchen in the Smithsonian?

415
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,520
-妈妈一直想带我去的  -我知道
- My mom always wanted to take me here. - I know.

416
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,190
索菲亚已经帮你收好了行李  她在机场等我们
Sofia already packed your bags. She's meeting us at the airport.

417
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,330
等等  我毁了你的恋爱
Wait, wait, wait. I ruined your relationship,

418
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,540
你还要让我免费旅游吗
and you're sending me on a free trip?

419
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,160
我不该提这茬的
I should not have mentioned that.

420
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,660
至少让我给你为你做的芝士煎鸡排
At least let me give you the chicken parm that I made you.

421
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,540
芝士鸡排  前十都不是好吗
Chicken parm? Not even top 10.

422
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,390
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

423
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,280
还有件事
One more thing.

424
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,460
谢谢
Thank you.

425
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,360
艾略特  我有话要跟你说
Elliot, I have something to tell you.

426
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,150
-什么  -我在你身边睡不着
- What? - I've been having a hard time sleeping next to you.

427
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,240
好担心睡梦中会做什么事
I'm so worried that I might do something in my sleep

428
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,810
让你觉得我不性感了
and you won't think I'm sexy anymore.

429
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:16,880
-什么  -我知道
- What? - I know.

430
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,220
我这么玉树临风  怎么可能
With this moneymaker, that's crazy.

431
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,460
但万一呢
But what if?

432
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,220
你在担心这个吗
You've been worried about that?

433
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,840
我担心的也是这个
I've been worried about the same thing!

434
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,250
拜托  你有什么好担心的
Oh please. You don't know from worry.

435
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,040
我当然有  我担心到
I don't? I was so worried,

436
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,080
花钱让尤兰达看我睡觉
I paid Yolanda to watch me sleep.

437
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,650
你太贴心了
That's so sweet!

438
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,420
-你们做了什么奇怪的事吗  -没有
- Did you do anything weird? - No.

439
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,460
真是疯狂  谁在意我们怎么睡觉呢
This is crazy. Who cares what we do in our sleep?

440
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,100
我们可以做自己  我们那么相爱
We can be ourselves. We love each other.

441
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,570
-有吗  -我是的
- We do? - Well... I do.

442
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,220
我也是
I do too.

443
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,800
那就好  因为我有睡眠呼吸暂停症
Good, because I have sleep apnea.

444
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,910
晚安  亲爱的
Good night, sweetheart.

445
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,140
管它呢
Oh, who cares?

11
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,230
What's that smell? Is it garbage day?

12
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,840
No, I made breakfast.

13
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,300
Did you make it with garbage?

14
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,160
Since your mom passed away,

15
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,760
I know how hard it is for you on her birthday,

16
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,690
So I made you a feast of eggs, bacon and buttermilk pancakes!

17
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,050
That is so sweet.

18
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,220
Where are those things?

19
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,350
Also, I put $20

20
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,290
in the Julia Child Smithsonian trip jar

21
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,890
and if someone would stop taking quarters out of the jar,

22
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,490
we would finally be able to take that trip

23
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,140
you and your mom always dreamed about.

24
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,630
You hear that?

25
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,380
Mom just said you're the best friend ever.

26
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,160
Thank you, Mrs. Diamond.

27
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,260
What was that now?

28
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,630
Breakfast should be your most important meal of the day,

29
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,350
not your last.

30
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,110
I think she's a smart lady.

31
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,290
- Why don't I make you breakfast? - Oh, good idea.

32
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,420
Two organic eggs, toast, bacon extra crispy,

33
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,100
and tick-tock, 'cause I gotta get to work.

38
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,820
Gabi! More coffee!

39
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,410
I haven't slept in two days.

40
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,620
Sounds like somebody's getting lucky.

41
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,090
That puts the "nasty" in "doing the nasty."

42
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,030
Sex with Alan is wild.

43
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,610
I feel like Elliot, Queen of the Jungle.

44
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,880
Last night we did it in the craziest place...

45
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,960
the bedroom floor.

46
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,280
Oh please, I've done it on the floor

47
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,070
of Bed, Bath & Beyond.

48
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,590
I went in with a 20% off coupon,

49
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,860
and got 100% off.

50
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,810
So...

51
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,390
Before my amazing girlfriend comes down, I need your help.

52
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,520
Shauna is being honored

53
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,600
by the San Francisco Journalists Association,

54
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,970
and I need to think of an awesome gift.

55
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,550
Oh, and...

56
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,390
ferris wheel.

57
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,200
Oh, look at me.

58
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,370
I'm rich. I can buy a ferris wheel.

59
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,950
I was talking about the craziest place I ever had sex.

60
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,570
In a ferris wheel

61
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,180
at a wedding with a carnival theme.

62
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,230
Beat that.

63
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,950
I can.

64
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,470
My daughter's seventh birthday

65
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,920
in the bouncy castle

66
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,160
with the clown.

67
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,460
It turns out noses aren't

68
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,640
the only thing clowns like to honk.

69
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,460
Kids, clowns, hetero sex--

70
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,870
there's nothing for me here.

71
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,220
You have another kid... besides Brett?

72
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,490
Yeah, Danielle, she's 25.

73
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,590
Two kids.

74
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,190
Is that it?

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,010
I don't talk about Danielle that often.

76
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,590
Unfortunately, we haven't spoken in years.

77
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,770
What? A mother-daughter not close? What happened?

78
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,800
Gabi, sounds like it's kind of a private thing.

79
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,260
Yeah, yeah, that's why I'm asking.

80
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,640
It's okay, Josh.

81
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,770
I was a child myself when I had her.

82
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,520
And if I'm truthful, I think we're just too much alike.

83
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,910
Now can we talk about breakfast?

84
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,380
Yes. Would you like eggs?

85
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,280
And do you at least send each other Christmas cards?

86
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,730
Well, I do. I just-- I never get one back.

87
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,660
Not even an E-card?

88
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,710
But they're free.

89
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,340
Last I heard,

90
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,270
she was making artisanal maple syrup in Vermont.

91
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,080
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to go cry in my car.

92
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,830
- Shauna! - I'm just kidding. A driver's picking me up.

93
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,690
I'm gonna cry in his car.

94
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,380
Hey, you know what a great gift for Shauna would be?

95
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,310
A therapist... thanks to you.

96
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,000
No. Get her and her daughter back together.

97
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,740
No, that's Shauna's personal business.

98
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,060
- It's not my place to get involved. - Yeah, that's why

99
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,140
it would be such a great surprise-- she'd never see it coming.

100
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,610
Every mother and daughter want to be close.

101
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,090
Come on, Josh, trust me.

102
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,380
Trust you? No.

103
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,540
- But-- - No!

104
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,440
- Is that a firm-- - Yes!

105
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,750
- So that's a yes! - No!

106
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,320
No!

107
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,550
No.

108
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,290
- Just-- - No.

109
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,220
Okay.

110
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,680
Oh my damn.

111
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,930
A pig in a blanket.

113
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,430
I don't know what happened.

114
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,680
I came to get Josh's tux for the cleaner's,

115
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,820
I smelled his pillow, and the next thing I know--

116
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,930
Okay, night-night.

117
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,560
Okay, baby, something definitely isn't right.

118
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,930
Come on. I don't usually put you down for your nap until 4:00.

119
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,520
I spent my first weekend at Alan's place and couldn't sleep,

120
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,970
'cause I was afraid I might do something embarrassing.

121
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,620
It can't be more embarrassing than what you do when you're awake.

122
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,390
Hey, I just got an idea.

123
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,800
Can you come over to my house and watch me sleep?

124
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,050
I would, but The Exorcist is on,

126
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,700
and watching that sounds a little less scary.

127
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,250
I can get you front-row seats to see Usher!

128
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,400
I'm gonna need your address, a key, and some holy water.

129
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,790
Hey, Josh, I made you a little snack--

130
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,220
chicken and waffles.

131
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,310
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

132
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,850
"Where's the maple syrup," you say?

133
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,220
I didn't say.

134
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,260
What are you saying?

135
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,040
I'm just saying the syrup's on the way over...

136
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,670
from Vermont.

137
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,250
- You didn't. - I did.

138
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,390
I called Danielle, and she really wants to see her mom.

139
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,160
I know you told me not to, but it was the right thing to do.

140
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,260
- I had to! - Gabi, call it off.

141
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,970
Too late.

142
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,560
Shauna, would you come down here, please?

143
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,710
How dare you! I clearly said no.

144
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,620
There were no other words surrounding it. One word. "No."

145
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,100
What's all the commotion?

146
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,510
Shauna, I want you to know

147
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,130
I had nothing to do with this.

148
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,160
Hi, mom.

149
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,880
Oh my God! Dani!

150
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,320
What are you doing here?

151
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,110
Well, she flew all the way across the country

152
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,250
because she wanted to see you. Isn't that right, Danielle?

153
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,760
When Gabi called me, I jumped at the chance.

154
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,300
And you wanna know why she never sent you any cards?

155
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,600
Well, you tell her.

156
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,650
- It's-- it's-- - She really needed her independence,

157
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,110
but now she realizes that-- you tell her.

158
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,430
My life is nowhere near as good without you in it.

159
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,310
Can you ever forgive me?

160
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,580
Can I?

161
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,710
She can. She can.

162
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,100
See, Josh? I told you this would all work out.

163
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,890
Now, if you wanna pay me back for her plane ticket,

164
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,700
- that would be really great. - Not cool.

165
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,070
This is totally not cool. This is a disaster.

166
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,020
Seriously? Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

167
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,680
Because what I'm seeing is a beautiful mother-daughter reunion

168
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,170
happening right in front of us.

169
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,140
What could possibly be wrong with this picture?

170
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,640
That's ferris-wheel girl!

171
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,190
Are you sure that's ferris-wheel girl?

172
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,920
I mean, it was years ago in the dark.

173
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,910
Dark? She was all lit up.

174
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,690
Her body was red, then blue,

175
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,110
then yellow... then red again.

176
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,450
Well, maybe she won't remember you.

177
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,130
Come on, Gabi. It's me!

178
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,200
Josh, I'm so excited to say this,

179
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,030
meet my daughter Danielle.

180
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,430
Hi, I'm Josh.

181
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,190
Hey, nice to meet you.

182
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,120
Nice to meet you, too.

183
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,210
- Well, this calls for champagne. - Great idea!

184
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,970
Oh! I'm sorry, Dani. It's Anderson Cooper.

185
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,910
He gets real whiny if you don't pick up. I'll be right back.

186
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,000
So... maple syrup, huh?

187
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,710
Yeah, it's kinda random, but it suits me.

188
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,150
Vermont!

189
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,620
Pretty cold there. Gets kind of cold there in the winter.

190
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,750
Yeah. Way to cold to have sex on a ferris wheel.

191
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,980
I knew it! I knew you remembered me!

192
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,870
Yeah, who could forget? You were red,

193
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,950
then blue, then yellow, and then red again.

194
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,020
- Champagne is served. - It's her. I told you.

195
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,030
You're ferris-wheel girl?

196
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,600
Damn it!

197
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,130
Do you see what you did?

198
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,050
Do you see what you did

199
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,500
when you did the thing I told you not to do?

200
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,000
Well, if you didn't do the thing that you shouldn't have done,

201
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,630
then the thing I did

202
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,240
would've been the thing that I should've done!

203
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,010
So what are we gonna do?

204
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,010
Okay, everybody just shut up, all right?

205
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,170
This is a very precious day.

206
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,600
You know what you did to him.

207
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,930
He knows what he did to you. The important thing is

208
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,170
your mother can never find out what you did to each other.

209
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,080
You want me to lie to Shauna?

210
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,350
That puts me in a very uncomfortable position.

211
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,070
Oh, really? Well, it can't be any more uncomfortable

212
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,770
than the position you guys were in on the ferris wheel!

213
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,870
Gabi, this dinner was absolutely delicious.

214
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,620
And completely uneventful.

215
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,690
Mom, do you realize

216
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,950
this is the first dinner we've had together in three years?

217
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,730
- To making up for lost time. - Cheers!

218
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,610
Well, get ready, 'cause now it's time

219
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,320
for the first dessert you've had together in three years.

220
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,460
I'm so happy.

221
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,350
Oh, don't worry, Shauna. I've got it.

222
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,100
I insist. You've done so much for me.

223
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,510
Thanks.

224
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,010
I mean, this is a miracle.

225
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,420
- Things are going great. - I know.

226
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,110
- She doesn't have a clue. - Well, thank God.

227
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,960
- I really like your mom. - Yeah, she's great.

228
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,170
I love her... so much,

229
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,770
- and you know what? - What?

230
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,230
I love you, too.

231
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,320
I've thought about you every single night

232
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,650
ever since we made love on that ferris wheel.

233
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,310
It just keeps going round and round in my mind,

234
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,640
- like a... - I don't know-- ferris wheel?

235
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,190
Yes! That's it!

236
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,950
You totally get me,

237
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,710
and now here I am,

238
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,040
sitting next to you. It's like...

239
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,220
destiny!

240
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,140
- Who's ready for dessert on the terrace? - I am, mommy!

241
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,590
Oh, and can you make some hot cocoa?

242
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,210
Anything for you, darling.

243
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,960
I thought she'd never leave.

244
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,040
What is wrong with you? You're acting crazy!

245
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,960
No, I am not.

246
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,080
I just wanna bite your neck!

247
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,190
- I'll be outside! - We'll be outside!

248
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,790
Perfect timing. I've got the dessert.

249
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,960
Gabi, we have a problem.

250
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,440
- Danielle's in love with me. - What? Why would you think that?

251
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,890
She said, "I love you," she's never stopped loving me...

252
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,860
- She wants to bite my neck. - I see what's going on here.

253
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,660
You're just upset because I went against your wishes,

254
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,390
it all worked out, and you can't stand it.

255
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,590
Gabi, is the water warm yet for Danielle's cocoa?

256
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,030
Everything's ready to go.

257
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,700
Here you go.

258
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,420
Go! Go!

259
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,480
Oh, you forgot the marshmallows.

260
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,750
No, no, no, no. Don't go.

261
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,000
Hi.

262
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,390
Okay, look, this has to stop.

263
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,650
You're right. No, you're right.

264
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,230
I came here to fix my relationship with my mother,

265
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,200
so this can't happen.

266
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,500
- Thank you. - But this can.

267
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,410
Oh god!

268
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,760
I'm just so happy that you and Danielle are back together!

269
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,030
Me too. You're smushing the marshmallows, darling.

270
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,560
Oh, the actual marshmallows.

271
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,630
Hey, you found the marshmallows. Awesome.

272
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,150
I just noticed the time. I've got to get down to the studio.

273
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,320
I'm on air tonight.

274
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,400
- Josh, I trust you'll entertain my daughter while I'm out. - No!

275
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,040
I mean... Gabi?

276
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,250
Uh, I was thinking, since you have to work,

277
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,250
maybe Danielle should come with me and spend the night at my place.

278
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,630
- Great idea. - Yes.

279
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,920
No!

280
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,620
I... just don't want to be any trouble.

281
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,430
Really?

282
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,590
I mean, yeah, that's no trouble at all.

283
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,520
Yeah, you girls run and have some fun.

284
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,940
Maybe meet some boys. Come on, darling.

285
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,260
You've been stuck in the woods of Vermont.

286
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,100
When was the last time you went and got crazy?

287
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,560
Okay, let's go.

288
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,680
Okay, let's do this.

289
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,890
Oh my god! How did you make those pajamas?

290
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,700
Did you skin an entire zoo?

291
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,020
I like your pajamas, too.

292
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,940
Did it come with Barbie, or was it sold separately?

293
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,750
Which bed do you sleep in?

294
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,710
That's Fluffykins' bed.

295
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,330
He turns in late, after Law & Order.

296
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,250
What are you doing? I need you in the bed,

297
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,100
so I can simulate having a person next to me while I sleep.

298
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,220
I'm not simulating anything!

299
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,020
You know what? Forget this whole thing.

300
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,460
I got you tickets to Usher. We had a deal!

301
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,310
Fine! But I'm building a pillow wall.

302
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,330
Getting into bed with a man and not touching him.

303
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,560
It's like I'm married all over again.

304
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,300
She was kissing all over her mother's boyfriend?

305
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,830
Ooh! I saw this on a telenovela once.

306
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,380
Did she just come out of a coma?

307
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,750
I don't want her to hear.

308
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,430
Don't worry about it. She's in the shower.

309
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,370
I mean, the whole way over here

310
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,540
I was trying to convince her that if she went for Josh,

311
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,640
then she would ruin her relationship with her mother forever.

312
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,970
And you know what she said?

313
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,530
"Josh tastes like cotton candy!"

314
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,090
I mean, she's here for two more days.

315
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,050
- What am I gonna do? - Oh, no, no, you don't have two more days.

316
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,500
That crazy bomb is ticking. You need to get rid of her now.

317
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,380
Or-- I mean, what if I pull out

318
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,730
all the photo albums of me and my mother, I mean,

319
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,620
and show her what a real relationship looks like?

320
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,640
I feel like that's what my mom's telling me to do.

321
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,180
Really? Listen again.

322
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,330
Because what I'm hearing is...

323
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,010
"Drive that crazy bitch to the airport

324
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,680
"and put her on a plane to Vermont."

325
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,470
You know what? I think I'm gonna get out the photo albums,

326
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,510
so when she gets out of the shower,

327
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,860
- then she's-- - Wait, wait, wait, wait.

328
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,630
She's been in there for forever.

329
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,050
She should've run out of hot water 20 minutes ago.

330
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,920
Oh god!

331
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,120
Oh god! Oh god! Oh god!

332
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,170
Maybe my mom really was talking to you,

333
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,610
because that crazy bitch climbed out the bathroom window!

334
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,740
Just like the telenovela.

335
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,290
No, no, no, no, no!

336
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,620
No! No!

337
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,650
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

338
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,470
Danielle, stop!

339
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,780
Just because you once had sex with Josh on a ferris wheel,

340
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,290
doesn't mean you can sneak into be with him now!

341
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,610
I can explain.

342
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:33,410
I asked you not to fly Shauna's daughter out here,

343
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,170
but you did.

344
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,930
And no one was supposed to tell Shauna

345
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,580
that I had sex with her daughter,

346
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,760
but you did.

347
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,640
Maybe it's gonna be okay.

348
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,360
I mean, after she gets over her initial shock,

349
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,970
Shauna's gonna be fine.

350
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,170
Josh, these two weeks have been some of the best times I've ever had,

351
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,960
and I never imagined it would come to such a humiliating end. Goodbye!

352
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,100
Shauna, wait.

353
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,440
Look... we all have pasts.

354
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,700
The important thing is I wanna be with you.

355
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:06,910
No, you had sex with my daughter!

356
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,980
What's that thing all the Americans say?

357
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,780
Oh yeah. Eww!

358
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,380
Oh, it's Danielle.

359
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,540
"Mom, maple syrup emergency. Had to fly home.

360
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,600
So thrilled about you and Josh, and...

361
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,430
I loved seeing you so happy. Kiss, hug, Danielle."

362
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,370
See? See? She chose you over Josh.

363
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,170
I did the right thing.

364
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,650
I guess, in a funny way, you did.

365
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,380
Goodbye, Gabi.

366
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,120
Goodbye, Josh.

367
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,660
Hugs are for people who haven't slept with my daughter.

368
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:50,810
Why?

369
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,090
Why? Why?

370
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,230
Why? Why? Why?

371
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,650
Why? Why, why, why? Why?

372
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,300
Why? You know what? Don't answer that question!

373
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,390
Get out!

374
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,970
Out!

375
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,570
Alan, I would say, "Rise and shine,"

376
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,370
but it appears somebody already has.

377
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,720
I'm not Alan,

378
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,710
and that's one of my hair rollers!

379
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,760
Yolanda!

380
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,080
You were supposed to be watching me,

381
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,500
not getting your woman stink on me.

382
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,650
I'm sorry! I closed my eyes for one second,

384
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,150
next thing I know, I woke up spooning an Asian Danny DeVito!

385
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,800
Wait, so you slept the whole night?

386
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,600
You didn't see me do anything?

387
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,350
Oh, relax! We both slept through the night.

388
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,140
What's the weirdest thing that could've happened?

389
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,690
Wait. How did you get my--

390
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,230
And how did you manage to put on...

391
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,350
Why are you here? It can't be good.

392
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,550
Gabi, open the door.

393
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Okay, first, let me start by saying I'm really, really sorry

394
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,020
about everything, and to make it up to you,

395
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,390
I made your favorite dish.

396
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,540
- Truffle mac and cheese? - Your second favorite dish.

397
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,210
Sofia called me, and I know it was your mother's birthday this week.

398
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,140
And I think that explains your behavior yesterday.

399
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,950
Not every other day.

400
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,740
I guess this time of year's really hard for me.

401
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,340
I want you to know my door's always open if you need to talk.

402
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,720
Not my bedroom door.

403
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,040
I guess after you said, "Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?",

404
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,730
it really made me think, "Why?"

405
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,100
And I realized I was just trying

406
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,400
to live vicariously through Danielle and Shauna.

407
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,350
I thought maybe if I could get them back together, then...

408
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,670
God, I would do anything to have one more moment with my mom.

409
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,390
I know...

410
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,070
which is why I'm giving you the rest of the week off

411
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,710
and sending you and Sofia on a little trip.

412
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,760
What? Where are we going?

413
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,070
Let me... give you a little hint.

414
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,030
Julia Child's kitchen in the Smithsonian?

415
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,520
- My mom always wanted to take me here. - I know.

416
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,190
Sofia already packed your bags. She's meeting us at the airport.

417
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,330
Wait, wait, wait. I ruined your relationship,

418
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,540
and you're sending me on a free trip?

419
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,160
I should not have mentioned that.

420
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,660
At least let me give you the chicken parm that I made you.

421
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,540
Chicken parm? Not even top 10.

422
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,390
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

423
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,280
One more thing.

424
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,460
Thank you.

425
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,360
Elliot, I have something to tell you.

426
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,150
- What? - I've been having a hard time sleeping next to you.

427
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,240
I'm so worried that I might do something in my sleep

428
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,810
and you won't think I'm sexy anymore.

429
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:16,880
- What? - I know.

430
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,220
With this moneymaker, that's crazy.

431
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,460
But what if?

432
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,220
You've been worried about that?

433
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,840
I've been worried about the same thing!

434
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,250
Oh please. You don't know from worry.

435
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,040
I don't? I was so worried,

436
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,080
I paid Yolanda to watch me sleep.

437
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,650
That's so sweet!

438
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,420
- Did you do anything weird? - No.

439
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,460
This is crazy. Who cares what we do in our sleep?

440
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,100
We can be ourselves. We love each other.

441
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,570
- We do? - Well... I do.

442
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,220
I do too.

443
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,800
Good, because I have sleep apnea.

444
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,910
Good night, sweetheart.

445
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,140
Oh, who cares?

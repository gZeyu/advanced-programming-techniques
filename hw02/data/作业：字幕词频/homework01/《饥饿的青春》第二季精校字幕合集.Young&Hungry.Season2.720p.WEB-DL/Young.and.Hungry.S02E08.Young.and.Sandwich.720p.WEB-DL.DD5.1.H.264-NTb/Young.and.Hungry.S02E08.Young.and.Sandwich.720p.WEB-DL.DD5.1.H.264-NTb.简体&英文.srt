你过去一年里才约了三次会

25
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,930
还找了个理由讨厌他们所有人
and you found a reason to hate all of them.

26
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,490
不是那样的
That's not true!

27
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,940
你记得超棒先生吗

你也不喜欢瑞克
Okay, well, then you didn't like Rick

33
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,120
因为他给i上加点时画的是气泡
because he dotted his I's with a bubble.

34
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,200
他还用翻盖手机
And he had a flip phone.

35
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,740
我们是野人吗
What are we, cavemen?

36
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,690
听着
Okay, listen...

37
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,590
亲爱的  你想过也许你太挑剔了吗
Sweetie, did you ever think maybe you're just a little too picky?

38
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,820
不
No!

39
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,480
你只是不懂
Look, you just don't get it,

40
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,750
因为你有超级库珀熊
because you have a super Cooper bear.

41
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,330
是啊  所以我才一直催促你
Yeah, and that's why I'm pushing you so hard.

42
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,970
我也希望你拥有超棒的其他熊熊
I want you to have a super significant other bear.

43
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,570
不可能的
Well, it ain't gonna happen,

44
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,580
因为所有完美男人都有主了

45
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,250
我遇到了完美的男人

在"你好丘比特"的一池帅哥中遇见的
In the pool of hotties on "Heycupid."

50
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,840
那是一款约会应用
It's a dating app

51
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,250
你可以拿起手机
where you hold your phone up

52
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,820
如果附近有人喜欢你的资料...
and if a guy nearby likes your profile...

53
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,450
现在我有了马可
Now I have Marco.

54
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,660
他是个炫酷型男  开了一家精品肉店
He's cool, sexy, and owns a gourmet butcher shop.

55
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,350
索菲亚很久没吃到"好肉"了
Sofia hasn't had a good piece of meat in a while.

56
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,050
我们今晚要进行第二次约会了
So, uh, we're going on our second date tonight,

57

妹子  我真高兴搬到了你们隔壁

60
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,230
-索菲亚  -别说

61
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,760
我不会用那款应用
I'm not using that app.

62
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,340
世界上的男人们  你们有过机会
Men of the world, you've had your chance.

63
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,730

我还以为她忙着
I thought she'd be too busy

78
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,960
用斑点狗皮做外套
making coats out of dalmatian puppies

79
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,220
来再次结婚呢

等等  乔什知道吗
Wait, does Josh know?

81
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,110
你觉得我为啥要藏起他的笔记本
Why do you think I'm hiding his laptop

82
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,360
智能手机
his smartphone...

83
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,150
还有这个震动的玩意儿
and whatever this vibrating thing is?

84
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,480
尤兰达刚告诉我卡洛琳订婚了吗
Yolanda just told me Caroline's engaged?

85
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,680

听着  乔什
Listen, Josh,

87
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,750
卡洛琳订婚了
just because Caroline is engaged

88
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,460
并不意味着你应该垂头丧气
doesn't mean you need to go start feeling all bad about yourself.

89
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,290
我没啊

告诉你一下  乔什

各位  我为卡洛琳感到高兴

We weren't meant to be together. It's all good.

96

你没必要为了我们逞英雄  大个儿
You don't need to be brave for us, big guy.

我不用抱抱
I don't need to go in.

99
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,750
我没事
I'm good.

100
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,130
-我能告诉你一个秘密吗  -什么
- Can I tell you a secret? - What?

101
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,960
如果他胖了  我不会爱他
If he got fat, wouldn love him.

102
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,270
艾略特  你能帮我拿一下手机吗
Oh, Elliot, can you grab my phone?

103
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,020
我在忙着做饺子
I'm elbow-deep in dumplings.

104
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,270
我在忙着"我不在乎"
I'm elbow-deep in "I don't care."

105
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,950
拜托  我给索菲亚编了假约会档案
Please, I made Sofia a fake dating profile

106
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,850
每次它叮的一声  就说明她有了对象
and everytime it dings, it means she got a match.

107
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,100
你不想看看吗
Don't you want to see?

108
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,440
那男人没穿上衣吗
Are the guys shirtless?

109
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,830
-穿了  -那就不要
- No. - Then no.

110
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,290
该死
Shoot.

111
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,190

116
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,220
艾略特  看来我们有对象了
Elliot, it looks like we have a match.

117
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,470
你知道从统计学角度而言
Did you know, statistically,

118
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,870
手机比马桶还要脏吗
cellphones are dirtier than toilet seats?

119
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,780
不知道  失陪了  我要去卫生间
I did not. Excuse me, I'll be in the bathroom,

120
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,420
把脸擦烂为止
scrubbing my face till I bleed.

121
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,110
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

122
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,890
马可要带我去吃午餐
Marco's taking me to lunch,

123
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,340
我打算扮嫩
and I'm trying to look young.

124
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,030
他要在20年前接你吗
Is he picking you up 20 years ago?

125
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,180
我要去补妆
I'm gonna go touch-up my makeup.

126
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,330
乔什的滚漆筒在洗衣间
Josh's paint roller is in the laundry room.

127

128
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,820
艾略特
Elliot?

129
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,020
马可
Marco?

130
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,550
你就是跟尤兰达约会的马可吗
You're the Marco that's going out with Yolanda?

131
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,010
但你以前跟男人约会
But you used to date men,

132
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,140
我说的男人  是指我
and by men, I mean me.

133
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,320
好吧  这有点尴尬了
Okay, this just got a little weird.

134
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,690
麦当娜演唱会后我就没见过你
I haven't seen you since the Madonna concert.

135
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,180
你不该在那里甩了我
That was a terrible place to dump me.

136
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,820
之后我再也听不下去她的歌了
I haven't been able to listen to her music since.

137
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,420
亲爱的  没人能听
Honey, no one has.

138
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,020
艾略特
Oh, Elliot,

144
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,880
马可  你真的不觉得"走后门"
Marco, are you sure you wouldn't be more comfortable

145
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,260
更舒服吗
using the back door?

146
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,530
我们午饭吃什么呢  宝贝
So... what are we thinking for lunch, babe?

147
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,250
泰国菜  意大利菜
Thai? Italian?

148
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,820
为什么不尝尝韩国菜[韩国人]
Why don't you try Korean?

149
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,530
等等
Oh, wait.

150
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,920
你"尝"过
You have.

151
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,980
鲁本  这没什么大不了的  好吗
Ruben, this is not a big deal. Okay?

152
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,250
你只要告诉索菲亚
You've just got to tell Sofia

153
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,180
你是我男朋友库珀的朋友
that you're a friend of my boyfriend, Cooper.

154
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,040
我跟这位库珀关系多好呢
How tight am I with this Cooper?

155
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,680
我们互相给对方起昵称了吗
I mean, do we have nicknames for each other?

156
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,410
这家伙会给我捐肾吗
Would the guy give me a kidney?

157
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,730
什么  你为什么需要肾
Why? Why do you need a kidney?

158
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,090
你的档案里没写啊
That was not in your profile.

159
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,400
听着  我觉得你的室友真的很可爱
Look, look, I think your roommate is really cute,

160
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,960
只不过我不太想撒谎
but I'm just not comfortable lying.

161
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,320
索菲亚
Sofia!

162
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,230
突然之间  我觉得无妨
And suddenly, I'm comfortable.

163
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,840
你真人比小库在公司给我...
You're even prettier than your piure...

164
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,560
看的照片更漂亮...
that Coop showed me at work

165
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,020
而且我不需要肾
where I don't need a kidney.

166
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,400
好吧  你也是技术男吧
O...kay. So you're in tech.

167
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,070
你是说科...技吗
Tech...nology?

168
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,660
他以前是  但现在不是了
He was, but now he's not.

169
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,790
对  我改行了
Yeah, I had a career change.

170
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,220
我在一家做三明治的公司上班
I work for an establishment that makes sandwiches.

171
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,140
叫做萨明治
It's called Sammich's.

172
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,280
你听说过吗
You heard of it?

173
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,520
快餐店嘛  听说过
Fast food, yes.

174
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,930
你有没有听说过有人得先走
Have you ever heard of someone having to leave a date early

175
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,650
因为她另有约呢
because she has an appointment?

176
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,430
-那人就是我  -索菲亚
- This is that. - Sofia.

177
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,600
我作为一名市场助理分管其中五家门店
I cover five of their franchises as a marketing associate.

178
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,380
我可以重新安排
I can reschedule.

179
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,630
当然
Yeah, you can.

180
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,060
库库跟我说你很聪明
You know, Coopster told me you were smart,

181
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,910
有趣  并且貌美如花
funny, and gorgeous.

182
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,150
要我说
If you ask me,

183
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,280
他所言非虚并且有过之无不及
he under-promised and over-delivered.

184
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,580
满嘴营销套话
Marketing speak.

185
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,220
加比  我刚想起来你另有约
Gabi, I just remembered that you have to leave early

186
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,230
你得先走
because you have an appointment.

187
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,990
-我没有啊  -你有
- No, I don't. - You do!

188
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
好吧
Okay.

189
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,210
早安  我最好的美女朋友
Good morning, my beautiful best friend.

190
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,450
在喝咖啡前说"早安"
Well, "good morning" before coffee?

191
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,480
看来某人的室友
It looks like somebody has a roommate

192
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,260
为她找到了真命天子
that found her the perfect guy!

193
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,570
小声点  他就在里面
Shh! He's in there right now.

194
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,270
不得了啊  妹子
Damn, girl.

195
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,840
弥补之前浪费的时光
Way to make up for lost time.

196
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,300
你的腿酸吗
Was it like riding a bicycle

197
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,490
还是像骑了环法车赛那么酸
or was it like riding a bicycle a whole bunch of times?

198
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,420
没有  我们就聊了聊天
No, all we did was talk.

199
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,060
光着身子吗
Naked?

200
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,480
没有  你知道我很保守的
No, you know I'm old fashioned.

201
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,870
至少得到第七次约会才能上床
Booty's gotta wait till at least the seventh date.

202
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:19,850
但他太优秀了  而且人又好又有志向
Ugh, but he is so amazing and sweet and ambitious.

203
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,910
另外  在他睡觉的时候我查了下他背景
Plus, I did a background check while he was sleeping.

204
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,330
没有前科
No priors.

205
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,540
没留尿样吗  你的要求放宽了
No urine sample? You're slipping.

206
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,550
总之  我要去洗澡了
Well, anyway, I'm gonna shower

207
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,490
因为他说他得去上班了
because he says he has to leave for work,

208
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,120
穿西装上班
where he wears a suit.

209
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,180
我终于和西装男约会了
I'm finally dating a guy who wears a suit!

210
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,180
加油加比  加油加比
Go Gabi, go Gabi.

211
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,900
鲁本
Hey, Ruben.

212
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,800
我以为你去上班了
I thought you left for work.

213
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,710
我没去
I did not.

214
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,260
该你说了
Your turn.

215
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,810
你是说穿着这一身吗
You mean this?

216
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,050
我穿这身是去上班的
I wear this for work.

217
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,080
索菲亚说你穿西装[套装]上班
Sofia said you wore a suit to work.

218
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,570
没错
I do.

219
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,340
火腿奶酪三明治套装
A ham and cheese sandwich suit.

220
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,790
什么
What?

221
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,300
什么情况
I mean, what?

222
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,430
穿成那样在萨明治店上班
You know, for Sammich's.

223
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,720
我就是萨明治店的吉祥物萨米
I'm Sammy the Sammich.

224
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,430
我的布偶服在车里
My costume's in the car.

225
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,170
天呐  我把索菲亚介绍给了一个三明治
Oh my God, I set Sofia up with a sandwich but--

226
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,880
等等  你说你是做市场营销的
Wait, you said you were in marketing.

227
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,510
人们看到我跳舞  然后来买三明治  
Well, people see me dance, and they buy a sandwich--

228
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,630
市场营销
Marketing.

229
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:20,900
天呐
Oh my God.

230
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,460
这比用翻盖手机还差劲
This is so much worse than having a flip phone.

231
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,160
所以我不在初次约会的时候就说实情
That's why I don't tell girls on the first date.

232
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,910
她们会以工作取人
They can be a little judgy.

233
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,370
你是吉祥物好吗
Yeah, well, you are a Sammich.

234
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,590
要是索菲亚知道了  绝不会再跟你约会的
And if Sofia finds out, she is never gonna go out with you again.

235
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,580
我真的很喜欢她
I really like her.

236
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,580
我知道  我是她最好的朋友
I know, and I'm her best friend,

237
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,120
这个身份我想继续保持下去
and I want to continue to be,

238
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,190
所以你不能告诉她实情
so you just can't tell her.

239
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,110
好吗  向我保证
Okay? Promise me.

240
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,070
-好  -好  握手为誓
- Okay, yeah. - All right, shake on it!

241
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,620
天呐  我都做了什么
Oh God, what have I done?

242
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,560
天呐  我得删了这个应用
Oh, man. I've gotta delete this app.

243
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,110
给索菲亚介绍对象是我有过的最糟的主意
Setting up Sofia was the worst idea I've ever had.

244
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,340
你怎么知道呢
How would you know?

245
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,840
你都没有想出过一个好主意来进行比较
Don't you need to have a good idea to compare it to?

246
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,290
你知道吗  没关系的
You know what? It's fine.

247
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,010
一切都会好起来的
It'll be okay.

248
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,510
她会在他身上找到讨厌的地方
She'll find something about him that she hates,

249
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,930
然后她会在发现他是个三明治并跟我
and then she'll dump him before she finds out

250
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,800
绝交之前就甩了他的
he's a sandwich and dumps me.

251
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,540
加比
Ugh, Gabi!

252
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,810
别再发牢骚了
Enough with the incessant whining.

253
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:22,820
乔什
Josh!

254
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,740
我有麻烦了
I have a problem.

255
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,890
现在不是说这个的时候  艾略特
Now is not a good time, Elliot.

256
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,040
尤兰达在跟我以前的男朋友约会
Yolanda's dating someone I used to date.

257
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,400
-我该告诉她吗  -该
- Should I tell her? - Yes.

258
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,690
我还指望你另找门路...
I was hoping you'd go the other way...

259
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,760
就像马可以前那样
Like Marco used to.

260
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,460
听着  我也遇到了一点麻烦
Listen, I may have a little bit of a situation, too.

261
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,590
不管是什么麻烦
Whatever it is,

262
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,160
别在头脑发热的时候做出
don't do something in the heat of the moment

263
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,610
后悔终生的事
that you'll regret forever.

264
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,070
我只会这么做啊  你不认识我吗
That's all I do. Do you know me?

265
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,220
你还好吗
Are you okay?

266
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,770
还好  不  不好
I'm fine. No, I'm not.

267
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,370
我之前在想着有多替卡洛琳高兴
So I was thinking about how happy I am for Caroline,

268
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,990
所以我去了她家  送了她个结婚礼物
so I went over to her place and gave her a wedding gift.

269
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,270
真贴心  你送的什么
Oh, that's sweet. What'd you give her?

270
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,480
一次高潮
An orgasm.

271
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,030
什么
What?

272
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,960
我们上床了
We had sex.

273
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,060
是...
Y--

274
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,050
是  我知道高潮是什么
Yes, I know what an orgasm is!

275
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,240
只是不知道还能当礼物送人
I just didn't know that you could register for one.

276
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,070
天啊  我是怎么了
Oh my god, what is going on with me?

277
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,710
自从我跟卡洛琳分手  交往过了
I mean, since I broke up with Caroline, there's been

278
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,730
吉莉  劳伦  肖娜  差点有肖娜的女儿
Jilly, Lauren, Shauna, almost Shauna's daughter,

279
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,070
现在又回到了卡洛琳
and now back to Caroline.

280
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,370
你套了自己一圈呢
You lapped yourself.

281
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,180
我知道
I know.

282
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,370
高中的时候我肯定高兴坏了
High school Josh would have been stoked to be in this position,

283
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,820
但这不是我
but this is not me.

284
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,860
你猜怎么着
You know what?

285
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,310
在我想明白这事以前
I am not sleeping with any more women

286
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,730
不会再和女人睡觉了
until I figure out what is going on.

287
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,850
听着
Listen,

288
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,920
你不是最近唯一搞砸的人
you're not the only one who's been messing up recently.

289
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,030
我...
I, uh,

290
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,970
我不小心介绍了索菲亚一个三明治
I accidentally set Sofia up with a sandwich.

291
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,330
我看出你想干什么了  加比
I see what you're doing, Gabi.

292
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,370
你想编个比我干的还蠢的事
You're making up something more idiotic than what I did

293
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,660
好安慰我的心灵
to help me feel better about myself.

294
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,790
谢谢
Thank you.

295
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,120
是啊  我是在这样
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

296
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,390
尤兰达
Yolanda!

297
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,080
我有话跟你说
I have to tell you something!

298
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,370
在我吸尘的时候说吧
Tell me while I vacuum,

299
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,210
我赶着和马可约会呢
I have to hurry for my date with Marco!

300
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,650
就是这事
About that,

301
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,150
我以前和他约会过
I used to date him!

302
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,290
什么
What?

303
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,280
我以前和马可约会过
I used to date Marco!

304
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,470
你在说什么
What the hell you talkin' about?

305
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,190
马可喜欢女人
Marco likes women.

306
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,650
现在而已
Now.

307
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,080
我不相信你
I don't believe you.

308
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,100
有个鲨鱼纹身在他的两...
Shark tattoo right between the--

309
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,250
妈惹
Oh my damn!

310
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,020
对不起
I'm sorry.

311
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,120
马可一定是在探索性向
Marco must have been experimenting,

312
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,020
我就是他的实验室
and I was his laboratory.

313
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,280
不敢相信我会这么说
I can't believe I'm saying this,

314
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,250
但我不希望你受伤害
but I don't want you to get hurt.

315
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,890
因为就算马可变直了
'Cause even though Marco went straight,

316
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,710
可能还会弯回去
he still might fluctuate.

317
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,040
你真是贴心  艾略特
Oh, that is so sweet, Elliot.

318
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,830
不过我们现实点吧
But let's be real.

319
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,700
他游览过"亚洲风景"  但还是更爱我的风情
He went "Gaysian," then changed his persuasion.

320
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,110
我想了下和鲁本的事
I had a thought about Ruben.

321
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,740
你发现他吃东西很奇怪  然后甩了他是不是
Oh, you noticed he chews weird, and you kicked him to the curb?

322
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,820
他吃东西很完美
He chews perfectly.

323
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,040
终于遇到一个
Finally!

324
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,500
听着  重点是
Hey, listen, the point is

325
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,170
你状态又回来了
uh, you got your groove back.

326
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,430
所以现在可以重返情场
You know, so now you can get out there

327
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,470
和别人约会  而不是鲁本
and you can date other people, not Ruben.

328
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,460
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

329
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,070
我终于遇到了个喜欢的男人
I finally meet a guy I like,

330
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,210
所以我要打破七次约会的规矩
that's why I'm breaking the seven-date rule

331
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,810
今晚就和他上床
on having sex tonight.

332
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,230
不  不要
No! No, no, no. Don't.

333
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,590
收起你的胯
Put that away!

334
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,590
规则很明确  好吗
The rule is very clear, okay?

335
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,920
真找不到缺点了再上床
Booty's gotta wait until you find things you hate.

336
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,390
好吧  怎么了
Okay, what is going on?

337
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,500
因为几天前
Because a couple of days ago,

338
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,840
你还等不急让我去约会
you couldn't wait for me to meet someone.

339
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,210
现在又想我甩了他吗
And now you want me to dump him?

340
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,820
好吧  坐下来
Okay, sit down.

341
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,200
鲁本有些事你会想知道的
There's something about Ruben you should know.

342
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,000
好吧  你说
Okay, well tell me.

343
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,140
因为我觉得他是完美的男人
Because I think he's the perfect man.

344
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,060
不是男人...
Not so much of a man...

345
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,270
是三明治人
as a manwich.

346
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,600
什么
What?

347
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:00,200
鲁本...
Ruben...

348
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,990
{\an8}鲁本是种三明治的名字

349
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,990
是个三明治
is a sandwich.

350
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,080
是啊  加比
Yes, Gabi.

351
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,870
我猜他一定没听过这笑话
I'm sure he's never heard that one before.

352
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,480
不不不  我想说的是
No, no, no. No! Listen, my point is

353
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
鲁本是个三明治
Ruben is a sandwich,

354
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,910
一个职业三明治
a professional sandwich.

355
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,950
鲁本就是萨明治的萨米
Ruben is Sammy the sammich.

356
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,390
等等
Hold on.

357
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,250
你是说  那个站在外面...
You mean, the one that stands outside the--

358
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,400
-穿着...  -是
- With the-- - Yeah.

359
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,590
-还做着...  -是
- Who does the-- - Yeah.

360
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,080
-操他...  -走
- What the-- - Go!

361
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,970
我不懂了  你干嘛不像跟其他人一样
I don't understand. Why can't you just break up with him

362
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,690
发短信分手呢
over text like all the other ones?

363
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,060
因为他骗了我
Because he lied to me.

364
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,400
我差点就被他"治"了
I almost had a one-night "standwich."

365
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,440
他在这
Here he is.

366
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,110
你为什么不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

367
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,650
我们聊了一晚上
I mean, we stayed up all night talking.

368
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,490
说了那么多秘密
We shared intimate details of our lives.

369
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,630
我连你最喜欢的三明治都知道
I know your favorite sandwich!

370
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,490
你居然忘了说你自己也是
But you forgot to mention that you are one!

371
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,350
别推我
Don't push me!

372
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,930
不许推我闺蜜  过来
Nobody shoves my best friend. Come here!

373
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,790
你得道歉
You got to apologize!

374
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,720
你不是鲁本
You're not Ruben.

375
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,310
我当然不是
You're damn right I'm not.

376
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,920
五秒原则  对不起
Uh, five second rule. I'm so sorry!

377
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,810
真的对不起
I'm so sorry.

378
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,980
索菲亚  你来干什么
Sofia? What are you doing here?

379
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,520
天啊  那手套
Oh my god. The gloves.

380
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,690
你是个三明治
You are a sandwich!

381
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,920
我准备告诉你的
I was gonna tell you,

382
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,540
但加比逼我别告诉
but Gabi made me swear not to.

383
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,900
什么
What?

384
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,490
你居然想怪我
All right, you can't pin this all on me.

385
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,240
要不是你在婚介应用上
This never would have happened

386
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,410
填的假冒档案也不会这样
if you didn't lie to me on your HeyCupid profile.

387
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,050
等等  妹子
Back it up, sista.

388
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,840
档案
Profile?

389
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,930
我以为你说他是库珀的朋友
I thought you said he was a friend of Cooper's.

390
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,730
听着  我就直说了  好吧
Okay. Listen, I'm just gonna come clean. Okay?

391
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,910
库珀也用婚介应用...
Cooper went on HeyCupid--

392
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,220
-加比  -抱歉
- Gabi. - I'm sorry.

393
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,940
我假冒了你的交友档案
I set you up with a fake dating profile,

394
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,140
-因为我想帮你找到真命天子  -天啊
- 'cause I wanted you to find the perfect guy. - Oh my god.

395
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,510
这可过分了...
You know, this is too much...

396
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,040
即使对你来说
even for you.

397
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,530
这手套没中指算你走运
You're lucky this doesn't have a middle finger!

398
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,140
大家都在说这里
Everyone's talking about this place.

399
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,700
菜看起来也很好吃
And the food looks good.

400
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,890
上等腰肉牛排听着真棒
Oh, the porterhouse steak sounds awesome.

401
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,660
但中式鸡肉沙拉看起来也超好吃
Oh, but the Chinese chicken salad looks delish!

402
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,890
你两道菜都行[可直可弯]  是吗
So you can go either way, huh?

403
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,150
当然了
I sure can.

404
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,280
我觉得我要沙拉吧
I think I'll have the salad.

405
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,920
我喜欢亚洲酱料[穿衣服]
I love an Asian dressing.

406
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,480
或者不穿
And undressing.

407
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,380
我们快点餐吧
Let's hurry and order.

408
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,760
早点吃完
The sooner we eat,

409
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,180
就能早点燃烧掉这些卡路里
the sooner we can burn off these calories.

410
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,250
想得美  艾略特
Oh, hell no, Elliot!

411
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,150
艾略特
Elliot?

412
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,270
我看出来了
I see what this is about.

413
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,220
他告诉了你我们以前约会过
He told you we used to date

414
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,490
我和男人在一起过吓到你了
and it freaks you out that I've been with men.

415
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,420
不  不
Oh, no, no.

416
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,350
我无所谓  随你喜欢男女
I'm cool with that. Whatever floats your boat.

417
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,130
但喜欢艾略特...
But Elliot?

418
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,300
过去的事就别再说了吧
Let's leave the past in the past.

419
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,660
今晚只有我们两个
Tonight is just you and me.

420
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,170
没错
Oh, you're right.

421
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,970
是我在犯傻
I'm being silly.

422
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,330
不行
I can't.

423
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,300
对不起  艾略特  我是说马可...
I'm sorry, Elliot-- I mean, Marco--

424
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,280
艾马特  再见
El Marco. Bye!

425
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,690
我一直在想着和卡洛琳那事
This whole Caroline thing just really screwed with my head.

426
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,810
我得锻炼一下分分心
I need to work out some frustration.

427
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,110
你就不能借酒浇愁吗  像我爸那样
Couldn't you just drink, like my dad?

428
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,520
真是愚蠢
I mean, it was so stupid.

429
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,210
我都对她没感觉了
I don't even have feelings for her anymore.

430
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,770
什么也不算啊
It meant nothing.

431
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,580
好疼
Ouch!

432
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,660
我知道  听着很残忍  但这是事实
Yeah, I know. It sounds harsh, but it's true.

433
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,540
我们俩根本不配  那些姑娘都不配
She was never right for me. None of these girls were.

434
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,080
我干嘛还要和她们勾搭呢
Why do I keep hooking up with all these women?

435
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,200
好吧  你得停下
Okay, you need to stop.

436
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,330
我也想啊  艾略特  我也想
I wish I could, Elliot. I wish I could.

437
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,690
好疼的
It hurts!

438
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,770
你说得没错  是疼
You're damn right, it does,

439
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,910
但或许我胡搞就是为了掩盖心痛
but maybe I bury this pain by sleeping around.

440
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,310
你为什么要这样
Why are you doing this?

441
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,150
或许因为我想  艾略特
Maybe because I want that feeling, Elliot.

442
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,980
想要那种为某人痴狂的感觉
The feeling you get when you're excited about somebody,

443
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,090
相处多久都不满足
when you can't get enough of them.

444
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,440
你只能想着她们...
All you do is think about them...

445
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,080
就像我对加比的感觉
the way I feel about Gabi.

446
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,170
加比吗
Gabi?

447
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,760
天啊  就是这个
Oh my god, that's it.

448
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,370
我还对加比有感觉
I still have feelings for Gabi.

449
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,950
现在怎么办
Now what?

450
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,040
喊救护车
Call 911.

451
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,420
就算我吃着这个你做的
Even though I am eating this sundae you made

452
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,450
想挽回我友谊的圣代
to buy back my friendship,

453
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,700
也不代表我就原谅你了
It does not mean that I have forgiven you.

454
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,280
索菲亚  我发现你在把杏仁
Sofia, I noticed that you are picking out

455
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,450
拣到一边  不吃它们
and not eating the almonds.

456
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,090
你别说了
Let me stop you right there.

457
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,230
我懂你的小把戏
I know what you're doing.

458
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,120
你在我圣代里放杏仁
You put almonds in my sundae,

459
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,800
明知道我不喜欢
knowing that I do not like them,

460
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:49,150
因为就算圣代不完美
because even though the sundae's not perfect,

461
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,640
我还是很喜欢吃
I'll love it anyway.

462
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,050
你懂我的寓意了吗
Oh, did you pick up on that?

463
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,910
这是行不通的  因为圣代不是人
And it's not gonna work because a sundae isn't a person,

464
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,280
除非你又想介绍个
unless you're planning to set me up

465
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,440
穿成圣代的人给我
with a person who dresses like a sundae.

466
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,070
我来问你  谁是你人生中
Let me ask you something. Who's the biggest disaster

467
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,760
-遇见最烂的人  -你
- you've ever met in your whole life? - You.

468
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,250
好吧  首先  你回答的太快了
Okay, first off, you answered that too fast.

469
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,900
其次
And second,

470
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,800
忽略今天发生的事情
despite what happened today,

471
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,220
你爱我吗
Do you love me?

472
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,740
当然了
Of course I do.

473
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,420
那为什么你可以接受我的所有缺点
Well, then why is it you can accept all of my flaws

474
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,790
依然爱我  但却不能对和你
and still love me, but you can't do that

475
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,250
约会的男生也这样呢
with the guys that you date?

476
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,380
我不知道
I don't know.

477
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,040
跟男生怎么一样呢
It's just different with guys.

478
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,810
是吗
Oh, is it?

479
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,420
是啊  他们...
Yes, I mean, they're...

480
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,190
他们像...
They're like...

481
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,970
他们...
They do--

482
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,990
你说的在理
Wow, that's a really good point.

483
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,270
那我再问你
Well, let me ask you another question.

484
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,230
如果我是三明治你还爱我吗
Would you still love me if I was a sandwich?

485
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,520
天啊
Oh my god.

486
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,500
我的计划有用了
My plan has worked.

487
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,590
鲁本
Ruben!

488
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,510
真的很抱歉
I am so, so sorry!

489
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,540
我真的喜欢你
I really like you,

490
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,870
我不在乎你是不是三明治
and I don't care if you're a sandwich.

491
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,560
只要瞒着我爸妈就好
We just won't tell my parents.

492
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,930
请告诉我我没找错人
Oh, please tell me I have the right one.

493
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,220
没有
Yeah, you do.

494
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,560
谢天谢地
Thank god!

495
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,010
马可  我就感觉你会打来
Marco, I had a feeling you'd call.

496
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,730
我只是想为麦当娜演唱会那事道歉
I just wanted to make up for the Madonna concert.

497
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,340
我不是想炫耀  但我名草有主了
Papa don't mean to preach, but I have a boyfriend.

498
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,370
我只是觉得既然你来了
I just thought that since you're here,

499
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,260
说明你和你男友也没那么坚贞嘛
you and your boyfriend aren't exclusive.

500
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,910
我们只是喝杯酒
It's just a drink.

501
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:54,310
是啊  我们见面那晚你也是这么说的
Yeah, that's what you said the night we met.

502
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,030
看着我的眼睛
Look me in the eye

503
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,030
告诉我你对我没有性趣  宝贝
and tell me that you're not attracted to me, baby.

504
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,850
告诉我你不想和我在一起
That you don't want a big slice of this.

505
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,720
抱歉  我做不到
Sorry, I can't do this!

506
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,900
马可...尤兰达...马兰达
Marco-- Yolanda-- Malanda.

507
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,320
再见
Bye!

饥饿

00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,860
的青春

10
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,860
第二季  第九集

11
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,700
好了  艾略特  就是今天了
This is it, Elliot. Today is the day.

12
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,230
我要这样做  我绝对要这样做
I'm doing this. I am definitely doing this.

13
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,880
你会很出色的
And you're gonna be wonderful.

14
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:14,990
你要做什么
What are you doing?

15
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,430
告诉加比我对她的感受
Telling Gabi how I feel about her.

16
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,700
库珀今晚就飞来了
Cooper's flies in tonight,

17
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,140
我得赶在他来之前告诉她
so I gotta get to her before he does.

18
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,340
我看了她喜欢的所有浪漫喜剧  寻找灵感
I've watched all of her favorite rom-coms as inspiration.

19
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,700
我知道哈利是怎么遇见莎莉的
I know how Harry met Sally,

20
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,610
知道西雅图为什么有不眠夜
and I know why they're sleepless in Seattle,

21
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,760
我搞不明白的是怎么告诉加比我爱她
What I can't figure out is how to tell Gabi I love her.

22
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,190
-你为什么不说这些  -什么
- Why don't you tell her that? - What?

23
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,940
刚才那番话  很动听
That speech. It was beautiful.

24
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,640
的确有点动听
It was kind of beautiful.

25
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,530
我们走吧
Come on, let's do this.

26
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:38,930
你不能跟我一起去
You're not coming with me.

27
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,050
我知道  我想要你送我去埃兰家
I know. I want you to drop me off at Alan's.

28
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,850
他说要给我看一个"大东西"
He said he had something big to show me.

29
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,670
上次他这样做时  我笑了一周
And the last time he did that, I was smiling for a week.

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,400
我也许该穿条好裤子
I should probably throw on some pants.

31
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,250
我来帮忙
I'll help.

32
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,960
早上好
Good morning.

33
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,270
谢谢你让库珀住这里
Thank you so much for letting Cooper live here.

34
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,030
是待在这里
Stay here.

35
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,230
好吧  待在这里  直到他找到工作
Right, stay here until he gets a job.

36
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,320
重点是我们要住在一起了
The point is, we're living together.

37
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,250
是待在一起
Staying together.

38
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,170
天啊  是他
Oh my god, it's him.

39
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,420
他随时都可能来
He'll be here any minute.

40
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,130
天啊  他随时都可能来
Oh my god, he'll be here any minute!

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,940
我怎么有时间化好
How am I gonna have time

42
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,990
全部妆  让自己看起来自然呢
to put on all my makeup so I look natural?

43
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,620
他来了
It's him.

44
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,420
我是超级库珀熊
I'm super Cooper bear,

45
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,730
我等不及用爪子...
and I can't wait to put my paws on--

46
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,060
行了  我是索菲亚
Okay, it's Sofia.

47
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,000
库珀  你什么毛病啊
Cooper, what the hell is wrong with you?

48
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,770
你上次过来的时候跟我保证过
The last time you were here, you promised me

49
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,560
会告诉加比乔什喜欢她
that you would tell Gabi that Josh had feelings for her.

50
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,150
你求我让你告诉她
You begged me to let you tell her,

51
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,170
我当时想照顾你的感情
and I was sensitive to your feelings.

52
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,140
我本来打算告诉她  然后她说她爱我
I was about to tell her, and then she told me that she loved me.

53
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,470
我要怎么说啊
What was I supposed to say to that?

54
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,700
我也爱你  顺便说一句  乔什也是
"I love you too. By the way, so does Josh"?

55
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,030
我给你最后一次机会
Okay, I'm gonna give you one last chance.

56
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,850
如果你今天还不说  老娘就说
If you don't tell her by the end of the day, I'm gonna.

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,530
我还以为海关搜身下手重呢
I thought the T.S.A. was rough.

58
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,950
你在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

59
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,130
我从中国过来跟加比同居
I came from China to live with Gabi.

60
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,640
该你了
Your turn.

61
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,190
我从我家来跟加比谈谈
I came from my house to talk to Gabi.

62
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,870
有意思  这次你走前门
Oh, interesting. And you used the front door this time,

63
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,240
{\an4} 翻译  冰蓝  roaddog

64
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,060
不走逃生梯了吗
not the fire escape?

65
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,240
{\an4} 校对  roaddog

66
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,460
对  没错
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's right.

67
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,240
{\an4} 时间轴  小狱

68
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,900
我知道  我都知道了
I know. I know it all,

69
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,240
{\an4} 后期  斯人   总监  roaddog

70
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,780
包括你爱加比这一事实
including the fact that you love Gabi,

71
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,030
而你对我撒谎了  说你不爱她
which you lied to me about and told me you didn't.

72
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,470
什么  你怎么...
What? How do you--?

73
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,650
什么 
What?

74
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,580
索菲亚说漏嘴了
Sofia accidentally told me.

75
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,090
所以我知道一切  没有秘密了
So I know everything. No secrets.

76
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,870
加比知道吗
All right, does Gabi know?

77
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,610
好吧  就一个秘密
Okay, one secret.

78
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,190
就是说你没告诉她  你为啥不告诉
Which means you didn't tell her. Why didn't you tell her?

79
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,100
因为你害怕如果她发现我喜欢她
Because you're scared if she finds out I have feelings for her,

80
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,780
她就会选我  我
she'll choose me. Me.

81
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,440
她会吗
Will she, though?

82
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,120
因为我确定当她让我住在这里
Because I'm pretty sure when she asked me to live here

83
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,600
并说她爱我时  是因为她选择了我
and told me she loved me, it 'cause she chose me.

84
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,590
我
Me.

85
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,040
库珀  我刚下床...
Hey, Cooper, I just rolled out of--

86
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,920
乔什  你在这里干什么
Josh, what are you here for?

87
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,810
我告诉你我来不是干什么的  审讯
I'll tell you what I'm not here for-- an interrogation.

88
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,290
你知道什么让我恶心吗
You know what makes me sick?

89
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,750
如果不是我  她都不会
It's that she never would have even met Cooper

90
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,200
遇见库珀  该死
if it wasn't for me, damn it.

91
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,410
我得想想下一步该怎么做
I gotta figure out my next move.

92
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,140
擦窗户怎么样
How about the windows?

93
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,860
尤兰达  我是认真的
Yolanda, I'm serious.

94
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,560
我要怎么做
What am I gonna do?

95
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,670
我告诉你要怎么做
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.

96
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,170
按兵不动  库珀刚回来
Nothing. Cooper just got back.

97
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,450
加比现在很粘他
Gabi's all hot and bothered and into him.

98
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,540
但那孩子没工作
But the boy's got no job,

99
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,780
一间小公寓住着三个人
and three people in that tiny apartment--

100
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,890
看看那朵玫瑰花会多快凋谢吧
Watch how fast that bloom falls off that rose.

101
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,380
一整天都看不到你  我要怎么过啊
How am I gonna make it through a whole day without seeing you?

102
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,030
那就只能给你深情一吻  让你记住我了
I guess I'll just have to give you something to remember me by.

103
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,880
天啊
Oh my damn.

104
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,990
那并不意味着什么
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.

105
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,670
各位  没看见你们呢
Hey, guys. Didn't see you there.

106
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,370
乔什  今早我们都没机会聊聊
Josh, we didn't have a chance to catch up this morning.

107
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:44,950
你怎么样
How are you doing, buddy?

108
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,740
还是富得流油  你呢  库珀
Still filthy rich. How about you, Cooper?

109
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,210
做爱太多有点累
Other than a little tired

110
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,460
其余没什么好抱怨的
from having so much sex, can't complain.

111
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,300
希望你别太累
Well, I hope you're not too tired.

112
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,370
我听说找工作很累人的
I hear looking for work can be exhausting.

113
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,700
当然啦  我不知道  我一般是雇人的
Of course, I wouldn't know. I usually do the hiring.

114
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,020
实际上  我可以轻松找到工作
Actually, I could easily get a job,

115
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,500
因为我是个天才
'cause I'm, you know, a genius.

116
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,270
但我六个月都不能找技术工作
But I can't take a tech job for six months

117
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,710
因为我跟上家公司签了非竞争条款
because I have a non-compete clause from my last company.

118
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,940
所以没必要竞争  乔什
So there's just really no point in competing, Josh.

119
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,220
是啊  但是库珀可以做自由职业者
Yeah, but Cooper can get freelance stuff.

120
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,070
所以我把我的车给他了
That's why I gave him my car.

121
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,920
他今天要去找工作
He's gonna go out to look for a job today.

122
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,380
没工作也没车
No job and no car?

123
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,920
最多一周
I give it a week.

124
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:27,080
埃兰给我看了他的大惊喜
Well, Alan showed me his big surprise.

125
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,910
他清算了退休帐户
He liquidated his retirement account

126
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,950
买了一家KTV
and bought a karaoke bar.

127
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,950
我是亚洲基佬  依然觉得那是个愚蠢的主意
I'm gay and Asian, and still think that's a stupid idea.

128
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,050
我觉得他想实现梦想很棒好吗
Hey, I think it's exciting he's following his dream.

129
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,020
埃兰该让库珀来干那些技术活
Ooh, Alan should hire Cooper to do all the technical stuff.

130
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,910
我的确在毕业舞会上弄过激光秀
I did put on a laser show at my prom.

131
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,370
效果图比实际好多了
It was way better than actually going.

132
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,560
库珀也帮乔什工作过
And Cooper worked for Josh

133
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,310
表现也很好  对吗  乔什
and he did a great job. Right, Josh?

134
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,680
是
Yes.

135
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:56,970
好吧
Fine.

136
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,150
但我希望你的报酬
But I hope you work

137
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,930
能像你女友穿得一样廉价
as cheap as your girlfriend looks in that outfit.

138
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,430
我更便宜
Cheaper.

139
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,940
叮叮叮  午饭来噜
Ringy-dingy! I got your lunch thingy.

140
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,840
我在三明治里放了
I put crinkle cut potato chips

141
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,060
你喜欢的扭扭薯条
in the sandwich just like you like--

142
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,180
-就像我在说...  -我爱你
- Just my little way of saying-- - I love you.

143
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,420
-什么  -没什么
- What? - Nothing.

144
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,750
好吧
Oh, okay.

145
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,480
我要回厨房了
Well, I'm gonna head back to the kitchen.

146
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,780
我爱你
I love you.

147
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,780
好吧  先说清楚...
Okay, just to clarify--

148
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,320
你是在跟我说话还是跟三明治
are you speaking to me or the sandwich?

149
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,380
加比  我一直在等合适的机会
Gabi, I've been waiting for the right time

150
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,700
跟你说  现在好像不太合适
to tell you this. Not sure this is it.

151
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,920
但我爱你
But I love you.

152
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,920
你笑什么
Why are you laughing?

153
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,630
我不知道该说什么
I don't know what to say.

154
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,890
不如说
How about,

155
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,360
"我也爱你  乔什"
"I love you too, Josh"?

156
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,140
抱歉  抱歉
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

157
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,530
我真的受宠若惊
That's super sweet and super flattering.

158
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,990
所以我要说  谢谢你
So I'm going to say thank you

159
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,840
然后回厨房了
and head back to the kitchen.

160
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,180
享受你的午餐吧
So enjoy your lunch.

161
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,960
好吧  我现在又想了一下
Okay, now that I had a moment to think about it,

162
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,210
你这话怎么冒出来的
quick question, where the hell did that come from?

163
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,660
突然平白无故的
I mean, suddenly, out of the clear blue,

164
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,590
你就跟我说了这话吗  干嘛选现在
you tell me something like that? I mean, why now?

165
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,870
为什么是现在
Why now?

166
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,390
当然了
Of course.

167
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,130
因为我和库珀在一起  让你要疯了
'Cause I'm with Cooper. And it's driving you crazy

168
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,670
因为你那么好胜
Because you're so competitive.

169
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,680
对你来说  我就是个荣誉奖杯
To you, I'm just a trophy to win.

170
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,360
你猜怎么着  我才不是奖
Well, guess what. I'm no prize.

171
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,460
好吧  我是奖
Okay, all right, I am a prize,

172
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,050
但不是你的奖
but not yours.

173
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,240
享受你的午餐吧
Enjoy your lunch.

174
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,430
你好大的胆子  知道吗
I mean, how dare you, you know?

175
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,070
我现在那么幸福
I'm happier than I've ever been.

176
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,390
你却说了这话
And you say something like this

177
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,800
想来扰乱我脑子  你猜怎么着
to try and mess with my head. Well, guess what.

178
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,750
我脑子才不乱  实际上  无比清醒
My head is not messed. In fact, it's clearer than ever.

179
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,690
我爱库珀
I love Cooper.

180
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,060
还以为她又要回来
Hmm, thought she was coming back.

181
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,500
天啊  索菲亚  我今天这班上得真疯狂
Oh my god, Sofia, I had the craziest day at work.

182
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,910
我给乔什午餐做了三明治
I brought Josh in a sandwich for lunch

183
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,730
接着突然之间  他说"我爱你"
and then all of a sudden he said "I love you."

184
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,330
太好了
Yes!

185
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,080
的确很疯狂哈
That is a crazy day at work.

186
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,860
你一定震惊到了  他提了我名字吗
You must have been totally shocked. Did my name come up?

187
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,800
没有  为什么要提你
No. Why would your name come up?

188
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,160
因为我是你闺蜜  你什么都告诉我
Because I'm your best friend and you tell me everything,

189
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,590
所以告诉我吧
so tell me everything.

190
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,990
好吧  你不会相信的
Okay, you're never gonna believe this,

191
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,730
但他跟我说他爱我  我什么感觉都没有
but when he told me that he loved me, I felt nothing.

192
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,670
-没有吗  -没有
- Nothing? - Nothing.

193
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,140
你知道没感觉感觉有多好吗
Do you know how good it felt to feel nothing?

194
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,980
你知道我原来多喜欢他的
I mean, you know how into him I was.

195
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,740
但现在没感觉了  真的没了  我爱库珀
But now it's gone. It's totally gone. I love Cooper.

196
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,210
天啊  我解放了
Oh my god, I'm off the hook.

197
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,630
我们解放了  你解放了
We're off the hook. You're off the hook.

198
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,190
这事算完了
This is off the hook!

199
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,240
好了  我去换衣服准备和我爱的男人
Okay, I'm gonna go change to have dinner with the man I love--

200
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,280
库珀吃晚餐  不是乔什哦
Cooper, not Josh. Yay!

201
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,810
耶
Hell yay!

202
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,790
这些是给我的吗
Oh, are those for me?

203
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,360
不  是给加比的
No, they're for Gabi,

204
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,430
因为你比我今晚跟她摊牌乔什的事
because you're making me tell her about Josh tonight.

205
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,940
这花该给我
Well, they should be for me,

206
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,280
因为我有好消息告诉你
because I'm about to tell you some great news.

207
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,250
你今晚不用跟她摊牌了
You don't have to tell her about Josh tonight.

208
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,080
你问为什么吗
Oh, why, you ask?

209
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,890
因为今天
Because today

210
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,640
乔什说自己爱她  是不是好棒
he told her he loves her. Isn't that great?

211
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,830
怎么就棒了
How is that great?

212
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,160
说实话  这简直让我想砸墙
Honestly, that makes me want to punch a wall.

213
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,710
好吧  淡定  硬汉
Okay, calm down, macho.

214
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,460
我不是没见过你的宠物小精灵牙刷
I've seen your pokemon toothbrush.

215
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,140
好棒是因为  首先
Look, it's great because, first of all,

216
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,040
她不爱他  爱的是你
she doesn't love him. She loves you.

217
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,910
其次  我们不用告诉她了
And second of all, we don't gotta tell her.

218
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,740
我们不用告诉...
We don't have to tell--

219
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,250
我们不用告诉她了
We don't have to tell her!

220
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,130
没错  但你再喊的话  就要了
Yeah, but if you keep screaming it, we will.

221
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,030
抱歉  这真不错
Sorry, sorry. This is great.

222
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,570
如果秘密不再是秘密
If the secret is no longer a secret,

223
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,110
我们就不用瞒着她了
we're not keeping anything from her.

224
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,070
该做的事做完了  我们不用告诉她
The right thing got done, and we didn't have to tell her.

225
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,670
-简直是大礼  -简直是大礼
- It's like a gift. - It is like a gift.

226
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,760
比那个破熊好多了
And so much better than that stupid bear.

227
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,240
乔什  你在这干什么  吓死我了
Josh, what are you doing here? You scared me half to death.

228
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,500
我一直在想今天下午的事
Look, I've been thinking about what happened this afternoon.

229
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,000
-我们要谈谈  -不  该说的我都说了
- We need to talk. - No, I said everything I needed to say already.

230
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,850
库珀正在那睡觉呢  你得走了
Cooper is sleeping right there. You need to go.

231
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,420
真是神经
The nerve of this guy.

232
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,060
给
Here you go.

233
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,140
天啊
Oh my god.

234
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,850
这是个梦  我在做梦
This is a dream. I'm dreaming.

235
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,440
为什么我会梦到乔什
Why am I dreaming about Josh?

236
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,770
因为你对我有感觉
'Cause you have feelings for me.

237
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,620
不  我没有
No, I don't.

238
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,000
你得走了  我对你没感觉
You have to leave. I don't have feelings for you.

239
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,210
我爱库珀
I love Cooper.

240
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,400
-你真想让我走吗  -是的
- Do you really want me to leave? - Yes.

241
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,230
就说了你爱我
Told you you loved me.

242
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,770
不  我不想你在这  你走
No, I don't want you here. You have to leave.

243
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:55,890
真的吗
Really?

244
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,110
那你为什么都要吻我了
Then why are you about to kiss me?

245
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,500
怎么  着火了吗  小丑来了吗
What? Is there fire? Are there clowns?

246
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,270
不  我刚做了个噩梦
No, I-- I just had a bad dream.

247
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,560
什么梦  你想说说吗
What happened? You want to talk about it?

248
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,080
不  没事
No, I'm good.

249
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,450
没事
I'm good.

250
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,220
看招牌的效果多好
Look how great the sign turned out.

251
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,840
我们现在正式变成  "我唱吗
We are now officially the "Me sing?

252
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,670
我不会唱  好吧"KTV了
I could never. Ok!" Karaoke bar.

253
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,520
够了  你这假惺惺的欢呼是怎么回事
Okay, enough. What's with all the fake yays?

254
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,380
简直像跟我第一任男友嘿咻
It's like sex with my first boyfriend.

255
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,970
我就是担心
I'm just concerned.

256
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,810
要么KTV倒了  你伤心
Either the bar fails and you're sad,

257
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,490
要么很成功
or it succeeds,

258
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,100
你就成KTV老板了
and then you own a karaoke bar.

259
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,900
别怕
Fear not.

260
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,470
这KTV会很火爆的
This bar shall flourish.

261
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,170
看到没  我说了老天眷顾我吧
See? Told you I was one of the chosen people.

262
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,530
小库  灯光都接好了吗
Hey, Coopy, are the lights all hooked up?

263
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,640
是的  你们准备好示范了吗
Yep. You guys ready for a demo?

264
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,770
-烧钱啊  -像彩虹一样
- Expensive. - It's like a rainbow.

265
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,030
美死了
I'm dying.

266
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,730
好了  我要出去拿点东西
Okay, I gotta run out and grab a few things.

267
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,050
你想让我买几个迪厅的灯球吗
Oh, hey, you want me to pick up a couple of disco balls?

268
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,300
你觉得呢
What do you think?

269
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,960
埃兰  我就是担心你会亏本
Alan, I'm just worried you'll lose all your money.

270
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,380
艾略特  这是我成真的梦想
Elliot, this is my dream and it's happening.

271
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,670
船已经离港了
The boat's leaving the dock.

272
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,800
你要么跟我再见  要么跳上来一起划
You can either wave goodbye or get in the boat and help me row.

273
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,400
居然是手划船吗
Ugh, it's a rowboat?

274
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,580
好吧  但你来划
Fine, but you row.

275
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,110
我去吧台边优雅地喝大都会了
I'll go sip a cosmo adorably at the bar.

276
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,490
真高兴你让我来
I am so excited that you asked me

277
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,300
负责你的开业餐饮  埃兰
to cater your opening night, Alan.

278
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,540
无骨鸡翅哎
Ooh, boneless chicken wings.

279
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,790
你把它们做成小鸡鸡的样子真可爱
It's adorable how you made them look like little penises.

280
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,540
那是麦克风
They're microphones.

281
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,520
因为这里能唱歌
'Cause of the singing.

282
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,750
这样就有道理多了
That makes a lot more sense.

283
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,220
我肯定它们很美味
You know, I'm sure they're delicious,

284
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,140
但我太紧张吃不下
but I'm too nervous to eat.

285
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,420
你紧张什么  这KTV看起来棒极了
Why are you nervous? The bar looks great.

286
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,060
艾略特和我对这里有分歧
Elliot and I have been at such odds over this place.

287
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,210
我想让开幕夜十全十美
I want opening night to be perfect,

288
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,760
就像艾略特一样
just like Elliot.

289
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,290
知道吗  他就是我的真命天子
You know, he's the one.

290
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,510
是  气得让我在洗衣房哭的天子
Yeah, the one that makes me cry in the laundry room.

291
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,030
埃兰  我能问你个问题吗
Alan, can I ask you a question?

292
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,240
你怎么知道谁是真命天子
How do you know which one is the one,

293
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,210
尤其是可能有两个天子呢
especially if there could be two that are both the one?

294
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,360
不  加比比
No, Gabelah,

295
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,300
只会有一个
there can only be one "the one."

296
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,050
没错  你怎么能知道
Exactly. How do you know?

297
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,400
很简单  是吻
It's simple. It's the kiss.

298
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,180
我记得第一次吻艾略特的时候
I remember when I kissed Elliot for the first time.

299
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,280
那是大学
We were in college.

300
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,500
我喝了一瓶半的预调酒
I'd had one and a half zimas,

301
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,240
感觉晕乎乎的
and was feeling really loose,

302
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,430
所以就大胆亲上去了
so I just went for it.

303
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,550
那个吻让我浑身酥麻
That kiss made my toes curl.

304
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,100
只有这样才能知道
That's the only way you know.

305
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,970
所以不能点猫猫吗
So "one potato, two potato" is out?

306
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,260
加比  我很高兴你来了
Gabi, look, I'm glad you came by.

307
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,770
我觉得我们话还没...
I don't think we finished our conv--

308
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,460
享用你的啤酒吧
Enjoy your beer.

309
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,860
乔什  真的很抱歉
Josh, I'm really sorry.

310
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,360
我知道那有些突然  但是...
I know that came as a shock, but--

311
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,750
加比  我收到你短信了  怎么啦亲爱的
Gabi, I got your text. What's up, baby?

312
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,910
谢谢你来  索菲亚忙着上班
Thanks for coming. Sofia's stuck at work

313
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,680
我真的要找个人聊聊
and I really needed to talk to somebody.

314
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,930
在洗衣房里聊吗
In the laundry room?

315
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,000
是的  我在这里躲库珀
Yeah, I'm hiding out in here from Cooper

316
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,670
和人生
and life.

317
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,210
怎么了  亲爱的
What's wrong, baby?

318
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,660
我现在很两难
Well, I have a dilemma.

319
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,130
库珀搬到楼上了
Cooper moved in upstairs

320
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,180
现在我"楼下"开始对乔什有感觉了
and now I'm starting to feel things for Josh downstairs.

321
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,520
妈呀
Oh my damn.

322
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,490
继续
Go on.

323
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,780
乔什告诉我他爱我
Josh told me that he loved me.

324
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,240
我以为自己对他没感觉
And I didn't think that I had any feelings for him,

325
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,240
但发现我有  所以跟埃兰聊了聊
but it turns out, I do. And so I talked to Alan,

326
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,450
他说唯一知道那感觉
and he said the only way to find out

327
00:15:01,450 --> 00:14:37,530
是否真实的办法  是吻他
if those feelings are real, is to kiss him.

328
00:14:37,540 --> 00:15:06,200
我就吻了  尤兰达  那个吻真是...
And so I did. And, Yolanda, that kiss was...

329
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,500
棒呆了
Amazing.

330
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,390
我是这么感觉的
Well, it was for me,

331
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,600
所以她一定也是  对吗
so it had to be for her too, right?

332
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,150
只有一个办法能回答这问题
There's only one way for me to answer that question.

333
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,390
艾略特
Elliot.

334
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,450
她一定也是喜欢的
I mean, she had to be into it.

335
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,280
第二个吻  我觉得...
And the second kiss-- I felt that...

336
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,930
人都麻了  麻了  尤兰达
In my toes. In my toes, Yolanda.

337
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,630
但我有库珀了
But I have Cooper

338
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,790
他辞了中国的工作来和我一起
who quit his job in China to be here with me.

339
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,830
他那么贴心  关心人  又优秀
And he's so sweet and caring and wonderful.

340
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,680
我怎么能选乔什不要他呢
And how could I pick Josh over him?

341
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,550
她怎么会选库珀不要我呢
How could she pick Cooper over me?

342
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,200
我那么好
I mean, I'm a catch.

343
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,400
聪明  又成功
I'm smart. I'm successful.

344
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,810
或许还能说  我有点...
And, might I say, I can be...

345
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,040
一点点自大
A little arrogant.

346
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,390
如果他觉得自己能睡遍半个旧金山的女人
If he thinks he can just sleep with half of San Francisco

347
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:25,570
来说"我爱你  加比"
and then say, "I love you, Gabi,"

348
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:54,890
还指望我说"好啊  乔什"
and I'll be like "Okay, Josh."

349
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:56,930
但是呢
But?

350
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,200
但感觉就在那  你知道吗
But it's just there, you know--

351
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,180
那种化学反应  那种激情
that chemistry and that passion...

352
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,510
那种电流
That electricity.

353
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,770
你不能否认
You can't deny it.

354
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:07,530
我不能否认  我要怎么办
I can't deny it. What am I gonna do?

355
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,250
我不能告诉你怎么办  亲爱的
Oh, I can't tell you what to do, baby.

356
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,610
我有偏向  我爱乔什
I'm biased. I love Josh.

357
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,560
我有偏向  我讨厌加比
I'm biased. I hate Gabi.

358
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,890
但我爱你  所以祝你好运
But I love you, so good luck.

359
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,320
谢谢  伙计
Thanks, man.

360
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,010
所以你要怎么办
So what are you gonna do?

361
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,060
做成熟的事
The mature thing, you know.

362
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,740
我准备躲在这里直到该去KTV
I'm gonna hide down here until it's time to go to the karaoke bar

363
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,070
期望答案能奇迹般地降临
and just hope that an answer magically comes to me.

364
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,560
知道我是你我会怎么办吗
You know what I'd do in your situation?

365
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,210
投几个硬币进去
Put a couple of quarters in

366
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,160
在滚筒上爽一把
and ride the spin cycle.

367
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,460
乔什  要喝酒吗
Hey, Josh. Need a drink?

368
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,430
-好啊  -吧台在那
- Yeah, sure. - Cool. Bar's over there.

369
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,910
《心之全蚀》
Ooh, "Total Eclipse of the Heart."

370
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,400
是我的看家曲
That's, like, my jam.

371
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,930
我们该合唱
We should do a duet.

372
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,360
我更喜欢独唱
I'm more of a solo act.

373
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,400
要开胃菜吗
Um, appetizer?

374
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,730
好  谢谢
Yeah, thanks.

375
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,270
这些不是鸡鸡
They're not penises.

376
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,380
我没觉得是
I didn't think they were.

377
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,180
是小麦克风  对吗
They're little microphones, right?

378
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,980
是啊  因为这里是KTV嘛
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because of the karaoke And the singing.

379
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,220
-我走了  -我留在这
- I'm gonna go. - I'm gonna stay.

380
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,630
真高兴  你现在都是我的了
I'm so happy. You're all mine now.

381
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,320
什么
What?

382
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,630
你不是供完餐了吗
I mean, you're done serving food?

383
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,510
是啊  对  都是你的了
Oh, yeah, yeah, right. All yours.

384
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,910
大家好
Hello, everyone.

385
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,360
欢迎来到"我唱吗  我不会唱  好吧"的
Welcome to the grand opening of "Me sing?

386
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,020
盛大开业
I could never. Ok!"

387
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,960
这是我毕生的梦想
This has been my lifelong dream.

388
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,710
没有我另一个
And I couldn't have done it

389
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,670
毕生梦想  艾略特·帕克  我也无法成功
without my other lifelong dream-- Elliot Park.

390
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,730
是我  我是造梦者哦
That's me. I'm a dream weaver.

391
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,130
我二十年前做了件蠢事
You know, I did a really stupid thing 20 years ago.

392
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,680
我遇到了自己的梦中情人
I found the man of my dreams,

393
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,780
却从来没告诉他我的感受
and I never told him how I felt about him.

394
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,920
为什么  有太多借口了
Why? I had a million excuses.

395
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,260
我怕被拒绝  时机永远不对
I was afraid of rejection. It was never the right time.

396
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,720
我当时有女朋友
I had a girlfriend.

397
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,120
所以我们一直没能在一起
So we never got together.

398
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,420
没告诉你我过去的感受  让我真的想打自己
I could kick myself for not telling you how I felt back then

399
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,830
因为我从心底知道你就是那唯一
when I knew in my heart you were the only one.

400
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,470
我们回不到过去
Well, we can't go back,

401
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,150
但我学到了很重要的东西
but I learned something really important.

402
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,830
我不会再那么傻了
I'm never gonna be that stupid again.

403
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,370
艾略特·帕克
Elliot Park,

404
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,720
你愿意和我结婚吗
will you marry me?

405
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,940
天啊
Oh my god.

406
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,100
天啊  给我的吗
Oh my god. For me?

407
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,270
但愿能合适
I hope it fits.

408
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,440
我手胖的像海星
I have hands like little starfish.

409
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,660
答不答应  我膝盖不行了
Yes or no? My knees aren't the best.

410
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,890
我愿意
Yes.

411
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,150
你还好吗
Is everything okay?

412
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,590
不好
No.

413
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,870
你想一个人静静吗
Do you want me to leave you alone?

414
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,000
不
No.

415
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,530
我真的很高兴库珀回来了
I was really, really happy that Cooper was here.

416
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,150
可然后你说你爱我
And then you told me that you loved me

417
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,480
一切又乱了
and everything got confused.

418
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,210
然后我吻了你  你又吻了我
And then I kissed you and you kissed me

419
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,380
然后我就更乱了
and then I got even more confused.

420
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,940
然后我听到了埃兰的话
And then I heard Alan's speech.

421
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,720
我不再困惑了
I'm not confused anymore.

422
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,020
乔什
Josh,

423
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,910
是你
it's you.

424
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,880
不  等等
No, wait.

425
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,650
我得先和库珀谈谈
I have to talk to Cooper first.

426
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,600
我最不想的就是让他难堪
I mean, the last thing I want to do is embarrass him.

427
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,900
太迟了
Too late.

428
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,920
库珀  对不起
Cooper, I'm so sorry.

429
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,360
不  我才是觉得对不起的那个
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

430
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,220
你想和乔什在一起吗
You want to be with Josh?

431
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,040
没问题
Fine.

432
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,190
但有些事你得先知道
But you should know something first.

433
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,140
乔什  你想告诉她吗
Josh, you want to tell her?

434
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,510
你猜怎么着  让我说吧
You know what? Let me.

435
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,540
-库珀  不要  -别对我说不要
- Cooper, don't. - Don't "Don't" Me.

436
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,270
加比  在你被乔什的"我爱你"迷惑前
Gabi, before you fall for Josh's big "I love you,"

437
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,490
你该知道他三个月前就觉得自己爱你了
you should know that he thought he loved you three months ago,

438
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,930
就在取消自己的婚礼前
right before he called off his wedding.

439
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,770
没错
Oh, yeah.

440
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,980
他跟说有人都说了  除了你
And he told everybody but you,

441
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,720
然后  当他改变了主意
and then, when he changed his mind,

442
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,800
又说服所有人骗你
convinced everyone to lie to you about it.

443
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,410
尤兰达骗了你  艾略特骗了你
Yolanda lied. Elliot lied.

444
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,440
就连索菲亚都是
Even Sofia lied,

445
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,620
在他送她了一台新手机以后
only after being bought off with a new cell phone.

446
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,170
所以今天我们才会这样
Which brings us to today,

447
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:11,230
现在我们在一起  他又突然爱你了
when all of a sudden he loves you again now that we're together.

448
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,210
我好奇这次能有多久
I wonder how long it'll last this time.

449
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,450
总之  我祝你幸福
Anyway, I-- I wish you all the best.

450
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,500
看到没  我也可以骗人
See? I can lie too.

451
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,730
是真的吗
Is it true?

452
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,800
加比  一切我都能解释
Gabi, I can explain everything.

453
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,500
-天啊  是真的  -加比  等等
- Oh my god, it is true. - Gabi, wait.

454
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,920
不  你给我让开
No, get the hell away from me.

455
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,090
{\an8}埃兰和艾略特
幸福永远

456
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,450
好了  下一首是乔希
Okay, next up we have Josie

457
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,330
带来的《饿狼》
singing "Hungry Like the Wolf."

458
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,350
幸亏这泡沫爱心
Thank god I didn't pay retail

459
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,170
我是打折买的
for that styrofoam heart.

460
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,710
对不起
I'm sorry.

461
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,620
我想今晚对你来说是完美的
I wanted tonight to be perfect for you.

462
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,210
就是啊
It was.

463
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,270
不光是加比哭着从这里跑出去
And not just because Gabi ran out of here crying.

464
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,550
我的戒指也很美
My ring is beautiful.

465
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,870
是个小蝴蝶结  因为你就是我的小蝴蝶结
It's a tiny bowtie, 'cause you're my tiny bowtie.

466
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,690
抱歉我之前那么唠叨你买这地方
I'm sorry I was so bitchy about you buying this place.

467
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,500
我错了  这里人山人海
I was wrong. This place is packed.

468
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,350
我觉得这里会很火的
I think we have a hit on our hands.

469
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,260
我知道  想想我开始对酒水食物
I know. And imagine how much money we'll make

470
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,600
收费以后我们能赚多少吧
once I start charging for food and drinks.

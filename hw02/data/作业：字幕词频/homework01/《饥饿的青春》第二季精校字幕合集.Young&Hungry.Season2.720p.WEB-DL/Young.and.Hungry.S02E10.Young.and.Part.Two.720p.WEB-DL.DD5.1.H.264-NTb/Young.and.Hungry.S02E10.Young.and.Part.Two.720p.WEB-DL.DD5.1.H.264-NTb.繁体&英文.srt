00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,640
的青春

10
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,640
第二季  第十集

11
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,140
《饑餓的青春》前情提要
Previously on Young & Hungry.

12
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,330
我愛你
I love you.

13
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,000
你怎么知道誰是真命天子
How do you know which one is the one?

14
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,390
很簡單  是吻
It's simple. It's the kiss.

15
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,860
庫珀搬到樓上了  現在我"樓下"開始
Cooper moved in upstairs, and now I'm starting

16
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,710
對喬什有感覺了
to feel things for Josh downstairs.

17
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,870
媽呀
Oh, my damn.

18
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,890
喬什  是你
Josh... it's you.

19
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,740
加比  在你被喬什的"我愛你"迷惑前
Gabi, before you fall for Josh's big "I love you,"

20
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,870
你該知道他三個月前就覺得自己愛你了
You should know that he thought he loved you three months ago.

21
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,140
然后  當他改變了主意
And then when he changed his mind,

22
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,230
又說服所有人騙你
convinced everyone to lie to you about it.

23
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,080
-是真的嗎  -加比  一切我都能解釋
- Is that true? - Gabi, I can explain everything.

24
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,720
-天啊  是真的  -加比  等等
- Oh my god, it is true. - Gabi, wait.

25
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,220
不  你給我讓開
No, get the hell away from me.

26
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,960
加比  你在嗎
Gabi, are you in here?

27
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,080
該死  天啊
Damn it. Oh, my god!

28
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,570
別這樣嚇我  我差點揍你了
Don't scare me like that! I almost went Lil' So-so on your ass.

29
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,940
加比  我們得談談  我給你發了一千條短信
Gabi, we need to talk. I sent you, like, a thousand texts.

30
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,530
這是雪上加霜
Well, then you added insult to injury

31
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,690
因為我沒有不限量短信套餐
because I don't have unlimited texting.

32
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,930
加比  我一知道喬什喜歡你
Gabi, I wanted to tell you about Josh

33
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,140
就想跟你說
the second that I found out.

34
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,500
但你好像和庫珀很開心
But you seemed so happy with Cooper,

35
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,600
我就是不忍心告訴你[沒有心]
I just-- I didn't have the heart.

36
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,750
你承認自己沒良心啦
So you admit you have no heart.

37
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,080
你有權對我生氣  好嗎
Look, you have every right to be mad at me. Okay?

38
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,940
雖然我的本意是好的
Even though my intentions were good,

39
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,470
這很愚蠢  我負全責
it was stupid and I take full responsibility.

40
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,230
也許你該為你的行為
And maybe you should take some responsibility

41
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,150
負一些責
for how you've been acting.

42
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,340
什么
What?

43
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,520
你該為你的行為
You should take some responsibility

44
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,260
負一些責
for how you've been acting.

45
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,600
我的行為嗎
How I've been acting?

46
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,550
我愛喬什  不  我愛庫珀
"I love Josh. No, I love Cooper.

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,320
他是真命天子  不  他才是
"He's the one. No, he's the one.

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,890
我有兩個真命天子
I have two ones."

49
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,260
首先  那一點也不像我
Okay, first of all, that sounds nothing like me.

50
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,490
其次
And second of all-- -

51
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,470
你得趕走門口那個人
you need to get rid of whoever is at that door.

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,060
好吧  從現在開始我挺你
Okay. From now on, I got your back.

53
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,240
-她在嗎  -不在
- Is she here? - Nope!

54
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,980
-我知道她在  -你怎么知道的
- I know she's here. - How?

55
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,550
我看見她了
I see her.

56
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,980
-加比  我們得談談  -不談  不要鬧劇了
- Gabi, we need to talk. - No. No more talking, no more drama.

57
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,240
我需要的是讓今晚結束
What I need is for this night to end.

58
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,880
那可不是結束的聲音
That is not the sound of ending!

59
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,300
-加比  我們得談談  -三個月來
- Gabi, we need to talk. - For three months,

60
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,440
你們一句話都沒跟我說  現在你倆閉不了嘴了
none of you said a word to me. And now none of you can shut up!

61
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,640
聽到了嗎  庫珀
You hear that, Cooper?

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,650
她不想跟你說話  拜拜了您啊
She doesn't want to talk to you. So buh-bye now.

63
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,470
去你的  拜拜了您啊
Don't buh-bye me. Buh-bye you.

64
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,440
-后退  -你才后退
- Hey, back off. - You back off.

65
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,490
你倆什么毛病啊
What is wrong with you two?

66
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,450
對不起  我過分了
I'm sorry, that was out of line.

67
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,680
是的
It was.

68
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,250
-這樣也是  -搞什么
- So is this. - What the hell?

69
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,530
喬什  住手
Josh, stop!

70
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,860
好吧  夠了
Okay, that's it.

71
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,070
你們快住手
Oh my god, you guys, stop!

72
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,920
-不要弄壞攪拌機  -天啊
- Not the blender! - Oh, my god!

73
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,060
住手  住手  住手
Stop! Stop! Stop!

74
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,620
別弄倒燭臺
Not the votives!

75
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,730
住手
Stop!

76
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,320
天啊  你們得停止打架  好嗎
Oh, my god! Okay, you need to stop fighting, all right?

77
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,900
因為你們打得太挫了  好丟人
Because you're bad at it, and it's embarrassing!

78
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,750
我受不了了  好嗎
I can't take this anymore. Okay?

79
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,060
我受夠了  你倆我都受夠了
I'm-- I'm done. I'm done with both of you.

80
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,610
好嗎  你們得出去
All right? You need to get out.

81
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,330
明天上班時見嗎
So I'll see you at work tomorrow?

82
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,840
是的  但我會遲到的
Yes, but I will be late.

87
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,470
醒醒  加比
Wake up, Gabi,

88
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,920
你最好的朋友要帶你去吃早餐...
'cause your best friend is taking you to breakfast at--

89
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,230
早上好
Good morning!

90
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,540
你看起來精力充沛  怎么了
You seem peppy. Why?

91
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,000
因為那些謊言和背叛  我睡不著
Well, thanks to all the lies and betrayal, I couldn't sleep.

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
所以我出去散了個步
So I took one of those

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,880
想著我這輩子都干了些啥啊
"What am I doing with my life" walks,

94
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,070
我意識到你說得對
and I realized you were right.

95
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,900
我表現得像是浪漫喜劇里為情所困的姑娘
I've been acting like some lovesick girl in a rom-com

96
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,990
而沒有追逐我的夢想
instead of following my dreams.

97
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,460
我不是茱莉亞·羅伯茨  而是茱莉亞·蔡爾德
I'm not Julia Roberts, I'm Julia Child.

98
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,550
然后突然想到  達比
And then it hit me. D'arby.

99
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,290
聲音很尖的流浪漢嗎
The homeless guy with the really high-pitched voice?

100
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,790
不  那是達布尼
No, no, no, that's Dabney.

101
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,180
我說的是查爾斯·達比
I'm talking about Charles D'arby,

102
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,090
舊金山最有名的廚師
One of the most famous chefs in San Francisco.

103
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,580
每年他都會舉辦一場比賽  尋找一名學徒
Every year, he has a contest to find an apprentice to work

104
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,230
在他瑞士的米其林星級餐廳工作  我申請了
at his Michelin-starred restaurant in Switzerland, and I applied!

105
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,500
"你和喬什的工作呢"  你問
"What about your job with Josh," You ask?

106
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,400
我先去上班  直到我得到學徒的工作
Well, I'm keeping it until I get the apprenticeship,

107
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,670
我會得到的
and I am getting it.

108
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,450
我已經提交了三份原創食譜
I already submitted three original recipes,

109
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,500
個人情況說明
a personal statement,

110
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,980
和三封偽造的推薦信
and three fake references.

111
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,810
我只用拍一段刀工的視頻了
All I have left to do is make a video of my knife skills.

112
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,070
我喝了好多咖啡啊
Man, I've had a lot of coffee.

113
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,830
-親愛的  真抱歉  -沒必要
- Baby, I am so sorry. - Not necessary.

114
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,040
我再也不氣你對我撒謊喬什的事了
I am no longer angry with you for lying to me about Josh.

115
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,680
因為你是被他強迫騙我的
Because you were coerced by him into deceiving me.

116
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,550
艾略特  我原諒你
And Elliot, I forgive you

117
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,630
因為你并沒有背叛我
because you didn't really betray me as a friend

118
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,670
畢竟你一開始就不怎么喜歡我
since you never really liked me in the first place.

119
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,830
太對了
That is so true.

120
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,040
關鍵是...
The important thing is...

121
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,600
我要結婚了  而你不在賓客名單上
I'm getting married, and you're not invited.

122
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,230
棒棒噠
Yay!

123
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,700
加比來了嗎
Did I hear Gabi?

124
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,250
尤蘭達  能讓我們單獨待一會嗎
Hey, Yolanda, um, would you mind giving us a minute?

125
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,370
喬什  別這樣  我不想討論這事
Josh, no, I don't want to talk.

126
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,850
尤蘭達  作為我的朋友  請你留下
Yolanda, as my friend, I'm asking you to stay.

127
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,050
-沒問題  -尤蘭達  作為你的老板
- Oh, sure. - Yolanda, as your boss,

128
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,850
請你離開
I'm asking you to leave.

129
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,990
-好的  -你欠我的
- Yep. - You owe me.

130
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,230
-對  -我可是付工資給你的人
- Yep. - I pay you.

131
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,920
抱歉  加比  錢更重要
Sorry, Gabi, monies before honeys.

132
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,410
加比  我們得談談
Gabi, we need to talk.

133
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,890
是啊  早餐你想吃什么
Yes, we do. What would you like for breakfast?

134
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,060
我想來一份美味的
I would like a delicious plate

135
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,650
"請坐下來  聽聽這個"
of please sit down and listen to this.

136
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,940
-喬什  -我就想讓你
- Josh! - Look, it's just a voice mail

137
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,200
聽一通語音留言  僅此而已
I want you to hear. That's it.

138
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,720
好吧
Fine.

139
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,800
昨晚在我取消婚禮之后
Last night after I called off my wedding,

140
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,400
我想見的人是你
you're the person that I wanted to see.

141
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,640
我甚至去你家  拿著玫瑰跑上逃生梯
I even ran up your fire escape with roses.

142
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,350
我不知道該說什么
Um, I don't know what I was gonna say,

143
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,040
但知道我想見你
but I knew that I needed to see you

144
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,900
然后我看到了庫珀和你在一起
and then I saw Cooper and you,

145
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,610
要是你和庫珀在一起很幸福
and look, if you're happy with Cooper,

146
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,870
就當沒收到過這條消息
just disregard this whole message.

147
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,280
但要是你覺得或許和我在一起會更幸福的話
But if you think you might, like, be happier with me,

148
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,270
給我回電  另外  我是喬什
call me back. This is Josh, by the way.

149
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,080
天吶  喬什
Oh, my God. Josh.

150
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,520
我知道  很情真意切吧
I know. Pretty intense.

151
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,150
你真的留了那通留言嗎
Did you really leave me that message?

152
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,180
當然
Sure did.

153
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,240
我能問你點事嗎
Can I ask you something?

154
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,600
-問吧  -為什么我從來沒有收到過呢
- Anything. - How come I never got it?

155
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,920
這個問題問得好
Well, good question.

156
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,870
還有  為什么我的語音消息會在你電腦里呢
And, uh, how come my message is on your computer?

157
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,960
又是一個好問題
Another good question.

158
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,560
會不會是因為你開始和別的人約會
Is it possible that you tricked me into giving you my phone,

159
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,530
所以你騙我  讓我把手機給你
so that you could delete the message before I got it

160
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,110
這樣一來  你就能在我看到前把它刪了
because you started dating someone new?

161
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,260
什么
What?

162
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,350
猜得有點兒對
That's a little bit of a reach.

163
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,590
加比  我...我看到你和庫珀在一起
Gabi, I-- I saw you with Cooper.

164
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,570
我不想破壞你的生活
I didn't want to screw up your life.

165
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,800
是啊  那時你和吉莉在一起
Yeah, well, you were with Jilly,

166
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,380
或許你只是不想破壞你自己的生活
so maybe you just didn't want to screw up your own life.

167
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,580
現在  早餐你想吃什么
Now, what do you want for breakfast?

168
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,140
我想聽到你說"我們在一起吧"
What I want is to hear you say we're gonna be together.

169
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,980
-不可能  -為什么  你還和庫珀在一起嗎
- No! - Why, you're staying with Cooper?

170
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,190
天吶  不  喬什...
Oh, my God! No, Josh...

171
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,530
我受不了了  好嗎  我辭職
I can't take this. Okay? I quit.

172
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,020
-什么  -我忍不下去了
- What? - I can't do this anymore.

173
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,520
好嗎  我受不了每天來上班
Okay? I can't come to work

174
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,050
都要和你進行一番這樣的對話
and go through this with you every single day!

175
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,770
加比  你不能辭職
Gabi, you can't quit.

176
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,030
你打算做什么
What are you gonna do?

177
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,930
告訴你吧
Well, for your information,

178
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,470
我要給非常著名的查爾斯·達比大廚
I have an apprenticeship with the very famous

179
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,240
當學徒
Chef Charles D'arby.

180
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,600
真的嗎
You do?

181
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,740
其實還算不上學徒
Well, it's-- it's not so much an apprenticeship

182
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,750
只參加一場學徒面試
as it is an audition for an apprenticeship.

183
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,530
-是嗎  -其實還沒參加面試
- It is? - Well, it's-- it's not so much an audition

184
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,400
只申請參加了招收學徒的
as it is an application for an audition

185
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,080
面試活動
that could lead to an apprenticeship.

186
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,680
所以你還沒當上
So you have nothing?

187
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,200
我本可以騙你說我當上了
Well, I could've lied and said I had something,

188
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,710
但我可不像你  喬什
but I'm not you, Josh.

189
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,340
再見
Goodbye.

190
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,300
華夫餅  我該說早餐想吃華夫餅的
Waffles. I should have said I wanted waffles for breakfast.

191
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,610
加比  你在外面干什么
Gabi, what are you doing out here?

192
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,060
我在等面試資格的通知
I'm waiting to hear if I got the audition.

193
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,380
我的手機信號只有在這里才滿格
And this is the only place where I get full bars.

194
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,340
-達布尼  -你好
- Oh! Hey, Dabney - Hi!

195
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,550
我在網上看了當學徒的要求
So, you know, I was reading about that apprenticeship online.

196
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,480
我沒想到得到一個面試的機會是這么難
And I didn't realize how hard it was to get an audition.

197
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,760
-索菲亞  我會得到的  -當然
- Sofia, I'm going to get this. - Oh, no, of course. No.

198
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,360
我完全相信你會的
I 1000% believe you will get this.

199
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,330
但萬一沒成  也沒有那么糟
But, um, in case you don't, it's not the end of the world.

200
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,130
懂嗎  你仍然可以在喬什那里上班
You know? You still have your job at Josh's.

201
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,190
-我辭職了  -什么
- I quit Josh's. - What?

202
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,760
我知道這很瘋狂
I know, it seems crazy.

203
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,790
但經歷了這一切之后
But the thought of working for him

204
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,770
為他工作感覺太怪了
after everything we've been though seems just as crazy.

205
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,700
好吧  你確定嗎  因為你好像
Okay, are you sure? Because you have, like,

206
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,160
根本沒有機會參加那場高級面試
zero percent chance of getting that fancy apprenticeship.

207
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,480
你剛剛才說你相信我的實力
Hey! You just said that you believed in me!

208
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,110
天吶  我們得靠賣頭發付房租了
Oh, my God, we're gonna have to sell our hair to pay rent!

209
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,510
來電話了
It's ringing!

210
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,280
-是組委會  -打開揚聲器
- It's them. - Put it on speaker.

211
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,310
好的
Okay.

212
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,680
喂
Hello?

213
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,610
戴蒙德小姐  我是達比大廚
Miss Diamond, this is Chef D'arby.

214
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,110
達比大廚  我是戴蒙德小姐
Chef D'arby, this is Miss Diamond.

215
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,300
你被選中參加我的學徒面試了
You have been chosen to audition for my apprenticeship.

216
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,430
明早九點整  希望你準時出席
We'll expect to see you tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

217
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,000
天吶  我會準時到的  非常感謝
Oh, my God. I will be there. Thank you so much!

218
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,180
我知道你能行的
I knew you'd get it!

219
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,290
祝賀你
Congratulations!

220
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,360
謝謝  達布尼
Thanks, Dabney!

221
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,680
天吶  我的媽呀
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!

222
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,620
冷靜  這時候得集中思想
Okay, settle down. It's time to focus.

223
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,430
我會的  索菲亞  看看這個地方
I am focused. Sofia, look at this place.

224
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,730
那位是達比大廚
That's Chef D'arby.

225
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,560
英國人就是會長啊
They sure know how to grow them in England.

226
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,350
"拜托  先生  能再給我點嗎"
Please sir, can I have some more?

227
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,350
{\an8}《霧都孤兒》經典臺詞

228
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,240
-你能行的  -好的
- Look, you can do this. - Okay.

229
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,770
-祝你好運  -謝謝
- Good luck. - Thanks.

230
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,320
達比大廚  我是加比·戴蒙德
Oh, Chef D'arby, I'm Gabi Diamond.

231
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,170
謝謝你給我這次機會
Thank you so much for this opportunity.

232
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,470
占我便宜的機會嗎
The opportunity to touch me inappropriately?

233
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,660
抱歉  聽著  我就一個小問題
Oh, sorry. Uh, listen, I just had a quick question.

234
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,710
是什么讓我進面試的
What was it that actually got me the audition?

235
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,510
我的菜譜嗎  還是我的刀工
Was it my recipes? Was it my knife skills?

236
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,790
實際上  是卡明斯基先生
Actually, it was Mr. Kaminski.

237
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,810
-你幫我進的面試嗎  -不用謝
- You got me this audition? - You're welcome.

238
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,540
-你好大的膽子  -我以為你想進啊
- How could you? - I thought that's what you wanted.

239
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,950
不  我想的是靠自己進
No! What I wanted was to do it myself.

240
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,800
我是想幫你實現你的夢想
Look, I was just trying to help you get your dream.

241
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,340
沒錯  喬什  我的夢想
Yeah, exactly, Josh. My dream. Mine.

242
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,710
我以為自己是在做好事
I thought I was doing something nice.

243
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,840
拜托  你就是想贏回我罷了
Please, you were just trying to win me back!

244
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,750
真的嗎  這聽著像是個好計劃嗎
Really? Does that sound like a good plan?

245
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,410
幫你拿到在瑞士的學徒資格
To help you get an internship in Switzerland

246
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,680
好讓你離開我半年嗎
that takes you away from me for six months?

247
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,930
-這怎么就能贏回你了  -我不知道  喬什
- How is that getting you back? - I don't know, Josh.

248
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,460
但你做的所有事都讓我覺得
But all you've done is made me realize

249
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,270
我不該在這里
that I'm not supposed to be here.

250
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,230
各位  各就各位
Everybody, take your places.

251
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,270
我們要開始了
We are about to begin.

252
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,370
我做的就是幫你拿到面試資格
Look, all I did was get you the audition.

253
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,660
贏不贏就看你自己了
It's up to you to win it.

254
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,570
你們要做的菜是
And the dish you will be preparing is...

255
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,340
波爾多紅酒醬汁森林牛排
filet de boeuf forestiere with bordelaise sauce

256
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,050
配小土豆[法語]
and petit gratin dauphinois.

257
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,080
-你們有兩個小時  -光翻這話就得兩小時吧
- You have two hours. - I need two hours to translate that.

258
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,940
芮娜德小姐  你的紅酒醬汁
Now, Ms. Renard, the bordelaise ?

259
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,710
你的  哈珀先生
You, Mr. Harper.

260
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,000
到你了  戴蒙德小姐
On to you, Miss Diamond.

261
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,200
濃稠度有點問題哈
Bit of a consistency problem there.

262
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,280
我能補救的  可以的
Well, I can fix it, I can fix it.

263
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,860
行了  戴蒙德小姐  你走吧
It's over, Miss Diamond. Off you go!

264
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,650
什么  我走吧  我走吧
What? Off I go? Off I go?

265
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,990
我走了
Off I go...

266
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,310
走開
Go away!

267
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,050
庫珀
Oh. Cooper.

268
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,130
別生氣
Don't be upset.

269
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,710
我就是來拿自己東西  把鑰匙還給你
I just came to grab my stuff, drop off your key.

270
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,710
我不是批評你
Not to be judgey,

271
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,820
但你鼻子上那白色東西是什么
but what is the white stuff under your nose?

272
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,260
是我最愛的毒品  糖霜
It's my drug of choice: frosting.

273
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,510
-你還好嗎  -是啊  不能再糟了
- Are you okay? - Oh, yeah. Never worse.

274
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,750
-你呢  -我女朋友和我最好的朋友都跑了
- How are you? - Well, I lost my girlfriend and my best friend.

275
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,990
那兩個都是你
Those are both you, by the way.

276
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,540
庫珀  真的很抱歉最后事情成這樣
Cooper, I'm... I'm so sorry for the way things ended.

277
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,240
不  加比  是我很抱歉
No, Gabi, I'm sorry.

278
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,550
你那么棒
You're amazing.

279
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,110
知道嗎  你像是在這里
You know, you're, like, up here.

280
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,340
而我在這里
And I'm down here.

281
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,310
像我這樣的人永遠追不到你那么好的姑娘
And a guy down here never gets the girl up here.

282
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,380
所以當我發現喬什對你有感覺
So when I found out Josh had feelings for you,

283
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,250
我慌了
I panicked.

284
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,110
覺得如果你知道了  我會失去你
I thought if you found out, I'd lose you.

285
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,870
-庫珀  你不用跟我說這些  -我要說
- Cooper, you don't have to tell me all this. - Yes, I do.

286
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,630
我可以接受我們不在一起
I can accept us not being together,

287
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,810
不能接受的是我在KTV的表現
what I can't accept is the way I acted at the karaoke bar.

288
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,700
我想要你知道我比那樣要好
I need you to know that I'm better than that.

289
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,490
你當然好了
Of course you are.

290
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,040
如果不是  那我也不可能愛上你
If you weren't, then I wouldn't have fallen in love with you.

291
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,690
我也從來沒有要存心傷害你
And I never meant to hurt you.

292
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,000
我知道
I know.

293
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,780
你額頭上也有糖霜
Frosting's up there, too.

294
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,380
為什么
Why?

295
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,110
你好啊  索菲亞
Oh! Hey, Sofia.

296
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,870
我就是隨手做個
I'm just whipping up a little midnight snack

297
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,370
波爾多紅酒醬汁森林牛排
of filet de boeuf forestiere with bordelaise sauce

298
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,260
配小土豆當宵夜
and petit gratin dauphinois.

299
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,300
為什么
Why?

300
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,080
因為我的實力不止面試那樣  索菲亞
Because I'm better than that audition, Sofia.

301
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,250
是因為庫珀
It's because of Cooper.

302
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,710
他即使知道我們不會復合
Even though he knew we weren't gonna get back together,

303
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,280
也還是想要挽回印象
he still wanted to redeem himself.

304
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,100
我也要對達比大廚這么做
And that's what I have to do with Chef D'arby.

305
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,320
拿不到學徒資格我無所謂
I'm fine with not getting the apprenticeship.

306
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,750
有所謂的是達比大廚只因為我的
What I'm not fine with is Chef D'arby only remembering me

307
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,690
-爛醬汁記住了我  -親愛的
- for my ploppy sauce. - Oh, sweetie.

308
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,490
我肯定他根本沒想過你
I'm sure he's barely thought about you at all.

309
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,040
他會記住我的  好嗎
Well, he's going to remember me, okay?

310
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,970
我得不到工作  但還是能贏回名聲
I didn't get the job, but I can get my reputation back.

311
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,630
這一次  我的牛肉要燥翻天
And this time, my boeuf will raise the roof.

312
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,230
如果你還能再見到他  給他我電話
Well, if you're gonna see him again, give him my number.

313
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,780
我想嘗嘗他的"肉"
I'd like a bite of his boeuf.

314
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,520
達比大廚  抱歉打擾你
Chef D'arby, I'm really sorry to interrupt.

315
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,320
我能冒昧問下大師在做什么佳肴嗎
Oh, may I ask what amazing dish the maestro is preparing?

316
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,520
雞蛋
Eggs.

317
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,520
聽著  我知道我的醬汁在該
Well, listen, I know my sauce went plop-plop

318
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,250
絲般順滑的時候成了團
when it should have gone whoosh.

319
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,570
我也不指望您能改變主意
And I don't expect you to change your mind,

320
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,030
但我不能接受自己明顯沒盡力的作品
but I couldn't live with myself knowing I didn't do my best work.

321
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,280
所以請允許我呈現
So, may I now present...

322
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,900
波爾多紅酒醬汁森林牛排
filet de boeuf forestiere with bordelaise sauce

323
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,360
配小土豆
and petit gratin dauphinois.

324
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,110
絲般順滑
Whoosh.

325
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,770
我希望這頭牛的死法
I hope this cow was slaughtered more humanely

326
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,930
能比你說出的那些法語更人道
than how you just slaughtered the French language.

327
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,290
是法語啊
Oh, it's French!

328
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,480
不錯
Well done.

329
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,500
在我辦比賽的十年里
In the ten years since I've had this competition,

330
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,190
沒一個選手有勇氣
not a single contestant has had the courage

331
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,660
能再來找我證明自己
to try and redeem themselves with me.

332
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,610
說真的  達比大廚  我這樣不是為了你
Well, honestly, Chef D'arby, I didn't do it for you.

333
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,350
-是為我自己  -我很佩服
- I did it for me. - Well, I'm impressed.

334
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,870
希望明年能見到你  戴蒙德大廚
I hope to see you again next year, Chef Diamond.

335
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,610
你是剛喊我大廚嗎
Did you just call me chef?

336
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,730
我是大廚了  我是大廚了
I'm a chef, I'm a chef!

337
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,380
-不許抱我  -我們求異存同嘛
- No hugging. - Disagree to disagree.

338
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,770
-加比  -謝謝你
- Gabi. - Thank you.

339
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,670
-什么  -我之前很氣你干預我的生活
- What? - I was so mad at you for meddling in my life,

340
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,320
我該只說謝謝你就好的
and I should've just said thank you.

341
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,000
-你是拿到學徒資格了嗎  -不是
- So, you got the apprenticeship? - Not even close.

342
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,510
不過多虧了你  我有了失敗的機會
But thanks to you, I got the chance to fail,

343
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,450
也讓我有了
which gave me the chance

344
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,820
振作起來  向查爾斯·達比證明
to pick myself up and prove to Charles D'arby

345
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,720
自己當得起"大廚"名號的機會
that I'm worthy of the title chef.

346
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,130
挺好的
Good for you.

347
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,350
你還專程來說謝謝真是很好
It was nice of you to come by and say thanks...

348
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,990
等等  還有呢
Wait. Wait, wait. There's more.

349
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:51,900
說到了第二次機會  不如你也給我一個吧
In the spirit of second chances, how about you give me one?

350
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,780
喬什  我真的很想做你的...
Josh, I really wanna be your--

351
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,370
-女朋友  -大廚
- Girlfriend. - Chef.

352
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,640
沒錯  大廚
Yes, chef.

353
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,390
你要再做我大廚我很歡迎
I would love to have you as my chef again.

354
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,630
-我好像聽到了"女朋友"  -你聽到了嗎
- I think I heard "girlfriend." - Did you hear that?

355
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,960
我還想你說的"大廚"聲音夠大
I was hoping you said chef loud enough

356
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,450
然后只聽成了"大廚朋友"呢
so all you heard was "chef-friend."

357
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,670
喬什  我們之間的感覺的確無法否認
Listen, Josh, what we have between us is undeniable.

358
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,890
但也瘋狂  混亂又讓人迷惑
But it's also crazy and messy and confusing--

359
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,590
-跟我約一次會吧  -什么
- Go on a date with me. - What?

360
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,550
加比  我們經歷了那么多事
Gabi, you and I have been through so much,

361
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,480
但卻從沒有簡單的約過一次會
but the one thing we've never done is go on a simple date.

362
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,950
所以...你愿意嗎
So... will you?

363
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,280
就算你拒絕  我還是用你的
Look, you're still gonna have a job even if you say no.

364
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,710
但我覺得我們之間也值得有第二次機會
But I think you and I deserve a second chance, too.

365
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,980
你這是答應還是...
Is that a yes or...?

366
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,070
這是個有答應趨勢的感嘆
It's a "huh" with "yes" tendencies.

367
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,830
好  那我們今晚在艾略特和埃蘭的訂婚派對見吧
Okay. I'll see you tonight at Elliot and Alan's engagement party?

368
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,670
-沒問題  -之后帶你去吃晚餐
- Absolutely. - Take you to dinner afterwards?

369
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,080
我會考慮的
I will think about it.

370
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,530
今晚見
I'll see you tonight.

371
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,470
她會考慮的
She's gonna think about it!

372
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,810
-我看起來怎么樣  -美翻了
- How do I look? - Amazing!

373
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
我們絕對是那個基佬訂婚派對上
I'm pretty sure we're gonna be the two cutest girls

374
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,460
最美的兩個姑娘
at that gay engagement party.

375
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,800
我很高興事情是這么發展的
You know, I'm really happy about the way this all turned out.

376
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,030
那句話說得真對
I think it's really true,

377
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,700
當上帝關上了一扇門  會打開一扇窗
when god closes a door, he opens a window.

378
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,980
-喂  -戴蒙德小姐  我是達比大廚
- Hello? - Miss Diamond, this is Chef D'arby.

379
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,040
達比大廚  你好  有事嗎
Chef D'arby? Oh, hello, what can I do for you?

380
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,940
我發現比賽的
It has come to my attention

381
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,090
冠軍是作弊贏得的資格
that the winner of the competition cheated.

382
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,240
她提前知曉了試菜內容
She found out the audition dish in advance.

383
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,130
通常  我會把機會給第二名
Normally, I'd offer the position to the first runner-up,

384
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,300
但我對你印象深刻
but I was so impressed by you,

385
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,550
決定把學徒機會給你
I've decided to offer you the apprenticeship.

386
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,820
-真的嗎  -我知道時間倉促
- Really? - I know this is short notice,

387
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,720
但我們希望你能連夜飛來蘇黎世
but we need you on the red eye to Zurich tonight.

388
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,310
周一早上我們廚房見
I'm expecting you in the kitchen Monday morning.

389
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,550
恭喜你  大廚
Congratulations, Chef.

390
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,080
謝謝  謝謝  謝謝
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

391
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,010
-天啊  -天啊  你成功了
- Oh, my god! - Oh, my god! You did it!

392
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,070
我成功了
I did it!

393
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,040
等等  喬什怎么辦
Wait, wait, wait. What about Josh?

394
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,360
-學徒資格怎么辦  -喬什  學徒
- What about the apprenticeship? - Oh! Josh, the apprenticeship.

395
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,370
喬什  學徒  我怎么突然有這么多選擇了
Josh, the apprenticeship. How do I suddenly have so many options?

396
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:11,090
上帝打開了那么多窗戶干嘛
God opened too many windows. Why did you open so many windows?

397
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,500
我要怎么辦  索菲亞
What am I gonna do, Sofia?

398
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,600
茱莉亞會怎么做
What would Julia do?

399
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,090
茱莉亞·羅伯茨還是蔡爾德
Roberts or Child?

400
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,350
蔡爾德  做菜的那個
Child. Child! The one who cooks!

401

11
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,140
Previously on Young & Hungry.

12
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,330
I love you.

13
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,000
How do you know which one is the one?

14
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,390
It's simple. It's the kiss.

15
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,860
Cooper moved in upstairs, and now I'm starting

16
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,710
to feel things for Josh downstairs.

17
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,870
Oh, my damn.

18
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,890
Josh... it's you.

19
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,740
Gabi, before you fall for Josh's big "I love you,"

20
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,870
You should know that he thought he loved you three months ago.

21
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,140
And then when he changed his mind,

22
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,230
convinced everyone to lie to you about it.

23
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,080
- Is that true? - Gabi, I can explain everything.

24
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,720
- Oh my god, it is true. - Gabi, wait.

25
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,220
No, get the hell away from me.

26
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,960
Gabi, are you in here?

27
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,080
Damn it. Oh, my god!

28
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,570
Don't scare me like that! I almost went Lil' So-so on your ass.

29
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,940
Gabi, we need to talk. I sent you, like, a thousand texts.

30
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,530
Well, then you added insult to injury

31
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,690
because I don't have unlimited texting.

32
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,930
Gabi, I wanted to tell you about Josh

33
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,140
the second that I found out.

34
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,500
But you seemed so happy with Cooper,

35
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,600
I just-- I didn't have the heart.

36
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,750
So you admit you have no heart.

37
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,080
Look, you have every right to be mad at me. Okay?

38
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,940
Even though my intentions were good,

39
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,470
it was stupid and I take full responsibility.

40
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,230
And maybe you should take some responsibility

41
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,150
for how you've been acting.

42
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,340
What?

43
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,520
You should take some responsibility

44
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,260
for how you've been acting.

45
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,600
How I've been acting?

46
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,550
"I love Josh. No, I love Cooper.

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,320
"He's the one. No, he's the one.

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,890
I have two ones."

49
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,260
Okay, first of all, that sounds nothing like me.

50
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,490
And second of all-- -

51
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,470
you need to get rid of whoever is at that door.

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,060
Okay. From now on, I got your back.

53
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,240
- Is she here? - Nope!

54
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,980
- I know she's here. - How?

55
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,550
I see her.

56
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,980
- Gabi, we need to talk. - No. No more talking, no more drama.

57
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,240
What I need is for this night to end.

58
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,880
That is not the sound of ending!

59
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,300
- Gabi, we need to talk. - For three months,

60
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,440
none of you said a word to me. And now none of you can shut up!

61
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,640
You hear that, Cooper?

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,650
She doesn't want to talk to you. So buh-bye now.

63
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,470
Don't buh-bye me. Buh-bye you.

64
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,440
- Hey, back off. - You back off.

65
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,490
What is wrong with you two?

66
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,450
I'm sorry, that was out of line.

67
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,680
It was.

68
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,250
- So is this. - What the hell?

69
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,530
Josh, stop!

70
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,860
Okay, that's it.

71
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,070
Oh my god, you guys, stop!

72
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,920
- Not the blender! - Oh, my god!

73
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,060
Stop! Stop! Stop!

74
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,620
Not the votives!

75
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,730
Stop!

76
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,320
Oh, my god! Okay, you need to stop fighting, all right?

77
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,900
Because you're bad at it, and it's embarrassing!

78
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,750
I can't take this anymore. Okay?

79
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,060
I'm-- I'm done. I'm done with both of you.

80
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,610
All right? You need to get out.

81
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,330
So I'll see you at work tomorrow?

82
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,840
Yes, but I will be late.

87
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,470
Wake up, Gabi,

88
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,920
'cause your best friend is taking you to breakfast at--

89
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,230
Good morning!

90
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,540
You seem peppy. Why?

91
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, thanks to all the lies and betrayal, I couldn't sleep.

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So I took one of those

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,880
"What am I doing with my life" walks,

94
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,070
and I realized you were right.

95
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,900
I've been acting like some lovesick girl in a rom-com

96
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,990
instead of following my dreams.

97
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,460
I'm not Julia Roberts, I'm Julia Child.

98
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,550
And then it hit me. D'arby.

99
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,290
The homeless guy with the really high-pitched voice?

100
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,790
No, no, no, that's Dabney.

101
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,180
I'm talking about Charles D'arby,

102
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,090
One of the most famous chefs in San Francisco.

103
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,580
Every year, he has a contest to find an apprentice to work

104
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,230
at his Michelin-starred restaurant in Switzerland, and I applied!

105
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,500
"What about your job with Josh," You ask?

106
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,400
Well, I'm keeping it until I get the apprenticeship,

107
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,670
and I am getting it.

108
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,450
I already submitted three original recipes,

109
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,500
a personal statement,

110
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,980
and three fake references.

111
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,810
All I have left to do is make a video of my knife skills.

112
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,070
Man, I've had a lot of coffee.

113
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,830
- Baby, I am so sorry. - Not necessary.

114
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,040
I am no longer angry with you for lying to me about Josh.

115
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,680
Because you were coerced by him into deceiving me.

116
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,550
And Elliot, I forgive you

117
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,630
because you didn't really betray me as a friend

118
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,670
since you never really liked me in the first place.

119
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,830
That is so true.

120
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,040
The important thing is...

121
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,600
I'm getting married, and you're not invited.

122
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,230
Yay!

123
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,700
Did I hear Gabi?

124
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,250
Hey, Yolanda, um, would you mind giving us a minute?

125
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,370
Josh, no, I don't want to talk.

126
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,850
Yolanda, as my friend, I'm asking you to stay.

127
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,050
- Oh, sure. - Yolanda, as your boss,

128
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,850
I'm asking you to leave.

129
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,990
- Yep. - You owe me.

130
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,230
- Yep. - I pay you.

131
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,920
Sorry, Gabi, monies before honeys.

132
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,410
Gabi, we need to talk.

133
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,890
Yes, we do. What would you like for breakfast?

134
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,060
I would like a delicious plate

135
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,650
of please sit down and listen to this.

136
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,940
- Josh! - Look, it's just a voice mail

137
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,200
I want you to hear. That's it.

138
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,720
Fine.

139
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,800
Last night after I called off my wedding,

140
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,400
you're the person that I wanted to see.

141
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,640
I even ran up your fire escape with roses.

142
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,350
Um, I don't know what I was gonna say,

143
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,040
but I knew that I needed to see you

144
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,900
and then I saw Cooper and you,

145
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,610
and look, if you're happy with Cooper,

146
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,870
just disregard this whole message.

147
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,280
But if you think you might, like, be happier with me,

148
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,270
call me back. This is Josh, by the way.

149
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,080
Oh, my God. Josh.

150
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,520
I know. Pretty intense.

151
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,150
Did you really leave me that message?

152
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,180
Sure did.

153
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,240
Can I ask you something?

154
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,600
- Anything. - How come I never got it?

155
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,920
Well, good question.

156
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,870
And, uh, how come my message is on your computer?

157
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,960
Another good question.

158
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,560
Is it possible that you tricked me into giving you my phone,

159
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,530
so that you could delete the message before I got it

160
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,110
because you started dating someone new?

161
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,260
What?

162
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,350
That's a little bit of a reach.

163
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,590
Gabi, I-- I saw you with Cooper.

164
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,570
I didn't want to screw up your life.

165
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,800
Yeah, well, you were with Jilly,

166
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,380
so maybe you just didn't want to screw up your own life.

167
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,580
Now, what do you want for breakfast?

168
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,140
What I want is to hear you say we're gonna be together.

169
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,980
- No! - Why, you're staying with Cooper?

170
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,190
Oh, my God! No, Josh...

171
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,530
I can't take this. Okay? I quit.

172
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,020
- What? - I can't do this anymore.

173
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,520
Okay? I can't come to work

174
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,050
and go through this with you every single day!

175
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,770
Gabi, you can't quit.

176
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,030
What are you gonna do?

177
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,930
Well, for your information,

178
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,470
I have an apprenticeship with the very famous

179
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,240
Chef Charles D'arby.

180
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,600
You do?

181
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,740
Well, it's-- it's not so much an apprenticeship

182
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,750
as it is an audition for an apprenticeship.

183
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,530
- It is? - Well, it's-- it's not so much an audition

184
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,400
as it is an application for an audition

185
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,080
that could lead to an apprenticeship.

186
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,680
So you have nothing?

187
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,200
Well, I could've lied and said I had something,

188
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,710
but I'm not you, Josh.

189
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,340
Goodbye.

190
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,300
Waffles. I should have said I wanted waffles for breakfast.

191
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,610
Gabi, what are you doing out here?

192
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,060
I'm waiting to hear if I got the audition.

193
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,380
And this is the only place where I get full bars.

194
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,340
- Oh! Hey, Dabney - Hi!

195
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,550
So, you know, I was reading about that apprenticeship online.

196
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,480
And I didn't realize how hard it was to get an audition.

197
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,760
- Sofia, I'm going to get this. - Oh, no, of course. No.

198
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,360
I 1000% believe you will get this.

199
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,330
But, um, in case you don't, it's not the end of the world.

200
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,130
You know? You still have your job at Josh's.

201
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,190
- I quit Josh's. - What?

202
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,760
I know, it seems crazy.

203
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,790
But the thought of working for him

204
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,770
after everything we've been though seems just as crazy.

205
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,700
Okay, are you sure? Because you have, like,

206
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,160
zero percent chance of getting that fancy apprenticeship.

207
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,480
Hey! You just said that you believed in me!

208
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,110
Oh, my God, we're gonna have to sell our hair to pay rent!

209
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,510
It's ringing!

210
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,280
- It's them. - Put it on speaker.

211
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,310
Okay.

212
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,680
Hello?

213
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,610
Miss Diamond, this is Chef D'arby.

214
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,110
Chef D'arby, this is Miss Diamond.

215
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,300
You have been chosen to audition for my apprenticeship.

216
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,430
We'll expect to see you tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

217
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh, my God. I will be there. Thank you so much!

218
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,180
I knew you'd get it!

219
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,290
Congratulations!

220
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,360
Thanks, Dabney!

221
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,680
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!

222
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,620
Okay, settle down. It's time to focus.

223
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,430
I am focused. Sofia, look at this place.

224
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,730
That's Chef D'arby.

225
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,560
They sure know how to grow them in England.

226
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,350
Please sir, can I have some more?

228
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,240
- Look, you can do this. - Okay.

229
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,770
- Good luck. - Thanks.

230
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,320
Oh, Chef D'arby, I'm Gabi Diamond.

231
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,170
Thank you so much for this opportunity.

232
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,470
The opportunity to touch me inappropriately?

233
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,660
Oh, sorry. Uh, listen, I just had a quick question.

234
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,710
What was it that actually got me the audition?

235
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,510
Was it my recipes? Was it my knife skills?

236
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,790
Actually, it was Mr. Kaminski.

237
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,810
- You got me this audition? - You're welcome.

238
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,540
- How could you? - I thought that's what you wanted.

239
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,950
No! What I wanted was to do it myself.

240
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,800
Look, I was just trying to help you get your dream.

241
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,340
Yeah, exactly, Josh. My dream. Mine.

242
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,710
I thought I was doing something nice.

243
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,840
Please, you were just trying to win me back!

244
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,750
Really? Does that sound like a good plan?

245
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,410
To help you get an internship in Switzerland

246
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,680
that takes you away from me for six months?

247
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,930
- How is that getting you back? - I don't know, Josh.

248
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,460
But all you've done is made me realize

249
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,270
that I'm not supposed to be here.

250
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,230
Everybody, take your places.

251
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,270
We are about to begin.

252
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,370
Look, all I did was get you the audition.

253
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,660
It's up to you to win it.

254
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,570
And the dish you will be preparing is...

255
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,340
filet de boeuf forestiere with bordelaise sauce

256
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,050
and petit gratin dauphinois.

257
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,080
- You have two hours. - I need two hours to translate that.

258
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,940
Now, Ms. Renard, the bordelaise ?

259
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,710
You, Mr. Harper.

260
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,000
On to you, Miss Diamond.

261
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,200
Bit of a consistency problem there.

262
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,280
Well, I can fix it, I can fix it.

263
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,860
It's over, Miss Diamond. Off you go!

264
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,650
What? Off I go? Off I go?

265
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,990
Off I go...

266
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,310
Go away!

267
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,050
Oh. Cooper.

268
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,130
Don't be upset.

269
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,710
I just came to grab my stuff, drop off your key.

270
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,710
Not to be judgey,

271
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,820
but what is the white stuff under your nose?

272
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,260
It's my drug of choice: frosting.

273
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,510
- Are you okay? - Oh, yeah. Never worse.

274
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,750
- How are you? - Well, I lost my girlfriend and my best friend.

275
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,990
Those are both you, by the way.

276
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,540
Cooper, I'm... I'm so sorry for the way things ended.

277
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,240
No, Gabi, I'm sorry.

278
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,550
You're amazing.

279
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,110
You know, you're, like, up here.

280
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,340
And I'm down here.

281
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,310
And a guy down here never gets the girl up here.

282
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,380
So when I found out Josh had feelings for you,

283
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,250
I panicked.

284
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,110
I thought if you found out, I'd lose you.

285
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,870
- Cooper, you don't have to tell me all this. - Yes, I do.

286
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,630
I can accept us not being together,

287
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,810
what I can't accept is the way I acted at the karaoke bar.

288
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,700
I need you to know that I'm better than that.

289
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,490
Of course you are.

290
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,040
If you weren't, then I wouldn't have fallen in love with you.

291
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,690
And I never meant to hurt you.

292
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,000
I know.

293
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,780
Frosting's up there, too.

294
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,380
Why?

295
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,110
Oh! Hey, Sofia.

296
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,870
I'm just whipping up a little midnight snack

297
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,370
of filet de boeuf forestiere with bordelaise sauce

298
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,260
and petit gratin dauphinois.

299
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,300
Why?

300
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,080
Because I'm better than that audition, Sofia.

301
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,250
It's because of Cooper.

302
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,710
Even though he knew we weren't gonna get back together,

303
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,280
he still wanted to redeem himself.

304
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,100
And that's what I have to do with Chef D'arby.

305
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,320
I'm fine with not getting the apprenticeship.

306
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,750
What I'm not fine with is Chef D'arby only remembering me

307
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,690
- for my ploppy sauce. - Oh, sweetie.

308
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,490
I'm sure he's barely thought about you at all.

309
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,040
Well, he's going to remember me, okay?

310
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,970
I didn't get the job, but I can get my reputation back.

311
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,630
And this time, my boeuf will raise the roof.

312
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,230
Well, if you're gonna see him again, give him my number.

313
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,780
I'd like a bite of his boeuf.

314
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,520
Chef D'arby, I'm really sorry to interrupt.

315
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,320
Oh, may I ask what amazing dish the maestro is preparing?

316
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,520
Eggs.

317
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,520
Well, listen, I know my sauce went plop-plop

318
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,250
when it should have gone whoosh.

319
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,570
And I don't expect you to change your mind,

320
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,030
but I couldn't live with myself knowing I didn't do my best work.

321
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,280
So, may I now present...

322
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,900
filet de boeuf forestiere with bordelaise sauce

323
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,360
and petit gratin dauphinois.

324
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,110
Whoosh.

325
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,770
I hope this cow was slaughtered more humanely

326
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,930
than how you just slaughtered the French language.

327
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,290
Oh, it's French!

328
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,480
Well done.

329
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,500
In the ten years since I've had this competition,

330
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,190
not a single contestant has had the courage

331
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,660
to try and redeem themselves with me.

332
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,610
Well, honestly, Chef D'arby, I didn't do it for you.

333
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,350
- I did it for me. - Well, I'm impressed.

334
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,870
I hope to see you again next year, Chef Diamond.

335
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,610
Did you just call me chef?

336
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,730
I'm a chef, I'm a chef!

337
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,380
- No hugging. - Disagree to disagree.

338
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,770
- Gabi. - Thank you.

339
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,670
- What? - I was so mad at you for meddling in my life,

340
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,320
and I should've just said thank you.

341
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,000
- So, you got the apprenticeship? - Not even close.

342
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,510
But thanks to you, I got the chance to fail,

343
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,450
which gave me the chance

344
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,820
to pick myself up and prove to Charles D'arby

345
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,720
that I'm worthy of the title chef.

346
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,130
Good for you.

347
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,350
It was nice of you to come by and say thanks...

348
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,990
Wait. Wait, wait. There's more.

349
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:51,900
In the spirit of second chances, how about you give me one?

350
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,780
Josh, I really wanna be your--

351
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,370
- Girlfriend. - Chef.

352
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,640
Yes, chef.

353
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,390
I would love to have you as my chef again.

354
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,630
- I think I heard "girlfriend." - Did you hear that?

355
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,960
I was hoping you said chef loud enough

356
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,450
so all you heard was "chef-friend."

357
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,670
Listen, Josh, what we have between us is undeniable.

358
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,890
But it's also crazy and messy and confusing--

359
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,590
- Go on a date with me. - What?

360
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,550
Gabi, you and I have been through so much,

361
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,480
but the one thing we've never done is go on a simple date.

362
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,950
So... will you?

363
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,280
Look, you're still gonna have a job even if you say no.

364
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,710
But I think you and I deserve a second chance, too.

365
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,980
Is that a yes or...?

366
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,070
It's a "huh" with "yes" tendencies.

367
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,830
Okay. I'll see you tonight at Elliot and Alan's engagement party?

368
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,670
- Absolutely. - Take you to dinner afterwards?

369
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,080
I will think about it.

370
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,530
I'll see you tonight.

371
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,470
She's gonna think about it!

372
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,810
- How do I look? - Amazing!

373
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
I'm pretty sure we're gonna be the two cutest girls

374
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,460
at that gay engagement party.

375
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,800
You know, I'm really happy about the way this all turned out.

376
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,030
I think it's really true,

377
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,700
when god closes a door, he opens a window.

378
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,980
- Hello? - Miss Diamond, this is Chef D'arby.

379
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,040
Chef D'arby? Oh, hello, what can I do for you?

380
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,940
It has come to my attention

381
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,090
that the winner of the competition cheated.

382
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,240
She found out the audition dish in advance.

383
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,130
Normally, I'd offer the position to the first runner-up,

384
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,300
but I was so impressed by you,

385
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,550
I've decided to offer you the apprenticeship.

386
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,820
- Really? - I know this is short notice,

387
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,720
but we need you on the red eye to Zurich tonight.

388
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,310
I'm expecting you in the kitchen Monday morning.

389
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,550
Congratulations, Chef.

390
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,080
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

391
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,010
- Oh, my god! - Oh, my god! You did it!

392
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,070
I did it!

393
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,040
Wait, wait, wait. What about Josh?

394
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,360
- What about the apprenticeship? - Oh! Josh, the apprenticeship.

395
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,370
Josh, the apprenticeship. How do I suddenly have so many options?

396
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:11,090
God opened too many windows. Why did you open so many windows?

397
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,500
What am I gonna do, Sofia?

398
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,600
What would Julia do?

399
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,090
Roberts or Child?

400
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,350
Child. Child! The one who cooks!

401
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,450
I must really love this man 'cause I'm wearing a bow tie.

402
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,560
And I must really love this man

403
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,070
because I'm having my engagement party at a karaoke bar.

404
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,500
Oh, damn, baby, who ordered the fajitas?

405
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,820
- 'Cause you are sizzling hot. - Thank you.

406
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,350
I never thought I'd see the day.

407
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,700
You may be going on a date with Gabi,

408
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,580
Elliot getting married,

409
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,880
and here I am... with nothing.

410
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,710
I have a tab open at the bar.

411
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,280
Except that.

414
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,740
Hey, Josh. I'm calling because I have some news.

415
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,110
Some really amazing news.

416
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,540
I got the apprenticeship.

417
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,440
I hate to tell you this over the phone,

418
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,830
but if I saw you in person,

419
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,860
I'm not sure I'd be able to make the same decision.

420
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,540
After this crazy week of deciding

421
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,900
whether I should choose Cooper or choose you,

422
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,050
I decided to choose me.

423
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,840
And it's the hardest decision that I've ever had to make.

424
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,360
I'm really sorry we didn't get a second chance.

425
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,780
I hope you understand.

426
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,910
You've always been there for me, so I know that you will.

427
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,410
Okay, I'll send you guys a postcard. Bye!

428
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,350
Oh, this is Gabi, by the way.

429
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,380
It's just sad, Dabney.

430
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,160
Gabi's only been gone a few days and it's just really hard.

431
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,610
You know, I rattle around the apartment, eat cereal.

432
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,430
We used to do everything together.

433
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,930
Shop, get pedicures, order takeout.

434
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,200
You know what the worst part is?

435
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,630
She took the tablet so I'm stuck using the laptop.

436
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,220
It just really sucks. You know what I mean?

437
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,140
My dog tells me to burn stuff.

438
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,490
Good talk.

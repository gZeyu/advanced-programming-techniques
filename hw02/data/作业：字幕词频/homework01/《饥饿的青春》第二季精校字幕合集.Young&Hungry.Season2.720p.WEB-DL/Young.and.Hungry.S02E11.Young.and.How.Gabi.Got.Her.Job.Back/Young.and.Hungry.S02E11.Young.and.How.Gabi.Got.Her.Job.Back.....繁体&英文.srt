但你覺得我們
But don't you think 

50
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,740
是不是應該談談最明顯的問題
we should talk about the elephant in the room?

51
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,150
是的  索菲亞  我會找到工作
Yes, Sofia, listen, I'm going to get a job 

52
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
然后就可以付房租了

-我保證  -不  我說的是喬什
- I promise. - No, I was talking about Josh.

00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,420
這個問題啊
Oh, that elephant.

55
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,230
那你打算怎么辦
So, what's your plan?

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,810
幸虧你問起
It's funny you should ask. 

57
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,930
我本來打算直接從機場去他家
I was gonna go to his place straight from the airport,

58
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,410
望著他的眼睛  說
I was going to look him right in the eye and say,

59
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,900
"我當時就那么走了  真是很殘酷無情
"The way that I left was hurtful and horrible

60
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,130
非常非常抱歉
and I am so, so sorry.

61
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,450
你能不能原諒我"
Can you ever forgive me?"

62
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,330
-你怎么沒說  -我好怕怕
- Well, why didn't you? - I got scared.

63
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,990
我在瑞士的時候  試過聯系他
When I was in Switzerland, I tried reaching out.

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,530
給他打了電話  還發了短信
I called him and I texted him.

65
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,020
但后來又覺得好像不該煩他
But then I felt like I should just leave him alone.

66
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,270
-為什么  -因為他回我說"別煩我"
-Why? -'Cause he wrote back, "Leave me alone."

67
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,140
但現在我回家了  很想見他
But now that I'm home, I really want to see him.

68
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,850
為什么  因為你覺得內疚
But why? Because you feel guilty?

69
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,180
還是你想道歉
Because you want to apologize?

70
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,820
還是你仍然喜歡他
You still have feelings for him?

71
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,950
是  是  我也不知道
Yes, yes, and I don't know.

72
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,050
天啊
Oh, my god!

73
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,380
你覺得我是不是下意識地燒了餐廳
Do you think that I subconsciously burnt down that restaurant

74
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,460
好早點回來見他
so that I could come home early and see him?

75
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,610
當然不是
No!

76
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,530
你對警察和其他人也得這么說
And that is what you will tell the police and everyone.

77
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,060
我真不敢相信
I still can't believe

78
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,910
你能用手機控制它
you're controlling that with your phone.

79
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,450
是啊  我的應用
Yeah. With my app,

00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,060
可以用任何一部手機遙控無人機
you can control it with any phone.

81
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,080
就好像是個萬能電視遙控器
It's kind of like a universal TV remote,

82
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,390
不過遙控的是無人機
but for drones.

83
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,500
兩件人人都愛的事
Two things that everyone loves.

84
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,170
無人機和一直拿著手機
Drones and people always on their phones.

85
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,540
我要買
I want to buy it.

86
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,680
跟你說過了  這個應用不賣的
Like I told you before, the app isn't for sale.

87
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,840

Well, here's something new.

88
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,090
我買了你的整個公司如何
How about I buy your whole company?

89
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,660
沒興趣
Not interested.

90
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,900
-我出價五億美元  -太感興趣了
- I'll give you half a billion dollars. - Interested.

91
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,490
尤蘭達  如果喬什把公司賣給卡爾
Yolanda, if Josh sells his company to Kal,

92
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,640
那我就會是
I will be the publicist

93
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,010

98
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,970
他的整個團隊都會跟著沾光
and his whole team will share the glory.

99
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,530
除了你
Except you.

00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,560
沒人在乎你
No one cares about you.

102
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,580
誰傷害你了
Who hurt you?

103
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,430
我去開門  今天是最美好的日子

Is it me or did it just get awkward in here?

115

You can save your apology! He has moved on!

138
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,020

143
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,970
艾略特說得對
Look, Elliot's right.

144
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,770
你沒必要跟我道歉
You don't need to apologize to me.

145
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,260
我已經翻篇了  我很好
I've moved on. Everything's cool.

146
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,160
別誤會  吃你甜點的是只海鷗  不是我
In case you were wondering, a seagull ate your dessert, not me.

147
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,160
我該走了
I better be off.

148
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,350
卡爾  這是我的前任廚師加比
Kal, this is my former chef Gabi.

149
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,060
她剛從瑞士
She just got back

150
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,660
一個很棒的培訓班學成歸來
from a really fancy apprenticeship in Switzerland.

151
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,180
歐洲的培訓班  你一定很厲害
Ooh, an apprenticeship in Europe. You must be good.

152
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,360
我正想招一個廚師  你有興趣嗎
I'm looking for a chef. Are you interested?

153
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,650
-你說什么  -你說什么
- Excuse me? - Excuse me?

154
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,650
對不起  我們還沒正式介紹
I'm sorry. We haven't been properly introduced.

155
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,880
我剛搬到隔壁  我叫卡爾  是個億萬富翁
I just moved in next door. I'm Kal. I'm a billionaire.

156
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,130
隔壁嗎
Next door?

157
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,760
聽著喬什  我不想讓你
Listen, Josh, the last thing I want to do

158
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,910
覺得太尷尬
is make you feel awkward.

159
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,670
啥  我  不  你  尷尬  我  怎么會
What? Me? No. You! Awkward! Me? What?

160
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,480
她走之前我們有點小誤會
Look, we had a little thing before she left.

161
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,920
實際上也沒什么事  差不多而已
Actually, we didn't. We almost did.

162
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,080
我可不想摻合進什么事里
Well, I really don't want to get into the middle of a thing.

163
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,040
沒事  你沒聽我說嗎
There was no thing. Did you not just hear me?

164
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,640
什么事都沒有
No thing happened.

165
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,300
既然沒什么事
And since there was no thing,

166
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,050
也就沒什么摻合不摻合的
there's nothing to get in the middle of.

167
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,630
全都是...浮云
Just a bunch of-- air.

168
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,510
那你不介意我接受這工作吧
So, you're cool if I take the job?

169
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,760
介意  我  什么  當然不  工作  接吧
Cool! Me! What? Yes! Cool! Me! Yeah! Job. Take.

170
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,960
-你確定嗎  -到底有沒有人在聽我說話
- You're sure? - I mean, is no one hearing what I'm saying?

171
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,510
話筒沒開嗎  接吧
Is this thing on? Take the job.

172
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,380
好吧  那我接受  謝謝你
Okay. I guess I'll take it. Thank you.

173
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,970
太好了  你可以立即上崗嗎
Great! Can you start right away?

174
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,890
我明晚有個非常重要的商務晚宴
I've got a very important business dinner tomorrow night,

175
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,390
必須要能打動對方
and I really have to impress the guy.

176
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,620
那人是誰
Oh, who's the guy?

177
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,250
在下
Me.

178
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,440
我還是不敢相信
I still can't believe it.

179
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,990
只有你能找到
Only you would get a job

180
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,350
正好在"問題"家對面的工作
that just so happens to be across the hall from the elephant.

181
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,150
我知道  但是我問了他一百次  
I know! But I asked the elephant a hundred times 

182
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,220
他都說不介意
and he said he was cool with it.

183
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,160
我該怎么辦  我需要一份工作
So what am I supposed to do? I need a job.

184
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,970
既然那樣  請坐
Well, on that note, take a seat.

185
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,020
索菲亞  我不需要你打雞血
Sofia, I don't need one of your pep talks

186
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,500
那跟聽講座沒啥區別
that's actually a lecture.

187
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,480
但是你真的需要
Oh! But you do.

188
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,760
這個新工作是個嶄新的開始
This new job is a fresh start.

189
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,340
為了保證你步入正軌
So, to help you stay on track,

190
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,150
我整理了一張《要和不要做》清單
I've put together a little list of "dos and don'ts".

191
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,900
"要表現得專業
"Do act professional.

192
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,280
不要跟你老板上床
"Don't have sex with your boss.

193
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,850
要穿褲子
"Do wear pants.

194
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,510
不要脫下來"
Don't take them off."

195
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,250
索菲亞  我沒有要跟...
Sofia, I'm not gonna sleep with--

196
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,010
"要為卡爾和喬什準備美味的晚餐
"Do prepare a delicious dinner tonight for Kal and Josh.

197
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,170
不要跟喬什訂婚  不要看他
"Don't engage with Josh. Don't look at him.

198
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,280
不要談論過去  不要談論未來"
Don't talk about the past. Don't talk about the future."

199
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:22,820
-那如果...  -不要
- But what if-- - Don't.

200
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,470
-那如果他...  -不要
- But what if he-- - Don't.

201
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,750
-那如果他...  -不要
- But what if he-- - Don't.

202
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,360
好吧  你說得對  索菲亞
Okay, fine. You're right, Sofia.

203
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,170
沒有你我在瑞士是怎么挺過來的啊
Man, how did I ever make it in switzerland without you?

204
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,940
你沒挺過來
You didn't.

205
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,400
你燒了一間餐廳
You burned down a restaurant.

206
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,250
天吶  加比  這太不可思議了
Oh, my god. Gabi, this looks amazing.

207
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,850
你這本來裝修就很好
Well, your place is amazing.

208
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,290
我特別喜歡那架鋼琴
I especially love the piano.

209
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,830
-是三角鋼琴嗎  -它可不止三角錢
- Is it a grand? - Oh, it cost way more than that.

210
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,070
卡爾  我想讓你知道
Listen, Kal, I just want you to know

211
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,310
今晚跟喬什的晚餐
that tonight's dinner with Josh

212
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,170
會非常的專業
is going to be completely professional.

213
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,600
-為什么會不專業  -不會的
- Why wouldn't it be? - It would be.

214
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,000
喬什來了
That's Josh.

215
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,170
我要去里屋等著
I'm going to go in the other room.

216
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,680
你一會能像《唐頓莊園》里那樣介紹我嗎
Could you announce me how they do on Downton Abbey?

217
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,010
可以
Yes.

218
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,160
好了  專業一點  不談過去
Okay. Be professional. Don't talk about the past.

219
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,600
不談未來
Don't talk about the future.

220
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,720
我們談談吧
We need to talk.

221
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,060
加比  今晚真的很重要
Gabi, this is a really important night.

222
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,810
我知道  對我來說也是
I know! For me, too!

223
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,850
我們終于有機會談談了
We finally have a chance to talk.

224
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,900
我要跟卡爾談生意
I'm talking about the deal with Kal.

225
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,300
這個對我真的很重要
This is really important to me.

226
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,550
但我知道你對我有感情
But I know that you're feeling things.

227
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,910
比如...討厭嗎
Like annoyed?

228
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,130
對  很好  繼續
Good. That's good. Go on.

229
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,770
我昨天說的都是真心話
Look, I meant what I said yesterday.

230
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,770
你在這工作我不介意
I'm cool with you working here,

231
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,740
所以你能不能表現得專業一點
so can you please just act professional?

232
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,130
好吧  您要喝酒嗎  先生
Fine! Can I get you a glass of wine, sir?

233
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,980
不  謝謝  五億美元的生意可得謹慎
No, thank you. $500 million deals and alcohol do not mix well.

234
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,710
我本來想等你介紹
I was waiting to be announced,

235
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,170
但一個男人又能躲在門后多久呢
but how long can a man hide behind his own door?

236
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,440
抱歉  現在有請...
Sorry. May I please introduce--

237
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,580
時機已經過了
The moment passed.

238
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,330
-你好  喬什  -你好  卡爾
- Hello, Josh. - Good to see you, Kal.

239
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,400
開始之前
Before we get started,

240
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,100
我有件私事想和你討論下
there's something personal I wanted to discuss with you.

241
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,500
好的  什么事
Sure, what is it?

242
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,260
我就直說了
All right. I'll get right down to it.

243
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,860
我對你的廚師有意思
I'm hot for your chef.

244
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,950
希望你不介意
I hope it's not a problem.

245
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,560
介意嗎
Problem?

246
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,150
才不介意  多好
Hell no, it's great!

247
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,840
她太棒了
She's fantastic.

248
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,930
我知道我們才認識
I know we only just met,

249
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,500
但真的特別有默契
But we've got the most amazing connection.

250
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,690
很好  這消息真有趣
I love it! It's fun. Fun news.

251
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,260
好  等吃完晚餐
Great! I'm going to ask her out

252
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,090
我就準備約她出去
as soon as we're finished with dinner.

253
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,300
好  頭盤準備好了
Okay, the first course is ready.

254
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,700
看起來真美味
This looks divine.

255
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,670
加比  你真是上帝的恩賜
Gabi, you're a godsend.

256
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,000
難以置信你居然讓我挖走她
I can't believe you let me steal her away from you.

257
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,130
她已經沒替我工作了  不算挖
It's not stealing when she wasn't even working for me.

258
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,300
加比  再倒點酒
Gabi, more wine?

259
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,220
-我以為你...  -倒
- Oh, I thought you-- - More wine!

260
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,760
{\an8}該詞暗指女性私處

261
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,760
加比  你的生蠔太完美了
Gabi, your oyster is perfection.

262
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,260
真高興你喜歡
I'm so glad you like it.

263
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,920
還有很多呢
There's plenty more where that came from.

264
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,930
夠了  你猜怎么著  我不用吃這頓大餐
All right! You know what? I don't need this big fancy dinner.

265
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,940
我也吃過加比的生蠔
I've had Gabi's oysters.

266
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,790
把初始報價合同給我簽字吧
Do you have the initial offer for me to sign?

267
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,850
目的很明確哈
A man who knows what he wants.

268
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,940
好  我們來談生意
All right. Let's get down to biz-natch.

269
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,670
你可以仔細看下合同...
Now feel free to take your time and look over--

270
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,800
不用  廢話廢話  一堆零
No. Blah, blah, blah. Lots of zeros.

271
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,520
看起來不錯  簽字了
All looks in order. Signing.

272
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,330
意向書送給律師過目
Letter of intent off to the attorney's.

273
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,410
很高興和你做生意
Great doing biz-natch with you.

274
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,560
再見  拜拜  我走了
Cheerio! Tut-tut! Must be off!

275
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,980
下面呈上第二道...
May I now introduce the second course--

276
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,270
你根本沒看過《唐頓莊園》  是不是
You've never seen Downton Abbey, have you?

277
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,350
是的
No.

278
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,290
我今晚準備約她出去
I'm going to ask her to hang out tonight.

279
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,430
卡爾  你猜怎么著
Hey, Kal, guess what?

280
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,930
我不在乎
I don't care!

281
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,280
香檳  好像這能打動她一樣
Champagne! Like that's going to impress her.

282
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,670
媽呀  還真有用
Holy cow, I think it did!

283
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,900
這就去臥室  太快了吧
Is it too soon to go to the bedroom?

284
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,160
不
No!

285
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,470
等等  阿德里亞娜嗎
Wait! Adriana?

286
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,670
不  不要  不要
Oh, no! No, no, no! No, no, no!

287
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,760
墜毀  無人機墜毀了
Ohh, drone down! We have a drone down!

288
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,210
謝謝
Thank you!

289
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,260
第一天怎么樣
Good first day?

290
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,350
你會很滿意的  我沒脫褲子
You' will be happy to know, I kept my pants on.

291
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,960
敬你的循序漸進
Here's to baby steps. 

292
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,590
卡爾人很好  我們很融洽
Kal was great. I had no problem with Kal.

293
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,090
但喬什來參加商務晚宴時
But when Josh showed up for his business dinner,

294
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,850
不愿跟我說話
he wouldn't talk to me.

295
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,600
我想讓他跟我談談  他就是不干
I tried to get him to talk to me, but he just wouldn't.

296
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,960
然后說"拜拜  再見  我走了"
And then he was all like, "Tut-tut. Cheerio. I must be off".

297
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,300
你干嘛那樣看著我
Why are you looking at me like that?

298
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,460
就是你這愚蠢  愛演的樣子
It's just-- all your stupid, crazy, drama--

299
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,400
我好想你
I missed you!

300
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,790
我不是光愚蠢又愛演的
Come on. I'm not all stupid, crazy drama.

301
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,840
加比  快開門  加比
Gabi, open the door quick! Gabi! Gabi! Gabi!

302
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,080
我把無人機飛進卡爾家里  現在墜毀了
I flew a drone into Kal's penthouse and I crashed it

303
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,600
需要你去幫我拿回來
and I need you to get it back for me.

304
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,930
不敢相信我還覺得學織毛衣就不空虛了
I can't believe I thought learning to knit could fill this void.

305
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,540
好吧  你在說什么
Okay, what are you talking about?

306
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,280
加比  我需要你去把那架無人機拿回來
Look, gabi, I need you to get that drone back for me.

307
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,740
我會損失五個億的
I could lose $500 million.

308
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,290
-好吧  我幫你  -太好了  我們走
- Okay, I'll help you. - Great. Let's go.

309
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:09,970
如果...
If--

310
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,760
如果你同意拿回來以后談談
if you agree to have a talk when we're done.

311
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,700
情真意切地談談
A real talk. A feelings talk.

312
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,780
-你有卡爾家鑰匙嗎  -有
- Do you have the key to Kal's apartment? - Yes.

313
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,140
那就情真意切地談談  走
Feelings talk it is. Let's go.

314
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,830
無人機應該在鋼琴邊上
I think the drone is over by the piano.

315
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,270
好  等一下
Okay. Wait here.

316
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,480
喬什  找到了
Josh, I got it.

317
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,310
那是地寶
That's a roomba.

318
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,990
吸塵器
A vacuum.

319
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,360
現在是告訴你的時候了
Now would be a good time to tell you,

320
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,650
我不知道無人機長什么樣
I don't know what a drone looks like.

321
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,130
是帶四個螺旋槳的小飛機
It's a quad copter with four rotors.

322
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,560
四個螺旋槳啊  你不早說
Four rotors! Why didn't you say so?

323
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,850
什么聲音  卡爾
What the hell? Kal!

324
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,680
我怎么會在這里
What-- what am I doing in here?

325
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,040
你可能想這么問吧
Is the question you're probably asking.

326
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,230
加比  我知道你在找喬什的無人機
Gabi, I know you're looking for Josh's drone.

327
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,030
無人機長這樣啊
Oh, that's a drone!

328
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,560
被你抓住了  我是來找這個的
Yep, you caught me. That's what I'm here for.

329
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,900
但不是因為他讓我來的
But not because he put me up to it.

330
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,590
我是一個人...和喬什來的
I'm here completely on my own-- with Josh.

331
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,160
喬什  你們在我家里搞什么
Josh, what the hell is this doing in my apartment?

332
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,920
卡爾  聽我解釋
Kal, I can explain everything.

333
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,560
這無人機的人工智能技術太先進了
The drone's artificial intelligence is too advanced.

334
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,710
或許是機器人起義的開端
This could be the start of a robot uprising.

335
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,480
別亂扯  你為什么要監視我
Cut the crap. Why are you spying on me?

336
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,160
卡爾  我不是在監視你
Kal, I'm not spying on you.

337
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,570
外面怎么回事
What's going on out here?

338
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,320
阿德里亞娜
Adriana?

339
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,270
該問的是你穿著那性感睡袍怎么回事吧
I think the question is what's going on in there, sexy robe?

340
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,310
我明白了
Oh, I get it.

341
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,280
我就知道你介意我跟你廚師約會
I knew you were bothered when I asked if I could date your chef.

342
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,090
你在監視阿德里亞娜
You were spying on Adriana.

343
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,600
等等  卡爾  你問喬什能不能跟他廚師約會
Wait, Kal, you asked Josh if you could date his chef?

344
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,400
你以為他說的是我  不是她嗎
Did you think he meant me chef and not she chef?

345
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,940
什么
What?

346
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,220
我知道怎么回事了  他沒有監視你
I know what's going on here. Listen, he wasn't spying on you.

347
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,370
是在監視我
He was spying on me.

348
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,010
我不在乎他監視誰
I don't care who he was spying on.

349
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,720
重點是他監視人
The point is he was spying!

350
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,870
我要信任自己合作的人
I need to trust the people that I work with.

351
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,060
生意吹了  你被解雇了
The deal is off. And you, you're fired.

352
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,190
-什么  -什么
- What?  - What?

353
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,110
但你還說我的生蠔很完美
But what about my perfect oyster?

354
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,530
那誰來幫你做飯
But who's gonna cook for you?

355
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,200
實際上  我準備來
Actually, I'm going to.

356
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,510
喬什  對不起  我辭職了
Josh, I'm sorry, I quit.

357
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,570
現在準備為卡爾工作
I'm going to go work for Kal now.

358
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,830
等等  你要替跟你上床的人
Wait a minute. You're going to cook for the same guy

359
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,100
工作嗎
you're sleeping with?

360
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,680
姑娘  我可有張清單要送你
Girl, I have a dos and don'ts list for you.

361
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,920
真是多謝  你讓我被解雇了
Well, thanks a lot, you just got me fired!

362
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,430
是啊  你還砸了我五億美元的生意呢
Yeah, well, you just cost me a $500 million deal!

363
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,870
我嗎  分明是你自己
Me? Me? That was you.

364
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,640
-都怪你  -隨便了
- That was all you! - Oh, whatever!

365
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,160
行了  我們說好的  該談談了
Okay. Deal's a deal. Time to talk.

366
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,730
好  我很傷心
Okay. I'm upset.

367
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,340
我的無人機碎了  你還知道了我的感受
I think my drone's broken. And now you know how I feel.

368
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,740
你到底是怎么回事
What the hell is the matter with you?

369
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,260
我才回來時  你說你放下了  不介意了
When I first got back, you said you'd moved on. You were good.

370
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,750
現在  突然又開始監視我
And now, all of a sudden you're spying on me

371
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,330
因為覺得我在和你鄰居上床
because you think I'm sleeping with your neighbor?

372
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,820
這都是怎么回事
What is that all about?

373
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,080
你真想知道這都是怎么回事嗎
Do you really want to know what that's all about

374
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,410
還是又準備一遇到難題
or are you just gonna jump on another plane 

375
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,700
就坐飛機跑路
when things get too difficult?

376
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,030
所以你是在生氣
So you are mad.

377
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,950
你把我一個人晾在這  加比
You pulled the rug out from under me, Gabi!

378
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,770
讓我在艾略特的訂婚派對上像個傻子
You left me like a smiling idiot at Elliot's engagement party!

379
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,080
我跟你說了愛你  吻了你
I told you I loved you, I kissed you,

380
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,700
我也知道這對你有意義
and I know that meant something to you.

381
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,840
-是的  -那你為什么還讓我那樣
- It did. - Then why would you leave me like that?

382
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,340
因為...
Because--

383
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,800
喬什  如果我看到你  就走不掉了
Josh, if I saw you then I wouldn't have been able to go.

384
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,210
第一次離開時  我一直捫心自問
When I first left, I kept asking myself

385
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,640
怎么才要在一起了我就要走
how I could leave when we were just getting started.

386
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,440
那你問出什么了
And what did you come up with?

387
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,640
因為我可什么理由都想不到
Because I couldn't come up with anything.

388
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,460
跟你在一起太簡單了
Being with you would have been too easy.

389
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,590
現在這樣簡單嗎
This is easy?

390
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,080
喬什
Josh.

391
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,670
為哄我高興你可以移山開路
You would move mountains to make me happy.

392
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,400
但我想自己移山  你懂我的意思嗎
And I want to move my own mountains. Does that make any sense?

393
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,140
我知道山是什么
I know what mountains are.

394
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,050
我去瑞士  是因為想做下一個茱莉亞·蔡爾德
I went to Switzerland because I want to be the next Julia Child.

395
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,530
如果你什么事都幫我做了
And if you did everything for me,

396
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,420
那我就失去了實現夢想的動力
then I would lose my own drive to make that dream come true.

397
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,420
你明白嗎
Do you understand that?

398
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,410
我知道夢想是什么
I know what dreams are.

399
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,130
喬什
Josh...

400
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,670
加比
Look, Gabi--

401
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,070
你離開以后  事情很糟
when you left, it was horrible.

402
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,430
我不知所措
I was a mess.

403
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,580
所以全心投入工作
So I threw myself into work--

404
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,430
然后...實際上差點做成了
and-- actually it kinda got me to a place

405
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,160
五億美元的大生意
where I almost made $500 million.

406
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,540
所以  我離開是好事嗎
So, me leaving was a good thing?

407
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,440
沒錯  我的會計師覺得你該多毀掉我的生活
Yeah. My accountant thinks you should ruin my life more often.

408
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,890
但是...加比

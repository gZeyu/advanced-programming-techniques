1
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,510
*I love to live alone*

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,990
*'cause I'm in my cleaning zone*

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,320
Gabi, hi!

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,600
How are you? How's Switzerland?

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,160
Have you learned how to yodel yet?

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,300
You ask me that every week

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,050
and the answer is still no-de-lay-hee-hoo!

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,350
Gets me every time.

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,200
Wait a minute. It's not Sunday night. 

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,480
Why are you calling me now?

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,710
I just missed ya.

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,970
How did flambe week go?

15
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,440
Fla-mazing.

16
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,360
I learned how to make a peppercorn steak with brandy,

17
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,510
how to burn down a restaurant,

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,190
how to make Crepe Suzette...

19
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,830
Wait, wait. Back up.

20
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,700
So, the secret is actually lemon zest...

21
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,050
Back it up a little more.

22
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,130
Something about burning a restaurant down?

28
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:56,080
Yeah. There may have been a teeny-tiny major fire.

29
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,980
The French alcohol that I was using 

31
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,600
was a little higher proof than I realized.

32
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,260
I blame the metric system.

34
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,810
Did they?

35
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,690
No, they blamed me.

37
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,590
Oh, you poor thing. What are you gonna do?

38
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,250
Come home?

40
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,200
Oh, my god! You're here!

41
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,780
They kicked me out.

43
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,320
Aw, you okay?

44
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,990
No-de-lay-hee-hoo!

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,110
Well, overall, it sounds like you had a great time.

49
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,770
But don't you think 

50
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,740
we should talk about the elephant in the room?

51
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,150
Yes, Sofia, listen, I'm going to get a job 

52
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
and I'm going to be able to pay rent.

53
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,690
- I promise. - No, I was talking about Josh.

54
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,420
Oh, that elephant.

55
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,230
So, what's your plan?

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,810
It's funny you should ask. 

57
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,930
I was gonna go to his place straight from the airport,

58
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,410
I was going to look him right in the eye and say,

59
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,900
"The way that I left was hurtful and horrible

60
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,130
and I am so, so sorry.

61
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,450
Can you ever forgive me?"

62
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,330
- Well, why didn't you? - I got scared.

63
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,990
When I was in Switzerland, I tried reaching out.

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,530
I called him and I texted him.

65
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,020
But then I felt like I should just leave him alone.

66
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,270
-Why? -'Cause he wrote back, "Leave me alone."

67
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,140
But now that I'm home, I really want to see him.

68
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,850
But why? Because you feel guilty?

69
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,180
Because you want to apologize?

70
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,820
You still have feelings for him?

71
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,950
Yes, yes, and I don't know.

72
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,050
Oh, my god!

73
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,380
Do you think that I subconsciously burnt down that restaurant

74
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,460
so that I could come home early and see him?

75
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,610
No!

76
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,530
And that is what you will tell the police and everyone.

77
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,060
I still can't believe

78
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,910
you're controlling that with your phone.

79
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,450
Yeah. With my app,

80
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,060
you can control it with any phone.

81
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,080
It's kind of like a universal TV remote,

82
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,390
but for drones.

83
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,500
Two things that everyone loves.

84
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,170
Drones and people always on their phones.

85
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,540
I want to buy it.

86
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,680
Like I told you before, the app isn't for sale.

87
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,840
Well, here's something new.

88
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,090
How about I buy your whole company?

89
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,660
Not interested.

90
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,900
- I'll give you half a billion dollars. - Interested.

91
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,490
Yolanda, if Josh sells his company to Kal,

92
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,640
I will be the publicist

93
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,010
to one of the richest men in San Francisco.

94
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,810
And I'll be washing the underpants

95
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,150
of one of the richest men in San Francisco.

96
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,780
Yours sounds better.

97
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,660
Josh is about to hit it big 

98
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,970
and his whole team will share the glory.

99
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,530
Except you.

100
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,380
You're new.

101
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,560
No one cares about you.

102
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,580
Who hurt you?

103
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,430
I'll get it! This is the best day ever.

104
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,370
Hi!

105
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,190
Oh, my god! It returned!

106
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,410
Go away!

107
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,660
Please, Elliot.

108
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,880
I just need to talk to Josh.

109
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,380
No! You will never set foot in this house again...

110
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,800
Oh, my damn, Gabi! Come on in!

111
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,470
No, Yolanda! I forbid it.

112
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,620
Forbid this. 

113
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,490
- Gabi? - Hey, Josh.

114
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,120
Is it me or did it just get awkward in here?

115
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,720
You're back early.

116
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,710
Yeah, about that.

117
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,050
Listen, I kinda wanted to talk to you about something.

118
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,180
Elliot, maybe we shouldn't stand here and watch this.

119
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,490
You're right. Let's stand over there.

120
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,490
If this is about your job,

121
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,070
I actually hired a new chef.

122
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,680
Yeah, I know, Yolanda told me.

123
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,000
Here she is. Adriana.

124
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,580
This is Gabi, my ex-- chef--

125
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,740
ex-chef.

126
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,820
Oh, you're Gabi.

127
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,730
Or as Elliot calls you,

128
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,630
"She who must not be named."

129
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,580
- Pleased to meet you. - Very nice to meet you.

130
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,590
So, is now a good time for us to--

131
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,950
Never! He doesn't want to talk to you!

132
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,160
Is that true, Josh? Do you not want to talk to me?

133
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,180
Of course he wants to talk to you!

134
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,300
He's got a lot of feelings he needs to let out!

135
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,210
Because I have feelings that I need to let out, too. 

136
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,640
Starting with I'm sorry.

137
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,300
You can save your apology! He has moved on!

138
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,020
The hell he has!

139
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,990
Yolanda, stay out of it!

140
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,500
Stop!

141
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,000
You! You! Out!

142
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,630
Someone's wound a little tight!

143
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,970
Look, Elliot's right.

144
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,770
You don't need to apologize to me.

145
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,260
I've moved on. Everything's cool.

146
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,160
In case you were wondering, a seagull ate your dessert, not me.

147
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,160
I better be off.

148
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,350
Kal, this is my former chef Gabi.

149
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,060
She just got back

150
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,660
from a really fancy apprenticeship in Switzerland.

151
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,180
Ooh, an apprenticeship in Europe. You must be good.

152
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,360
I'm looking for a chef. Are you interested?

153
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,650
- Excuse me? - Excuse me?

154
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,650
I'm sorry. We haven't been properly introduced.

155
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,880
I just moved in next door. I'm Kal. I'm a billionaire.

156
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,130
Next door?

157
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,760
Listen, Josh, the last thing I want to do

158
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,910
is make you feel awkward.

159
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,670
What? Me? No. You! Awkward! Me? What?

160
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,480
Look, we had a little thing before she left.

161
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,920
Actually, we didn't. We almost did.

162
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,080
Well, I really don't want to get into the middle of a thing.

163
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,040
There was no thing. Did you not just hear me?

164
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,640
No thing happened.

165
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,300
And since there was no thing,

166
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,050
there's nothing to get in the middle of.

167
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,630
Just a bunch of-- air.

168
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,510
So, you're cool if I take the job?

169
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,760
Cool! Me! What? Yes! Cool! Me! Yeah! Job. Take.

170
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,960
- You're sure? - I mean, is no one hearing what I'm saying?

171
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,510
Is this thing on? Take the job.

172
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,380
Okay. I guess I'll take it. Thank you.

173
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,970
Great! Can you start right away?

174
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,890
I've got a very important business dinner tomorrow night,

175
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,390
and I really have to impress the guy.

176
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,620
Oh, who's the guy?

177
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,250
Me.

178
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,440
I still can't believe it.

179
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,990
Only you would get a job

180
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,350
that just so happens to be across the hall from the elephant.

181
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,150
I know! But I asked the elephant a hundred times 

182
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,220
and he said he was cool with it.

183
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,160
So what am I supposed to do? I need a job.

184
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,970
Well, on that note, take a seat.

185
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,020
Sofia, I don't need one of your pep talks

186
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,500
that's actually a lecture.

187
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,480
Oh! But you do.

188
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,760
This new job is a fresh start.

189
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,340
So, to help you stay on track,

190
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,150
I've put together a little list of "dos and don'ts".

191
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,900
"Do act professional.

192
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,280
"Don't have sex with your boss.

193
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,850
"Do wear pants.

194
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,510
Don't take them off."

195
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,250
Sofia, I'm not gonna sleep with--

196
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,010
"Do prepare a delicious dinner tonight for Kal and Josh.

197
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,170
"Don't engage with Josh. Don't look at him.

198
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,280
Don't talk about the past. Don't talk about the future."

199
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:22,820
- But what if-- - Don't.

200
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,470
- But what if he-- - Don't.

201
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,750
- But what if he-- - Don't.

202
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,360
Okay, fine. You're right, Sofia.

203
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,170
Man, how did I ever make it in switzerland without you?

204
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,940
You didn't.

205
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,400
You burned down a restaurant.

206
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,250
Oh, my god. Gabi, this looks amazing.

207
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,850
Well, your place is amazing.

208
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,290
I especially love the piano.

209
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,830
- Is it a grand? - Oh, it cost way more than that.

210
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,070
Listen, Kal, I just want you to know

211
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,310
that tonight's dinner with Josh

212
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,170
is going to be completely professional.

213
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,600
- Why wouldn't it be? - It would be.

214
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,000
That's Josh.

215
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,170
I'm going to go in the other room.

216
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,680
Could you announce me how they do on Downton Abbey?

217
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,010
Yes.

218
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,160
Okay. Be professional. Don't talk about the past.

219
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,600
Don't talk about the future.

220
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,720
We need to talk.

221
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,060
Gabi, this is a really important night.

222
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,810
I know! For me, too!

223
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,850
We finally have a chance to talk.

224
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,900
I'm talking about the deal with Kal.

225
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,300
This is really important to me.

226
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,550
But I know that you're feeling things.

227
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,910
Like annoyed?

228
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,130
Good. That's good. Go on.

229
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,770
Look, I meant what I said yesterday.

230
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,770
I'm cool with you working here,

231
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,740
so can you please just act professional?

232
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,130
Fine! Can I get you a glass of wine, sir?

233
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,980
No, thank you. $500 million deals and alcohol do not mix well.

234
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,710
I was waiting to be announced,

235
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,170
but how long can a man hide behind his own door?

236
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,440
Sorry. May I please introduce--

237
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,580
The moment passed.

238
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,330
- Hello, Josh. - Good to see you, Kal.

239
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,400
Before we get started,

240
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,100
there's something personal I wanted to discuss with you.

241
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,500
Sure, what is it?

242
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,260
All right. I'll get right down to it.

243
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,860
I'm hot for your chef.

244
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,950
I hope it's not a problem.

245
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,560
Problem?

246
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,150
Hell no, it's great!

247
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,840
She's fantastic.

248
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,930
I know we only just met,

249
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,500
But we've got the most amazing connection.

250
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,690
I love it! It's fun. Fun news.

251
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,260
Great! I'm going to ask her out

252
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,090
as soon as we're finished with dinner.

253
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,300
Okay, the first course is ready.

254
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,700
This looks divine.

255
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,670
Gabi, you're a godsend.

256
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,000
I can't believe you let me steal her away from you.

257
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,130
It's not stealing when she wasn't even working for me.

258
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,300
Gabi, more wine?

259
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,220
- Oh, I thought you-- - More wine!

261
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,760
Gabi, your oyster is perfection.

262
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,260
I'm so glad you like it.

263
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,920
There's plenty more where that came from.

264
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,930
All right! You know what? I don't need this big fancy dinner.

265
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,940
I've had Gabi's oysters.

266
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,790
Do you have the initial offer for me to sign?

267
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,850
A man who knows what he wants.

268
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,940
All right. Let's get down to biz-natch.

269
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,670
Now feel free to take your time and look over--

270
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,800
No. Blah, blah, blah. Lots of zeros.

271
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,520
All looks in order. Signing.

272
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,330
Letter of intent off to the attorney's.

273
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,410
Great doing biz-natch with you.

274
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,560
Cheerio! Tut-tut! Must be off!

275
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,980
May I now introduce the second course--

276
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,270
You've never seen Downton Abbey, have you?

277
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,350
No.

278
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,290
I'm going to ask her to hang out tonight.

279
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,430
Hey, Kal, guess what?

280
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,930
I don't care!

281
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,280
Champagne! Like that's going to impress her.

282
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,670
Holy cow, I think it did!

283
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,900
Is it too soon to go to the bedroom?

284
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,160
No!

285
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,470
Wait! Adriana?

286
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,670
Oh, no! No, no, no! No, no, no!

287
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,760
Ohh, drone down! We have a drone down!

288
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,210
Thank you!

289
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,260
Good first day?

290
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,350
You' will be happy to know, I kept my pants on.

291
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,960
Here's to baby steps. 

292
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,590
Kal was great. I had no problem with Kal.

293
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,090
But when Josh showed up for his business dinner,

294
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,850
he wouldn't talk to me.

295
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,600
I tried to get him to talk to me, but he just wouldn't.

296
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,960
And then he was all like, "Tut-tut. Cheerio. I must be off".

297
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,300
Why are you looking at me like that?

298
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,460
It's just-- all your stupid, crazy, drama--

299
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,400
I missed you!

300
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,790
Come on. I'm not all stupid, crazy drama.

301
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,840
Gabi, open the door quick! Gabi! Gabi! Gabi!

302
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,080
I flew a drone into Kal's penthouse and I crashed it

303
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,600
and I need you to get it back for me.

304
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,930
I can't believe I thought learning to knit could fill this void.

305
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,540
Okay, what are you talking about?

306
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,280
Look, gabi, I need you to get that drone back for me.

307
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,740
I could lose $500 million.

308
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,290
- Okay, I'll help you. - Great. Let's go.

309
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:09,970
If--

310
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,760
if you agree to have a talk when we're done.

311
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,700
A real talk. A feelings talk.

312
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,780
- Do you have the key to Kal's apartment? - Yes.

313
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,140
Feelings talk it is. Let's go.

314
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,830
I think the drone is over by the piano.

315
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,270
Okay. Wait here.

316
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,480
Josh, I got it.

317
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,310
That's a roomba.

318
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,990
A vacuum.

319
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,360
Now would be a good time to tell you,

320
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,650
I don't know what a drone looks like.

321
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,130
It's a quad copter with four rotors.

322
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,560
Four rotors! Why didn't you say so?

323
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,850
What the hell? Kal!

324
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,680
What-- what am I doing in here?

325
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,040
Is the question you're probably asking.

326
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,230
Gabi, I know you're looking for Josh's drone.

327
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,030
Oh, that's a drone!

328
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,560
Yep, you caught me. That's what I'm here for.

329
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,900
But not because he put me up to it.

330
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,590
I'm here completely on my own-- with Josh.

331
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,160
Josh, what the hell is this doing in my apartment?

332
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,920
Kal, I can explain everything.

333
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,560
The drone's artificial intelligence is too advanced.

334
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,710
This could be the start of a robot uprising.

335
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,480
Cut the crap. Why are you spying on me?

336
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,160
Kal, I'm not spying on you.

337
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,570
What's going on out here?

338
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,320
Adriana?

339
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,270
I think the question is what's going on in there, sexy robe?

340
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,310
Oh, I get it.

341
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,280
I knew you were bothered when I asked if I could date your chef.

342
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,090
You were spying on Adriana.

343
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,600
Wait, Kal, you asked Josh if you could date his chef?

344
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,400
Did you think he meant me chef and not she chef?

345
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,940
What?

346
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,220
I know what's going on here. Listen, he wasn't spying on you.

347
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,370
He was spying on me.

348
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,010
I don't care who he was spying on.

349
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,720
The point is he was spying!

350
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,870
I need to trust the people that I work with.

351
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,060
The deal is off. And you, you're fired.

352
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,190
- What?  - What?

353
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,110
But what about my perfect oyster?

354
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,530
But who's gonna cook for you?

355
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,200
Actually, I'm going to.

356
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,510
Josh, I'm sorry, I quit.

357
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,570
I'm going to go work for Kal now.

358
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,830
Wait a minute. You're going to cook for the same guy

359
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,100
you're sleeping with?

360
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,680
Girl, I have a dos and don'ts list for you.

361
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,920
Well, thanks a lot, you just got me fired!

362
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,430
Yeah, well, you just cost me a $500 million deal!

363
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,870
Me? Me? That was you.

364
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,640
- That was all you! - Oh, whatever!

365
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,160
Okay. Deal's a deal. Time to talk.

366
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,730
Okay. I'm upset.

367
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,340
I think my drone's broken. And now you know how I feel.

368
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,740
What the hell is the matter with you?

369
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,260
When I first got back, you said you'd moved on. You were good.

370
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,750
And now, all of a sudden you're spying on me

371
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,330
because you think I'm sleeping with your neighbor?

372
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,820
What is that all about?

373
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,080
Do you really want to know what that's all about

374
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,410
or are you just gonna jump on another plane 

375
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,700
when things get too difficult?

376
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,030
So you are mad.

377
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,950
You pulled the rug out from under me, Gabi!

378
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,770
You left me like a smiling idiot at Elliot's engagement party!

379
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,080
I told you I loved you, I kissed you,

380
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,700
and I know that meant something to you.

381
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,840
- It did. - Then why would you leave me like that?

382
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,340
Because--

383
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,800
Josh, if I saw you then I wouldn't have been able to go.

384
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,210
When I first left, I kept asking myself

385
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,640
how I could leave when we were just getting started.

386
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,440
And what did you come up with?

387
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,640
Because I couldn't come up with anything.

388
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,460
Being with you would have been too easy.

389
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,590
This is easy?

390
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,080
Josh.

391
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,670
You would move mountains to make me happy.

392
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,400
And I want to move my own mountains. Does that make any sense?

393
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,140
I know what mountains are.

394
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,050
I went to Switzerland because I want to be the next Julia Child.

395
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,530
And if you did everything for me,

396
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,420
then I would lose my own drive to make that dream come true.

397
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,420
Do you understand that?

398
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,410
I know what dreams are.

399
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,130
Josh...

400
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,670
Look, Gabi--

401
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,070
when you left, it was horrible.

402
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,430
I was a mess.

403
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,580
So I threw myself into work--

404
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,430
and-- actually it kinda got me to a place

405
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,160
where I almost made $500 million.

406
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,540
So, me leaving was a good thing?

407
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,440
Yeah. My accountant thinks you should ruin my life more often.

408
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,890
But, Gabi...

409
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,370
I can't go through that again.

410
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:09,080
Josh, I am sorry. I am really, truly, very, very sorry.

411
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,800
And you for...

412
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,250
I forgive you, Gabi.

413
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,870
Josh, you did not have to say that.

414
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,770
So, where do we go from here?

415
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,890
How about we go back to doing what we do best?

416
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,790
- Being friends. - I would love that.

417
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,930
Me, too.

418
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,940
- So, we're good? - We're very good.

419
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:41,260
Good. Feelings talk adjourned.

420
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,120
All right. I got to get out of here.

421
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,070
I gotta get up early and start the job search.

422
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,420
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

423
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,250
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

424
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,000
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. What?

425
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,600
I can't believe I'm about to say this.

426
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,480
What?

427
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,860
- Do you want... - Yes!

428
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,510
- ...your old job back? - Yes!

429
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,480
Yes, I do, thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

430
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,460
Now I don't have to get up early.

431
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,550
Thanks for the feelings talk.

432
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,420
What are friends for?

433
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,340
- See you tomorrow, chef. - See you tomorrow, boss.

434
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:42,640
Elliot, I have some news.

435
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,070
The deal with Kal's off.

436
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,600
Damn it! All that money!

437
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,010
Okay, well, I'll just be the publicist

438
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,340
to another cutest guy in San Francisco.

439
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,800
I have some other news--

440
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,670
Adriana quit.

441
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,980
- Good morning. - No!

442
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,870
It lives! No!

00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,160
我的星期内裤收进来了
Okay, my "Days of the week" undies are done,

71
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,890
但你的胸罩还在外面晾着
but your bra is still out there drying.

72
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,070
还没干吗  面积也不大啊
Still? There's not much there to dry.

73
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,140
这又不好笑
It's not funny.

74
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,090
等等  周五的内裤呢
Hey, wait, where's Friday?

75
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,900
不  今天是周六
No, today's Saturday.

76
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,950
你好  谢天谢地是周五
Hello. Ho-oh! Thank god it's Friday.

77
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,750
它落到我的车上了
Yeah, they fell on my car.

78
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,630
其实这条内裤还去过
You know, that's actually not the craziest place

79
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,960
更怪的地方呢
that pair has landed.

80
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,540
我想听听更多细节  我是泰勒
I'd like to hear more about that. I'm Tyler.

81
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,590
-我是加比  -我是索菲亚
- I'm Gabi. - I'm Sofia.

82
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,180
她有男友  我没有
She has a boyfriend. I do not.

83
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,450
我也没有...男友
Neither do I... have a boyfriend.

84
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,320
在旧金山得说明  特别是顶着这发型
You have to say that in San Francisco. Especially with this hair.

85
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,890
真的很帅
It's really pretty.

86
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,750
既然我已经见过你的内裤了
Well, since I've already seen your underwear,

87
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,120
我觉得我请你吃晚餐才合适
I think it's only right that I buy you dinner.

88
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,020
好啊
Oh. Yeah.

89
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,220
我是说  不行  等等
I mean, no. Wait!

90
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,530
也许可以吧  有点复杂
Maybe. It's kind of complicated.

91
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,600
等等  我弄糊涂了
Wait, I'm confused.

92
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,820
你真有男朋友吗
Wait, so you do have a boyfriend?

93
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,800
不  我有个老板
No, I have a boss.

94
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,900
你知道的  当你有对象而老板没有时
And you know how when you're dating someone and your boss isn't,

95
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,500
-会有些尴尬  -不会啊
- it can be kind of awkward? - Not really.

96
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,710
能让我们单独聊会儿吗
Can you excuse us for a minute, please?

97
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,090
-我其实...  -待在这里  给
- I kind of have-- - Stay here. Here.

98
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,210
松饼啊
Ooh, a muffin.

99
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,000
加比  你为什么想着乔什
Gabi, why are you thinking about Josh?

100
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,730
你的内内飘向了那个帅哥  相信它的智慧
Your panties flew to that guy. Trust their wisdom.

101
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,330
我知道  但我刚回乔什家工作
Yeah, I know, but I just started going back to work at Josh's,

102
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,230
我怕我俩的关系很脆弱
and I'm afraid it's just so delicate

103
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,230
如果我开始跟别人约会  我俩之间就会很奇怪
that if I start dating someone, it could be kinda weird.

104
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,400
那就别在上班时说这事
Yeah, well, then just don't talk about it at work.

105
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,140
我还真没想过
That had never occurred to me.

106
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,290
泰勒  我很乐意跟你约会
Uh, Tyler, hi. I'd love to go out with you.

107
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,250
什么时候
When?

108
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,540
-你最喜欢什么颜色  -黑色
- What's your favorite color? - Black.

109
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,590
那就周三吧
Wednesday it is.

110
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,870
加比  你今早好安静啊
Gabi, you're awfully quiet this morning.

111
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,020
因为我忙着不说那件事
That's because I'm too busy not talking about it.

112
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,670
-什么事  -我碰上了一个大帅哥
- Not talking about what? - I met the cutest guy!

113
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,650
他出现在我家门口
He showed up right at my door

114
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,020
寻找我内裤的主人
looking for the owner of my underwear.

115
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,540
简直像是童话一样
It's like a fairy tale.

116
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,240
早上好
Good morning.

117
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,260
你最爱的教母出现了
Here comes your favorite godmother.

118
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,650
那你就是丑陋的继姐姐吗
Which makes you what, the ugly stepsister?

119
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,060
多说点这帅哥的情况啊
So tell me more about this guy.

120
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,610
好  他玩乐队  是耍棍子的
Okay. He's in a band, and he plays the sticks.

121
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,410
也就是说他是打鼓的
Which means he plays the drums.

122
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,880
打鼓的男人好性感啊
It is so sexy when some guy just plays the--

123
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,750
你走进来  加比就闭嘴了
Wow! When you walk in, Gabi shuts up.

124
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,980
你怎么做到的  教教我吧
How did you do that? Teach me!

125
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,780
很容易
Well, it's easy.

126
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,980
你只用在她说男人时走进来
All you do is catch her when she's talking about a guy.

127
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,980
我才没说什么男人呢
I was not talking about a guy.

128
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,020
我说的是《布偶大电影》里的动物
I was talking about animal from The Muppets.

129
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,320
对  他打鼓
Yeah. He plays the drums.

130
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,370
尤兰达以为他弹吉他  所以...
Yolanda thought he played the guitar, which is why--

131
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,560
加比
Gabi.

132
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,580
你可以聊你的约会
It's okay to talk about your dating life.

133
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,440
真的吗  你不觉得奇怪吗
Really? It doesn't make you feel weird?

134
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,110
你不难受吗  你这样说不是为了
You're not uncomfortable? You're not just saying that

135
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,090
装坚强  因为你心如死灰吗
to put on a brave face 'cause secretly you're dying inside?

136
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,840
加比  我跟你保证
Gabi, I promise you.

137
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,380
我完全没意见
I'm totally cool with it.

138
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,680
他特别有意见
He's so not cool with it.

139
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,820
加比  我以为我们说好了上班不提这事
Gabi, I thought we talked about you not talking about it at work.

140
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,740
没错  我没做到
We did. And I failed.

141
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,040
但好消息是  我意识到我只用撮合乔什
But the good news is I realized all I have to do is set up Josh.

142
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,790
坏消息是  那是最蠢的主意
And the bad news is that's the dumbest idea ever.

143
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,830
不  索菲亚  他不会接受我跟泰勒约会的
No. Sofia, he's not gonna be cool with me dating Tyler

144
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,930
除非他也跟别人约会  你怎么会不懂这个
Unless he's dating somebody too. How do you not know this?

145
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,020
也许因为我脑子里都是知识
Well, because my brain runs on knowledge,

146
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,400
而不是洋葱圈渣
not funyun dust.

147
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,140
你觉得乔什会喜欢你那个漂亮朋友迪迪吗
Hey, do you think josh would be into your pretty friend Dee Dee?

148
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,760
性病迪迪吗
ST-Dee-Dee?

149
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,070
我觉得不会
I don't think so.

150
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,200
那个谁呢  不行
Oh, what about... no.

151
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,680
那个谁呢  算了
Hey, what about... no.

152
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,450
那么...
What about...

153
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,270
她呢
her.

154
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,240
美女  你叫什么
Hey, pretty girl. What's your name?

155
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,770
-莎拉  -莎拉
-Sarah. -oh, Sarah.

156
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,330
莎拉  名字很性感  你单身吗
Sarah. Sexy name. You single?

157
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,480
我受宠若惊  但我不喜欢女孩
Look, I'm flattered, but I'm not into girls.

158
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,630
不是的  我不是在给自己搭讪
Oh, oh, no, no, no. It's not for me.

159
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,070
是给他
It's for him.

160
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,420
他叫乔什  今年三十岁  帅气又土豪
His name is Josh, he's 30, sexy and super successful.

161
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,790
既然他那么好  你怎么不跟他约会
Oh. Well, if he's so great, why don't you date him?

162
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,330
因为他是我老板  那样太不专业了
Because he's my boss, and that would be super unprofessional.

163
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,960
-他笑起来确实挺可爱  -没错
- He does have a cute smile. - Yeah.

164
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,830
开保时捷的样子更可爱
Looks even cuter in his Porsche.

165
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,340
埃兰  冷静
Alan, calm down!

166
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,390
所以你变装皇后宾果的主持人不干了
So your Drag Queen Bingo host dropped out,

167
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,840
你需要另外找个男扮女装的人
And you need to find a man dressed as a woman.

168
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,170
不  我才不做
No, I will not do it.

169
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,850
我知道你叫我亚洲小公主
I know you call me your Asian Princess,

170
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,720
但那仅限在卧室
but that's just for the bedroom!

171
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,810
不许吃软糖蛋糕
Step away from the Fudgey Cakes!

172
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,020
我们会给你找到别的主持  我保证  再见
We will find you another bingo host, I promise. Bye!

173
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,260
我听见你说需要个主持
Did I hear you say you need a bingo host?

174
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,890
我在教堂主持过宾果  可棒了
Because I call bingo at church, and I'm damn good at it.

175
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,210
相信我  尤兰达  这活不适合你
Trust me, Yolanda. This is not the gig for you.

176
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,730
别这样嘛  我可会带气氛了
Oh, come on! I got a whole shtick.

177
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:04,590
摸出I8  我喊"我吃了[音似]一整个披萨"
I grab a ball and I call out, "I-8... a whole pizza, y'all."

178
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,920
牧师都被我气死了
It killed the reverend.

179
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,040
没关系  他去更好的地方了
It's okay, he's in a better place.

180
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,250
对不起  尤兰达  但真的不行
Sorry, Yolanda, but the answer's no.

181
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,100
别这样嘛  为什么我不行
Oh, come on. Why can't I do it?

182
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,610
因为你不是...
Because you're not a--

183
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,190
等等  你转一圈
You know what? Spin.

184
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,290
也许你确实行
You might be able to pull this off.

185
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,360
我就说嘛
That's what I've been saying!

186
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,000
谢谢  艾略特  你真棒
Thanks, Elliot, oh! You the man!

187
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,250
不  有"棒"的是你
No, you are.

188
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,880
别怕饿  午餐到
Never fear, lunch is here.

189
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,520
好啦  我们有叉子刀子勺子  和莎拉
Okay. We've got a fork, a knife, a spoon, and a Sarah.

190
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,990
莎拉是啥
What's a Sarah?

191
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,550
这个  她跟我住一栋楼
This. She lives in my building,

192
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,260
特别可爱  是个律师助理  还练普拉提
she's super cute, she's a paralegal, she does Pilates.

193
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,860
你这是干什么
What are you doing?

194
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,800
你知道你有阵子没约会了吧
So you know how you haven't dated anybody in a while?

195
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,150
我选择的  我来选  不是她们
By choice. My choice, not theirs.

196
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,280
-那我的选择是莎拉  -不用  谢谢
- Well, my choice is Sarah. - No, thank you.

197
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,300
加比  自己能找女朋友的  我是谁啊
Gabi, I can get a girl on my own. I'm me.

198
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,250
但这是对我最好的选择
But it would be the best thing for me--

199
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,490
还有你  莎拉  还有大家
you-- Sarah-- everyone.

200
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,770
我只是觉得我们之间发生那么多...
Look, I just feel like after everything that happened between us,

201
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,530
-你懂的  四以后  -加比  够惹
- you know, all that "sturff"... - Gabi, "enurf."

202
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,470
我只是觉得如果我跟别人约会了
I just thought you might be a little uncomfortable

203
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,140
而你没有  你会不舒服
if I'm dating someone and you're not

204
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,990
因为你也许还对某人有感觉呢
because you might still have feelings for a certain someone.

205
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,230
自恋狂
Set it up.

206
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,910
要不这样  我们一起出去吧
Better yet, why don't we all go out together.

207
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,320
怎么样  我和莎拉  你和动物
How about that? Me, Sarah, you, animal.

208
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,670
好啊
Great!

209
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,620
好的  但能今晚就去吗
Okay, oh, uh, but can we do it tonight?

210
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,990
因为今天是星期三
Because today is wednesday,

211
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,760
我编了个特别好笑的内衣笑话
and I made a really cute underwear joke.

212
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,240
加比告诉我你是乐队的鼓手
So Gabi tells me you are the drummer in a band.

213
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,810
-太帅了  -没错  只差一首主打歌
- That's awesome. - Yeah. We're one hit from making it big.

214
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,780
我们乐队的名字叫"只差一首主打歌"
That's the name of our band, "One Hit From Making It Big."

215
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,720
你听过他们的歌吗
Have you heard any of their music?

216
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,190
没有  但我听过他在桌上打节奏
No, but I heard him tapping on the table.

217
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,880
特别有天赋
He's very talented.

218
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,520
莎拉  来帮我做甜点吧
So, uh, Sarah, do you want to help me with dessert?

219
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,790
如果那是"我们去谈谈男人"的暗号  那当然
If that's code for "Let's talk about the boys," hell yeah.

220
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,630
谢谢
Thank you.

221
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,730
加比说你们是在她家认识的  你住在附近吗
Gabi mentioned you met, uh, at her place. Do you live nearby?

222
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,300
-只有周二周四才是  -什么
- Only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. - What?

223
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,530
是  周一周三会有扫大街的
Yeah, well, Mondays and Wednesdays is street cleaning

224
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:30,580
而我觉得周末最好还是把车停在城外
and weekends I find it best to park outside the city.

225
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,320
因为...你住在  你的车里吗
Because... you live... in your car?

226
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,460
没错
Yup.

227
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,340
我重新调整了座椅  几乎能在车里躺下
I re-jiggered the seat so I almost have a full recline.

228
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,770
而且我的空气清新剂是椰林飘香味
And I got a Pina Colada air refresher,

229
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,370
所以就感觉自己在度假
so it's like I'm always on vacation.

230
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,720
真不错  请稍等
Sweet. Hey, give me a second.

231
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,520
泰勒是个流浪汉
Tyler is homeless.

232
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,180
-什么  -他其实有家啦
- What? - I shouldn't say he's homeless.

233
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,170
车就是他的家  就像只乌龟
His car is his home, like a turtle.

234
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,200
好吧  你是怎么知道的
Okay, where is this coming from?

235
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,790
他自己跟我说的  还很自豪
- He told me, proudly.

236
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,530
-那只乌龟亲口告诉我的  -我不相信
- I got it straight from the turtle's mouth. - I don't believe you.

237
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,960
洗手间在哪
Hey, where's the bathroom?

238
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,170
就在走廊尽头
Oh, it's just right down the hall.

239
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,390
有个洗手间真好
Oh, I love bathrooms,

240
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,340
要不还得花25美分才能上厕所
I don't need a quarter to get into.

241
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,450
对了  我能不能顺便把衬衫洗了
Hey, is it cool if I hand-wash my shirt in there?

242
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,850
算了吧  也不脏
Oh, you know what? I'm cool.

243
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,880
这还是不能说明他无家可归
Okay, that doesn't prove he's homeless.

244
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,280
我这么问  是因为我住在我的车里
Oh, the reason I'm asking is 'cause I live in my car.

245
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,950
好吧  能说明
Okay, that does.

246
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,910
快来看看我今晚主持宾果的新裙子
Hey, y'all. Check out my new dress for hosting bingo night.

247
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,680
能展露我的身材曲线
It's gonna show off all my curves.

248
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,130
副乳也展露得出来啊
And maybe a little sideboob too.

249
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,780
-不错  -才不是
- Nice. - Not really.

250
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,680
你没有浮夸点的衣服吗  是酒吧哎
Don't you have anything flashier? It's a bar!

251
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,150
带亮片的  能突出你宽阔性感的肩膀
Something sparkly, that accentuates your broad sexy shoulders

252
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,210
和你粗壮有型的腿
and your strong, shapely legs.

253
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,140
-是啊  又不是去教堂玩宾果  -就是嘛
- Yeah! This ain't church bingo. - Testify!

254
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,440
但是如果要露那么多  我还得去脱毛
But if I'm gonna be showing all that skin, I gotta go get waxed.

255
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,290
不用的
Don't bother.

256
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,530
-早安  乔什  -你好
- Morning Josh - Oh hey.

257
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,170
昨晚和泰勒过得如何
How'd your night go last night with Tyler?

258
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,660
你们采取安全措施了吗
Did you guys use protection?

259
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,000
你懂的  系安全带了吗
You know, seat belts?

260
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,460
你跟莎拉也开这种玩笑吗
Oh, are those the kind of jokes you use on Sarah?

261
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,120
你们昨晚怎么样
How'd that work out for ya?

262
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,180
我感觉我们似乎还会再见的
Something tells me I'm gonna see her again.

263
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,650
-早  -我说吧
- Morning. - Told ya.

264
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,220
莎拉  昨晚我过得很开心
Hi, Sarah. I had a great night with you last night.

265
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,540
-我也是  -等会儿打给你吗
- Me too. - Call ya later?

266
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,600
等不及了
Can't wait.

267
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,240
加比  谢谢你把他介绍给我
Gabi, thanks for the awesome setup.

268
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,360
现在我放心多了  这城里奇葩太多
I'm just so relieved. There are so many weirdos in this city.

269
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,860
是啊  每条街上都有
Yep, there's one parked on every corner.

270
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,180
我可能把钥匙落在楼上了
I think I left my keys upstairs.

271
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,430
莎拉  我找到了你的...
Sarah, I found your...

272
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,670
一罐牙吗
jar of teeth?

273
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,490
好诡异  好诡异的一罐牙
Really, really creepy jar of teeth!

274
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,050
你妹啊
What the hell?

275
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,960
我肯定把钥匙放在这儿了
I know I must have put them up here somewhere.

276
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,490
你或许该看看在不在包里
Uh, maybe you wanna... check your purse?

277
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,230
我看看...
Let's see...

278
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,470
在这儿呢
here they are. Ah!

279
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,470
明明在眼前
Don't you hate it when something

280
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,850
却看不见  真是太烦人了
is right in front of you and you can't see it?

281
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,430
我什么都没看见
No, I didn't see anything.

282
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,070
好  家里见啦
Okay, well, see you back at the apartment.

283
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,510
我锁了门就见不着你了
Not if I lock my door.

284
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,150
乔什  乔什
Josh, Josh, Josh, Josh!

285
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,990
我一不小心把莎拉的包弄掉了
I accidentally knocked Sarah's purse over,

286
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,810
你永远也不会相信我看到了什么
and you're never gonna believe what came out!

287
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,490
-一罐牙  -什么
- A jar of teeth. - What?

288
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,150
一罐牙  还不止呢
A jar of teeth! But wait, that's not all.

289
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,730
还有个银色的尖东西  拔牙的东西
There was also a silver pointy thing, and a pully thing,

290
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,690
还有个钳牙的东西
and a clampy thing,

291
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,620
我觉得那都不是好东西
and I think she uses them for bad things.

292
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,450
加比  淡定  我不知道你看见的...
Okay, Gabi, calm down. I'm not sure what you saw...

293
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,410
没错  还有个锯子
There was a saw too!

294
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,580
你不能再约她了
You have to stop dating her.

295
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,610
加比  我明白了
Oh, Gabi, I see what's going on here.

296
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,220
你还记得你以为你在约会
Remember when you thought I'd be uncomfortable

297
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,500
而我会不高兴吗
if you were dating somebody and I wasn't?

298
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,390
不
No.

299
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,050
不  不是这样的好吗
No. That is not what's happening here, okay?

300
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,870
她是变态  可能很危险
She's sick. She could be dangerous.

301
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,360
我没说你是故意这样的
Look, I'm not saying you're doing it on purpose.

302
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,450
只是觉得你可能还没发现
I just think it's a little unconscious.

303
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,190
是吗  我觉得你最后会在笼子里喊"救命"
Yeah? Well, I think you're gonna be in a cage yelling, "Help me!"

304
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,580
但因为没了牙  只能喊出来"巨闷"
But because you have no teeth, it's gonna come out, "Melp me!

305
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,050
"巨闷"
"Melp me!

306
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,040
"巨闷"
Melp me!"

307
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,120
我把她包碰掉到地上  开始还想
I dropped her purse on the ground, and at first I was like,

308
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,050
"不好  别把她手机摔坏了"
"Oh, no, I hope I didn't break her phone."

309
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,920
然后就是  "不好  我找到一罐牙齿"
And then I was like, "Oh, no, I found a jar of teeth!"

310
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,930
真的吗  加比
Really, Gabi?

311
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:15,780
还是这也像当初
Or is this like the time

312
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,930
你觉得那匹巡逻马对你抛媚眼那样
you thought that police horse winked at you?

313
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,190
不是的  我亲眼看见了  还拿在手里
No! Okay? I saw them. I held them in my hands.

314

You have a dog? I didn't think they let us have pets.

Then I got your photo and forgot how to drive.

340
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,310
不如来杯红酒吧
How does a glass of wine sound?

341
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,450
你想给他下毒  偷他牙齿
Like you're gonna poison him and steal his teeth!

342
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:43,060

Yeah, like that's a thing.

355
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,150
就是真的
It is a thing.

356
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,350
那为什么罐子上都是名字  莎拉
Well, why are there all the names on the jars, Sarah?

357
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,750
那是我客户的名字
They're my customers.

358
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,060
乔什可不是你客户  你解释啊
Well, Josh is not a customer. So, explain that.

359
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,760

362
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,070
莎拉  你的故事还有个小漏洞
Well, Sarah, there's just one little hole in your story.

363
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,970
一个小蛀牙
A cavity, if you will.

364
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,000
你说的这些
Where is all of this so-called

365
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,490
牙齿首饰我怎么没见着
teeth jewelry I am hearing so much about?

366
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,780

I wasn't gonna say anything, but it's kinda weird.

374
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,160
我自己根本不戴

我觉得这还挺酷的
I guess that's kinda cool.

378
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,620
你的牙都是从哪来的
Where do you get these teeth from?

379
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,940
我闯进停尸房拔的

407
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,800
加比  你知道我们不会
Gabi, you know we're not always gonna be

408
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,750
总是同时有对象的
dating people at the same exact time.

409
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,360
我知道  我只是想让我们回到正常
Yeah, I know. I think I was just trying to get us back to normal.

410
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,580

413
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,410
我们要试着忘掉

414
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,610
你知道我们之间是什么样吗

从你为我工作开始

416
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,260
我们的关系就从没正常过
our relationship's been anything but normal.

417
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,770
对我们来说  奇怪才是正常
So for us, normal is weird.

418
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,290
而正常才奇怪
And weird is normal.

419
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,580
现在开始  我们接受这奇怪就好
From now on, I think we should just embrace the weird.

420

奇怪是我们要接受的

426
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,570
今天是周四  我把车停楼下
It's Thursday, so I was parked downstairs

427
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,400
一整天脑子里都在想着你
and I just couldn't get your pretty little face

428
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,630
漂亮的小脸蛋
out of my head all day,

429
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,890
所以就想上楼来见见本尊
So I thought I'd come up and see it in person.

430
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,360
-你是想上厕所  对不对  -憋死我了
- You have to use the bathroom, don't you? - So bad.

431
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,810
你家还有那松饼吗
Hey, do you have any more of those muffins?

432
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,540
要接受奇怪
Embrace the weird.

433
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,440
我本该生你的气
I should be mad at you,

434
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,900
但我得承认
but I gotta admit it,

435
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,310
那还挺好玩
that was fun.

436
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,310
你的确没料到  但像个男人一样挺住了
It was a big surprise, but you took it like a man.

437
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,720
没错  你在台上真棒
You sure did. You were amazing out there.

438
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,870
是吗
I was?

439
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,610
谢谢
Thank you.

440
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,900
我能请你喝杯酒吗
Can I buy you a drink?

441
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,200
请我喝两杯好了
You can buy me two.

442
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,370
先说清楚
So I'm clear,

443
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,140
这家伙以为我是男人才来搭讪的  对吗
this guy's flirting with me because he thinks I'm a man, right?

444
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,500
宾果
Bingo.

445
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,140

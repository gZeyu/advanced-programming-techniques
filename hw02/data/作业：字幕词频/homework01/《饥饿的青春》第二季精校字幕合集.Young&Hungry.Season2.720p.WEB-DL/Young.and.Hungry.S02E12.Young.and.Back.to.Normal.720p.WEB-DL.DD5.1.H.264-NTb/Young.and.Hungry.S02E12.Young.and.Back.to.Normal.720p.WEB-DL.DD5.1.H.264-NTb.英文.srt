70
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,160
Okay, my "Days of the week" undies are done,

71
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,890
but your bra is still out there drying.

72
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,070
Still? There's not much there to dry.

73
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,140
It's not funny.

74
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,090
Hey, wait, where's Friday?

75
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,900
No, today's Saturday.

76
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,950
Hello. Ho-oh! Thank god it's Friday.

77
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,750
Yeah, they fell on my car.

78
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,630
You know, that's actually not the craziest place

79
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,960
that pair has landed.

80
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,540
I'd like to hear more about that. I'm Tyler.

81
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,590
- I'm Gabi. - I'm Sofia.

82
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,180
She has a boyfriend. I do not.

83
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,450
Neither do I... have a boyfriend.

84
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,320
You have to say that in San Francisco. Especially with this hair.

85
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,890
It's really pretty.

86
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,750
Well, since I've already seen your underwear,

87
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,120
I think it's only right that I buy you dinner.

88
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,020
Oh. Yeah.

89
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,220
I mean, no. Wait!

90
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,530
Maybe. It's kind of complicated.

91
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,600
Wait, I'm confused.

92
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,820
Wait, so you do have a boyfriend?

93
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,800
No, I have a boss.

94
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,900
And you know how when you're dating someone and your boss isn't,

95
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,500
- it can be kind of awkward? - Not really.

96
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,710
Can you excuse us for a minute, please?

97
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,090
- I kind of have-- - Stay here. Here.

98
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,210
Ooh, a muffin.

99
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,000
Gabi, why are you thinking about Josh?

100
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,730
Your panties flew to that guy. Trust their wisdom.

101
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,330
Yeah, I know, but I just started going back to work at Josh's,

102
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,230
and I'm afraid it's just so delicate

103
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,230
that if I start dating someone, it could be kinda weird.

104
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,400
Yeah, well, then just don't talk about it at work.

105
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,140
That had never occurred to me.

106
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,290
Uh, Tyler, hi. I'd love to go out with you.

107
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,250
When?

108
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,540
- What's your favorite color? - Black.

109
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,590
Wednesday it is.

110
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,870
Gabi, you're awfully quiet this morning.

111
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,020
That's because I'm too busy not talking about it.

112
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,670
- Not talking about what? - I met the cutest guy!

113
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,650
He showed up right at my door

114
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,020
looking for the owner of my underwear.

115
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,540
It's like a fairy tale.

116
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,240
Good morning.

117
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,260
Here comes your favorite godmother.

118
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,650
Which makes you what, the ugly stepsister?

119
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,060
So tell me more about this guy.

120
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,610
Okay. He's in a band, and he plays the sticks.

121
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,410
Which means he plays the drums.

122
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,880
It is so sexy when some guy just plays the--

123
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,750
Wow! When you walk in, Gabi shuts up.

124
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,980
How did you do that? Teach me!

125
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,780
Well, it's easy.

126
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,980
All you do is catch her when she's talking about a guy.

127
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,980
I was not talking about a guy.

128
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,020
I was talking about animal from The Muppets.

129
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,320
Yeah. He plays the drums.

130
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,370
Yolanda thought he played the guitar, which is why--

131
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,560
Gabi.

132
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,580
It's okay to talk about your dating life.

133
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,440
Really? It doesn't make you feel weird?

134
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,110
You're not uncomfortable? You're not just saying that

135
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,090
to put on a brave face 'cause secretly you're dying inside?

136
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,840
Gabi, I promise you.

137
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,380
I'm totally cool with it.

138
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,680
He's so not cool with it.

139
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,820
Gabi, I thought we talked about you not talking about it at work.

140
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,740
We did. And I failed.

141
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,040
But the good news is I realized all I have to do is set up Josh.

142
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,790
And the bad news is that's the dumbest idea ever.

143
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,830
No. Sofia, he's not gonna be cool with me dating Tyler

144
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,930
Unless he's dating somebody too. How do you not know this?

145
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,020
Well, because my brain runs on knowledge,

146
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,400
not funyun dust.

147
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,140
Hey, do you think josh would be into your pretty friend Dee Dee?

148
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,760
ST-Dee-Dee?

149
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,070
I don't think so.

150
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,200
Oh, what about... no.

151
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,680
Hey, what about... no.

152
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,450
What about...

153
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,270
her.

154
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,240
Hey, pretty girl. What's your name?

155
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,770
-Sarah. -oh, Sarah.

156
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,330
Sarah. Sexy name. You single?

157
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,480
Look, I'm flattered, but I'm not into girls.

158
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,630
Oh, oh, no, no, no. It's not for me.

159
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,070
It's for him.

160
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,420
His name is Josh, he's 30, sexy and super successful.

161
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,790
Oh. Well, if he's so great, why don't you date him?

162
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,330
Because he's my boss, and that would be super unprofessional.

163
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,960
- He does have a cute smile. - Yeah.

164
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,830
Looks even cuter in his Porsche.

165
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,340
Alan, calm down!

166
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,390
So your Drag Queen Bingo host dropped out,

167
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,840
And you need to find a man dressed as a woman.

168
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,170
No, I will not do it.

169
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,850
I know you call me your Asian Princess,

170
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,720
but that's just for the bedroom!

171
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,810
Step away from the Fudgey Cakes!

172
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,020
We will find you another bingo host, I promise. Bye!

173
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,260
Did I hear you say you need a bingo host?

174
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,890
Because I call bingo at church, and I'm damn good at it.

175
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,210
Trust me, Yolanda. This is not the gig for you.

176
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,730
Oh, come on! I got a whole shtick.

177
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:04,590
I grab a ball and I call out, "I-8... a whole pizza, y'all."

178
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,920
It killed the reverend.

179
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,040
It's okay, he's in a better place.

180
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,250
Sorry, Yolanda, but the answer's no.

181
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,100
Oh, come on. Why can't I do it?

182
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,610
Because you're not a--

183
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,190
You know what? Spin.

184
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,290
You might be able to pull this off.

185
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,360
That's what I've been saying!

186
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,000
Thanks, Elliot, oh! You the man!

187
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,250
No, you are.

188
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,880
Never fear, lunch is here.

189
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,520
Okay. We've got a fork, a knife, a spoon, and a Sarah.

190
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,990
What's a Sarah?

191
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,550
This. She lives in my building,

192
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,260
she's super cute, she's a paralegal, she does Pilates.

193
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,860
What are you doing?

194
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,800
So you know how you haven't dated anybody in a while?

195
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,150
By choice. My choice, not theirs.

196
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,280
- Well, my choice is Sarah. - No, thank you.

197
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,300
Gabi, I can get a girl on my own. I'm me.

198
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,250
But it would be the best thing for me--

199
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,490
you-- Sarah-- everyone.

200
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,770
Look, I just feel like after everything that happened between us,

201
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,530
- you know, all that "sturff"... - Gabi, "enurf."

202
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,470
I just thought you might be a little uncomfortable

203
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,140
if I'm dating someone and you're not

204
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,990
because you might still have feelings for a certain someone.

205
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,230
Set it up.

206
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,910
Better yet, why don't we all go out together.

207
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,320
How about that? Me, Sarah, you, animal.

208
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,670
Great!

209
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,620
Okay, oh, uh, but can we do it tonight?

210
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,990
Because today is wednesday,

211
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,760
and I made a really cute underwear joke.

212
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,240
So Gabi tells me you are the drummer in a band.

213
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,810
- That's awesome. - Yeah. We're one hit from making it big.

214
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,780
That's the name of our band, "One Hit From Making It Big."

215
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,720
Have you heard any of their music?

216
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,190
No, but I heard him tapping on the table.

217
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,880
He's very talented.

218
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,520
So, uh, Sarah, do you want to help me with dessert?

219
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,790
If that's code for "Let's talk about the boys," hell yeah.

220
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,630
Thank you.

221
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,730
Gabi mentioned you met, uh, at her place. Do you live nearby?

222
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,300
- Only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. - What?

223
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,530
Yeah, well, Mondays and Wednesdays is street cleaning

224
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:30,580
and weekends I find it best to park outside the city.

225
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,320
Because... you live... in your car?

226
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,460
Yup.

227
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,340
I re-jiggered the seat so I almost have a full recline.

228
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,770
And I got a Pina Colada air refresher,

229
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,370
so it's like I'm always on vacation.

230
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,720
Sweet. Hey, give me a second.

231
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,520
Tyler is homeless.

232
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,180
- What? - I shouldn't say he's homeless.

233
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,170
His car is his home, like a turtle.

234
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,200
Okay, where is this coming from?

235
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,790
- He told me, proudly.

236
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,530
- I got it straight from the turtle's mouth. - I don't believe you.

237
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,960
Hey, where's the bathroom?

238
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,170
Oh, it's just right down the hall.

239
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,390
Oh, I love bathrooms,

240
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,340
I don't need a quarter to get into.

241
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,450
Hey, is it cool if I hand-wash my shirt in there?

242
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,850
Oh, you know what? I'm cool.

243
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,880
Okay, that doesn't prove he's homeless.

244
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,280
Oh, the reason I'm asking is 'cause I live in my car.

245
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,950
Okay, that does.

246
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,910
Hey, y'all. Check out my new dress for hosting bingo night.

247
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,680
It's gonna show off all my curves.

248
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,130
And maybe a little sideboob too.

249
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,780
- Nice. - Not really.

250
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,680
Don't you have anything flashier? It's a bar!

251
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,150
Something sparkly, that accentuates your broad sexy shoulders

252
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,210
and your strong, shapely legs.

253
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,140
- Yeah! This ain't church bingo. - Testify!

254
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,440
But if I'm gonna be showing all that skin, I gotta go get waxed.

255
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,290
Don't bother.

256
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,530
- Morning Josh - Oh hey.

257
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,170
How'd your night go last night with Tyler?

258
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,660
Did you guys use protection?

259
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,000
You know, seat belts?

260
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,460
Oh, are those the kind of jokes you use on Sarah?

261
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,120
How'd that work out for ya?

262
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,180
Something tells me I'm gonna see her again.

263
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,650
- Morning. - Told ya.

264
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,220
Hi, Sarah. I had a great night with you last night.

265
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,540
- Me too. - Call ya later?

266
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,600
Can't wait.

267
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,240
Gabi, thanks for the awesome setup.

268
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,360
I'm just so relieved. There are so many weirdos in this city.

269
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,860
Yep, there's one parked on every corner.

270
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,180
I think I left my keys upstairs.

271
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,430
Sarah, I found your...

272
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,670
jar of teeth?

273
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,490
Really, really creepy jar of teeth!

274
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,050
What the hell?

275
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,960
I know I must have put them up here somewhere.

276
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,490
Uh, maybe you wanna... check your purse?

277
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,230
Let's see...

278
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,470
here they are. Ah!

279
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,470
Don't you hate it when something

280
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,850
is right in front of you and you can't see it?

281
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,430
No, I didn't see anything.

282
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,070
Okay, well, see you back at the apartment.

283
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,510
Not if I lock my door.

284
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,150
Josh, Josh, Josh, Josh!

285
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,990
I accidentally knocked Sarah's purse over,

286
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,810
and you're never gonna believe what came out!

287
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,490
- A jar of teeth. - What?

288
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,150
A jar of teeth! But wait, that's not all.

289
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,730
There was also a silver pointy thing, and a pully thing,

290
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,690
and a clampy thing,

291
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,620
and I think she uses them for bad things.

292
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,450
Okay, Gabi, calm down. I'm not sure what you saw...

293
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,410
There was a saw too!

294
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,580
You have to stop dating her.

295
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,610
Oh, Gabi, I see what's going on here.

296
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,220
Remember when you thought I'd be uncomfortable

297
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,500
if you were dating somebody and I wasn't?

298
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,390
No.

299
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,050
No. That is not what's happening here, okay?

300
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,870
She's sick. She could be dangerous.

301
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,360
Look, I'm not saying you're doing it on purpose.

302
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,450
I just think it's a little unconscious.

303
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,190
Yeah? Well, I think you're gonna be in a cage yelling, "Help me!"

304
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,580
But because you have no teeth, it's gonna come out, "Melp me!

305
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,050
"Melp me!

306
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,040
Melp me!"

307
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,120
I dropped her purse on the ground, and at first I was like,

308
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,050
"Oh, no, I hope I didn't break her phone."

309
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,920
And then I was like, "Oh, no, I found a jar of teeth!"

310
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,930
Really, Gabi?

311
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:15,780
Or is this like the time

312
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,930
you thought that police horse winked at you?

313
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,190
No! Okay? I saw them. I held them in my hands.

314
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,040
What is it gonna take to get people to believe me?

315
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,430
- You don't have to prove it to me. - Yes, yes!

316
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,880
- I have to prove it. - I'm not gonna help--

317
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,280
And you're gonna help me!

318
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,360
Sarah, hi. Can you help me? I lost my dog.

319
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,250
You have a dog? I didn't think they let us have pets.

320
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,000
Right. Uh... it's a friend's dog...

321
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,180
Ryan Gosling.

322
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,670
You're friends with Ryan Gosling?

323
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,830
No, no. No, that's the name of the dog.

324
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,310
I think I just saw him! Um, can you please come help?

325
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:04,670
- Ryan Gosling! Come here, boy! - Ryan!

326
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,410
Okay. If I were a creepy jar of teeth, where would I be?

327
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,230
Ryan Gosling! Ryan Gosling!

328
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,580
Oh, no, these are Tic-Tacs.

329
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,440
I'm sorry, good luck finding Ryan Gosling.

331
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,660
Josh-- oh, my god.

332
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,310
I'm so scared. I'm so scared.

333
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,180
Hi, I'm calling you about your ad on Craigslist.

334
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,870
Do you still have the electric saw?

335
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,650
Oh, good. Does it cut through bone?

336
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,240
Perfect. Thank you.

337
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,970
Please be Sofia. Please be Sofia. Please be...

338
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
I got your text and I jumped in my car.

339
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,080
Then I got your photo and forgot how to drive.

340
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,310
How does a glass of wine sound?

341
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,450
Like you're gonna poison him and steal his teeth!

342
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:43,060
- Sounds good to me. - That's why I already poured one.

343
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,580
Really?

344
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,850
It's poison! Don't drink it! Don't drink it, no!

345
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,320
Don't drink it! Don't drink it! No!

346
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,190
- Get away from him, you freak! - Gabi!

347
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,290
What the hell are you doing in my apartment?

348
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,200
- Explain yourself! - Explain yourself!

349
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,720
You're the one hiding in my closet.

350
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
You're the one with a closet full of teeth!

351
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,480
Josh, look! Do you remember when you thought I was crazy?

352
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,660
- Uh, Sarah? - I can explain.

353
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,540
I make jewelry out of teeth and sell it on Etsy.

354
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,230
Yeah, like that's a thing.

355
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,150
It is a thing.

356
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,350
Well, why are there all the names on the jars, Sarah?

357
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,750
They're my customers.

358
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,060
Well, Josh is not a customer. So, explain that.

359
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,760
I was making him a surprise pair of cufflinks.

360
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,110
You hear that, Gabi? She was making me a surprise pair of...

361
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,000
teeth cufflinks.

362
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,070
Well, Sarah, there's just one little hole in your story.

363
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,970
A cavity, if you will.

364
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,000
Where is all of this so-called

365
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,490
teeth jewelry I am hearing so much about?

366
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,780
Story checks out.

367
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,170
Mystery explained.

368
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,610
My work here is done. I will take my leave.

369
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,850
Goodbye!

370
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,540
- I'm so sorry. - It's not your fault.

371
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,910
A lot of people think teeth jewelry's weird.

372
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:03,900
Okay, thank god.

373
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,870
I wasn't gonna say anything, but it's kinda weird.

374
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,160
I mean, I don't even wear it myself.

375
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,110
But there is a whole market for it:

376
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,050
- Goths, metalheads, dental hygienists. - Really?

377
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,820
I guess that's kinda cool.

378
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,620
Where do you get these teeth from?

379
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,940
I break into morgues.

380
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,540
She breaks into-- yep, time to go.

381
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,930
Thank you!

382
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,970
Damn! Work it, girl!

383
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,160
Thank you, baby!

384
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,530
If you got it, flaunt it!

385
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,860
Yolanda, you look like a queen.

387
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,690
Drag queen bingo?

388
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,050
Ladies and gentlemen, help me welcome to the stage

389
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:14,530
The Adam's apple of everyone's eye, Miss Yolanda!

390
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,600
Oh, hell no!

391
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,060
Wait, Yolanda.

392
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,610
You want me to pull balls?

393
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:23,000
The first balls I'm gonna pull are yours!

394
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,170
- Yolanda! - Listen to them, Yolanda.

395
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,840
They love you.

396
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,460
Yolanda! Yolanda!

397
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,860
Well, they are chanting my name.

398
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,570
So let's get this party started.

399
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,660
Let me hear you say "hey!"

400
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,930
The first ball of the night is...

401
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,620
B18
B-18.

402
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,880
If you want a piece of this, you better be 18!

403
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:11,080
- Morgues? - Morgues.

404
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,170
Man, we sure can pick 'em.

405
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,580
- We? - Okay, fine. Me.

406
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,070
Look...

407
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,800
Gabi, you know we're not always gonna be

408
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,750
dating people at the same exact time.

409
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,360
Yeah, I know. I think I was just trying to get us back to normal.

410
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,580
- You know, before all of that... - "Sturff"?

411
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,310
Yeah, "Sturff."

412
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,790
Well, look, sometimes "sturff" happens.

413
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,410
And we gotta get past that.

414
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,610
And you know what we have going for us?

415
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,060
Ever since you started working for me,

416
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,260
our relationship's been anything but normal.

417
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,770
So for us, normal is weird.

418
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,290
And weird is normal.

419
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,580
From now on, I think we should just embrace the weird.

420
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,410
The weird is what we need to embrace.

421
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,790
- Morgues! - Morgues!

422
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,890
All right. See ya tomorrow, weirdo.

423
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,130
Okay, bye, freak show.

424
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,600
- 'Sup, bro? - Embracing the weird.

425
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,430
- Hey, Tyler. - Hey, you.

426
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,570
It's Thursday, so I was parked downstairs

427
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,400
and I just couldn't get your pretty little face

428
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,630
out of my head all day,

429
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,890
So I thought I'd come up and see it in person.

430
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,360
- You have to use the bathroom, don't you? - So bad.

431
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,810
Hey, do you have any more of those muffins?

432
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,540
Embrace the weird.

433
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,440
I should be mad at you,

434
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,900
but I gotta admit it,

435
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,310
that was fun.

436
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,310
It was a big surprise, but you took it like a man.

437
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,720
You sure did. You were amazing out there.

438
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,870
I was?

439
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,610
Thank you.

440
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,900
Can I buy you a drink?

441
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,200
You can buy me two.

442
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,370
So I'm clear,

443
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,140
this guy's flirting with me because he thinks I'm a man, right?

444
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,500
Bingo.

445
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,140
Hi, I'm Frank.

00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,230
好了  幸運餅干時間
Okay. Fortune cookie time.

71
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,370
選一個
Pick one.

72
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,630
這個  不  這個
This one. No, this one.

73
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,160
-不  這個  -這個怎么樣
- No, this one. - Okay, how about this one?

74
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,920
"別人求助時  你很樂意竭盡全力"
"When asked, you will gladly bend over backwards."

75
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,470
無聊
Boring!

76
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,900
是啊  它們都好無聊
Yeah, they're all boring.

77
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,540
所以你得加上"在床上"
That's why you have to add "in bed."

78
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,850
"別人求助時  你很樂意在床上竭盡全力"
"When asked, you will gladly bend over backwards..." in bed!

79
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,870
-真棒  輪到你了  -好好好
- That's good. Okay. Your turn. Your turn. - Okay. Okay. Okay.

80
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,310
拜托告訴我我能找到工作
Oh, please tell me I'm going to get a job.

81
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,440
什么  開玩笑嗎
What? Are you kidding me?

82
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,630
我什么都沒有
I got nothing.

83
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,790
在床上
In bed!

84
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,330
不  我真的什么都沒有  我餅干是空的
No. I really don't have anything. My cookie's empty.

85
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,250
在床上
In bed!

86
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,680
加比  行了  我真的很沮喪
Gabi, stop. I'm really depressed.

87
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,160
顯然我永遠也找不到工作了
It's obvious I'm never going to get a job

88
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,290
連餅干都沒膽子告訴我
and this cookie doesn't have the balls to tell me.

89
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,220
坐在家里掰幸運餅干
Okay. Well, you're never going to get a job

90
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,050
是找不到工作的  好嗎
sitting at home reading fortune cookies. Okay?

91
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,400
你得嚴肅對待
You have to take this seriously.

92
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,020
得去真正能
You have to go somewhere

93
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,300
幫你找到工作的地方
that actually is going to help you find a job.

94
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,320
那是哪里
And where is that?

95
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,880
精靈告訴我
The spirits are telling me

96
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,410
你就快有錢了
that money is coming your way.

97
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,600
好吧  這跟幸運餅干有什么區別
Okay. How is this different from a fortune cookie?

98
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,920
她不是餅干
Well, she's not a cookie,

99
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,760
是訓練有素的專業人士
and she is a trained professional.

100
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,380
這太荒唐了
This is ridiculous.

101
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,180
我看到你很快就會...
I see that soon you will be--

102
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,080
退我錢  在床上
asking for a refund "in bed."

103
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,250
難以置信你居然帶我來這里
I can't believe you brought me here.

104
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,270
我該帶你去哪里啊
Well, where was I supposed to bring you?

105
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,450
不知道  去找求職顧問啊
I don't know. A job counselor?

106
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,430
求職顧問
A job counselor.

107
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,320
好像那不騙人一樣
Like that's not a total scam!

108
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,980
我感受到了緊張
I'm sensing tension.

109
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,580
瞧見沒  她很厲害
See? She's good.

110
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,110
好吧
Okay. Yeah, okay.

111
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,400
擁有看出面部表情基本技能的陌生人
Absolute stranger with rudimentary skills at reading facial cues,

112
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,310
跟我說說我的"未來"
tell me my "future."

113
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,160
我感應到了
Ooh, I'm getting something.

114
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,320
我感受到了你倆的生活
I sense that both of your lives

115
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,860
都要動搖了
are about to be shaken up.

116
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,660
天啊
Oh, my god.

117
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,190
太含糊了吧
That's super vague.

118
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,580
還有更多
There's more.

119
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,680
你們將會遭遇地震
There's going to be a seismic shift in your world.

120
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,470
天啊
Oh, my god.

121
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,450
你說的內容完全一樣
You just said the same thing...

122
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,940
只不過這次是輕聲說的
but you whispered it.

123
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,500
震動會傳播...
The tremors are gonna ripple through--

124
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,390
現在你只是在用不同的詞匯
Now you're just using different words.

125
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,100
地震  賤人
Earthquake, bitch!

126
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,640
會有地震
There's going to be an earthquake!

127
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,850
瞧瞧你做的事
See? See what you did.

128
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,960
你讓她生氣了  現在會有一場地震了
You made her mad and now there's going to be an earthquake.

129
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,520
加比  拜托  誰都能預測地震
Gabi, come on. Anyone can predict an earthquake.

130
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,040
這可是舊金山
This is San Francisco.

131
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,890
但她沒說到底是什么時候
But she didn't say exactly when it was gonna happen.

132
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,110
你下次尿尿的時候就會地震
It's gonna happen the next time you pee.

133
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,520
我嗎
Me?

134
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,820
索菲亞  你能不能把蛋糕樣品
Sofia, could you take the cake samples

135
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,990
端過去  我動不了
over to the table, please? I can't move.

136
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,890
加比  這樣不健康  去尿尿好嗎
Gabi, this is not healthy. Would you just pee already?

137
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,960
舊金山的命運
The fate of San Francisco

138
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,770
取決于我的膀胱
rests on my bladder.

139
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,590
你太可笑了
You are being ridiculous.

140
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,600
我可不覺得這種情況好笑
Oh, I don't think anything about this situation is ridiculous.

141
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,870
天啊
Oh, my god.

142
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,280
我們的婚禮蛋糕必須是這個黑巧克力甘那許蛋糕
Our wedding cake has to be this dark chocolate ganache.

143
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,760
這是我的一號選擇
It's my number one choice.

144
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,740
請不要說"一號"
Please don't say "Number one."

145
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,310
但我喜歡花生醬的
But I like the peanut butter.

146
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,010
請不要說"嘩"
Please don't say pee.

147
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,520
好  夠了
Okay, that's enough.

148
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,820
過來  我得告訴你一件事
Come over here. I gotta tell you something.

149
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,530
不不不
No, no, no, no, no.

150
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,720
索菲亞  干嘛  我在試吃蛋糕
Sofia, what, okay? I'm doing cake tasting--

151
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,110
棒
Yes!

152
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,290
不
Oh, no!

153
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,740
大家快找掩護
Take cover, everybody!

154
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,810
天啊  她到底有多迫切
Damn, how bad does she have to go?

155
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,390
索菲亞  怎么回事
Sofia, what's going on?

156
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,830
加比覺得如果她尿尿  就會發生...
Gabi thinks that if she pees there's going to be an--

157
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,910
地震了
Earthquake!

158
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,510
你們感受到了嗎  大家都還好嗎
Did you guys feel that? Is everybody okay?

159
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,690
摔壞[破戒]什么了嗎
Did anything break?

160
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,810
有  我的減肥大計
Yeah. My diet.

161
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,400
非常感謝你讓我們插隊
Thank you so much for squeezing us in.

162
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,000
是的  抱歉之前的質疑  你擁有大智慧
Yes, I am so sorry that I ever doubted you. Ye have much wisdom.

163
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,320
能告訴我們將會發生的一切嗎
Can you tell us everything that's going to happen?

164
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,990
對  千萬別漏了什么細節  好嗎
Yeah. Don't leave anything out, okay?

165
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,430
首先  尿尿沒什么影響了吧
And first off, is it safe to pee again?

166
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,660
這是什么意思
What does that mean?

167
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,590
我的微波爆米花好了
My microwave popcorn is done.

168
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,750
我看到了
Yes!

169
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,810
你會得到一大筆錢...
You're going to be offered a big bundle of money...

170
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,930
這錢會給你
...which will lead to you

171
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,850
帶來個藍布包裹的大胖小子
having a big chubby bundle of joy wrapped in blue.

172
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,640
一大筆錢...你就要找到工作了
A bundle of money-- you're going to get a job!

173
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,520
是啊  并且新同事會讓我懷孕
Yeah. And some guy at my new job is going to knock me up.

174
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,570
等等  什么
Wait. What?

175
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,570
出于本能  你會對這件事說不  但別這么做
Your instinct will be to say no to this offer, but don't.

176
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,850
她不會的  現在說說我吧
Oh, she won't. Now me.

177
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,620
我看到有人會要你伸出手
I see that someone is going to ask for your hand.

178
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,480
我的手  就像求婚那樣嗎
My hand? Like in marriage?

179
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,630
這不清楚
It's unclear.

180
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,170
但這段感情會"性感的冒煙"
But something about this relationship is gonna be smoking hot.

181
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,220
那人是誰  告訴我
Who is it? Tell me!

182
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,830
能透露一點給我嗎
Can you tell me anything? Something?

183
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,080
他的名字是字母J開頭的
Well, his name starts with the letter "J."

184
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,900
J嗎
"J"?

185
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,730
誰的名字是字母J開頭的
Whose name starts with the letter "J"?

186
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,110
J...  J...
"J"..."J"...

187
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,620
第二個字母是不是O
Is the second letter "O"?

188
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,650
是不是O
Is the second letter "O"?

189
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,660
賤人  不能問元音字母
Bitch, you can't buy a vowel.

190
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,690
這又不是《幸運之輪》
This isn't Wheel of Fortune.

191
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,690
{\an8}電視猜字游戲節目

192
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,740
你以為我是誰  凡娜·懷特[節目主持人]嗎
Who do I look like, Vanna White?

193
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,020
喬什  你沒事吧
Josh, you okay?

194
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,700
上次我見到一個男人如此費勁地呼吸時...
Last time I saw a man struggling that hard to breathe...

195
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,400
我們只好互換體位
we had to switch positions.

196
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,320
我沒事
I'm okay.

197
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,100
我只是...剛剛爬了27層樓梯  我沒事
I just...walked up 27 flights of stairs. I'm okay.

198
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,210
可是地震后他們已經修好電梯了
But they fixed the elevator after the earthquake.

199
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,870
你沒聽說過余震嗎
You ever heard of aftershocks?

200
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,460
我小時候  發生過一次地震
When I was a kid, there was an earthquake,

201
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,530
我獨自一人在電梯里被困了兩個小時
I was trapped alone in this elevator for two hours.

202
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,900
到現在  我聽到輕爵士的時候還會抖
To this day I shudder whenever I hear light jazz.

203
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,460
我也是
Yeah. Me, too.

204
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,260
白人毀一切
White people ruin everything.

205
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,260
{\an8}爵士樂為黑人首創

206
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,980
該死  我忘拿手機了
Oh, damn it. I left my phone down there.

207
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,240
尤蘭達  你介意...
Hey, Yolanda, would you mind--

208
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,870
突發新聞
Newsflash!

209
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,940
喬什  黑人女性打開有錢白人的車
Josh, a black woman going to a rich white man's car,

210
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,070
拿走他的手機...
taking his phone...

211
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,100
不會有好下場的
never ends well.

212
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,550
現在我希望你  走出房門
Now, what I want you to do, is I want you to go out there,

213
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,750
步入電梯  讓它知道誰厲害
get in that elevator and show it who's boss.

214
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,900
你說得對  是我太神經質
You're right. I'm being crazy.

215
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,610
-沒錯  -喬什·卡明斯基
- Hell, yeah, you are! - Josh Kaminski!

216
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,780
-戰勝它  卡明斯基  -我什么都不怕
- Kick ass, Kaminski! - I'm not scared of stuff!

217
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,540
沒錯  你不怕
Damn straight, you're not.

218
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,240
我想坐就能坐
I can take it if I feel like it.

219
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,210
但我不想坐
But I don't feel like it.

220
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,580
真不敢相信喬什會向我求婚
I can't believe Josh is going to propose to me.

221
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,620
他怎么想的
What is he thinking?

222
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,440
我們連戀愛都沒談成...
I mean, we couldn't make dating work...

223
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,230
怎么就會結得成婚呢
How are we supposed to make marriage work?

224
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,220
他瘋了吧
He is out of his mind.

225
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,300
至少你會得到一枚戒指...
At least you're getting a ring...

226
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,850
我將成為你未婚先孕的好朋友
I'm going to be the unmarried pregnant best friend.

227
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,700
我一直以為那會是你
I always thought that would be you.

228
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,150
我在這個男人手下工作
I mean, I work for the man.

229
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,080
他會讓我處于一個非常尷尬的境地
He's putting me in a very awkward position.

230
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,570
你想聊聊尷尬處境嗎
Oh, you want to talk about awkward position?

231
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,000
試想一下妊娠末期了
Try being in your third trimester

232
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,700
還在"愿者上鉤"上面尋找另一半
and looking for a date on Tinder.

233
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,460
好吧  我們得互相支持  好嗎
Okay. Well, we just have to stick together, okay?

234
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,290
你陪著我  別讓喬什向我求婚
You stay by my side and don't let Josh propose to me.

235
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,620
好  同時你陪著我
Okay. And you stay by my side

236
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,520
別讓任何人搞大索小姐的肚子
and don't let anyone put a baby in Lil' So-so.

237
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,070
兩位  你們在干嗎
Hey, guys, what you doing?

238
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,670
加比  我知道這事對你非常陌生...
Gabi, I know this is unfamiliar to you...

239
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,290
但我們管這叫閱讀
But it's called reading.

240
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,180
這是生育診所里的小冊子
It's a pamphlet on fertility.

241
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,710
經歷了這場可怕的地震之后...
After that dreadful earthquake...

242
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,220
我們意識到生命短暫
We realized life is short.

243
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,520
所以我們聊起了人生  并且...
So we started talking about life, and we--

244
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,580
決定要個孩子
Decided to have a baby!

245
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,440
你想告訴她們嗎  說吧
Oh, you wanted to tell them? Go ahead.

246
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,120
我們決定生個孩子  算了
We decided to have a baby. Whatever--

247
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,660
-恭喜  -太棒了
- Congratulations! - Oh, guys, that's amazing!

248
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,170
因此我們很高興見到你倆
That's why we're so glad to see you.

249
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,180
用匿名捐贈者的卵子太不近人情了
Using an anonymous egg donor is so impersonal.

250
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,780
所以我們想在認識的人里找
So we'd rather ask someone we know.

251
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,430
你愿意當我們的卵子捐贈人嗎  索菲亞
Would you consider being our egg donor, Sofia?

252
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,980
你想問她嗎  問吧
Oh, do you want to ask her? Go ahead.

253
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,800
你愿意當...  算了
Would you consider being-- ah, forget it.

254
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,520
天吶
Oh, my God!

255
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,210
等等  你們想用她的卵子嗎
Wait, you want one of her eggs?

256
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,670
不是針對你  小加加
Oh, it's nothing personal, Gabalah.

257
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,380
我們只是不想養個熊孩子
We just don't want to raise a demon spawn.

258
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,180
我們會給你兩萬塊補償
We'd give you $20,000 for your egg

259
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,040
感謝你給我們的大胖小子
and you'd help us get a little bundle of joy.

260
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,490
-天啊  大胖小子  -老天
- Oh, my god, a bundle of joy! - Oh, my god!

261
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,440
還有一大筆錢
A bundle of money!

262
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,210
是真的
It's happening.

263
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,350
-你不用著急答應  -好的
- You don't have to say yes right now-- - Yes.

264
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,790
我就知道價開高了
I knew it. We started too high.

265
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,420
我說了八千她也會同意吧
I told you she would've taken eight.

266
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,570
那你明天能跟我們
So you'll go with us tomorrow

267
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,710
一起去看產科醫生  檢測一下嗎
to a fertility doctor to see if you're a candidate?

268
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,910
靈媒讓我要說"好"  所以沒問題
Well, a psychic told me to say "Yes," so yes!

269
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,810
靈媒啊  我以為你說她聰明呢
A psychic! I thought you said she was smart.

270
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,000
等等  你的預言成真了
Wait, your prediction came true.

271
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,310
這是說明喬什就要...
Does that mean that Josh is about to--

272
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,750
加比
Gabi--

273
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,180
加比  你能...
Gabi, will you--

274
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,320
不不不  我還太年輕
No, no, no, no! I'm too young.

275
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,420
幫我做杯沙冰嗎
Please make me a smoothie.

276
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,560
幫我做杯沙冰
Please make me a smoothie!

277
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,290
我知道這可能有點嚇人  索菲亞
I know this might seem a little scary, Sofia...

278
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,610
但艾略特和我會一直陪著你的
but Elliot and I are here for you every step of the way.

279
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,730
有任何需要  就告訴我們
Anything you need, you let us know.

280
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,830
謝謝你們
Thanks, guys.

281
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,910
想想我們自己的大胖...
Just think, our own little bundle of--

282
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,980
糟糕
Crap!

283
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,640
看看這些海報
Look at all these posters.

284
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,290
不敢看
Oh, I can't!

285
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,180
多虧我已經彎了
If I wasn't gay already...

286
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,820
我真不知道該拿這東西怎么辦
I wouldn't know the first thing to do with this.

287
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,700
是啊  直男也不知道
Yeah, neither do straight guys.

288
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,310
這里怎么會有電動牙刷
Why is there a sonicare in here?

289
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,870
那不是牙刷  是超聲波探測棒
That's not a toothbrush. That's an ultrasound wand.

290
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,480
醫生用它伸進...
Yeah, the doctors use it to look inside your--

291
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,100
丁丁  丁丁  丁丁
Penis! Penis! Penis! Penis!

292
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,040
這里還真全是那個道哈
It's all vagina all the time in here.

293
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,640
記得我們說要陪著你...
Remember that stuff we said about us being there--

294
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,020
-你們走吧  -我走了
- Yeah, just go. - I'm going to go.

295
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,550
開會愉快  喬什
Have a good meeting, Josh.

296
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,670
好  再見
Okay. See you.

297
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,060
-好的  -再見
- All right. - Bye!

298
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,150
想走樓梯嗎
Trying to take the stairs?

299
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,510
樓梯門為什么鎖了  著火怎么辦
Why are these stair doors locked? It's a fire hazard.

300
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,730
因為我們正在幫你克服恐懼
Because we are conquering your fear right here and right now.

301
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,800
不
No!

302
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,090
這主意不好
That is a bad idea.

303
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,640
我不聽你的
I don't wanna.

304
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,510
喬什  別擔心  我上網查過了
Come on, Josh. Don't worry. I did a little research online.

305
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,050
說如果你想克服恐懼
And they say if you want to conquer your fear,

306
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:08,900
只要邊干喜歡的事
all you have to do is

307
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,550
邊經歷恐懼環境就好
associate it with something that makes you happy.

308
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,980
比如開除你嗎
Like firing you?

309
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,880
或者...
Or...

310
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,220
吃甜甜圈
donuts!

311
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,160
你一跨進電梯
Start eating one of these

312
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,520
就開始吃甜甜圈  像這樣
as soon as you get on the elevator. Like this.

313
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,540
真好吃
Damn, that's good.

314
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,310
尤蘭達  電梯門還沒開呢
Yolanda, the elevator doors didn't even open.

315
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,530
是  但我嘴張開了
No. But my mouth did.

316
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:39,910
喬什
Josh!

317
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,290
進電梯去
Get in that elevator!

318
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,440
再見
Bye!

319
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,180
好吧  我能做到的
Okay. I can do this.

320
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,870
好吧  喬什
Yeah, okay, Josh.

321
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,930
說實話  我知道你要干什么
Honestly, I know what you're about to do

322
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,270
但我還沒準備好
and I am just not ready.

323
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,860
我能看出你也很緊張
I can see that you're really nervous, too.

324
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,610
很好很好  沒事的
It's going to be fine! It's going to be fine!

325
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,360
是啊  當然很好
Well, yeah, of course it's going to be fine.

326
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,320
你聰明又帥氣
I mean, you're smart and you're handsome--

327
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,050
不  別這樣  好嗎
No, no, no, no. Don't do this, okay?

328
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,340
別跪...
Don't do--

329
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,890
是大震  是大震
It's a big one! It's a big one!

330
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,270
-怎么回事  -地震了
- What's happening? - Earthquake!

331
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,580
天啊  喬什  我嫁給你
Oh, god, Josh. I will marry you!

332
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,860
艾略特  震完了  放開我吧
Elliot, it's over. You can let go now.

333
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,640
但你好強壯
But you're so strong...

334
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,940
像是猶太版的錢寧·塔圖姆
Like a Jewish Channing Tatum.

335
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,750
允許你再多抱五秒鐘
You just bought yourself five more seconds.

336
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,480
天啊
God!

337
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,060
有人嗎
Hello!

338
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,220
快來人救救我
Somebody! Somebody help!

339
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,600
索菲亞·瑪利亞·康斯薇拉·拉斐爾·羅德里格斯
Sofia Maria Consuela Rafaella Rodriguez?

340
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,970
是我  等等  誰在喊我
That's me! Wait, who is that?

341
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,630
是上帝嗎
Is that god?

342
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,880
差不多  我是沃克醫生
Close. It's Dr. Walker

343
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,130
在尿樣窗口這里
At the urine sample pass-through.

344
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,550
你還好嗎
Are you okay?

345
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,230
不好  我打不開門
No! I can't get the door open.

346
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,930
別擔心  我已經呼救了
Okay, don't worry. I already called for help.

347
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,450
會沒事的
Everything's going to be fine.

348
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,640
說得容易  你反正在外面
That's easy for you to say. You're out there.

349
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,970
沒錯  如果我被困在里面  會慌死的
That's true. If I was trapped in there I'd be freaking out.

350
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,310
你能一直跟我聊天嗎
Can you just keep talking to me?

351
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,140
我怕還會有余震
I'm scared there's going to be an aftershock.

352
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,130
好  你最喜歡什么味道的冰淇淋
Oh, okay. Um, what's your favorite ice cream?

353
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,410
巧克力蛋糕味  曲奇味  我還年輕不能死
Rocky road, cookie dough, too young to die.

354
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,990
最后那個不是味道  是我的感受
That last one's not a flavor, it's just how I feel.

355
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,510
天啊  我好害怕  你能說些別嗎
Oh, my god. I'm freaking out. Can you just say something else?

356
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,590
你眼睛很漂亮
You have the prettiest eyes

357
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,060
是我從尿樣窗口看過最美的
I've ever seen through a urine pass-through.

358
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,270
來的時候  我真沒想過
Well, my eyes are not what I thought

359
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,050
你們會看的是我眼睛
you'd be looking into when I got here.

360
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,410
我們被困了嗎
Are we stuck?

361
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,640
該怎么辦
What're we gonna do?

362
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,150
首先讓我把你放下來
Well, first I'm going to put you down.

363
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,290
好
'kay.

364
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,200
然后請解釋下你為什么說要嫁給我
Then you're going to explain why you said you'll marry me.

365
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,090
好
'kay.

366
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,480
這個嘛
So--

367
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,730
你也知道的
you know that thing

368
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,650
就是那種覺得有人要跟你求婚了
where you think somebody's going to propose to you...

369
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,560
但你還沒準備好  就說"不行"
but you're not ready, so you're like, "No way!"

370
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,690
然后你覺得自己要死了
and then you think you're going to die,

371
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,510
又說"我們結婚吧"的事情嘛
so you're like, "Let's do this!"

372
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:25,190
加比  你為什么會覺得
Gabi, what reason could you possibly have to think

373
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,780
我要向你求婚
I was going to propose to you?

374
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,260
-靈媒說的  -這就是了
- A psychic told me. - And there it is.

375
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,940
波萊特夫人說
Madame Paulette said,

376
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,420
有個名字是J開頭的男人
the guy whose name started with the letter "J"

377
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,680
會讓我伸出手
was going to ask for my hand

378
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,760
我們的關系會"性感的冒煙"
and that our relationship would be "smoking hot"!

379
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,890
這樣哈
Well, I mean...

380
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,840
那的確是像我
that does sound like me.

381
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,330
就算波萊特夫人算的這么準
All right, look. As reliable of a source as Madame Paulette is...

382
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,510
但我向你保證  加比
I can assure you, Gabi,

383
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,740
我現在最不會干的  就是跟你求婚
the last thing I'm going to do right now is propose to you.

384
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,290
說"最不會"有點傷人吧
Yeah. The "last thing" is a little harsh.

385
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,640
討厭的靈媒  她要是說了我們
Stupid psychic. It would've been nice if she was going to tell me

386
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,350
會被困在電梯里該多好
we're going to get stuck in an elevator.

387
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,640
根本不準
She sucks.

388
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,340
現在我們沒事了嗎
We're good now?

389
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,590
有事  我們還困在電梯里
No! We're stuck in an elevator!

390
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,570
放松  都會沒事的
Okay, relax. Everything's going to be fine.

391
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,300
深呼吸
Take a deep breath. Breathe.

392
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,540
你看
See!

393
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,160
氧氣還挺充足
Lot's of oxygen in here.

394
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,580
想活動的話  空間也很大
Plenty of space to move around if we want to.

395
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,710
或者原地不動
Or freeze exactly in place.

396
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,130
我得從這出去
I gotta get the hell outta here!

397
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,780
等等  你要干什么
What are you doing? Wait! What are you doing?

398
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,210
我要往上爬一層樓
I'm going to go climb up a floor

399
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,310
打開電梯門  找人來救你
and open the elevator doors, and get you help!

400
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,090
不  別這么做
No, no, no! Please don't go.

401
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:34,340
加比  我必須要在薩克斯獨奏前出去
Gabi, I have to get out of here before the sax solo kicks in.

402
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,350
我能告訴你件事嗎
Can I tell you something?

403
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,010
第一次地震以后  我在想
After the first earthquake, I was thinking

404
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,080
"人生苦短  趕快要個孩子吧"
"Life is short... why wait to have a kid?"

405
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,540
但現在我想
But now I'm thinking,

406
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,550
"人生苦短  何必浪費在孩子身上"
"Life is short... why spend it with a kid?"

407
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,240
真的嗎
Really?

408
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,660
因為我以為我快死的時候
Because when I thought I was going to die,

409
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,150
心里沒想孩子
I wasn't thinking about babies,

410
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,690
想的是你
I was thinking about you.

411
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,070
我們或許沒多少日子了
We may not have that much time left,

412
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,160
但我知道剩下的我只想和你一起過
but I know I want to spend it with only you.

413
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,520
當然不是在這婦科中心
And not here in vagina central.

414
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,690
我的小猶太餡餅
Aw, my little knish!

415
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,390
我的小酸甜餃子
Aw! My little sweet and sour dumpling.

416
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,560
我突然餓了
Ooh, all of a sudden I'm hungry.

417
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,630
我可以去吃點東西
I could go for a nosh.

418
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,680
索菲亞怎么辦
Oh, what about Sofia?

419
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,370
對啊  索菲亞
Oh, yeah! Sofia!

420
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,700
索菲亞  要我們給你帶點東西吃嗎
Sofia, you want anything from the deli?

421
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,450
我被困住了
I'm trapped in here!

422
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,040
那就是不要咯
We'll take that as a no.

423
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,430
我們會是好家長的
We would've made such good parents.

424
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,660
最好的
The best.

425
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,370
你愿意捐獻卵子幫助朋友  真是心善
It's nice of you to consider donating an egg to help your friends.

426
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,960
說不上是捐獻
Yeah, well, I'm not exactly donating.

427
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,450
這樣做也有些是為了錢
I'm kinda doing it for the money.

428
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,150
還有是因為靈媒讓我做的
And 'cause a psychic told me to.

429
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,280
靈媒說的  那當然要聽了
Oh, a psychic. Well, then for sure you should do this.

430
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,390
你也覺得嗎
You think?

431
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,070
不  神經病才聽
No! It's crazy!

432
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,810
是吧  一開始我覺得
Isn't it? I mean, at first I thought,

433
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,290
"這錢來得容易  疼都不疼"
"Cha-ching, easy money and it wouldn't even hurt,"

434
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,340
然后又想"我的卵子會去哪里"
And then it's like, "Where'd my egg go?

435
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,200
"什么卵子  誰在乎
"What egg? Who cares?

436
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,850
我這還多著呢  根本不會想它"
I have a million more. I won't even miss it."

437
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,780
但又想  如果十八年后有人來敲我門
But then, what if in 18 years I get a knock on the door

438
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,800
開門是個孩子
and it's some kid saying,

439
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,600
喊我媽媽  我又說
"Mama," And then I'm like,

440
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,220
"菲德里克·何塞·巴勃羅·安立奎·羅德里格斯
"Federico Jose Pablo Enrique Rodriguez...

441
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,850
你怎么會在這"
What are you doing here?"

442
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,840
我能給你些建議嗎
Can I give you some advice?

443
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,860
什么  來自專業人士的建議嗎
What? Advice from an actual professional?

444
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,270
我洗耳恭聽
That'll be a welcome change.

445
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,380
如果你還沒準備好  就別做
If you're not ready for this, don't do it.

446
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,690
遵從你的內心
Follow your gut.

447
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,280
內心告訴我不要做
My gut is telling me to say no...

448
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,730
但銀行賬戶對我說  "拿錢啊  傻瓜"
but my bank account is telling me, "take the money, fool."

449
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,250
我有個預言給你
Hey! I have a prediction for you.

450
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,380
什么
What?

451
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,750
一個年輕的單身醫生會約你出去吃冰淇淋
A single, young doctor is going to ask you out for ice cream...

452
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,530
如果你不覺得他莽撞  又沒乳糖不耐的話
if that's not too forward and you're not lactose intolerant?

453
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,680
我覺得我會高興地答應
Uh, I think I'd really like that.

454
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,140
天啊  天啊
My god! Oh, my god!

455
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,480
我得救了
I'm saved!

456
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,830
我們外面見
I'll see you on the other side.

457
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,450
不管發生什么  我都會找到你

459
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,640
索菲亞
Sofia?

460
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,710
是我  尿樣窗口那個人
It's me, from the urine pass-through.

461
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,100
-天啊  -怎么了
- Oh, my god. - What?

462
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,530
靈媒說得對
The psychic was right.

463
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,880
不是孩子
It's not a baby at all.

464
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,570
你才是藍布裹著的大胖小子
You're the chubby bundle of joy wrapped in blue.

465
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,950
還有人說過更難聽的
I've been called worse.

466
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,580
你要是改主意了  我理解
But I get it if you changed your mind.

467
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,680
如果你不想去吃冰淇淋了  沒關系
If you don't want to go out for ice cream. It's totally cool.

468
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,020
是啊  對不起
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry, I don't.

469
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,760
除非是吃完浪漫晚餐以后
Unless it's after a romantic dinner.

470
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,550
晚餐加冰淇淋嗎
Dinner and ice cream?

471
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,600
真是完美之夜  你不去我都愿意
That's the perfect night. I don't even need you to go!

472
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,440
加比
Gabi!

473
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,440
是這層嗎  我找到個消防員
Is this the right floor? I found a fireman.

474
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,240
是的  就是這層
Yes, yes, yes! This is the right floor.

475
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,320
謝天謝地  簡直過了一輩子
Thank god, it's been forever!

476
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,030
才八分鐘
It's been eight minutes.

477
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,200
-你還好嗎  -我沒事  快救我出去
- Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Just get me out of here.

478
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,360
把手給我
Give me your hand.

479
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,090
抱歉  你說什么
I'm sorry, what did you say?

480
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,460
手  把你的手給我
Your hand. Give me your hand.

481
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,100
你想讓我伸出手嗎
You're asking me for my hand?

482
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,640
是的  我好拉你出來
Yeah, so I can pull you out of there.

483
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,600
你叫什么
What's your name?

484
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,750
-雷諾茲副隊  -名字  不是姓

485
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,340
-杰森  -杰森嗎
- Jason. - Jason!

486
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,420
J開頭的嗎
With a "J"?

487
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,600
女士  你在里面撞到頭了嗎
Ma'am, did you hit your head in there?

488
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,290
沒有  我沒事  靈媒說得好對
No, no! I'm fine. Oh, my god, the psychic was right!

489
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,340
一個J開頭的人真的要我伸手
A "J" did ask for my hand.

490
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,500
而且還"性感的冒煙"
And she was right about smoking hot!

491
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,550
謝謝
Thank you.

492
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,480
我重點在"冒煙"  不過你好  我叫加比
Well, I meant 'cause you're a fireman, but hi, I'm Gabi.

493
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,480
我還要去別的樓層搜救
Well, I have to see about the people in the other floors...

494
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,810
不過你要愿意  我等下再來看你
but I can check on you later if you want.

495
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,840
好  我愿意
Yeah, I want.

496
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,450
我在頂樓上班  有時間來玩
I work in the penthouse. Swing by anytime.

497
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,270
好  等會見
All right. Well, I'll see you guys later.

498
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,510
都等不及了
Looking forward to it.

499
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,230
他好勇敢
He is so brave.

500
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,640
我從電梯里擠出來
I shimmied out of the elevator...

501
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,900
沿著鋼纜爬上去
climbed up the cable...

502
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,890
徒手撬開樓上的電梯門
pried the doors open above us with my bare hands...

503
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,430
找到人來救你  是啊
and I found you help, but yeah...

504
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,820
他才了不起
he's superman.

505
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,990
我們不住這層
And this is not our floor.

506
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,290
波萊特夫人
Madame Paulette...

507
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,040
我一般都去找自由大街的斯嘉麗算命
I usually talk to my girl Scarlet over on Liberty Street...

508
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,820
但我兩個朋友來你這以后都找到了對象
but both my friends said they met guys after seeing you.

509
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,600
希望我也能這么幸運
So I'm hoping you got the touch.

510
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,300
抱歉  我沒感應到什么
I'm sorry, I'm not picking up any vibrations.

511
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,130
或許你把
Well, maybe you would

512
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,350
那小叉子放下以后就能...
if you put down that super tiny fork with the--

513
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,480
這是什么面包
Ooh, what kind of bread is that?

514
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,250
我這不是自助餐  賤人
This ain't no buffet, bitch.

515
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,380
那就給我算命  賤人
Well, then tell me my fortune, bitch.

516
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,750
現在我有感覺了
See, now I'm getting something.

517
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,090
你已經遇到了
You have already met the man

518
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,050
會跟你共度一生的男人
you're going to spend your life with.

519
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,920
是嗎  他長什么樣
Ooh, I have? What does he look like?

520
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,640
是個外國人
He's the exotic type.

521
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,810
我喜歡外國人
Ooh! I love exotic!

522
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,330
我看見他穿西裝打領帶
I see him in a suit and tie.

523
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,870
真帥
Oh, he fancy!

524
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,950
再詳細點
Tell me more.

525
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,460
他戴領結
He wears a bow tie...

526
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,480
名字開頭是字母E
and his name starts with an "E."

527
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,200
沒門
Oh, hell no!

70
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,020
Thanks for giving me a ride, Yolanda.

71
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,890
I promise, as soon as Sofia gets a job,

72
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,380
I will have my car back.

73
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,630
Oh, that's okay.

74
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,000
It lets me drive in the carpool lane

75
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,740
without having to use my Burt Reynolds blowup doll.

76
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,740
Well...

77
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,190
It's the moment you've all been waiting for.

78
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,620
Wait a minute.

79
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,930
You went to a fancy charity function last night.

80
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,710
I smell rich people things.

81
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,900
Ooh, is it a swag bag?

82
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,070
Please tell me it's a swag bag.

83
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,640
Maybe.

84
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,000
Wait, I don't get it. What's going on?

85
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,060
Every time I go to a big event

86
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,770
I get this gift bag full of really cool stuff

87
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,760
and I let Elliot and Yolanda divvy it up.

88
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,630
But now Gabi's here, so you gotta split it three ways.

89
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,250
- Oh, man. - Son of a bitch.

90
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,560
All right, let's keep it civilized.

91
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,940
And remember, it doesn't start until I leave the room.

92
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:03,600
Oh, my goodness!

93
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,190
What is it? What is it?

94
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,730
Ooh, Dolce & Gabbana sunglasses.

95
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,400
A smartwatch!

96
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,270
A video camera?

97
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,770
A 10-pack for soul spin classes!

98
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,620
Why would you go to a spin class?

99
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,070
You get winded walking down the buffet line.

100
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,740
Mr. Jake Gyllenhaal is in San Francisco filming a movie.

101
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,910
This is the place he goes to spin when he's in town.

102
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,040
Thank goodness we got a video camera!

103
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,710
Look, a $100 gift certificate to the Royal Hotel and Spa.

104
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,190
- Oh no, you score. - That is the best.

105
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,070
Whoa, 10 of them.

106
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,190
- Mine. - Mine. Mine.

107
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,400
- Mine. Mine. Mine. - Mine. Mine.

108
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,400
Mine. Mine.

109
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,640
- Mine. Mine. Mine... - Mine. Mine. Mine...

110
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,090
Hey, so how'd this job search go today?

111
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,350
Oh, great.

112
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,660
You know, that's why I'm celebrating

113
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,230
with a big bag of marshmallows.

114
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,980
Hey, what's with all the little pins

115
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,150
on this pretty map you made?

116
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,350
Oh, that's just to keep track

117
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,790
of all the places I've applied...

118
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,970
That's fantastic.

119
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,530
...and got rejections from.

120
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,520
Remember, Sofia, it only takes one employer to say yes.

121
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,200
Well, one employer did say yes.

122
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,210
- Yay! - It was my dad.

123
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,500
Yeah, he thinks I should move back home to Florida,

124
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,520
and work for him.

125
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,110
Aww, Sofia, you can't go home.

126
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,880
Gabi, I've been unemployed for three months.

127
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,950
I'm at the end of my rope.

128
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,940
I can't even afford any more rejection pins.

129
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,870
Okay, okay, enough, all right?

130
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,200
Let's put the sad map away.

131
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,800
You need to get out of this apartment and have some fun.

132
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,770
I'm not in the mood for fun.

133
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,190
Well, what if I told you

134
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,300
that I have $1,000 worth of gift certificates

135
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,270
to the Royal Hotel and Spa.

136
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,870
- Thinking mani-pedis. - Mani-pedis?

137
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,560
- Blow outs. - Blow outs?

138
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,710
Maybe a massage.

139
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,590
- A massage? - Yeah.

140
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,260
A total makeover ending with fancy drinks at the bar.

141
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,300
Fancy drinks? Yay!

142
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,370
That'll totally be my first drink of the day.

143
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,440
Let's go!

144
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,360
See. I told you this would cheer you up.

145
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,420
Gabi, you were so right.

146
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,810
I mean, I have no money, no job,

147
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,570
and I'll probably still have to move home to Florida,

148
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,880
But I love my new smoky eyes.

149
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,950
And I love your new attitude.

150
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,260
What are you talking about?

151
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,490
I'm just saying, you know,

152
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,120
these past few months of you trying to get a job

153
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,800
has made you kinda negative.

154
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,170
Well, what can I tell you? Everything in my life sucks.

155
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,250
I'm just saying I think you need to start shaking things up.

156
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,880
Think outside the box. Start saying yes to life

157
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,360
and new things...

158
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,640
Like that guy over there.

159
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,820
You know he's been staring at you since you sat down.

160
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,830
Oh, my god.

161
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,520
Okay. Now's your chance.

162
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,950
Do something Sofia would never do.

163
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,090
Be bold. Be crazy. Go talk to him.

164
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,970
You know what? I'm just gonna wait for him to come to me.

165
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,160
Oh, like you're waiting for all those employers

166
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,190
to come and talk to you?

167
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,580
See, this is what I mean.

168
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,250
You need to take action and get some action.

169
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,640
You know what? You're right.

170
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,620
Like, what do I have to lose?

171
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,390
- Nothing. 'Cause you got nothing. - Yeah.

172
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,240
Can I get you another round?

173
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,100
Uh, yeah, I'll have another vodka cran on ice.

174
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,920
This coupon is only good for food.

175
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,180
Okay, just the ice then.

176
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,680
My god, Gabi, it worked!

177
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,530
He asked me to dinner, and I said... yes.

178
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,470
That's great! This calls for a celebration.

179
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,940
Ice for everyone!

180
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,300
Okay, according to Jake Gyllenhaal's publicist,

181
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,530
this is the spin class he goes to.

182
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,470
When you see him, be cool.

183
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,510
Don't do anything to embarrass me.

184
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,700
It's him! Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

185
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,500
How can you tell? It's so damn dark in here.

186
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,330
Oh, wait.

187
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,260
I had on my new Dolce & Gabbana sunglasses.

188
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,680
I need my picture taken working out with him

189
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,780
so I can brag to my friends and elevate my status.

190
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,340
This is what everybody's talking about?

191
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,930
A bunch of stationary bikes?

192
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,640
Guys, I rode a bike to get here.

193
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,230
This is lame. I'm out.

194
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,130
- Who's ready for a spin? - Me.

195
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,760
I am ready for a spin. I'm Josh.

196
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,710
Do you spin here often?

197
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,070
Every day. It's my job.

198
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,100
All right.

199
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,130
Wait. You two.

200
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,670
You've never been to a spin class, have you?

201
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,290
How can you tell?

202
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,760
Because I have eyes.

203
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,850
Spin virgins go to the back row.

204
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,870
I'm being made fun of for being a virgin?

205
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,810
It's like high school all over again.

206
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,500
Hey, great.

207
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,520
Now how are we gonna get our photo taken with Jake?

208
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,690
You ever heard of a selfie stick, bitch?

209
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,610
Look who's finally home.

210
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,990
I took your advice,

211
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:54,640
and I said yes to life, to dinner, and to, um... dessert.

212
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,210
Was it like ice cream dessert, or you scream dessert?

213
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,230
Oh my god, you know, I've never done that before.

214
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,470
I mean, I've done that before,

215
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,430
but never like that, you know?

216
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,840
I'm a nice girl

217
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,500
who did a bad girl thing.

218
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,770
I'm so proud of you.

219
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,210
You were so right!

220
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,830
Letting go is fun.

221
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,220
I said yes to life,

222
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,190
and found a funny, charming, and uh,

223
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,900
very romantic guy.

224
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,470
Aww, he left me a note.

225
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,110
Did I tell you he was romantic?

226
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,750
Open it, open it! What's it say?

227
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,710
It's $500.

228
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,600
Well, why would he give you 500--

229
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,230
Oh my god, you don't think he thinks I'm--

230
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,150
No, I don't think he thinks you're--

231
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,090
What did you think that he thought?

232
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,570
- That I'm a hooker? - Yeah, that's what I thought.

233
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,660
Oh, my god!

234
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,370
No, it's okay, it's okay! It's all right, hey.

235
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,320
Look on the bright side...

236
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,650
At least you finally got a job.

237
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,790
Oh my god, I'm a hooker.

238
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,460
No!

239
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,700
You're not a hooker, he just thought you were.

240
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,480
- This is your fault, Gabi. - My fault?

241
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,190
Yes! "Say yes to life, Sofia."

242
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,560
Well, I said yes to life,

243
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,280
and now I'm just a ho with $78 in her bank account.

244
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,550
Technically, $578.

245
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,560
Shut up, shut up! I'm not gonna keep that money.

246
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,500
That's dirty! That's dirty, dirty money.

247
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,390
Come on, I think this is gonna be a really funny story

248
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,970
to tell your kids one day. No, this is it. This is it, Gabi!

249
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,390
This is the universe telling me to move back home to Florida.

250
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,980
I'm just-- I'm totally broke, and totally broken.

251
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,530
Aww, you're gonna be fine, we'll figure something out.

252
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,610
You know, when things were tough, I used to tell myself,

253
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,790
"Well, at least you're not a hooker."

254
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,510
Now I can't even say that.

255
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,470
Well, you can, it just won't be true.

256
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,040
Let me get this straight,

257
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,710
you were standing right next to Sofia,

258
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,380
and someone thought she was the prostitute?

259
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,430
Elliot, this is serious, okay? Sofia's really devastated.

260
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,420
Well, at least she can lift her legs.

261
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,480
And get paid for it.

262
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,240
What possessed you two to think

263
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,420
you could get through an entire class of soul spin?

264
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,250
Did you at least get a picture of Jake Gyllenhaal?

265
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,330
Sort of. All I got was one of his foot.

266
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,810
He's got some big feet.

267
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,730
That's my foot, fool!

268
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,960
Guess who's got a date with that hot spin instructor?

269
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,080
This guy!

270
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,600
Wait, how did you take the same class we did

271
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,080
and you're still walking?

272
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,310
Well, I exercise every day and I eat right.

273
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,920
Well, that's where we differ.

274
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,560
Um, Josh, can I talk to you about something?

275
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,180
Everybody wants a piece of me today, huh?

276
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,210
Popular guy.

277
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,430
Talk to me.

278
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,510
Okay, this is kind of serious.

279
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,680
Can I get sweet Josh or not-cocky Josh?

280
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,570
You got it. What's wrong, babe?

281
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,830
That was kind of a halfsie.

282
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,560
What's going on?

283
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,460
Sofia's thinking of moving home to Florida

284
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,800
because she slept with a guy last night

285
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,560
who thought she was a hooker.

286
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,560
Did not see that one coming.

287
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,190
I have to do something, something that's gonna turn this around.

288
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,240
And I don't know what that something is. Do you?

289
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,190
Okay, look, it's Sofia we're talking about here.

290
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,010
There's obviously some kind of mistake.

291
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,310
Well, he slipped an envelope with $500 in her purse

292
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,760
after they had sex.

293
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,040
Maybe it was meant for someone else?

294
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,340
Was her name on the envelope?

295
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,520
No.

296
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,710
Was there a note?

297
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,600
No.

298
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,140
So, the money could have been for anybody.

299
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,530
He could have left it for housekeeping.

300
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,350
Or maybe his assistant, or his bookie.

301
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,910
My God, you're right!

302
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,110
Sofia's not a hooker, she's just a thief.

303
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,300
Hi. Do you remember me from last night?

304
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,090
I was with my friend-- short dress,

305
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,930
stilettos, smoky eyes?

306
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,230
Oh, the hooker.

307
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,660
She's not! Why would you think that?

308
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,790
Short dress, stilettos, smoky eyes.

309
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,440
Okay, she's not a hooker. She's lovely.

310
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,360
- She's super sweet-- - Let me guess.

311
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,890
- Heart of gold? - No!

312
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,460
I mean, yes.

313
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,780
But, the point is

314
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,680
that after last night's misunderstanding

315
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,260
she's so upset that she's considering moving home to Florida

316
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,470
to work at her father's grocery store.

317
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,160
Ooh, checkout girl.

318
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,510
That's one of my fantasies.

319
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,760
Stop it.

320
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,190
She's my best friend, and I'm not letting her move home.

321
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,590
So, here's what we're gonna do, okay?

322
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,770
You're gonna record a message to her,

323
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,820
saying that the envelope that she found in her purse

324
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,460
must have fallen off the night stand

325
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,090
because it was meant for housekeeping.

326
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,340
Okay, ready, go!

327
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,180
I'm sorry your friend's upset,

328
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,560
but I'm not recording anything.

329
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,060
How do I know you're not a cop?

330
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,730
What is that? Like another one of your sick fantasies?

331
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,200
I'm a chef.

332
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,010
Even though that's kind of hot, too.

333
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,720
I am the personal chef to Mr. Josh Kaminski.

334
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,430
Josh Kaminski? The software developer?

335
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,410
Yeah, I think that's what he does.

336
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,650
I am the regional director for Star Bright Cruises.

337
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,400
I'm hosting the captain's dinner Thursday night,

338
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,970
and my caterer just dropped out.

339
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,180
You by any chance available?

340
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,230
Seriously? No, I would never work for you.

341
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,110
Never ever.

342
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,340
The gig pays five grand.

343
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,310
How does Asian fusion sound?

344
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,400
I still can't believe

345
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,390
that that was your first time in spin class.

346
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,870
You're quite an athlete.

347
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,580
Well, you know, I've never referred to myself as an athlete,

348
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,820
but, now that you mention it, it's pretty accurate.

349
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,190
I guess I have a type.

350
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,860
The last four guys I dated were all basketball players.

351
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,800
The old b-ball.

352
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,320
You know, I've been known to

353
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,360
get into a little two-on-two on the weekends.

354
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,060
No, I meant professional.

355
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,150
I've dated a Warrior, a Rocket,

356
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,510
a Timberwolf, and a Raptor.

357
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,260
Oh, so I'm the first tech guy you've ever dated?

358
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,310
Yeah.

359
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,460
It's gonna be different going out with a guy who's not so huge.

360
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,080
Guess what?

361
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,190
I have a huge surprise.

362
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,350
- What? - I got a catering gig!

363
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,750
You got another job?

364
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,190
You have two jobs, I can't even get one!

365
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,510
No, no, no I only took the job

366
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,380
because it pays five grand.

367
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,910
Five grand?

368
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,950
I'd have to sleep with that guy 10 times to make that.

369
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,040
Okay, okay, just calm down, all right?

370
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,410
I only took the gig

371
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,140
so that I can cover your expenses until you find a job.

372
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,240
Yay!

373
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,410
Gabi, that's very sweet, but I can't let you do that.

374
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,260
Well, you don't let me do a lot of things, but I still do them.

375
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,120
Gabi, it's not about the money, or rent,

376
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,380
or the fact that someone tried to pay me for sex.

377
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,520
I just-- I feel lost here, you know?

378
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,020
I don't have anything going on.

379
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,970
Well, I'll be lost without you,

380
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,090
you can't leave me. Please don't go.

381
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,240
Gabi, I can't afford to stay.

382
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,690
Okay, remember when I told you to take action?

383
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,290
Well, it's my turn.

384
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,790
You're not leaving!

385
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,050
I took this job so I can cover your expenses

386
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:15,970
for the next few months!

387
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,580
And I love you, and I will not take no for an answer!

388
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,150
Well, that's the sweetest thing that's ever been yelled at me.

389
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,580
So, you'll stay?

390
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,020
Well, on one condition.

391
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,160
I'm gonna help you with this catering gig.

392
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,350
No...

393
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,160
- No, no, I-- - That's not necessary.

394
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,640
Gabi, I insist.

395
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,330
I will not be a kept woman.

396
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,250
Been there, done that.

397
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,790
Okay, I'm gonna help you with this job.

398
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,020
I'll be your sous chef, your busser, your server,

399
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,400
I will not leave your side.

400
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,350
Plus, you know, it'll help me take my mind off the guy

401
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,680
who thought I was a hooker.

402
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,000
Will it?

403
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,210
Quick question.

404
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,100
If you were used to this big bottle of olive oil,

405
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,080
someone gave you this smaller bottle of olive oil,

406
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,540
would you point at it and laugh?

407
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,710
What?

408
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,840
It's just, would you be disappointed

409
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,120
in this smaller bottle of olive oil

410
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,540
even though the smaller bottle of olive oil

411
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,040
never had a complaint?

412
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,580
What's with the sudden interest in olive oil?

413
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,950
Yolanda, wake up

414
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,040
and smell the penis metaphor.

415
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,770
It's just, I'm going out with Kayla,

416
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,450
and she's only ever been with... big olive oils.

417
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,670
Josh, that myth about olive oils isn't true.

418
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,770
The last four guys she dated

419
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,450
were professional basketball players all over 6'7".

420
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,890
Oh yeah, you in trouble.

421
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,990
Josh, my problem just got bigger.

422
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,420
Well, that makes one of us!

423
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,530
Hey, guys, can I get your advice on something?

424
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,660
Damn you, soul spin and my inability to get away from Gabi.

425
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,200
Hey, are you guys still sore from that one soul spin class?

426
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,870
I've never been in such pain.

427
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,760
I can't even lift my arms.

428
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,700
Wait a minute.

429
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,800
So, if you were a cater waiter assisting me,

430
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,680
Could you hold this tray?

431
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,420
No.

432
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,480
Gabi, this was such a great idea!

433
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,590
I've been so stressed out about everything.

434
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,040
Yeah. Did you stretch?

435
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,160
- No. - Okay, great.

436
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,940
Hold my phone, I'm gonna get some towels.

437
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,950
Uh, Gabi,

438
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,200
Why are you getting a call

439
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,840
from "John who thought Sofia was a hooker"?

440
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,020
Ma-huh?

441
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,480
- Gabi, start talking. - Okay.

442
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,300
I went to the hotel bar

443
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,310
because I knew that you were upset

444
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,120
that John called you a hooker.

445
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,150
So, I confronted him, thinking maybe he made a mistake

446
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,560
and the money was actually for the housekeeper,

447
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,140
but I was wrong,

448
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,100
he did think you were a hooker.

449
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,810
So, I demanded he apologize,

450
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:21,740
but then he thought I was a cop,

451
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,760
so I had to tell him I was a chef,

452
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,360
then he offered me a $5,000 catering job,

453
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,910
which you insisted on helping me with!

454
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:27,740
And so now we're here

455
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,930
because I thought maybe if you came here,

456
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:29,990
You'd be too sore to work tomorrow.

457
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,550
So I'm really really sorry.

458
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,950
Oh my god, oh my god, you are so lucky

459
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,530
that I'm about to pedal off all this rage right now!

460
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,140
Attention, cyclists,

461
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,220
We're sorry to report Brad is sick and class is canceled.

462
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,910
No!

463
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,810
No one is going anywhere

464
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,650
because this class is not canceled!

465
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,110
I think everyone should listen to her.

466
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,690
Stop talking, Gabi, and start pedaling.

467
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,830
No one's gonna tell me that there's no class today.

468
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,480
Isn't anyone else just tired of hearing no?

469
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,060
Yeah!

470
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,090
And aren't you tired of not getting what you want out of life?

471
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,100
Yeah!

472
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,940
Sick of being called a hooker?

473
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,950
All right, well, just forget that last one.

474
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,880
Now get up, we're on a hill!

475
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,810
Come on, let's go! I said get up!

476
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,950
Oh, what the matter? Is your boss being mean to you?

477
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,370
Well, try not having a boss

478
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,340
because you've been unemployed for three months!

479
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,570
Pedal faster!

480
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,750
Oh, and look at you in your fancy soul spin gear.

481
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,190
How could you afford all that?

482
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,030
Do you not have to pay rent

483
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,640
because you live with your parents?

484
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,810
Well, that's not gonna be me!

485
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,950
- Because I enjoy my independence! - Yeah!

486
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,000
- I like my freedom! - Yeah!

487
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,500
So, you know what that means?

488
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,120
I'm not moving home to Florida!

489
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,780
You're not?

490
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,400
No. I guess I'm not.

491
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,660
Who said you could slow down? Push ups!

492
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,440
Sofia, that was amazing.

493
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,890
And when you shouted at us in Spanish,

494
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,500
you sounded even meaner.

495
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,420
Oh my god, I was talking in Spanish?

496
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,680
I didn't even realize.

497
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,810
Something just came over me,

498
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,020
and I had to take charge, you know?

499
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,470
Oh god, it felt so good to be in control again.

500
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,110
You know, the only reason I took that catering job

501
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,720
was to keep you here in San Francisco with me, right?

502
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,150
I know. But don't worry.

503
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,070
Like I said, I'm not going anywhere.

504
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,550
I don't know how, but I will figure it out.

505
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,990
We'll figure it out.

506
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,190
All right, come on, let's get out of here.

507
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,690
I'd love to, you know,

508
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,680
But I cannot feel my legs!

509
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,410
Ay, dios mios!

510
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,420
You're welcome.

511
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,930
Hey, that was a great class. Where do you teach?

512
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,610
Oh, I don't. I just take classes at the Y.

513
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,300
You're a natural. Motivating people and yelling at them?

514
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,460
That's a real gift.

515
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,670
- Thank you. - Yeah, she does it at home, too.

516
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,150
Well, I'm the head instructor here.

517
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,840
Would you be interested in working for us?

518
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,420
Wha-huh?

519
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,040
Uh, what she means is yes! Yes, she would.

520
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,940
- How soon can you start? - How's now?

521
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,660
You're hired.

522
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,540
I'll meet you in the back office

523
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,360
to talk wage, commission, and benefits.

524
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,960
Wage, commission, and benefits, oh my.

525
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,440
Okay. I'll see you in a second.

526
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,230
My god, you're a working girl again!

527
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,540
And I mean that in the nice way.

528
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,340
Wow, see what happens when you say yes--

529
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,800
Oh, shut up!

530
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,920
It feels good to be back.

531
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,140
How's your salad?

532
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,750
Amazing, I love it.

533
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:56,250
It's a little light on the olive oil, though.

534
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,910
Here you go.

535
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,510
Aww, that is the tiniest bottle of olive oil I've ever seen.

536
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,010
It's so cute.

537
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,270
I have a perfectly normal-sized penis!

538
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,590
I'm gonna go.

539
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,730
Probably for the best.

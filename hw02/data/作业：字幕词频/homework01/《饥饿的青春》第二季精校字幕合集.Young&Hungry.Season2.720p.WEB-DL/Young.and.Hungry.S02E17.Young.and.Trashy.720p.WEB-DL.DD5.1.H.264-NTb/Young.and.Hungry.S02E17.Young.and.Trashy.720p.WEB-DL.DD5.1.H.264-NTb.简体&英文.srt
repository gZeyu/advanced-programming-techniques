乔什
Hey Josh.

71
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,990
我俩都给你买了礼物
We each got you something

72
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,140
庆祝你新应用发布
to kick off the launch of your new app.

73
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,470
发布快乐
Appy-birthday!

74
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,980
你懂没  是发布日
Get it? App-y instead of happy?

75
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,860
是我想到的
I thought of it.

76
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,490
你们有谁送的是赞安诺吗
Do any of them happen to be a xanax?

77
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,750
我开玩笑而已  并没有
I'm just kidding. No, I'm not.

78
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,500
早上好
Good morning!

79
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,330
怎么了
What's... what's going on?

80
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,610
这是干什么
What's happening?

81
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,590
"干什么"吗
"What's happening?"

82
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,190
乔什今年发布的第一款新应用
The first new app Josh has released

83
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,250
还有半小时就要上线了
in a year is going live in 30 minutes.

84
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,730
为了让他在这能成就或者毁灭
And to distract him from this crucial moment

85
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,130
他事业的关键时刻别太紧张
that could make or break his career,

86
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,590
爱他的人们  送给了他礼物
The people that love him are giving him presents.

87
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,100
是啊  我知道是这事
Oh, yeah. I mean I know that's happening.

88
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,350
我是问还有其他事吗
I meant... you know, what's happening else?

89
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,870
没了
Nothing.

90
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,820
你要送他什么
What did you get him?

91
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,530
我...
I...

92
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,550
我要送...  不
I got him a-- oh no...

93
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,150
差点被你骗了
Ha ha, almost got me.

94
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,930
这是个惊喜
It's a surprise.

95
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,450
各位  你们不用送我东西的
Guys, you didn't have to get me anything.

96
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,210
很好  因为她显然没准备
Good, because she obviously didn't.

97
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,410
我准备了  实际上我的礼物很棒
Yes I did. In fact, my gift is so amazing,

98
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,100
还很私密  无法描述
And personal, and indescribable,

99
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,750
我就不描述了
I'm going to stop describing it.

100
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,470
拆我的  拆我的
Open mine! Open mine!

101
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,270
是最好的自行车架
It's a top of the line bike rack!

102
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,180
艾略特  你把我的两大爱好结合了
Elliot, you combined my two favorite things.

103
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,830
自行车和巨乳[架子]  击个掌
Bikes and racks. Up top!

104
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,590
我得承认  艾略特  我之前还怕
Well, I have to admit, Elliot, I was afraid

105
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,240
你的礼物比我有心思
that your gift would be better.

106
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,940
但没有哦
But it's not!

107
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,760
这是什么
What is-- what is this?

108
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,510
摇头娃娃啊
It's a bobblehead.

109
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,660
你的娃娃  我定做的
Of you! I had it made.

110
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,480
我该...
Where...

111
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,360
把这娃娃放哪啊
am I gonna put this bobblehead?

112
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,670
我太喜欢了
I love it.

113
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,600
真讨厌我的礼物还不来
I'm so mad that my gift isn't here yet.

114
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,480
你就好拆开了
So you can open it-- oh!

115
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,150
让我来看看运单
Let me check on the tracking.

116
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,450
不好
Yeah... oh no.

117
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,340
在...暴风雪地区有场暴风雪
There's a stupid snowstorm in the... snowstormy areas.

118
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,470
快看
Oh look.

119
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,520
上面说傍晚就能到了...吧
It says it's going to be here by late afteroon-ish.

120
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,730
我能先去吃午餐吗
Unrelated, can I take an early lunch?

121
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,900
{\an8}莉莉廉价服装店

122
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,420
这礼物一定要特别
Okay. This gift has to be unique,

123
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,560
私密  还要少于我们在沙发缝找到的十二块钱
And personal, and less than the $12 we found in the couch.

124
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,440
一顶软呢帽怎么样
How about a fedora?

125
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,280
别学菲董
Nah, too Pharrell-y.

126
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,480
好吧  那...
All right, so...

127
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,720
马甲如何
how about a vest?

128
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,070
太艾略特风了
Too Elliot-y.

129
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,980
好吧
Okie-dokie... ooh!

130
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,470
送高领衫
a turtleneck.

131
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,200
又不是演哑剧
Too mime-y.

132
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,230
是吗  史蒂夫·乔布斯演哑剧吗
Really? Was Steve Jobs a mime?

133
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,080
可能吧
Maybe.

134
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,000
但他不是搞电脑的大人物吗
But wasn't he like a big huge computer guy?

135
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,330
没错  这是他的标志性衣服
Yes, and this was his signature shirt!

136
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,010
黑色的高领套头衫
A black mock turtleneck.

137
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,840
你真觉得乔什那么书呆
You really think Josh is that much of a nerd

138
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,300
只因为史蒂夫·乔布斯穿这个
that he's gonna like a black mock turtleneck

139
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,220
就也会喜欢黑色高领衫吗
just because Steve Jobs wore one?

140
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,460
-也是  -不不不  这很完美
- He probably-- - No no no! It's perfect!

141
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,540
多少钱
How much is it?

142
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,500
十五块
Fifteen dollars.

143
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,560
该死  钱不够
Dammit. We don't have enough.

144
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,650
有我小索在  谁敢原价卖给你
Well, you don't need enough when you got Li'l So so.

145
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,350
八块钱  不卖就算
Ahem, eight bucks. Take it or leave it.

146
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,810
那算了
Leave it.

147
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,870
别嘛  姑娘
Come on, chica.

148
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,920
这破衣服哪里值十五块
This crappy old shirt isn't worth $15.

149
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,230
我们肯定有办法的
There's gotta be something we can do.

150
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,710
那就再加七块
Add $7.

151
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,000
七块
That's this many.

152
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,190
拜托  莉莉
Please, Lily!

153
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,710
廉价莉莉
Frugal Lily.

154
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,790
廉价莉莉小姐
Miss Frugal Lily.

155
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,190
这是送我老板的  如果我不送他礼物
This is for my boss, and if I don't get him something,

156
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,220
可能会丢工作
I could lose my job.

157
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,880
好吗  我闺蜜现在又没工作
Okay? And my best friend isn't working right now,

158
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,710
我是家里唯一挣钱的人了
so I'm the only one working in the family.

159
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,610
这样吧亲爱的  便宜三块
Tell you what sweetheart, three dollars off

160
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,210
留个信箱地址就好
if you join the mailing list.

161
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,660
没问题
Okay.

162
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,560
不用谢
You're welcome.

163
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,860
应用已经上线一小时了
Okay, the app's been live for an hour now.

164
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,240
下载量如何
How are the numbers?

165
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,820
按我首席财务总监的话是
I believe the way my Chief Financial Officer

166
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,850
"天啊  怎么会"
put it was, "Oh god! Oh god! Why?"

167
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,900
结束了  艾略特  失败了
It's over, Elliot. It failed.

168
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,880
我看得出来你不高兴
I can see you're upset.

169
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,050
你想让我...
Would you like me to...

170
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,240
下载啊
Come on!

171
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,190
闭嘴
Oh, shut up.

172
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,880
你才闭嘴
You shut up.

173
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,090
我快疯了
I'm losing it.

174
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,050
没错  是的
Yeah. Ya are.

175
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,530
你没了优势  没了天赋
Losing your edge. Losing you talent.

176
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,540
你在业内没地位了
You're not relevant anymore.

177
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,880
够了
Enough.

178
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,270
废物
Loser!

179
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,390
不
Nope.

180
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,280
这么大的东西塞不进那小洞啊
Not easy fitting something so big through such a small hole.

181
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,510
他说道
That's what he said.

182
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,550
我这么妙语连珠  居然边上没人听
I come up with a zinger like that and no one's around to hear it.

183
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,080
还以为有钱人的垃圾会香一点
You would think rich people's trash would smell better.

184
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,190
我猜所以他们有的才是"臭钱"吧
I guess that's why they call 'em stinkin' rich.

185
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,280
我要把这些段子写下来
Damn, I got to start writing this stuff down.

186
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,970
怎么回事
What the hell?

187
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,460
是我送给乔什的摇头娃娃
That's the bobblehead I got for Josh.

188
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,260
那没良心的混...
That ungrateful son of a--

189
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,470
还好我没送他小狗
good thing I didn't go with the puppy.

190
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,820
猜猜你有什么
Guess what you got?

191
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,040
一个烂透了的应用吗
An app that's going nowhere?

192
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,670
猜猜还有什么
Guess what else?

193
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,730
那个没人相信我买了的礼物
The gift arrived that no one believed I got you!

194
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,260
到了  快拆开看看
It's here! Open it, open it, open it...

195
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,450
黑色高领衫
Black turtleneck.

196
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,120
就是史蒂夫·乔布斯穿的那种
It's the same kind that Steve Jobs wore.

197
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,790
送你是因为你让我想起了他
I got it because you remind me of him.

198
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,090
我怎么就跟乔布斯一样了
How am I like Steve Jobs?

199
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,290
他那么成功
Steve Jobs was successful.

200
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,610
他也不是总成功的嘛
Well you know, he wasn't always.

201
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,140
他也起起伏伏的  是吗
He had-- he had ups and downs, right?

202
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,410
当然
Of course he did.

203
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,900
对  他有过成功  也有过失败
Yeah. You know, he had success and he had failure.

204
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,610
这跟你刚才说的是一个意思
I mean that's the same thing you just said,

205
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,980
但我懂了
but I see where you're going.

206
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,390
等等
Wait a minute.

207
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,830
你买这高领衫  是提醒我
You got me this turtleneck to remind me that

208
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,060
就算乔布斯多次失败过
even though Steve Jobs had some occasional disappointments,

209
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,700
结果还是称霸了整个科技界
he went on to take over the entire world of technology.

210
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,240
或许我也可以
And maybe I will too.

211
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,810
对  就像我贺卡上写的
Yeah. It's like you read my card.

212
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,180
我礼物选对了吗
So was I right about the gift?

213
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,890
很对  我送他的时机也刚刚好
Yes! And I gave it to him at the perfect time.

214
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,010
就在他应用失败的时候
Right when his app was failing.

215
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,910
不是吧  失败了吗
Oh no. His app is failing?

216
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,440
你想知道最棒的是什么吗
So you want to know the best part?

217
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,110
他很喜欢  那给了他希望
He loved it. It gave him hope.

218
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,990
送礼物不就是为了这个吗
And isn't that what gift giving is all about?

219
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,740
廉价服装店的莉莉
Lily! From Frugal Lily's!

220
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,210
记性真好  两小时前的人你还记得
Great memory, you met me two hours ago.

221
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,350
我想要回高领衫
I need the turtleneck back.

222
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,180
抱歉  莉莉  那衣服不卖
I'm sorry, Lily, the shirt's not for sale.

223
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,810
那就想办法卖
Well, make it for sale.

224
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,590
后来发现那衣服真是史蒂夫·乔布斯的
Turns out it belonged to the actual Steve Jobs.

225
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,740
什么  真的吗
What? Seriously?

226
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,060
对  女佣不小心拿来的
Yeah, the maid brought it in accidentally

227
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,600
现在他们家想要回去
and the family wants it back.

228
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,660
是吗
Oh, really?

229
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,180
那小索我最好穿上雨鞋
Well, then Li'l So-So better get her galoshes

230
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,340
因为老乔家要大出血咯
'cause that family's about to make it rain!

231
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,640
莉莉  我老板很喜欢那衣服
Lily, listen, my boss is in love with it

232
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,630
也真的给了他鼓励
and he was in a really bad place.

233
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,280
所以对不起  但多少钱都不能
So I'm sorry, but no amount of money

234
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,130
让我把衣服要回来
could make me take it away from him.

235
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,460
两万五怎么样
How about $25,000?

236
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,710
我们一小时内送去给你
We'll have it for you within the hour.

237
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,490
好  我用这件假高领衫
Okay, I'm gonna swap out the mock turtleneck

238
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,170
把那件高领衫换过来
for this mock-mock turtleneck, all right?

239
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:06,840
你在楼下放哨
You stay down here

240
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,880
确保乔什不从办公室出来  好吗
and make sure Josh doesn't come out of his office, okay?

241
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,930
也确保他别上楼
And make sure he doesn't come upstairs.

242
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,710
真是的  姑娘
Girl, please.

243
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,020
当我索美女三岁小孩吗
You think Li'l So-So was born yesterday?

244
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,740
游戏规则可是我...
The game don't run me, I run the...

245
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,190
-索菲亚  -乔什
- Hey, Sof! - Josh!

246
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,580
高领衫  乔什  高领衫
Turtleneck! Josh turtleneck!

247
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,830
这不是一般的高领衫
Not just any turtleneck.

248
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,110
是我的幸运高领衫
This is my lucky turtleneck.

249
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,390
加比送给我以后
Gabi got this for me and bam!

250
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,090
我应用的下载量飙升
My app sales have skyrocketed.

251
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,420
这衣服真的灵
This shirt is a winner.

252
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,320
乔什
Josh!

253
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,840
你穿着我送的高领衫啊
You're wearing the turtleneck that I got you.

254
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,000
怪不得你卧室里没有
That's why it's not in your bedroom...

255
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,990
我猜的
I would imagine.

256
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,410
这衣服改变了我的人生
This shirt has changed my life.

257
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,730
听到没  加比
Hear that, Gabi?

258
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,350
是不是很棒
Isn't that fantastic?

259
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,790
我再也不脱了
I'm never taking it off.

260
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,780
不脱了
Never!

261
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,240
不脱了吗
Never?

262
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,880
乔什  那你...
I mean Josh, what about--

263
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,780
你睡觉怎么办
what about when you go to sleep?

264
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,070
不脱
No.

265
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,470
那...那万圣节呢
Well, what about-- what about on Halloween?

266
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,770
-我就扮成乔布斯  -可恶
- I'll go as Steve Jobs. - Dammit.

267
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,890
那你骑自行车呢
Well, what about when you go on a bike ride?

268
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,200
加比  骑车的时候我当然会脱掉
Gabi, of course I'm going to take it off if I go on a bike ride.

269
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,450
我不会把让沾上汗的
I'm not going to get it sweaty.

270
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,890
你看起来好紧张
You know, you're all wound up.

271
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,690
我觉得你该去骑车放松下
I think you need to go on a bike ride.

272
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,950
索菲亚  他好紧张
Uh-huh. Sofia, he's tight.

273
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,260
摸摸看  肌肉都僵了
Feel him. He's very tight.

274
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,190
是僵了
Ooh, he is tight.

275
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,150
两位  今天是发布日
Guys, today is my launch day.

276
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,180
我只想坐在电脑前
All I want to do is sit at my computer

277
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,860
穿着我的幸运高领衫
and see how many people download my app

278
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,790
看会有多少人下载应用
while wearing my lucky magic turtleneck.

279
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,340
看来有人挺喜欢加比送的礼物
Looks like someone loves the gift Gabi got them.

280
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,970
不像我的摇头娃娃
Unlike my bobblehead,

281
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,130
我在你办公室没看见呢
which I didn't see in your office.

282
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,690
这个嘛...
Oh, well...

283
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,970
因为我把它移走了
that's 'cause I moved it.

284
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,610
谢天谢地
Oh, thank god.

285
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,130
我还怕你不喜欢它
You know, I was scared that you didn't like it.

286
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,910
我前夫科尔曼有次扔掉了我送的礼物
My ex Coleman once threw out a gift that I gave him and I...

287
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,140
我崩溃了
I was crushed.

288
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,770
到现在都记得
I remember it to this day.

289
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,980
尤兰达
Oh. Yolanda...

290
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,170
我不会扔掉你礼物的
I'd never throw your gift away.

291
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,870
那就好
Good.

292
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,280
所以它在哪
So, where is it?

293
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,860
我交给快递员
Um... I had a messenger pick it up

294
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,200
把它送去市中心的公司办公室了
and they took it to my corporate office downtown

295
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,540
好让大家都看看
so all the people there could see it.

296
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,860
我真是受宠若惊
Oh, I am so flattered!

297
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,730
看到大家都喜欢我也很高兴
You know, I would love to see the people enjoying it.

298
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,220
不如我们现在去你公司的办公室吧
How 'bout we go to your corporate office right now?

299
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,260
我也想去  但我...
You know, I'd love to but I'm...

300
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,860
-正要去骑车  -正要去骑车
- Going on a bike ride. - going on a bike ride.

301
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,750
乔什  你喊我来这里干什么
Josh, why did you want me to meet you in here?

302
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,990
明白了  等我也脱掉
Oh, I see. Let me catch up.

303
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,790
别闹
Knock it off!

304
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,430
埃兰能接受的  他同意我跟你睡
It's cool with Alan, you're one of my free passes.

305
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,720
艾略特  别闹
Elliot! No.

306
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,180
我需要你把尤兰达的礼物找回来
Look, I need you to get Yolanda's gift back.

307
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,000
从垃圾桶里
From the trash.

308
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,830
你把她的礼物扔了吗
You threw her gift away?

309
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,870
不得不扔  吓死我了
I had to! That thing was freaking me out.

310
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,750
谁管为什么  反正你更喜欢我的
Who cares why? You like mine better!

311
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,460
你能帮我吗  艾略特
Are you going to help me, Elliot?

312
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,120
当然
Absolutely.

313
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,470
我帮你踩着脚踏板
I'll push on the little pedal-y thing

314
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,160
你自己伸手拿吧
and you'll reach in and grab it.

315
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,250
不是这个垃圾桶
No, not this trash.

316
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,120
我把它扔进大楼的垃圾道了
I threw it down the building's trash chute.

317
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,390
我才不会去那里
No. I'm not going down there.

318
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,980
我给你一千块
I'll give you a thousand dollars.

319
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,420
不  我还是不去
No, I'm still not going down there.

320
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,940
两千块
$2,000.

321
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,080
你出的钱越多  这事越好笑
The higher the amount, the funnier it gets.

322
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,730
好吧  你婚礼费用我包了
Fine. I'll pay for your wedding.

323
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,000
在夏威夷的游艇上办婚礼
My Hawaiian wedding on a yacht

324
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,360
还请席琳·迪翁来唱《泰坦尼克号》主题曲吗
with Celine Dion singing the love song from "Titanic?"

325
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,760
没问题
Done!

326
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,790
我是这世界的女王
I'm the queen of the world!

327
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,770
好了各位  待会见
All right guys, see you in a bit.

328
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,410
你腰上系着高领衫
Is the bike ride really a good idea

329
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,470
再去骑单车  真的好吗
with the turtleneck wrapped around your waist?

330
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,110
没错  乔什
Uh... she's right, Josh.

331
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,780
万一卷进车轮里  或者被风刮走了呢
You know, it could get caught in a spoke or blow in the wind.

332
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,990
没错  毕竟这里是风城嘛
Yeah, yeah. You know, it is the windy city, after all.

333
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,950
那是芝加哥
That's Chicago.

334
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,030
不过你们说的对
But you guys might be right.

335
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,410
我可不想衣服出什么意外
I don't want anything to happen to it.

336
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,980
给  视线不许离开它
Here. Don't take your eyes off it.

337
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,280
不会的
I won't.

338
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,310
你猜怎么着  不行
You know what? I can't do it.

339
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,370
把高领衫还我
I need my turtleneck back.

340
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,730
好吧
Oh, okay.

341
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,850
把它系在脖子上
Tie it around my neck.

342
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,100
就像披风一样
Like a cape.

343
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,020
没想到吧  加比
Didn't think of that one, did you Gabi?

344
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,930
没有  乔什  你真是把高领衫穿得更帅了
Nope Josh. You've found a way to make turtlenecks even cooler.

345
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,130
对
Yes.

346
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,040
没错
Yes I did.

347
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,410
我们成功了  偷梁换柱
We did it! The 'ol switcheroo.

348
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,120
现在我们只要等他进了电梯
Now all we got to do is wait for him to get in the elevator.

349
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,900
两万五千块一次
$25,000 one...

350
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,090
两万五千块两次
$25,000 two...

351
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,510
两万五千块第三次
$25,000 three...

352
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,930
两万五千块
$25,000

353
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,720
两万五千块
$25,000

354
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,000
两万五...  乔什
$25-- Josh!

355
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,530
没有自行车
Can't go on a bike ride...

356
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,400
怎么能骑车
...without my bike.

357
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,330
没错  先生
No sir, you cannot.

358
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,630
去拿自行车吧
You go get that bike.

359
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,240
天啊  好险
Oh my god, that was so close.

360
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,100
好  我们快去莉莉店里
Okay, let's hurry. Let's get to Lily's.

361
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,770
衣服呢
Where's the shirt?

362
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,220
不要啊
Nooo!

363
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,290
好了  我再说最后一次
Okay, I'm just going to say this one more time.

364
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,790
这真是你干过最蠢的事
This is the dumbest thing you've ever done.

365
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,210
谁更蠢呢  是蠢蛋
Okay, who's dumber? The dummy?

366
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,440
还是把衣服扔进垃圾桶的蠢蛋
Or the dummy that threw the shirt to the dummy?

367
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,890
行了  我们找到衣服  赶快走
Okay. Let's just get it and get out of here.

368
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,000
好
Okay.

369
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,240
你去拿
Go get it!

370
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,640
我吗
Me?

371
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,470
好吧  我们一起去
Fine, we'll both go.

372
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
你都还没进垃圾桶呢  小公主
Okay, we're not even in there yet, princess.

373
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,790
如果里面有老鼠怎么办
What if there's a rat in here?

374
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,920
你们两个在这干什么
What are you two doing here?

375
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,800
乔什也让你们来找摇头娃娃吗
Did Josh send you to look for the bobblehead?

376
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,700
真不巧  它是我的
Well too bad, it's mine!

377
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,600
我们不是找摇头娃娃  是在找...
We're not looking for a bobblehead. We're looking for--

378
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,650
什么  我身上有东西吗
What? What? Is there something on me?

379
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,200
对
Yes!

380
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,570
在哪  在哪
Where? Where is it? Where is it?

381
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,170
在你头上
On your head...

382
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,120
艾略特找到了
Oh, Elliot found it!

383
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,350
艾略特  谢谢你找回了娃娃
Elliot, thank you for finding the bobblehead.

384
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,500
现在请你把它送去我市中心的办公室
Okay, now I need you to take it to my downtown office

385
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,190
明天尤兰达好能...
so tomorrow when Yolanda goes...

386
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,900
什么叫你没找到
what do you mean you didn't find it?

387
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,230
我才把它放进碗橱里
I just put it in the cupboard.

388
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,040
我再打给你
I'll call you back.

389
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,590
好  深呼吸
Okay, breathe.

390
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,250
一个摇头娃娃而已
It's a bobblehead.

391
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,990
一切都有合理解释
Logical explanation for all of this.

392
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,790
我吓到你了吗  小宝贝
Did I scare you, baby?

393
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,040
抱歉  我刚才在倒垃圾
Sorry, I was just taking out the trash.

394
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,180
知道吗  就是扔掉不想要的东西
You know, the place where you throw things out you don't want,

395
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,880
比如蛋壳  脏纸巾  真心的礼物
like eggshells, dirty paper towels, heartfelt gifts...

396
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,510
就像是特意定制的摇头娃娃
like a one of a kind made-to-order bobblehead?

397
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,390
-你都知道了  -没错
- So you know? - Yes, I know.

398
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,850
我在垃圾堆里找到了
I found it in the trash.

399
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,260
是你找到的  谢天谢地
Oh, you found it. Thank god.

400
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,110
所以也是你把它拿走的吗
So you were the one moving it around?

401
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,430
当然了
'course I was.

402
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,080
你不会以为是它自己走的吧
You don't think it walked over there by itself, did you?

403
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,370
怎么会
No.

404
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,740
那说话声音也是你吗
And-- and you were the one doing the voice?

405
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,370
-什么声音  -没事
- No. What voice? - Nothing!

406
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,400
尤兰达  我知道不该扔掉它
Yolanda, I know I shouldn't have thrown it away

407
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,190
但应用发布要逼疯我了
but my launch day was making me crazy

408
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,590
还看着我自己摇头晃脑地笑自己
and staring at my own head just bobbling around judging me,

409
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,330
是我反应过度了
I overreacted.

410
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,090
我能理解  乔什
I guess I understand, Josh.

411
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,920
看起来是有点诡异
I mean, it it is a little creepy looking.

412
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,860
那个娃娃  不是你脑袋
The doll, not your head.

413
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,030
你脑袋很好看
Nice head.

414
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,720
说真的  我很内疚
Seriously, I felt so bad.

415
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,900
现在已经派艾略特去垃圾箱找了
I have Elliot in the dumpster right now looking for it.

416
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,360
我让他出来
Gonna tell him to get out.

417
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,620
你真的想补偿我吗
You really want to make this up to me?

418
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,340
我知道我想
You know I do.

419
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,400
那就等下再打
Hold off on that phone call.

420
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,410
快  艾略特  把衣服给我们
Come on, Elliot. Just give us the shirt.

421
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,470
想得美
I would, except no.

422
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,250
这里面有蹊跷[闻起来奇怪]  不光是钻进
Something smells funny, and it's not just the wood shavings

423
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,020
我鞋子里的仓鼠笼木渣
from that hamster cage that's filling my loafer.

424
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,540
为什么两个女孩会爬进垃圾桶
Why would two girls crawl through filth

425
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,810
找一件丑死人的涤纶衣服
for an ugly polyblend shirt?

426
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,960
没错  这根本不值钱
Exactly. It's just a worthless shirt.

427
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,360
那你们也不会介意我用衣服
Oh, so then you won't mind if I use this shirt

428
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,340
擦一下这滩
to wipe up this unidentified sludge

429
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,110
最好是酸奶的白色不明物咯
that you better hope to god is greek yogurt.

430
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,510
不要
No!

431
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,930
艾略特  我们为什么想要这衣服不重要
Elliot, it doesn't matter why we want the shirt.

432
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,550
好吗  给我们就好
Okay? Just give it to us!

433
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,150
那就这样办
Here's how this is gonna go down.

434
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,740
你们找到摇头娃娃
You find my bobblehead,

435
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,780
我就把这丑衣服给你们
I give you this hideous shirt

436
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,010
大家皆大欢喜地出去
and we all walk out of here winners.

437
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,130
黄师傅家的外卖吗
Pro Wong's take out?

438
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,810
我们家的垃圾扔完了
Well, that's the end of our trash,

439
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,020
不过还有芬克小姐
But here's a little something

440
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,500
和她十二只猫向你问好哦
compliments of Miss Finkel and her twelve cats.

441
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,310
艾略特  这里没有
Elliot, it's not here!

442
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,800
继续找
Keep looking.

443
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,040
每个成人尿布都要翻过来看
Leave no adult diaper unturned.

444
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,330
不要
No... no!

445
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,080
够了
Stop it! Stop!

446
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,460
我想到了另一个办法
I just thought of another way to do this.

447
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,510
抓住他
Get him!

448
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,660
尤兰达
Yolanda!

449
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,700
你说得对  这样不礼貌
You're right. That is rude.

450
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,170
艾略特喝咖啡喜欢加奶
Elliot likes cream with his coffee.

451
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,520
我觉得行了
I think he's had enough.

452
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,680
给他点甜头[骨头]吧
Throw him a bone.

453
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,030
我可不只给他根骨头  我扔了一整只鸡
I did better than that. I threw a whole chicken!

454
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,250
好吧
All right.

455
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,080
明明二对一
It's two against one!

456
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,550
你怎么这么有劲
How are you so strong?

457
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,160
你们知道我去过多少次巴尼商场的
Do you know how many Barney's Warehouse Sales

458
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,900
大清仓吗  贱人
I've been to, bitches?

459
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,030
有情况
Incoming!

460
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,550
不
No!

461
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,910
天啊  是摇头娃娃
Oh my god! It's the bobblehead!

462
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,660
衣服给你们  贱人
Here's your shirt, bitches!

463
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,740
我已经洗两次澡了
I just took a second shower

464
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,000
闻起来还是一股酸辣汤味
and I still smell like hot and sour soup.

465
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,910
三次就好了
Third one's the charm.

466
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,650
才不会
No, it's not.

467
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,590
我们差一点就有钱了
We were so close to being rich.

468
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,360
我知道  我都想好怎么花那钱了
I know. I had big plans for that money.

469
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,670
我可以躺在卡波的沙滩上
I was going to pay off my student loans...

470
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,860
还清我的学生贷款
...while lying on a beach in Cabo.

471
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,130
是啊  我们去不成卡波了
Yeah, well we're not going to Cabo.

472
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,510
想知道为什么吗
You want to know why?

473
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,090
因为你直觉糟透了吗
Because you have terrible, terrible instincts?

474
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,190
不  因为我们太贪婪
No, because we were greedy.

475
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,880
我们就不该把乔什的衣服拿走
We never should have taken that shirt back from Josh.

476
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,940
我们现在说好
Let's make a pact right now

477
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,500
再也不让贪婪控制自己
to never let ourselves be controlled by greed.

478
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,800
没问题
Done.

479
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,830
姑娘们  衣服呢
Hey ladies, where's the shirt?

480
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,640
被撕坏了
Well, it's torn.

481
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,000
贪婪把它撕成了两半
Greed ripped it in half.

482
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,970
我要把你们撕成两半
I'm gonna rip you both in half,

483
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,470
衣服给我
Give me that shirt.

484
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,730
等等  这不是我卖你们的那件
Wait a minute, this isn't the shirt I sold you.

485
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,580
什么
What?

486
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,030
你觉得乔布斯会穿女式M号吗
You think Steve Jobs wore a woman's medium?

487
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,120
什么  天啊
What? Oh my god. Oh my god.

488
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,380
那说明艾略特头上的不是这件衣服
That means Elliot must have had a different shirt on his head.

489
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,150
说明真的衣服还在...
That means the real shirt is still in the...

490
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,890
我能去卡波了
I'm going to Cabo!

491
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,670
这还能卖几个钱
Eh, I could get a couple of bucks for this.

492
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,310
乔什  该洗衣服了
Hey Josh, it's laundry day.

493
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,530
暗示你一下
Hint hint.

494
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,630
我说暗示  意思是赶快把那臭衣服脱下来
And by hint hint, I mean take off the damn shirt because you stink.

495
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,460
抱歉  尤兰达  我不脱
Sorry, Yolanda. Not taking it off.

496
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,400
我的应用这周下载量都很惊人
My app has been crushing it all week.

497
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,690
请脱了吧
Please?

498
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,190
我九十分钟以后就还你
I mean, I'll have it back to you in 90 minutes.

499
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,190
抱歉  我不冒这个险
Sorry, I'm not taking that risk.

500
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,700
现在麻烦告诉加比  我可以吃午餐了
Now please tell Gabi I'm ready for my lunch.

501
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,950
好吧
Okay.

502
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,920
太棒了
Yes!

503
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,610
或许是该换了
Maybe she's right.

504
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,950
加比
Gabi?

505
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,750
乔什要吃午餐了
Josh's ready for his lunch.

506
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,990

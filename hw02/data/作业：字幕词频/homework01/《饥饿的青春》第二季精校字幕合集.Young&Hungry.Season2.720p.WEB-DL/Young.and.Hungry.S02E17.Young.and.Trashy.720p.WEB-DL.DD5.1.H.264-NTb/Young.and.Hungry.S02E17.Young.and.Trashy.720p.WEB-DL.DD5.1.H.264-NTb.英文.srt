70
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,920
Hey Josh.

71
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,990
We each got you something

72
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,140
to kick off the launch of your new app.

73
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,470
Appy-birthday!

74
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,980
Get it? App-y instead of happy?

75
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,860
I thought of it.

76
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,490
Do any of them happen to be a xanax?

77
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,750
I'm just kidding. No, I'm not.

78
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,500
Good morning!

79
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,330
What's... what's going on?

80
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,610
What's happening?

81
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,590
"What's happening?"

82
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,190
The first new app Josh has released

83
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,250
in a year is going live in 30 minutes.

84
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,730
And to distract him from this crucial moment

85
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,130
that could make or break his career,

86
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,590
The people that love him are giving him presents.

87
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,100
Oh, yeah. I mean I know that's happening.

88
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,350
I meant... you know, what's happening else?

89
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,870
Nothing.

90
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,820
What did you get him?

91
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,530
I...

92
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,550
I got him a-- oh no...

93
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,150
Ha ha, almost got me.

94
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,930
It's a surprise.

95
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,450
Guys, you didn't have to get me anything.

96
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,210
Good, because she obviously didn't.

97
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,410
Yes I did. In fact, my gift is so amazing,

98
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,100
And personal, and indescribable,

99
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,750
I'm going to stop describing it.

100
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,470
Open mine! Open mine!

101
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,270
It's a top of the line bike rack!

102
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,180
Elliot, you combined my two favorite things.

103
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,830
Bikes and racks. Up top!

104
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,590
Well, I have to admit, Elliot, I was afraid

105
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,240
that your gift would be better.

106
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,940
But it's not!

107
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,760
What is-- what is this?

108
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,510
It's a bobblehead.

109
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,660
Of you! I had it made.

110
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,480
Where...

111
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,360
am I gonna put this bobblehead?

112
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,670
I love it.

113
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,600
I'm so mad that my gift isn't here yet.

114
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,480
So you can open it-- oh!

115
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,150
Let me check on the tracking.

116
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,450
Yeah... oh no.

117
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,340
There's a stupid snowstorm in the... snowstormy areas.

118
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,470
Oh look.

119
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,520
It says it's going to be here by late afteroon-ish.

120
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,730
Unrelated, can I take an early lunch?

122
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,420
Okay. This gift has to be unique,

123
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,560
And personal, and less than the $12 we found in the couch.

124
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,440
How about a fedora?

125
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,280
Nah, too Pharrell-y.

126
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,480
All right, so...

127
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,720
how about a vest?

128
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,070
Too Elliot-y.

129
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,980
Okie-dokie... ooh!

130
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,470
a turtleneck.

131
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,200
Too mime-y.

132
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,230
Really? Was Steve Jobs a mime?

133
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,080
Maybe.

134
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,000
But wasn't he like a big huge computer guy?

135
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,330
Yes, and this was his signature shirt!

136
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,010
A black mock turtleneck.

137
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,840
You really think Josh is that much of a nerd

138
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,300
that he's gonna like a black mock turtleneck

139
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,220
just because Steve Jobs wore one?

140
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,460
- He probably-- - No no no! It's perfect!

141
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,540
How much is it?

142
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,500
Fifteen dollars.

143
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,560
Dammit. We don't have enough.

144
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,650
Well, you don't need enough when you got Li'l So so.

145
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,350
Ahem, eight bucks. Take it or leave it.

146
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,810
Leave it.

147
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,870
Come on, chica.

148
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,920
This crappy old shirt isn't worth $15.

149
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,230
There's gotta be something we can do.

150
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,710
Add $7.

151
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,000
That's this many.

152
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,190
Please, Lily!

153
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,710
Frugal Lily.

154
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,790
Miss Frugal Lily.

155
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,190
This is for my boss, and if I don't get him something,

156
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,220
I could lose my job.

157
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,880
Okay? And my best friend isn't working right now,

158
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,710
so I'm the only one working in the family.

159
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,610
Tell you what sweetheart, three dollars off

160
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,210
if you join the mailing list.

161
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,660
Okay.

162
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,560
You're welcome.

163
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,860
Okay, the app's been live for an hour now.

164
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,240
How are the numbers?

165
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,820
I believe the way my Chief Financial Officer

166
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,850
put it was, "Oh god! Oh god! Why?"

167
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,900
It's over, Elliot. It failed.

168
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,880
I can see you're upset.

169
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,050
Would you like me to...

170
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,240
Come on!

171
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,190
Oh, shut up.

172
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,880
You shut up.

173
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,090
I'm losing it.

174
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,050
Yeah. Ya are.

175
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,530
Losing your edge. Losing you talent.

176
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,540
You're not relevant anymore.

177
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,880
Enough.

178
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,270
Loser!

179
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,390
Nope.

180
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,280
Not easy fitting something so big through such a small hole.

181
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,510
That's what he said.

182
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,550
I come up with a zinger like that and no one's around to hear it.

183
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,080
You would think rich people's trash would smell better.

184
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,190
I guess that's why they call 'em stinkin' rich.

185
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,280
Damn, I got to start writing this stuff down.

186
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,970
What the hell?

187
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,460
That's the bobblehead I got for Josh.

188
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,260
That ungrateful son of a--

189
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,470
good thing I didn't go with the puppy.

190
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,820
Guess what you got?

191
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,040
An app that's going nowhere?

192
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,670
Guess what else?

193
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,730
The gift arrived that no one believed I got you!

194
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,260
It's here! Open it, open it, open it...

195
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,450
Black turtleneck.

196
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,120
It's the same kind that Steve Jobs wore.

197
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,790
I got it because you remind me of him.

198
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,090
How am I like Steve Jobs?

199
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,290
Steve Jobs was successful.

200
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,610
Well you know, he wasn't always.

201
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,140
He had-- he had ups and downs, right?

202
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,410
Of course he did.

203
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,900
Yeah. You know, he had success and he had failure.

204
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,610
I mean that's the same thing you just said,

205
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,980
but I see where you're going.

206
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,390
Wait a minute.

207
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,830
You got me this turtleneck to remind me that

208
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,060
even though Steve Jobs had some occasional disappointments,

209
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,700
he went on to take over the entire world of technology.

210
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,240
And maybe I will too.

211
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,810
Yeah. It's like you read my card.

212
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,180
So was I right about the gift?

213
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,890
Yes! And I gave it to him at the perfect time.

214
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,010
Right when his app was failing.

215
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,910
Oh no. His app is failing?

216
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,440
So you want to know the best part?

217
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,110
He loved it. It gave him hope.

218
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,990
And isn't that what gift giving is all about?

219
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,740
Lily! From Frugal Lily's!

220
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,210
Great memory, you met me two hours ago.

221
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,350
I need the turtleneck back.

222
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,180
I'm sorry, Lily, the shirt's not for sale.

223
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,810
Well, make it for sale.

224
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,590
Turns out it belonged to the actual Steve Jobs.

225
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,740
What? Seriously?

226
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,060
Yeah, the maid brought it in accidentally

227
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,600
and the family wants it back.

228
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,660
Oh, really?

229
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,180
Well, then Li'l So-So better get her galoshes

230
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,340
'cause that family's about to make it rain!

231
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,640
Lily, listen, my boss is in love with it

232
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,630
and he was in a really bad place.

233
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,280
So I'm sorry, but no amount of money

234
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,130
could make me take it away from him.

235
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,460
How about $25,000?

236
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,710
We'll have it for you within the hour.

237
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,490
Okay, I'm gonna swap out the mock turtleneck

238
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,170
for this mock-mock turtleneck, all right?

239
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:06,840
You stay down here

240
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,880
and make sure Josh doesn't come out of his office, okay?

241
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,930
And make sure he doesn't come upstairs.

242
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,710
Girl, please.

243
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,020
You think Li'l So-So was born yesterday?

244
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,740
The game don't run me, I run the...

245
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,190
- Hey, Sof! - Josh!

246
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,580
Turtleneck! Josh turtleneck!

247
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,830
Not just any turtleneck.

248
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,110
This is my lucky turtleneck.

249
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,390
Gabi got this for me and bam!

250
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,090
My app sales have skyrocketed.

251
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,420
This shirt is a winner.

252
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,320
Josh!

253
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,840
You're wearing the turtleneck that I got you.

254
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,000
That's why it's not in your bedroom...

255
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,990
I would imagine.

256
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,410
This shirt has changed my life.

257
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,730
Hear that, Gabi?

258
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,350
Isn't that fantastic?

259
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,790
I'm never taking it off.

260
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,780
Never!

261
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,240
Never?

262
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,880
I mean Josh, what about--

263
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,780
what about when you go to sleep?

264
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,070
No.

265
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,470
Well, what about-- what about on Halloween?

266
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,770
- I'll go as Steve Jobs. - Dammit.

267
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,890
Well, what about when you go on a bike ride?

268
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,200
Gabi, of course I'm going to take it off if I go on a bike ride.

269
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,450
I'm not going to get it sweaty.

270
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,890
You know, you're all wound up.

271
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,690
I think you need to go on a bike ride.

272
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,950
Uh-huh. Sofia, he's tight.

273
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,260
Feel him. He's very tight.

274
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,190
Ooh, he is tight.

275
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,150
Guys, today is my launch day.

276
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,180
All I want to do is sit at my computer

277
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,860
and see how many people download my app

278
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,790
while wearing my lucky magic turtleneck.

279
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,340
Looks like someone loves the gift Gabi got them.

280
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,970
Unlike my bobblehead,

281
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,130
which I didn't see in your office.

282
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,690
Oh, well...

283
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,970
that's 'cause I moved it.

284
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,610
Oh, thank god.

285
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,130
You know, I was scared that you didn't like it.

286
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,910
My ex Coleman once threw out a gift that I gave him and I...

287
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,140
I was crushed.

288
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,770
I remember it to this day.

289
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,980
Oh. Yolanda...

290
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,170
I'd never throw your gift away.

291
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,870
Good.

292
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,280
So, where is it?

293
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,860
Um... I had a messenger pick it up

294
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,200
and they took it to my corporate office downtown

295
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,540
so all the people there could see it.

296
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,860
Oh, I am so flattered!

297
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,730
You know, I would love to see the people enjoying it.

298
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,220
How 'bout we go to your corporate office right now?

299
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,260
You know, I'd love to but I'm...

300
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,860
- Going on a bike ride. - going on a bike ride.

301
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,750
Josh, why did you want me to meet you in here?

302
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,990
Oh, I see. Let me catch up.

303
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,790
Knock it off!

304
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,430
It's cool with Alan, you're one of my free passes.

305
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,720
Elliot! No.

306
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,180
Look, I need you to get Yolanda's gift back.

307
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,000
From the trash.

308
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,830
You threw her gift away?

309
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,870
I had to! That thing was freaking me out.

310
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,750
Who cares why? You like mine better!

311
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,460
Are you going to help me, Elliot?

312
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,120
Absolutely.

313
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,470
I'll push on the little pedal-y thing

314
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,160
and you'll reach in and grab it.

315
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,250
No, not this trash.

316
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,120
I threw it down the building's trash chute.

317
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,390
No. I'm not going down there.

318
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,980
I'll give you a thousand dollars.

319
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,420
No, I'm still not going down there.

320
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,940
$2,000.

321
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,080
The higher the amount, the funnier it gets.

322
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,730
Fine. I'll pay for your wedding.

323
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,000
My Hawaiian wedding on a yacht

324
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,360
with Celine Dion singing the love song from "Titanic?"

325
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,760
Done!

326
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,790
I'm the queen of the world!

327
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,770
All right guys, see you in a bit.

328
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,410
Is the bike ride really a good idea

329
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,470
with the turtleneck wrapped around your waist?

330
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,110
Uh... she's right, Josh.

331
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,780
You know, it could get caught in a spoke or blow in the wind.

332
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,990
Yeah, yeah. You know, it is the windy city, after all.

333
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,950
That's Chicago.

334
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,030
But you guys might be right.

335
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,410
I don't want anything to happen to it.

336
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,980
Here. Don't take your eyes off it.

337
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,280
I won't.

338
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,310
You know what? I can't do it.

339
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,370
I need my turtleneck back.

340
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,730
Oh, okay.

341
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,850
Tie it around my neck.

342
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,100
Like a cape.

343
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,020
Didn't think of that one, did you Gabi?

344
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,930
Nope Josh. You've found a way to make turtlenecks even cooler.

345
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,130
Yes.

346
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,040
Yes I did.

347
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,410
We did it! The 'ol switcheroo.

348
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,120
Now all we got to do is wait for him to get in the elevator.

349
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,900
$25,000 one...

350
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,090
$25,000 two...

351
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,510
$25,000 three...

352
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,930
$25,000

353
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,720
$25,000

354
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,000
$25-- Josh!

355
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,530
Can't go on a bike ride...

356
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,400
...without my bike.

357
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,330
No sir, you cannot.

358
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,630
You go get that bike.

359
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,240
Oh my god, that was so close.

360
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,100
Okay, let's hurry. Let's get to Lily's.

361
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,770
Where's the shirt?

362
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,220
Nooo!

363
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,290
Okay, I'm just going to say this one more time.

364
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,790
This is the dumbest thing you've ever done.

365
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,210
Okay, who's dumber? The dummy?

366
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,440
Or the dummy that threw the shirt to the dummy?

367
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,890
Okay. Let's just get it and get out of here.

368
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,000
Okay.

369
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,240
Go get it!

370
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,640
Me?

371
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,470
Fine, we'll both go.

372
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Okay, we're not even in there yet, princess.

373
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,790
What if there's a rat in here?

374
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,920
What are you two doing here?

375
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,800
Did Josh send you to look for the bobblehead?

376
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,700
Well too bad, it's mine!

377
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,600
We're not looking for a bobblehead. We're looking for--

378
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,650
What? What? Is there something on me?

379
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,200
Yes!

380
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,570
Where? Where is it? Where is it?

381
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,170
On your head...

382
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,120
Oh, Elliot found it!

383
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,350
Elliot, thank you for finding the bobblehead.

384
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,500
Okay, now I need you to take it to my downtown office

385
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,190
so tomorrow when Yolanda goes...

386
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,900
what do you mean you didn't find it?

387
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,230
I just put it in the cupboard.

388
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,040
I'll call you back.

389
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,590
Okay, breathe.

390
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,250
It's a bobblehead.

391
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,990
Logical explanation for all of this.

392
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,790
Did I scare you, baby?

393
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,040
Sorry, I was just taking out the trash.

394
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,180
You know, the place where you throw things out you don't want,

395
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,880
like eggshells, dirty paper towels, heartfelt gifts...

396
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,510
like a one of a kind made-to-order bobblehead?

397
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,390
- So you know? - Yes, I know.

398
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,850
I found it in the trash.

399
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,260
Oh, you found it. Thank god.

400
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,110
So you were the one moving it around?

401
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,430
'course I was.

402
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,080
You don't think it walked over there by itself, did you?

403
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,370
No.

404
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,740
And-- and you were the one doing the voice?

405
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,370
- No. What voice? - Nothing!

406
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,400
Yolanda, I know I shouldn't have thrown it away

407
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,190
but my launch day was making me crazy

408
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,590
and staring at my own head just bobbling around judging me,

409
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,330
I overreacted.

410
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,090
I guess I understand, Josh.

411
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,920
I mean, it it is a little creepy looking.

412
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,860
The doll, not your head.

413
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,030
Nice head.

414
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,720
Seriously, I felt so bad.

415
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,900
I have Elliot in the dumpster right now looking for it.

416
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,360
Gonna tell him to get out.

417
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,620
You really want to make this up to me?

418
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,340
You know I do.

419
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,400
Hold off on that phone call.

420
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,410
Come on, Elliot. Just give us the shirt.

421
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,470
I would, except no.

422
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,250
Something smells funny, and it's not just the wood shavings

423
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,020
from that hamster cage that's filling my loafer.

424
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,540
Why would two girls crawl through filth

425
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,810
for an ugly polyblend shirt?

426
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,960
Exactly. It's just a worthless shirt.

427
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,360
Oh, so then you won't mind if I use this shirt

428
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,340
to wipe up this unidentified sludge

429
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,110
that you better hope to god is greek yogurt.

430
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,510
No!

431
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,930
Elliot, it doesn't matter why we want the shirt.

432
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,550
Okay? Just give it to us!

433
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,150
Here's how this is gonna go down.

434
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,740
You find my bobblehead,

435
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,780
I give you this hideous shirt

436
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,010
and we all walk out of here winners.

437
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,130
Pro Wong's take out?

438
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,810
Well, that's the end of our trash,

439
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,020
But here's a little something

440
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,500
compliments of Miss Finkel and her twelve cats.

441
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,310
Elliot, it's not here!

442
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,800
Keep looking.

443
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,040
Leave no adult diaper unturned.

444
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,330
No... no!

445
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,080
Stop it! Stop!

446
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,460
I just thought of another way to do this.

447
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,510
Get him!

448
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,660
Yolanda!

449
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,700
You're right. That is rude.

450
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,170
Elliot likes cream with his coffee.

451
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,520
I think he's had enough.

452
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,680
Throw him a bone.

453
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,030
I did better than that. I threw a whole chicken!

454
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,250
All right.

455
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,080
It's two against one!

456
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,550
How are you so strong?

457
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,160
Do you know how many Barney's Warehouse Sales

458
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,900
I've been to, bitches?

459
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,030
Incoming!

460
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,550
No!

461
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,910
Oh my god! It's the bobblehead!

462
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,660
Here's your shirt, bitches!

463
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,740
I just took a second shower

464
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,000
and I still smell like hot and sour soup.

465
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,910
Third one's the charm.

466
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,650
No, it's not.

467
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,590
We were so close to being rich.

468
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,360
I know. I had big plans for that money.

469
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,670
I was going to pay off my student loans...

470
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,860
...while lying on a beach in Cabo.

471
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,130
Yeah, well we're not going to Cabo.

472
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,510
You want to know why?

473
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,090
Because you have terrible, terrible instincts?

474
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,190
No, because we were greedy.

475
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,880
We never should have taken that shirt back from Josh.

476
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,940
Let's make a pact right now

477
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,500
to never let ourselves be controlled by greed.

478
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,800
Done.

479
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,830
Hey ladies, where's the shirt?

480
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,640
Well, it's torn.

481
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,000
Greed ripped it in half.

482
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,970
I'm gonna rip you both in half,

483
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,470
Give me that shirt.

484
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,730
Wait a minute, this isn't the shirt I sold you.

485
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,580
What?

486
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,030
You think Steve Jobs wore a woman's medium?

487
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,120
What? Oh my god. Oh my god.

488
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,380
That means Elliot must have had a different shirt on his head.

489
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,150
That means the real shirt is still in the...

490
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,890
I'm going to Cabo!

491
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,670
Eh, I could get a couple of bucks for this.

492
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,310
Hey Josh, it's laundry day.

493
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,530
Hint hint.

494
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,630
And by hint hint, I mean take off the damn shirt because you stink.

495
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,460
Sorry, Yolanda. Not taking it off.

496
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,400
My app has been crushing it all week.

497
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,690
Please?

498
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,190
I mean, I'll have it back to you in 90 minutes.

499
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,190
Sorry, I'm not taking that risk.

500
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,700
Now please tell Gabi I'm ready for my lunch.

501
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,950
Okay.

502
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,920
Yes!

503
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,610
Maybe she's right.

504
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,950
Gabi?

505
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,750
Josh's ready for his lunch.

506
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,990
Yeah, wait a sec!

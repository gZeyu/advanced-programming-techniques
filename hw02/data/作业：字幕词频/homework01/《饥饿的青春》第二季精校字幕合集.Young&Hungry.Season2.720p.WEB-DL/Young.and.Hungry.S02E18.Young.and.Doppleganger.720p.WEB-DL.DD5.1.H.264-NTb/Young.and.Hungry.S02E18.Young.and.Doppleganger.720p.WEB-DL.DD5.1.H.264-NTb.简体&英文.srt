00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,890
早上好
Good morning.

70
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,130
早上...
Good mor--

71
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,540
很好吃  对吧
Yeah, it's good, right?

72
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,530
这是手做杏仁奶油
It's artisanal almond butter.

73
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,920
首先  我觉得这很厉害
Well, "A", I'm really impressed

74
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,820
你居然知道怎么用"手做"这个词
that you know how to use the word "artisanal."

75
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,250
其次  杏仁奶油  
And "B", umm, almond butter?

76
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,260
一罐要十五块呢  我们吃不起
It's $15 a jar! We can't afford it!

77
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,640
靠这个就行了
Not with this.

78
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,090
所以你买了台六百块的料理机
Oh, okay, so you bought a $600 Vitamix

79
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,180
来做十五块的杏仁奶油吗
to make $15 worth of almond butter?

80
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,090
是啊
Yup.

81
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,220
我打算开始新业务
I'm starting this new thing

82
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,940
制作不同种类的果仁奶油
where I make different types of nut butters,

83
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,940
然后在湾区的农贸市场出售
and I sell them at farmers markets all over the bay area.

84
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,490
是吗
Are ya?

85
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,520
是的
Yes, I are.

86
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,520
你真是疯了[坚果]
Aww, you're nuts.

87
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,290
我可以拿这句话做广告呢
Hey, that could be my catchphrase.

88
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,670
加比  你知道买坚果  罐子  
Gabi, do you have any idea how much it would cost to buy the nuts,

89
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,440
丝带  标签  保险  还有销售许可证
the jars, the ribbons, the tag, the insurance,

90
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,340
需要多少钱吗
let alone the permits for selling?

91
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,120
我有个主意
Oh, I have an idea!

92
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,130
我们来发明计算机吧
Let's invent the computer.

93
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,740
不不不  必须碾压创新
Oh, no, no, no! It's important that innovation be crushed!

94
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,250
加比  我不想碾压你的梦想
Gabi, I'm not trying to crush your dreams.

95
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,730
只是我们没有钱
It's just that money is, you know-- we don't have any.

96
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,030
所以这个主意完全不现实
So, this idea is just totally unrealistic.

97
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,280
"这个主意完全不现实"
"This idea is totally unrealistic."

98
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,590
我跟你说吧
I'll tell you what.

99
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,930
-我对你买料理机没意见  -好
- I'll be fine with you buying this-- - Yes.

100
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,270
前提是你以"一分都没"回答下一个问题
...if you answer "none" to the following question.

101
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,240
我们还有十一天就要交房租了
How much of our rent, which is due in 11 days,

102
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,220
你花了多少租金买这六百块的料理机
have you spent on this $600 blender?

103
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,900
梦想终结者
Dream crusher.

104
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,150
早上好  姑娘
Morning, girl.

105
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,600
怎么了
What's the matter?

106
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,550
索菲亚想让我退了这台料理机  
Sofia wants me to return this Vitamix,

107
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,630
但人家真的好想要
but I really want it.

108
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,730
我还想跟丹泽尔和勒布朗3P呢
Yeah, well, I wand to he the meat in a Denzel-LeBron sandwich,

109
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,430
但我们不会一直如愿
but we don't always get what we want.

110
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,520
有时候会因为尝试而被逮捕
And sometimes, we get arrested trying.

111
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,340
瞧瞧我为同志骄傲周末买的衣服
Check out the outfit I got for gay pride weekend.

112
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,030
你想把他们吓直吗
You trying to scare them straight?

113
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,140
瞧瞧我要穿的
Look what I'm wearing.

114
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,990
那辆游行花车为什么带着你的假发啊
Why is that parade float wearing your wig?

115
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,910
那是我啦
That's me!

116
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,800
你为什么去同志骄傲节啊
Why are you going to pride?

117
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,300
还记得你骗我扮成了
Oh, remember when you tricked me into

118
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,070
变装宾果游戏主持人吗
being a drag queen bingo host?

119
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,290
真好玩
Ha, that was funny.

120
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,360
现在我成了同志偶像
Well, now, I am a gay icon.

121
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,080
全城都有男人请我喝酒
I got men buying me drinks all over town.

122
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,580
因为他们觉得你是男人
Because they think you're a man.

123
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,410
如果12码的鞋能穿上的话
Well, if the size 12 shoe fits.

124
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,520
我有个想法
Hey, here's a thought.

125
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,190
埃兰出城了  不如我们一起去吧
Since Allan's out of town, why don't we go together?

126
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,320
我想庆祝的是骄傲  不是羞耻
I want to celebrate pride. Not shame.

127
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,800
不  尤兰达  想想吧
No. Yolanda, think about it.

128
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,270
我是个超棒的公关
I'm an amazing publicist.

129
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,250
我可以搞到节前派对
I can get us invites to the pre-party,

130
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,120
游行派对和节后派对的邀请
the parade party, and the post-party.

131
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,030
你可以为我们搞到免费的酒
You can get us free drinks.

132
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,160
我们会是骄傲游行上最受欢迎的一对
We'll be the most popular pair of people at the pride parade.

133
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,810
我喜欢
Ooh, I like it.

134
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,770
我的公寓位于活动中心
And my apartment sits in the center of all the action,

135
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,990
我们可以每场派对都穿不同的衣服了
so we can change outfits for every event!

136
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,900
真棒  这内裤我有好多不同的图案
Perfect! I own this in many patterns.

137
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,910
幸亏我没有把房子租出去
Oh, you know, thank god I didn't rent my place out.

138
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,660
有人说想在周末租我的房子  开价六百块
You know, someone offered me $600 for the weekend?

139
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,350
有人开价六百块租你的房子吗
Somebody offered you $600 to rent out your place?

140
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,890
是啊  我的公寓能看见游行全景
That's right. My apartment has a view of the whole parade.

141
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,060
人们愿意为此付钱
And people are willing to pay cash dollar money for that.

142
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,250
那就是说我的公寓也能看到值钱景色啦
So, that means my apartment has a cash dollar money view.

143
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,520
你听到了吗
Are you hearing this?

144
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,460
天啊
Oh... my god!

145
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,320
各位
Guys...

146
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,530
我刚收到了ED演讲的邀请
I just got invited to an EDtalk.

147
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,800
恭喜  这可是大事啊
Congratulations! This is huge!

148
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,590
太棒了
Wow, that's amazing!

149
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,150
如果知道那是什么  我会更加真诚的
If I knew what it was, I'd be more sincere.

150
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,880
加比  ED演讲
Gabi, an EDtalk

151
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,800
就是他们邀请非常成功的人士
is when they invite this extremely successful person

152
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,850
发表鼓舞人心的演讲  他们进行直播
to give this inspirational speech, and they livestream it.

153
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,940
如果火了  这可能改变一切
If it goes viral, this could be a game changer.

154
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,390
真有趣
Fun!

155
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,810
每段优秀的ED演讲都有令人震撼的一刻
Every great EDtalk has this moment that is so mind-blowing,

156
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,470
全体观众都会倒抽一口气
the entire audience gasps.

157
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,090
不止如此  我还有绝妙的开场笑话
I don't only have that, but I have a killer opening joke.

158
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,140
听好了
Check it.

159
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,060
为什么计算机下班回家以后精疲力尽
Why was the computer stressed out when it got home from work?

160
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,510
因为它开了很久车[有硬盘]
'Cause it had a hard drive.

161
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,960
罗杰  你先说  然后乔什跟上
Roger, you'll be speaking first, and then Josh will follow.

162
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,600
你们想要讲台升起还是降下去
Do you guys want the podium up or down?

163
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,940
我要升起
I'll go up.

164
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,970
我不要
Not me.

165
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,920
史蒂夫·乔布斯的讲台是降下去的
See, Steve Jobs had it down.

166
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,560
达赖喇嘛也是
Dalai Lama had it down.

167
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,060
乔什·卡明斯基也要降下去
And Josh Kaminski? He's gonna have it down.

168
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,590
我不想让我和观众之间有阻碍
I want nothing between me and my audience.

169
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,770
天啊
Oh, brother.

170
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,500
知道吗  各位
You know what, guys?

171
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,200
我为你们准备了小礼物
I got a little treat for you.

172
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,170
凑近点  我分享一下我的开场笑话
I want you to come close. I'm going to share my opening joke.

173
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,250
为什么计算机下班回家以后精疲力尽
Why was the computer stressed out when it got home?

174
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,450
因为它开了很久车[有硬盘]
'Cause it had a hard drive. Bam!

175
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,350
这玩意儿显然坏了
Well, this thing's obviously broken.

176
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,490
加比  已经三天了  料理机怎么还在
Gabi, it's been three days. Why is the blender still here?

177
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,980
记得你说过
Well, remember when you said

178
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,260
如果我能想办法不用房租
that if I could figure out a way to pay for the blender

179
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,950
付料理机的钱  就能留下它吗 
without using our rent money, I could keep it?

180
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,930
-记得  -我做到了
- Yeah. - Well, I did it!

181
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,450
你做了什么
You did what?

182
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,540
乔什周末不在家  去做演讲了
Well, Josh is away for the weekend doing some sort of talk.

183
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,520
他让我帮他看家
And he asked me to house sit.

184
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,550
-好的  -与此同时
- Okay. - Meanwhile,

185
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,190
我们自己家这里
over here at our place,

186
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,740
将举行骄傲游行
it's gay pride,

187
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,060
要是你家能看到游行现场
and if you have a view of the parade,

188
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,990
就能以六百元的价格租出去
you can rent out your place for $600.

189
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,410
猜猜我们能看到什么
And guess what we have?

190
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,180
游行现场
A view of the parade!

191
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,820
问题解决  能留下这台豪华料理机了
Problem solved, the fancy blender stays.

192
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,170
加比赢了
Gabi for the win.

193
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,180
加比  首先我得说
Gabi, first, let me say

194
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,010
我欣赏你的确想出了一个好办法
that I appreciate that you actually came up with a sensible plan.

195
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,360
我知道  我知道
I know. I know.

196
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,700
但是有一个问题
But there's just one problem.

197
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,600
我不想让陌生人住在我家
I don't want strangers staying in my place,

198
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,780
碰我的东西
touching my things,

199
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,580
睡在我床上  留下口水和...子孙
sleeping in my bed with their drool and their parts.

200
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,680
但是索菲亚...
But Sofia--

201
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,560
不行  加比  没人可以住在这
No, Gabbi, the answer is no. Nobody can stay here.

202
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,990
我们可能遇到了点麻烦
We may have a little bit of a situation.

203
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,030
你把我们的房子租出去了吗
You rent our apartment?

204
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,870
租给了特别好的人
To really cool people.

205
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,500
可能是吧
Probably.

206
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,750
你们好  听着  我很抱歉...
Hi. Listen, I'm really sorry--

207
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,230
-你好  -你好
- Hi. - Hi.

208
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,820
-她们就这么进来了  -你好
- And they're in. - Hi.

209
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,990
-我叫萨姆  -我叫格蕾茜
- I'm Sam. - And I'm Gracie.

210
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,310
你们家真漂亮
This place is so cute.

211
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,780
跟照片上的一样
Just like all the pictures.

212
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,970
这算不上是个阳台
Well, this is hardly a veranda.

213
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,050
幸运地是  你们家能看到这次游行
Luckily, you guys have a view of the parade.

214
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,900
她弟弟是这次游行的大礼官
Her brother's the grand marshal.

215
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,520
天呐  索菲亚也有一个基佬弟弟
Oh, my God! Sofia has a gay brother, too!

216
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,110
基佬兄弟们万岁
Yay for gay brothers!

217
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,600
我也不想破坏大家的兴致
Okay, well, I hate to break it to everybody,

218
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,770
但是作为这间房子的共同居住者
but as co-habitant of said apartment,

219
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,770
我的室友没有告诉我
I was not informed by the other co-habitant of this apartment

220
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,110
把房子转租给别人这件事
about this sub-leasing situation,

221
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,330
所以我得请你们离开
so I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

222
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,490
不是吧  你的室友有没有告诉你我们签了合同
Really? Well, did your co-habitant tell you we have a contract?

223
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,570
你签了合同吗
You signed a contract?

224
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,680
对  可是你挺喜欢合同的啊
Yeah, but you love contracts!

225
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,370
我...气死我了  都不知道该从哪说起了
I-- I'm so mad right now, I don't even know where to start.

226
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,990
索菲亚  冷静一下好吗  我有别的办法
Sofia, hang on, okay? I have another idea.

227
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,480
既然你不愿意让她们住在这  她们也不想走
Since you don't want them here, and they don't want to leave,

228
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,250
不如给她们升个房
how about we upgrade them

229
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,870
住到我老板的高层豪华公寓怎么样
to my boss' deluxe apartment in the sky?

230
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,690
这主意不错
That sounds so amazing!

231
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,510
不不不  我不想住高层
No, no, no, I don't want to be in the sky.

232
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,960
我想在这里看游行
I want to be here with the view of the parade.

233
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,480
不是吧  现在你把乔什的房子给她们住吗
Seriously, so now you're just offering Josh's apartment?

234
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,630
真不敢相信  加比
I-- I can't believe you, Gabi.

235
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,840
你猜怎么着  我...
You know what? I--

236
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,270
事实上  你的确做得出这种事
Actually, I can believe it!

237
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,410
因为你一直做这样的事情
Because you do things like this all the time!

238
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,440
如果你不总是拒绝我的话
Well, I wouldn't do things like this all the time

239
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,580
我也不会一直做这种事
if you didn't always say no.

240
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,700
要是你不像个不负责任的孩子
I wouldn't have to say no, Gabi,

241
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,490
加比  我也不会拒绝你
if you weren't acting like an irresponsible child.

242
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,180
天呐  你什么时候变得那么严厉
Oh, my God. When did you get such a stick up your ass?

243
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,610
不知道  或许是你逼我的
I don't know, maybe you put it there without asking me.

244
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,200
这是怎么了  索菲亚
What's happening, Sofia?

245
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,270
我们以前很开心  一起出去玩  一起做傻事
We used to have fun and hang out and do stupid stuff together.

246
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,760
我们成熟了  加比
We grew up, Gabi,

247
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,160
至少我成熟了
Or at least I did.

248
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,360
要是成熟意味着像你一样  那我宁愿不成熟
Well, if growing up means acting like you, then I don't want to.

249
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,820
这正是问题的关键
And that's exactly the point.

250
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,800
我成熟了  而你没有
I've grown up, and you haven't.

251
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,620
或许事实上我们越来越疏远了
So, maybe the truth is we've just actually grown apart.

252
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,890
也许是这样
Oh, well, maybe we have.

253
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,490
抱歉让你们目睹这一切
I'm sorry you had to see that.

254
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,570
没关系
Oh, it's okay.

255
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,490
我们刚在车里也为这吵了一架
We just had the same argument in the car.

256
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,080
我和她越来越疏远了
I'm growing apart from her?

257
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,930
我是满脑子蠢主意的孩子吗
I'm a child with stupid ideas?

258
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,990
看看这蠢不蠢
Well, how stupid is this?

259
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,750
蠢得太赞了
Stupid awesome!

260
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,620
天呐
Oh, my God.

261
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,790
真高兴我决定跟你一起来这
I am so glad I decided to come with you.

262
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,070
是啊
Yeah, you are.

263
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,700
谢谢你让我住在...我的家里
Thank you so much for letting me stay in... my apartment.

264
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,290
希望我严厉的性格不会吓到你
I hope the stick up my ass doesn't get in your way.

265
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,890
别这么说
Oh, please.

266
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,650
以格蕾茜指出的我的严厉之处[屁股上的棍子]
With all the sticks Gracie's told me I have up my ass,

267
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,460
都够我开个冰棍厂了
I could start a popsicle factory.

268
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,310
天呐  你旅行还自带杯垫吗
Oh, my God. You travel with your own coasters?

269
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,490
是的  是不是很疯狂
Yeah, is that crazy?

270
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,930
疯得太棒了
It's crazy awesome!

271
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,860
我从来没到过这么高的地方[这么嗨过]
I've never been this high before.

272
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,150
开玩笑的  我绝对有过
Just kidding. I totally have.

273
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,780
真好笑
That's really funny.

274
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,760
索菲亚也说过这样的笑话
You know, Sofia used to make jokes like that.

275
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,370
现在她唯一说的笑话就是
Now, the only joke she makes is,

276
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,570
"砰砰  谁在敲门
"Knock, knock. Who's there?

277
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,030
闭嘴  我们分手[碎]了"
Shut up, we're broke."

278
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,900
上周  加比...
And last week, Gabi--

279
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,940
加比给我发短信了
Oh, it's Gabi texting me.

280
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,910
或许是想道歉
Probably wanting to apologize.

281
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,570
不  是一张她屁股的照片
Nope, it's just a picture of her butt.

282
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,120
你想让她回来吗
You want to get her back?

283
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,510
别理她  做个成熟的人
Ignore her. Be the bigger person.

284
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,390
我怎么没早点遇到你
Where have you been all my life?

285
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,530
她们回你的短信了吗
What did they text back?

286
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,460
没  她们想不出如何反驳
Nothing. They can't think of a comeback.

287
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,520
-她们真没劲  -是啊
- They're so boring. - I know.

288
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,260
你知道什么有意思吗
Hey, you know what's not boring?

289
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,000
优惠券
Couponing!

290
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,480
-玛格丽塔酒  -没错
- Margaritas! - Yeah!

291
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,160
能休息一下真好
Oh, it's good to take a little break.

292
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,510
-你要休息了吗  -不  你呢
- Oh, you need a break? - No, do you?

293
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,780
-不用  -明白了
- No. - Gotcha.

294
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,430
我能每天都像这样参加派对
I could party like this every day.

295
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,860
我也是
Me too.

296
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,180
我的心脏要爆炸了
My heart feels like it's about to explode.

297
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,650
高兴激动的爆炸了
From all the fun and excitement.

298
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,520
我的脚也在抽筋
And my feet are throbbing.

299
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,570
跟着电子乐的节奏舞动
To the rhythm of the techno.

300
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,130
你猜怎么着  我们去换衣服吧
You know what? Let's go change outfits,

301
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,650
然后继续下去游行
So we can get back out there.

302
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,790
没错
You know it.

303
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,010
不过你还知道吗
But, you know what else?

304
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,190
我发现站在这能看到更多游行队伍
I'm noticing you get a better view of the parade from right here.

305
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,210
真好奇坐下来看会不会更好
I wonder if it's even better sitting down?

306
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,060
我看看
Let me see.

307
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,850
但就坐一小会
But just for a brief mo.

308
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,130
随着我们的生活日趋便捷
So, as our lives become easier,

309
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,100
为我们服务的计算机
The computers doing our jobs

310
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,920
才是需要诊疗的对象
will be the ones who'll need therapy.

311
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,680
有了我的算法  它们将会痊愈
And thanks to my algorithm, they'll be able to get it.

312
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,420
这让我想起一个笑话
Reminds me of a joke.

313
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,030
为什么计算机下班回家以后精疲力尽
Why was the computer stressed out when it got home from work?

314
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,760
因为它开了很久车[有硬盘]
'cause it had a hard drive.

315
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,600
你听到了吗
Did you hear that?

316
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,390
不  他剽窃了我的笑话
No. No, he stole my joke!

317
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,940
天啊  你说得好对
My gosh, you're so right.

318
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,470
喊几个朋友来玩真的能放松
Having a few friends over totally mellowed me out.

319
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,260
或者是因为这一大壶玛格丽塔酒
Or maybe it's the pitcher of margaritas?

320
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,820
这也有用
That too.

321
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,630
马上更多的朋友就要来了  真好玩
Oh, some more margarita drinkers are on their way up. Fun!

322
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,520
是我老板电话
Oh, it's my boss.

323
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,920
你带他们进来  我来对付他
You buzz your friends in, I'll handle this guy.

324
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,370
老板
Hey, boss.

325
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,460
加比  这就是灾难
Gabi, this is a disaster!

326
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,530
我想给艾略特打电话  但他不接
I'm trying to call Elliot, and he's not picking up.

327
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,370
怎么了
What's wrong?

328
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,300
在我前面发言的人剽窃了我笑话
The guy before me stole my joke!

329
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,010
什么  他为什么要剽窃那...
What? Why would he steal that...

330
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,680
那么棒的笑话
awesome joke.

331
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,700
就是因为它棒啊  加比
Because of its awesomeness, Gabi.

332
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,500
现在该我上台了
And now, I'm about to go on,

333
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,900
却发生了很奇怪的事
and something weird is happening to me.

334
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,900
我手在抖  开始出汗
My hands are shaking, I'm starting to sweat.

335
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,560
那只是怯场而已  好吗
Okay, well, it's just stage fright, okay?

336
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,690
谁都会这样的
It happens to everybody.

337
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:58,980
我不会
Not me.

338
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,900
我胸口好闷
Oh, wow, my chest is tight.

339
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,830
好  你深呼吸
Okay, just take a deep breath.

340
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,960
如果你演讲时候还紧张
If it gets bad during your talk,

341
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,960
就想象观众穿着内衣的样子
just picture the audience in their underwear.

342
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,780
开心果  该你上场了
Hey, funny man, you're on.

343
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,520
我要上场了
Oh, I gotta go on.

344
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,120
我就说该把口琴带来
I knew I should have brought my harmonica.

345
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,040
天啊  天啊
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!

346
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,500
格蕾茜
Gracie?

347
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,640
格蕾茜  你说会来几个朋友的
Gracie! Gracie, you said a few of your friends were coming up.

348
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,550
别急  剩下的马上就到
Oh, calm down. The rest will be here real soon.

349
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,210
下面请欢迎  乔什·卡明斯基
Please welcome to the ED stage, Josh Kaminski.

350
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,390
伙计  该你上了
Dude, you're on.

351
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,480
我说把讲台降下去的  算了
I said podium down! Oh, never mind.

352
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,970
大家好
Hi.

353
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,370
我是乔什·卡明斯基
I'm Josh Kaminski.

354
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,760
然后...
And, uh...

355
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,730
今天...我想跟大家聊聊...
today, I'd like to... talk to you about...

356
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,320
聊聊...
about...

357
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,430
真的管用
It worked.

358
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,220
今天我想跟大家聊聊
Today, I would like to talk to you

359
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,440
通向成功的不同途径
about alternate paths to success.

360
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,110
下去啊  小子
Down, boy.

361
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,220
我们如何衡量成功
How do we measure succ-sex?

362
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,310
嘿咻  嘿咻
Sex. Sex.

363
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,300
成功
Success.

364
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,800
很困难
Well, it's hard.

365
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,120
真的很困难  希望它没这么难[硬]
It is really hard. I wish it wasn't hard...

366
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,110
但就是难
But it is.

367
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,770
每个人都有自己的成功之路
We each have our own path.

368
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,370
路上是一马平川吗  未必
Is it straight? Not always.

369
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,630
这条路漫长吗  付出就有收获
Is it long? Everything's relative!

370
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,080
我要的可不是这种抽气声
Not the gasp I was hoping for.

371
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,960
真是险
What a rush.

372
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,760
不敢相信我以前从没用过优惠券
I can't believe I've never couponed before.

373
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,480
现在知道了吧
You would never know it.

374
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,150
谢谢你
Thank you.

375
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,170
你在干什么
What are you doing?

376
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,130
倒走属于我的清洁剂
Oh, just taking my share of the pine sol.

377
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,770
-你的吗  -对
- Your share? - Yeah.

378
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,540
是你买的  但我用优惠券帮你省了四毛钱
You bought it, but I saved you 40 cents with my coupon,

379
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,390
所以我要倒走四毛钱的
so just taking my 40 cents worth.

380
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,570
很公平
It's fair.

381
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,890
或许是公平
Well, it might be fair,

382
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,050
但你不觉得有点疯狂吗
but it's a little insane, don't you think?

383
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,390
我明白了
Oh, I get it.

384
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,340
是因为我没付你油钱
This is because I didn't pay you for gas.

385
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:51,880
不  才五个街区  我不会收你油钱的
Oh, no, no. I drove five blocks. I wouldn't charge you for gas.

386
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,200
可能你收了
Well, maybe if you did,

387
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,700
就不至于会在网上把房子
you wouldn't have to rent your house out to strangers

388
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,800
租给陌生人了
on the internet.

389
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,130
这是怎么回事
What's happening here?

390
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,540
我以为我们挺默契
I thought we were on the same page.

391
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,850
我头开始疼了
And I think I'm getting a headache.

392
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,490
你要阿司匹林吗
Oh, you want some aspirin?

393
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,850
好的  谢谢
Uh, yeah, thanks.

394
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,840
-给  -谢谢
- Here you go. - Thank you.

395
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,860
五毛七分钱
That'll be 57 cents.

396
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,660
你们知道真正有意思的是什么吗
Hey, you know what would be really fun?

397
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,680
所有人都滚蛋
If everybody left!

398
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,690
格蕾茜
Gracie!

399
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,070
加比
Gabi!

400
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,670
等等  你怎么还穿着胸罩
Wait, why are you still wearing a bra?

401
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,890
这里到底怎么回事
What the hell is happening?

402
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,460
你得让所有人都出去
You gotta get everybody out of here!

403
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,700
几个人而已啦
Oh, it's just a couple of people.

404
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,940
我朋友贾里德觉得你很可爱
And my friend Jared thinks you're really cute.

405
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,710
真的吗
Really?

406
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,890
不行
No!

407
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,960
你得让大家都离开
You gotta get everybody out.

408
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,790
等等  你怎么了
Wait, what's happening to you?

409
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,860
变得跟索菲亚一样
You're turning into such a Sofia.

410
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,910
索菲亚
Sofia?

411
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,820
我像索菲亚吗
I'm a Sofia?

412
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,170
如果我变得像索菲亚
If I'm turning into a Sofia,

413
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,590
那唯一的原因就是你像...
the only reason is because you're acting like a--

414
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,890
天啊
Oh, my god.

415
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,000
你刚才是连说了十二遍索菲亚吗
Did you just say "Sofia," like, 12 times?

416
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,040
还是我真的太醉了
Or am I really wasted?

417
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,820
天啊  是我老板
Oh, my god. Oh, my god, it's my boss!

418
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,330
救命
Help!

419
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,610
乔什  好安静对不对  你怎么了
Hey, Josh. Pretty quiet. What's going on there?

420
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:19,110
总而言之就是演讲没有预期的效果
Let's just say the ED talk didn't go as planned.

421
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,740
我要回家了
I'm coming home.

422
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,990
什么  回家吗
What? Home?

423
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,050
乔什  肯定没事的  是你对自己太严厉
Josh, I'm sure it was fine. You're always so hard on yourself.

424
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,880
你根本想不到
You have no idea.

425
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,190
我马上就走
I'm leaving right now.

426
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,860
但今天不是周日啊  你说周日回来
But-- but it's not Sunday, and you said Sunday.

427
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,540
加比  我只想蜷在床上
Gabi, all I wanna do is crawl into my bed

428
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,670
再也不见任何人
and never see anyone ever again.

429
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,330
半小时后见
See you in 30 minutes.

430
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,310
天啊
Oh, god...

431
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,540
请帮帮我
Please help.

432
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,440
告诉我个把那些人赶走的办法
Show me a way to get those people out of there

433
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,790
我发誓我每周都会去教堂
and I promise I'll go to church every week.

434
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,850
每隔一周吧
Every other week.

435
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,090
索菲亚  你怎么来了
Sofia, what are you doing here?

436
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,790
那个萨姆太神经了
That Sam was wound way too tight.

437
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,630
对  格蕾茜也疯了
Yeah, and Gracie is out of control.

438
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,000
她办了个派对  乔什已经在回来的路上
She threw a party, and now Josh is on his way here,

439
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,580
屋子里有好多人
and there's like a gazillion people in there,

440
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,830
他们都不肯走
and they won't leave!

441
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,710
这都怪我  我要丢工作了  你得帮我
This is all my fault. I'm gonna lose my job. You gotta help me.

442
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,600
或许我是很严厉[屁股上有棍子]
Well, I might have a stick up my ass,

443
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,980
但他们屁股上也要有脚印了
But they're about to have a foot up theirs.

444
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,970
索菲亚  你该怎么办
Sofia, I don't know what you're gonna do.

445
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,670
这些人都彻底玩疯了
I mean, these people are totally out of control!

446
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,420
我们不可能赶得走他们
We're never gonna get them out of here.

447
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,730
各位
People!

448
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,240
在下索菲亚·玛利亚·康斯薇拉
I am Sofia Maria Consuela

449
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,590
拉斐尔·罗德里格斯
Rafaella Rodriguez,

450
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,080
你们该走了
And you're done!

451
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,600
怎么回事
What's going on?

452
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,330
不要  乔什  人家订婚了
No, Josh, I'm engaged.

453
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,730
怎么了
What's happening?

454
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,950
天啊  我们错过了
Oh, god. We missed it.

455
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,420
游行真的是与我们擦肩而过
The parade has literally passed us by.

456
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,700
艾略特  我要说实话
Elliot, I have a confession to make.

457
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,760
这个周末太累人了
This holiday is exhausting.

458
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,170
上帝造人  就不是让他们跳舞十分钟以上的
Man wasn't made to dance for more than 10 minutes.

459
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,450
这种庆典该有能坐的地方
Celebrations should have places to sit.

460
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,270
面对现实吧
Let's face it,

461
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,020
我们老了
we're old.

462
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,200
没错
Yes.

463
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,280
但是  本着骄傲的精神
But, in the spirit of pride,

464
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,350
我们要展现真实的自己
let's be honest about who we are.

465
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,030
我们老了  累了  你们接受吧
We're old! We're tired! Get used to it!

466
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,280
老了才不好  干什么都很难
It doesn't get any better! It gets harder!

467
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,890
我染头发
I dye my hair!

468
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,990
我戴假发
I buy mine!

469
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,950
-乔什  -怎么了
- Hi, Josh. - Hey, what's up?

470
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,100
没有  没什么
Nothing! Nothing's up.

471
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,990
真是噩梦
What a nightmare.

472
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,220
还用说
Tell me about it.

473
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,970
这周末本该很棒的
This weekend was supposed to be so great.

474
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,630
结果成了灾难
It turned into a disaster.

475
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,090
-没错  -绝对的
- I hear you. - Totally get it.

476
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,460
我从没觉得自己这么赤裸又脆弱过
I have never felt so naked and exposed.

477
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,740
还有伤心
And sad.

478
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,230
孤独
And alone.

479
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,850
就像是你以为知道自己在做什么
It's like you think you know what you're doing.

480
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,930
计划好了一切
You got it all planned out.

481
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,950
对  你知道计划不是坏事
Yeah, but you know there's nothing wrong with planning.

482
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,240
有计划是好的
Planning can be good.

483
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,190
然后凭空出现了个东西
And then something pops up out of nowhere

484
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,440
让你猝不及防
and takes you completely by surprise.

485
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,870
但惊喜也没什么不对
But there's nothing wrong with surprises.

486
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,760
惊喜可以很有趣
You know, surprises can be fun.

487
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,750
但你知道什么很棒吗
But, hey, you know what's great?

488
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:21,910
能回到家
Being able to come home

489
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,560
跟让你觉得舒心的人在一起
and be with people who make you feel good.

490
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,410
我好想你
Oh, I missed you so much!

491
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,990
我更想你
I missed you more!

492
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,490
我才离开三小时啊
I've only been gone like three hours.

493
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,710
我好爱你
I love you so much!

494
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,680
我更爱你
I love you more!

495
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,280
这样真好
This is nice.

496
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,040
很鼓舞人心
This is uplifting.

497
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,610
可能有点太鼓舞了
Maybe a little too uplifting.

498
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,700
别又来啊  别又来
Not again, not again, not again...

499
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,830
艾略特  我的演讲彻底失败了
Elliot, my speech was a complete failure.

500
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,280
演讲是失败
Your speech was,

501
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,660
但你的神曲可成功了
But your song's a raging success.

502
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,930
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

503
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,100
作为你的公关  我自己动手
As your publicist, I took matters into my own hands

504
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,650
扭转了局面
to get in front of the story.

505
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,500
大家好  我是乔什·卡明斯基
Hi, I'm Josh Kaminski.

506
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,240
我们如何衡量成功
How do we measure success?

507
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,920
它很困难  困难  困难
Well, it's hard, hard, hard.

508
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,580
真的很困难  希望它没这么难
Really hard. I wish it wasn't hard,

509
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,600
但就是难
but it is.

510
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,990
生活中  你要自己动手  动手
In life, you have to be hands on, hands on,

511
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,600
你要自己动手  动手
you have to be hands on, hands on.

512
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,770
这真棒  你一定忙了很久吧
I mean, that's really good. That must've taken you forever.

513
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,290
没错  可困难了
Yeah. It was really hard.

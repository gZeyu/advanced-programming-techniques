早上好
Good morning.

70
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,130
早上...
Good mor--

71
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,540
很好吃  對吧
Yeah, it's good, right?

72
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,530
這是手做杏仁奶油
It's artisanal almond butter.

73
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,920
首先  我覺得這很厲害
Well, "A", I'm really impressed

74
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,820
你居然知道怎么用"手做"這個詞
that you know how to use the word "artisanal."

75
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,250
其次  杏仁奶油  
And "B", umm, almond butter?

76
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,260
一罐要十五塊呢  我們吃不起
It's $15 a jar! We can't afford it!

77
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,640
靠這個就行了
Not with this.

78
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,090
所以你買了臺六百塊的料理機
Oh, okay, so you bought a $600 Vitamix

79
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,180
來做十五塊的杏仁奶油嗎
to make $15 worth of almond butter?

80
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,090
是啊
Yup.

81
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,220
我打算開始新業務
I'm starting this new thing

82
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,940
制作不同種類的果仁奶油
where I make different types of nut butters,

83
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,940
然后在灣區的農貿市場出售
and I sell them at farmers markets all over the bay area.

84
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,490
是嗎
Are ya?

85
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,520
是的
Yes, I are.

86
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,520
你真是瘋了[堅果]
Aww, you're nuts.

87
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,290
我可以拿這句話做廣告呢
Hey, that could be my catchphrase.

88
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,670
加比  你知道買堅果  罐子  
Gabi, do you have any idea how much it would cost to buy the nuts,

89
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,440
絲帶  標簽  保險  還有銷售許可證
the jars, the ribbons, the tag, the insurance,

90
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,340
需要多少錢嗎
let alone the permits for selling?

91
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,120
我有個主意
Oh, I have an idea!

92
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,130
我們來發明計算機吧
Let's invent the computer.

93
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,740
不不不  必須碾壓創新
Oh, no, no, no! It's important that innovation be crushed!

94
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,250
加比  我不想碾壓你的夢想
Gabi, I'm not trying to crush your dreams.

95
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,730
只是我們沒有錢
It's just that money is, you know-- we don't have any.

96
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,030
所以這個主意完全不現實
So, this idea is just totally unrealistic.

97
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,280
"這個主意完全不現實"
"This idea is totally unrealistic."

98
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,590
我跟你說吧
I'll tell you what.

99
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,930
-我對你買料理機沒意見  -好
- I'll be fine with you buying this-- - Yes.

100
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,270
前提是你以"一分都沒"回答下一個問題
...if you answer "none" to the following question.

101
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,240
我們還有十一天就要交房租了
How much of our rent, which is due in 11 days,

102
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,220
你花了多少租金買這六百塊的料理機
have you spent on this $600 blender?

103
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,900
夢想終結者
Dream crusher.

104
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,150
早上好  姑娘
Morning, girl.

105
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,600
怎么了
What's the matter?

106
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,550
索菲亞想讓我退了這臺料理機  
Sofia wants me to return this Vitamix,

107
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,630
但人家真的好想要
but I really want it.

108
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,730
我還想跟丹澤爾和勒布朗3P呢
Yeah, well, I wand to he the meat in a Denzel-LeBron sandwich,

109
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,430
但我們不會一直如愿
but we don't always get what we want.

110
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,520
有時候會因為嘗試而被逮捕
And sometimes, we get arrested trying.

111
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,340
瞧瞧我為同志驕傲周末買的衣服
Check out the outfit I got for gay pride weekend.

112
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,030
你想把他們嚇直嗎
You trying to scare them straight?

113
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,140
瞧瞧我要穿的
Look what I'm wearing.

114
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,990
那輛游行花車為什么帶著你的假發啊
Why is that parade float wearing your wig?

115
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,910
那是我啦
That's me!

116
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,800
你為什么去同志驕傲節啊
Why are you going to pride?

117
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,300
還記得你騙我扮成了
Oh, remember when you tricked me into

118
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,070
變裝賓果游戲主持人嗎
being a drag queen bingo host?

119
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,290
真好玩
Ha, that was funny.

120
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,360
現在我成了同志偶像
Well, now, I am a gay icon.

121
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,080
全城都有男人請我喝酒
I got men buying me drinks all over town.

122
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,580
因為他們覺得你是男人
Because they think you're a man.

123
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,410
如果12碼的鞋能穿上的話
Well, if the size 12 shoe fits.

124
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,520
我有個想法
Hey, here's a thought.

125
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,190
埃蘭出城了  不如我們一起去吧
Since Allan's out of town, why don't we go together?

126
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,320
我想慶祝的是驕傲  不是羞恥
I want to celebrate pride. Not shame.

127
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,800
不  尤蘭達  想想吧
No. Yolanda, think about it.

128
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,270
我是個超棒的公關
I'm an amazing publicist.

129
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,250
我可以搞到節前派對
I can get us invites to the pre-party,

130
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,120
游行派對和節后派對的邀請
the parade party, and the post-party.

131
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,030
你可以為我們搞到免費的酒
You can get us free drinks.

132
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,160
我們會是驕傲游行上最受歡迎的一對
We'll be the most popular pair of people at the pride parade.

133
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,810
我喜歡
Ooh, I like it.

134
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,770
我的公寓位于活動中心
And my apartment sits in the center of all the action,

135
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,990
我們可以每場派對都穿不同的衣服了
so we can change outfits for every event!

136
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,900
真棒  這內褲我有好多不同的圖案
Perfect! I own this in many patterns.

137
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,910
幸虧我沒有把房子租出去
Oh, you know, thank god I didn't rent my place out.

138
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,660
有人說想在周末租我的房子  開價六百塊
You know, someone offered me $600 for the weekend?

139
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,350
有人開價六百塊租你的房子嗎
Somebody offered you $600 to rent out your place?

140
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,890
是啊  我的公寓能看見游行全景
That's right. My apartment has a view of the whole parade.

141
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,060
人們愿意為此付錢
And people are willing to pay cash dollar money for that.

142
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,250
那就是說我的公寓也能看到值錢景色啦
So, that means my apartment has a cash dollar money view.

143
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,520
你聽到了嗎
Are you hearing this?

144
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,460
天啊
Oh... my god!

145
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,320
各位
Guys...

146
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,530
我剛收到了ED演講的邀請
I just got invited to an EDtalk.

147
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,800
恭喜  這可是大事啊
Congratulations! This is huge!

148
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,590
太棒了
Wow, that's amazing!

149
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,150
如果知道那是什么  我會更加真誠的
If I knew what it was, I'd be more sincere.

150
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,880
加比  ED演講
Gabi, an EDtalk

151
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,800
就是他們邀請非常成功的人士
is when they invite this extremely successful person

152
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,850
發表鼓舞人心的演講  他們進行直播
to give this inspirational speech, and they livestream it.

153
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,940
如果火了  這可能改變一切
If it goes viral, this could be a game changer.

154
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,390
真有趣
Fun!

155
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,810
每段優秀的ED演講都有令人震撼的一刻
Every great EDtalk has this moment that is so mind-blowing,

156
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,470
全體觀眾都會倒抽一口氣
the entire audience gasps.

157
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,090
不止如此  我還有絕妙的開場笑話
I don't only have that, but I have a killer opening joke.

158
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,140
聽好了
Check it.

159
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,060
為什么計算機下班回家以后精疲力盡
Why was the computer stressed out when it got home from work?

160
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,510
因為它開了很久車[有硬盤]
'Cause it had a hard drive.

161
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,960
羅杰  你先說  然后喬什跟上
Roger, you'll be speaking first, and then Josh will follow.

162
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,600
你們想要講臺升起還是降下去
Do you guys want the podium up or down?

163
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,940
我要升起
I'll go up.

164
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,970
我不要
Not me.

165
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,920
史蒂夫·喬布斯的講臺是降下去的
See, Steve Jobs had it down.

166
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,560
達賴喇嘛也是
Dalai Lama had it down.

167
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,060
喬什·卡明斯基也要降下去
And Josh Kaminski? He's gonna have it down.

168
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,590
我不想讓我和觀眾之間有阻礙
I want nothing between me and my audience.

169
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,770
天啊
Oh, brother.

170
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,500
知道嗎  各位
You know what, guys?

171
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,200
我為你們準備了小禮物
I got a little treat for you.

172
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,170
湊近點  我分享一下我的開場笑話
I want you to come close. I'm going to share my opening joke.

173
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,250
為什么計算機下班回家以后精疲力盡
Why was the computer stressed out when it got home?

174
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,450
因為它開了很久車[有硬盤]
'Cause it had a hard drive. Bam!

175
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,350
這玩意兒顯然壞了
Well, this thing's obviously broken.

176
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,490
加比  已經三天了  料理機怎么還在
Gabi, it's been three days. Why is the blender still here?

177
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,980
記得你說過
Well, remember when you said

178
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,260
如果我能想辦法不用房租
that if I could figure out a way to pay for the blender

179
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,950
付料理機的錢  就能留下它嗎 
without using our rent money, I could keep it?

180
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,930
-記得  -我做到了
- Yeah. - Well, I did it!

181
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,450
你做了什么
You did what?

182
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,540
喬什周末不在家  去做演講了
Well, Josh is away for the weekend doing some sort of talk.

183
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,520
他讓我幫他看家
And he asked me to house sit.

184
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,550
-好的  -與此同時
- Okay. - Meanwhile,

185
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,190
我們自己家這里
over here at our place,

186
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,740
將舉行驕傲游行
it's gay pride,

187
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,060
要是你家能看到游行現場
and if you have a view of the parade,

188
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,990
就能以六百元的價格租出去
you can rent out your place for $600.

189
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,410
猜猜我們能看到什么
And guess what we have?

190
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,180
游行現場
A view of the parade!

191
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,820
問題解決  能留下這臺豪華料理機了
Problem solved, the fancy blender stays.

192
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,170
加比贏了
Gabi for the win.

193
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,180
加比  首先我得說
Gabi, first, let me say

194
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,010
我欣賞你的確想出了一個好辦法
that I appreciate that you actually came up with a sensible plan.

195
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,360
我知道  我知道
I know. I know.

196
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,700
但是有一個問題
But there's just one problem.

197
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,600
我不想讓陌生人住在我家
I don't want strangers staying in my place,

198
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,780
碰我的東西
touching my things,

199
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,580
睡在我床上  留下口水和...子孫
sleeping in my bed with their drool and their parts.

200
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,680
但是索菲亞...
But Sofia--

201
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,560
不行  加比  沒人可以住在這
No, Gabbi, the answer is no. Nobody can stay here.

202
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,990
我們可能遇到了點麻煩
We may have a little bit of a situation.

203
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,030
你把我們的房子租出去了嗎
You rent our apartment?

204
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,870
租給了特別好的人
To really cool people.

205
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,500
可能是吧
Probably.

206
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,750
你們好  聽著  我很抱歉...
Hi. Listen, I'm really sorry--

207
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,230
-你好  -你好
- Hi. - Hi.

208
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,820
-她們就這么進來了  -你好
- And they're in. - Hi.

209
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,990
-我叫薩姆  -我叫格蕾茜
- I'm Sam. - And I'm Gracie.

210
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,310
你們家真漂亮
This place is so cute.

211
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,780
跟照片上的一樣
Just like all the pictures.

212
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,970
這算不上是個陽臺
Well, this is hardly a veranda.

213
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,050
幸運地是  你們家能看到這次游行
Luckily, you guys have a view of the parade.

214
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,900
她弟弟是這次游行的大禮官
Her brother's the grand marshal.

215
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,520
天吶  索菲亞也有一個基佬弟弟
Oh, my God! Sofia has a gay brother, too!

216
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,110
基佬兄弟們萬歲
Yay for gay brothers!

217
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,600
我也不想破壞大家的興致
Okay, well, I hate to break it to everybody,

218
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,770
但是作為這間房子的共同居住者
but as co-habitant of said apartment,

219
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,770
我的室友沒有告訴我
I was not informed by the other co-habitant of this apartment

220
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,110
把房子轉租給別人這件事
about this sub-leasing situation,

221
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,330
所以我得請你們離開
so I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

222
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,490
不是吧  你的室友有沒有告訴你我們簽了合同
Really? Well, did your co-habitant tell you we have a contract?

223
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,570
你簽了合同嗎
You signed a contract?

224
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,680
對  可是你挺喜歡合同的啊
Yeah, but you love contracts!

225
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,370
我...氣死我了  都不知道該從哪說起了
I-- I'm so mad right now, I don't even know where to start.

226
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,990
索菲亞  冷靜一下好嗎  我有別的辦法
Sofia, hang on, okay? I have another idea.

227
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,480
既然你不愿意讓她們住在這  她們也不想走
Since you don't want them here, and they don't want to leave,

228
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,250
不如給她們升個房
how about we upgrade them

229
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,870
住到我老板的高層豪華公寓怎么樣
to my boss' deluxe apartment in the sky?

230
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,690
這主意不錯
That sounds so amazing!

231
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,510
不不不  我不想住高層
No, no, no, I don't want to be in the sky.

232
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,960
我想在這里看游行
I want to be here with the view of the parade.

233
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,480
不是吧  現在你把喬什的房子給她們住嗎
Seriously, so now you're just offering Josh's apartment?

234
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,630
真不敢相信  加比
I-- I can't believe you, Gabi.

235
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,840
你猜怎么著  我...
You know what? I--

236
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,270
事實上  你的確做得出這種事
Actually, I can believe it!

237
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,410
因為你一直做這樣的事情
Because you do things like this all the time!

238
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,440
如果你不總是拒絕我的話
Well, I wouldn't do things like this all the time

239
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,580
我也不會一直做這種事
if you didn't always say no.

240
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,700
要是你不像個不負責任的孩子
I wouldn't have to say no, Gabi,

241
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,490
加比  我也不會拒絕你
if you weren't acting like an irresponsible child.

242
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,180
天吶  你什么時候變得那么嚴厲
Oh, my God. When did you get such a stick up your ass?

243
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,610
不知道  或許是你逼我的
I don't know, maybe you put it there without asking me.

244
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,200
這是怎么了  索菲亞
What's happening, Sofia?

245
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,270
我們以前很開心  一起出去玩  一起做傻事
We used to have fun and hang out and do stupid stuff together.

246
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,760
我們成熟了  加比
We grew up, Gabi,

247
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,160
至少我成熟了
Or at least I did.

248
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,360
要是成熟意味著像你一樣  那我寧愿不成熟
Well, if growing up means acting like you, then I don't want to.

249
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,820
這正是問題的關鍵
And that's exactly the point.

250
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,800
我成熟了  而你沒有
I've grown up, and you haven't.

251
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,620
或許事實上我們越來越疏遠了
So, maybe the truth is we've just actually grown apart.

252
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,890
也許是這樣
Oh, well, maybe we have.

253
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,490
抱歉讓你們目睹這一切
I'm sorry you had to see that.

254
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,570
沒關系
Oh, it's okay.

255
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,490
我們剛在車里也為這吵了一架
We just had the same argument in the car.

256
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,080
我和她越來越疏遠了
I'm growing apart from her?

257
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,930
我是滿腦子蠢主意的孩子嗎
I'm a child with stupid ideas?

258
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,990
看看這蠢不蠢
Well, how stupid is this?

259
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,750
蠢得太贊了
Stupid awesome!

260
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,620
天吶
Oh, my God.

261
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,790
真高興我決定跟你一起來這
I am so glad I decided to come with you.

262
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,070
是啊
Yeah, you are.

263
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,700
謝謝你讓我住在...我的家里
Thank you so much for letting me stay in... my apartment.

264
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,290
希望我嚴厲的性格不會嚇到你
I hope the stick up my ass doesn't get in your way.

265
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,890
別這么說
Oh, please.

266
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,650
以格蕾茜指出的我的嚴厲之處[屁股上的棍子]
With all the sticks Gracie's told me I have up my ass,

267
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,460
都夠我開個冰棍廠了
I could start a popsicle factory.

268
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,310
天吶  你旅行還自帶杯墊嗎
Oh, my God. You travel with your own coasters?

269
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,490
是的  是不是很瘋狂
Yeah, is that crazy?

270
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,930
瘋得太棒了
It's crazy awesome!

271
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,860
我從來沒到過這么高的地方[這么嗨過]
I've never been this high before.

272
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,150
開玩笑的  我絕對有過
Just kidding. I totally have.

273
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,780
真好笑
That's really funny.

274
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,760
索菲亞也說過這樣的笑話
You know, Sofia used to make jokes like that.

275
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,370
現在她唯一說的笑話就是
Now, the only joke she makes is,

276
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,570
"砰砰  誰在敲門
"Knock, knock. Who's there?

277
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,030
閉嘴  我們分手[碎]了"
Shut up, we're broke."

278
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,900
上周  加比...
And last week, Gabi--

279
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,940
加比給我發短信了
Oh, it's Gabi texting me.

280
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,910
或許是想道歉
Probably wanting to apologize.

281
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,570
不  是一張她屁股的照片
Nope, it's just a picture of her butt.

282
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,120
你想讓她回來嗎
You want to get her back?

283
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,510
別理她  做個成熟的人
Ignore her. Be the bigger person.

284
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,390
我怎么沒早點遇到你
Where have you been all my life?

285
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,530
她們回你的短信了嗎
What did they text back?

286
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,460
沒  她們想不出如何反駁
Nothing. They can't think of a comeback.

287
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,520
-她們真沒勁  -是啊
- They're so boring. - I know.

288
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,260
你知道什么有意思嗎
Hey, you know what's not boring?

289
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,000
優惠券
Couponing!

290
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,480
-瑪格麗塔酒  -沒錯
- Margaritas! - Yeah!

291
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,160
能休息一下真好
Oh, it's good to take a little break.

292
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,510
-你要休息了嗎  -不  你呢
- Oh, you need a break? - No, do you?

293
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,780
-不用  -明白了
- No. - Gotcha.

294
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,430
我能每天都像這樣參加派對
I could party like this every day.

295
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,860
我也是
Me too.

296
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,180
我的心臟要爆炸了
My heart feels like it's about to explode.

297
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,650
高興激動的爆炸了
From all the fun and excitement.

298
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,520
我的腳也在抽筋
And my feet are throbbing.

299
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,570
跟著電子樂的節奏舞動
To the rhythm of the techno.

300
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,130
你猜怎么著  我們去換衣服吧
You know what? Let's go change outfits,

301
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,650
然后繼續下去游行
So we can get back out there.

302
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,790
沒錯
You know it.

303
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,010
不過你還知道嗎
But, you know what else?

304
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,190
我發現站在這能看到更多游行隊伍
I'm noticing you get a better view of the parade from right here.

305
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,210
真好奇坐下來看會不會更好
I wonder if it's even better sitting down?

306
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,060
我看看
Let me see.

307
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,850
但就坐一小會
But just for a brief mo.

308
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,130
隨著我們的生活日趨便捷
So, as our lives become easier,

309
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,100
為我們服務的計算機
The computers doing our jobs

310
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,920
才是需要診療的對象
will be the ones who'll need therapy.

311
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,680
有了我的算法  它們將會痊愈
And thanks to my algorithm, they'll be able to get it.

312
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,420
這讓我想起一個笑話
Reminds me of a joke.

313
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,030
為什么計算機下班回家以后精疲力盡
Why was the computer stressed out when it got home from work?

314
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,760
因為它開了很久車[有硬盤]
'cause it had a hard drive.

315
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,600
你聽到了嗎
Did you hear that?

316
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,390
不  他剽竊了我的笑話
No. No, he stole my joke!

317
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,940
天啊  你說得好對
My gosh, you're so right.

318
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,470
喊幾個朋友來玩真的能放松
Having a few friends over totally mellowed me out.

319
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,260
或者是因為這一大壺瑪格麗塔酒
Or maybe it's the pitcher of margaritas?

320
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,820
這也有用
That too.

321
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,630
馬上更多的朋友就要來了  真好玩
Oh, some more margarita drinkers are on their way up. Fun!

322
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,520
是我老板電話
Oh, it's my boss.

323
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,920
你帶他們進來  我來對付他
You buzz your friends in, I'll handle this guy.

324
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,370
老板
Hey, boss.

325
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,460
加比  這就是災難
Gabi, this is a disaster!

326
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,530
我想給艾略特打電話  但他不接
I'm trying to call Elliot, and he's not picking up.

327
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,370
怎么了
What's wrong?

328
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,300
在我前面發言的人剽竊了我笑話
The guy before me stole my joke!

329
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,010
什么  他為什么要剽竊那...
What? Why would he steal that...

330
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,680
那么棒的笑話
awesome joke.

331
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,700
就是因為它棒啊  加比
Because of its awesomeness, Gabi.

332
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,500
現在該我上臺了
And now, I'm about to go on,

333
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,900
卻發生了很奇怪的事
and something weird is happening to me.

334
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,900
我手在抖  開始出汗
My hands are shaking, I'm starting to sweat.

335
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,560
那只是怯場而已  好嗎
Okay, well, it's just stage fright, okay?

336
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,690
誰都會這樣的
It happens to everybody.

337
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:58,980
我不會
Not me.

338
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,900
我胸口好悶
Oh, wow, my chest is tight.

339
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,830
好  你深呼吸
Okay, just take a deep breath.

340
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,960
如果你演講時候還緊張
If it gets bad during your talk,

341
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,960
就想象觀眾穿著內衣的樣子
just picture the audience in their underwear.

342
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,780
開心果  該你上場了
Hey, funny man, you're on.

343
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,520
我要上場了
Oh, I gotta go on.

344
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,120
我就說該把口琴帶來
I knew I should have brought my harmonica.

345
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,040
天啊  天啊
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!

346
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,500
格蕾茜
Gracie?

347
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,640
格蕾茜  你說會來幾個朋友的
Gracie! Gracie, you said a few of your friends were coming up.

348
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,550
別急  剩下的馬上就到
Oh, calm down. The rest will be here real soon.

349
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,210
下面請歡迎  喬什·卡明斯基
Please welcome to the ED stage, Josh Kaminski.

350
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,390
伙計  該你上了
Dude, you're on.

351
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,480
我說把講臺降下去的  算了
I said podium down! Oh, never mind.

352
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,970
大家好
Hi.

353
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,370
我是喬什·卡明斯基
I'm Josh Kaminski.

354
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,760
然后...
And, uh...

355
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,730
今天...我想跟大家聊聊...
today, I'd like to... talk to you about...

356
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,320
聊聊...
about...

357
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,430
真的管用
It worked.

358
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,220
今天我想跟大家聊聊
Today, I would like to talk to you

359
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,440
通向成功的不同途徑
about alternate paths to success.

360
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,110
下去啊  小子
Down, boy.

361
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,220
我們如何衡量成功
How do we measure succ-sex?

362
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,310
嘿咻  嘿咻
Sex. Sex.

363
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,300
成功
Success.

364
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,800
很困難
Well, it's hard.

365
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,120
真的很困難  希望它沒這么難[硬]
It is really hard. I wish it wasn't hard...

366
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,110
但就是難
But it is.

367
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,770
每個人都有自己的成功之路
We each have our own path.

368
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,370
路上是一馬平川嗎  未必
Is it straight? Not always.

369
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,630
這條路漫長嗎  付出就有收獲
Is it long? Everything's relative!

370
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,080
我要的可不是這種抽氣聲
Not the gasp I was hoping for.

371
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,960
真是險
What a rush.

372
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,760
不敢相信我以前從沒用過優惠券
I can't believe I've never couponed before.

373
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,480
現在知道了吧
You would never know it.

374
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,150
謝謝你
Thank you.

375
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,170
你在干什么
What are you doing?

376
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,130
倒走屬于我的清潔劑
Oh, just taking my share of the pine sol.

377
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,770
-你的嗎  -對
- Your share? - Yeah.

378
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,540
是你買的  但我用優惠券幫你省了四毛錢
You bought it, but I saved you 40 cents with my coupon,

379
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,390
所以我要倒走四毛錢的
so just taking my 40 cents worth.

380
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,570
很公平
It's fair.

381
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,890
或許是公平
Well, it might be fair,

382
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,050
但你不覺得有點瘋狂嗎
but it's a little insane, don't you think?

383
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,390
我明白了
Oh, I get it.

384
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,340
是因為我沒付你油錢
This is because I didn't pay you for gas.

385
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:51,880
不  才五個街區  我不會收你油錢的
Oh, no, no. I drove five blocks. I wouldn't charge you for gas.

386
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,200
可能你收了
Well, maybe if you did,

387
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,700
就不至于會在網上把房子
you wouldn't have to rent your house out to strangers

388
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,800
租給陌生人了
on the internet.

389
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,130
這是怎么回事
What's happening here?

390
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,540
我以為我們挺默契
I thought we were on the same page.

391
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,850
我頭開始疼了
And I think I'm getting a headache.

392
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,490
你要阿司匹林嗎
Oh, you want some aspirin?

393
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,850
好的  謝謝
Uh, yeah, thanks.

394
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,840
-給  -謝謝
- Here you go. - Thank you.

395
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,860
五毛七分錢
That'll be 57 cents.

396
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,660
你們知道真正有意思的是什么嗎
Hey, you know what would be really fun?

397
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,680
所有人都滾蛋
If everybody left!

398
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,690
格蕾茜
Gracie!

399
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,070
加比
Gabi!

400
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,670
等等  你怎么還穿著胸罩
Wait, why are you still wearing a bra?

401
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,890
這里到底怎么回事
What the hell is happening?

402
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,460
你得讓所有人都出去
You gotta get everybody out of here!

403
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,700
幾個人而已啦
Oh, it's just a couple of people.

404
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,940
我朋友賈里德覺得你很可愛
And my friend Jared thinks you're really cute.

405
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,710
真的嗎
Really?

406
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,890
不行
No!

407
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,960
你得讓大家都離開
You gotta get everybody out.

408
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,790
等等  你怎么了
Wait, what's happening to you?

409
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,860
變得跟索菲亞一樣
You're turning into such a Sofia.

410
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,910
索菲亞
Sofia?

411
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,820
我像索菲亞嗎
I'm a Sofia?

412
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,170
如果我變得像索菲亞
If I'm turning into a Sofia,

413
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,590
那唯一的原因就是你像...
the only reason is because you're acting like a--

414
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,890
天啊
Oh, my god.

415
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,000
你剛才是連說了十二遍索菲亞嗎
Did you just say "Sofia," like, 12 times?

416
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,040
還是我真的太醉了
Or am I really wasted?

417
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,820
天啊  是我老板
Oh, my god. Oh, my god, it's my boss!

418
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,330
救命
Help!

419
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,610
喬什  好安靜對不對  你怎么了
Hey, Josh. Pretty quiet. What's going on there?

420
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:19,110
總而言之就是演講沒有預期的效果
Let's just say the ED talk didn't go as planned.

421
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,740
我要回家了
I'm coming home.

422
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,990
什么  回家嗎
What? Home?

423
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,050
喬什  肯定沒事的  是你對自己太嚴厲
Josh, I'm sure it was fine. You're always so hard on yourself.

424
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,880
你根本想不到
You have no idea.

425
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,190
我馬上就走
I'm leaving right now.

426
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,860
但今天不是周日啊  你說周日回來
But-- but it's not Sunday, and you said Sunday.

427
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,540
加比  我只想蜷在床上
Gabi, all I wanna do is crawl into my bed

428
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,670
再也不見任何人
and never see anyone ever again.

429
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,330
半小時后見
See you in 30 minutes.

430
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,310
天啊
Oh, god...

431
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,540
請幫幫我
Please help.

432
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,440
告訴我個把那些人趕走的辦法
Show me a way to get those people out of there

433
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,790
我發誓我每周都會去教堂
and I promise I'll go to church every week.

434
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,850
每隔一周吧
Every other week.

435
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,090
索菲亞  你怎么來了
Sofia, what are you doing here?

436
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,790
那個薩姆太神經了
That Sam was wound way too tight.

437
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,630
對  格蕾茜也瘋了
Yeah, and Gracie is out of control.

438
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,000
她辦了個派對  喬什已經在回來的路上
She threw a party, and now Josh is on his way here,

439
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,580
屋子里有好多人
and there's like a gazillion people in there,

440
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,830
他們都不肯走
and they won't leave!

441
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,710
這都怪我  我要丟工作了  你得幫我
This is all my fault. I'm gonna lose my job. You gotta help me.

442
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,600
或許我是很嚴厲[屁股上有棍子]
Well, I might have a stick up my ass,

443
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,980
但他們屁股上也要有腳印了
But they're about to have a foot up theirs.

444
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,970
索菲亞  你該怎么辦
Sofia, I don't know what you're gonna do.

445
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,670
這些人都徹底玩瘋了
I mean, these people are totally out of control!

446
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,420
我們不可能趕得走他們
We're never gonna get them out of here.

447
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,730
各位
People!

448
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,240
在下索菲亞·瑪利亞·康斯薇拉
I am Sofia Maria Consuela

449
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,590
拉斐爾·羅德里格斯
Rafaella Rodriguez,

450
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,080
你們該走了
And you're done!

451
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,600
怎么回事
What's going on?

452
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,330
不要  喬什  人家訂婚了
No, Josh, I'm engaged.

453
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,730
怎么了
What's happening?

454
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,950
天啊  我們錯過了
Oh, god. We missed it.

455
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,420
游行真的是與我們擦肩而過
The parade has literally passed us by.

456
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,700
艾略特  我要說實話
Elliot, I have a confession to make.

457
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,760
這個周末太累人了
This holiday is exhausting.

458
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,170
上帝造人  就不是讓他們跳舞十分鐘以上的
Man wasn't made to dance for more than 10 minutes.

459
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,450
這種慶典該有能坐的地方
Celebrations should have places to sit.

460
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,270
面對現實吧
Let's face it,

461
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,020
我們老了
we're old.

462
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,200
沒錯
Yes.

463
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,280
但是  本著驕傲的精神
But, in the spirit of pride,

464
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,350
我們要展現真實的自己
let's be honest about who we are.

465
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,030
我們老了  累了  你們接受吧
We're old! We're tired! Get used to it!

466
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,280
老了才不好  干什么都很難
It doesn't get any better! It gets harder!

467
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,890
我染頭發
I dye my hair!

468
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,990
我戴假發
I buy mine!

469
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,950
-喬什  -怎么了
- Hi, Josh. - Hey, what's up?

470
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,100
沒有  沒什么
Nothing! Nothing's up.

471
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,990
真是噩夢
What a nightmare.

472
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,220
還用說
Tell me about it.

473
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,970
這周末本該很棒的
This weekend was supposed to be so great.

474
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,630
結果成了災難
It turned into a disaster.

475
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,090
-沒錯  -絕對的
- I hear you. - Totally get it.

476
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,460
我從沒覺得自己這么赤裸又脆弱過
I have never felt so naked and exposed.

477
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,740
還有傷心
And sad.

478
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,230
孤獨
And alone.

479
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,850
就像是你以為知道自己在做什么
It's like you think you know what you're doing.

480
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,930
計劃好了一切
You got it all planned out.

481
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,950
對  你知道計劃不是壞事
Yeah, but you know there's nothing wrong with planning.

482
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,240
有計劃是好的
Planning can be good.

483
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,190
然后憑空出現了個東西
And then something pops up out of nowhere

484
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,440
讓你猝不及防
and takes you completely by surprise.

485
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,870
但驚喜也沒什么不對
But there's nothing wrong with surprises.

486
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,760
驚喜可以很有趣
You know, surprises can be fun.

487
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,750
但你知道什么很棒嗎
But, hey, you know what's great?

488
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:21,910
能回到家
Being able to come home

489
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,560
跟讓你覺得舒心的人在一起
and be with people who make you feel good.

490
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,410
我好想你
Oh, I missed you so much!

491
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,990
我更想你
I missed you more!

492
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,490
我才離開三小時啊
I've only been gone like three hours.

493
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,710
我好愛你
I love you so much!

494
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,680
我更愛你
I love you more!

495
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,280
這樣真好
This is nice.

496
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,040
很鼓舞人心
This is uplifting.

497
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,610
可能有點太鼓舞了
Maybe a little too uplifting.

498
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,700
別又來啊  別又來
Not again, not again, not again...

499
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,830
艾略特  我的演講徹底失敗了
Elliot, my speech was a complete failure.

500
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,280
演講是失敗
Your speech was,

501
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,660
但你的神曲可成功了
But your song's a raging success.

502
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,930
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

503
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,100
作為你的公關  我自己動手
As your publicist, I took matters into my own hands

504
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,650
扭轉了局面
to get in front of the story.

505
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,500
大家好  我是喬什·卡明斯基
Hi, I'm Josh Kaminski.

506
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,240
我們如何衡量成功
How do we measure success?

507
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,920
它很困難  困難  困難
Well, it's hard, hard, hard.

508
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,580
真的很困難  希望它沒這么難
Really hard. I wish it wasn't hard,

509
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,600
但就是難
but it is.

510
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,990
生活中  你要自己動手  動手
In life, you have to be hands on, hands on,

511

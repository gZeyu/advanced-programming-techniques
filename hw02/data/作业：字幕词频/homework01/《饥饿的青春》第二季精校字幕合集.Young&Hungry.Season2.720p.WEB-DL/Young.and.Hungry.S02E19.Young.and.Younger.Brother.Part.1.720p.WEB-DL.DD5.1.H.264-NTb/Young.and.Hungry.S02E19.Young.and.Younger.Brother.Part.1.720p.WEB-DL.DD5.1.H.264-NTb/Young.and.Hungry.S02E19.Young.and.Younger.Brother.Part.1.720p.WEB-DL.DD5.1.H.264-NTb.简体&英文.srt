00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,560
早上好
Good morning.

71
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,920
加比  不管你在做什么  请做两份
Gabi, whatever you're making, please make it for two.

72
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,990
哪个姑娘这么幸运啊
Oh, wow. Who's the lucky lady?

73
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,780
或者是先生
Or gentleman.

74
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,250
先别评判嘛
Let's not judge now.

75
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,600
加比  这是我弟弟杰克
Gabi, this is my younger brother, Jake.

76
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,570
杰克  这是加比
Jake, this is Gabi.

77
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,240
你好  你为什么不告诉我你弟弟要来
Oh, hello. Hi. Why didn't you tell me your brother was coming?

78
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,180
我不知道
I didn't know.

79
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,180
杰克决定在超级"常见"的凌晨三点出现
Jake decided to show up at the super conventional hour of 3:00 A.M.

80
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,080
他一意孤行[奔向他的鼓]
You see, he marches to his own drum...

81
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,200
这很搞笑  因为他是鼓手
Which is funny because he's a drummer.

82
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,880
曾经是
Was...

83
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,760
然后我成了护林员  然后在石油钻塔工作
Then I was a forest ranger, then I worked on an oil rig...

84
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,390
然后上了捕鲔船
then I was on a tuna boat...

85
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,980
结果到了泰国  而我...
that ended up in Thailand where I...

86
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,590
在那里玩了几个月  现在我来了
just hung out for a couple months and now I'm here.

87
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,710
杰克有重大新闻要说
And Jake's got big news.

88
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,820
他找到了他的梦想职业  告诉她
He's found his calling. Tell her.

89
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,170
我想做大厨
I want to be a chef. 

90
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,860
真不错
Well, good for you!

91
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,650
谢谢  一开始我想当个厨师
Thanks! At first, I wanted to be a cook,

92
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,520
然后我想  为什么不做大厨呢
but then I thought, why not be a chef?

93
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,250
反正差不多  不过薪水更高
It's like the same thing, but with better pay. 

94
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,400
实际上  并不是
Actually, you know, it's not.

95
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,420
成为职业大厨需要付出辛勤劳动
It takes a lot of hard work to be a professional chef.

96
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,850
我知道  我在飞机上看了《美食总动员》
Oh, I know. I watched Ratatouille on the plane.

97
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,420
答案是不
The answer is no.

98
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,730
这也是我的婚礼  我想...
It's my wedding, too, and I want--

99
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,520
杰克
Jake!

100
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,650
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

101
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,590
我听说有人要结婚了
I heard someone was getting married,

102
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,620
想看看我输给了谁
and I want to see who I lost out to.

103
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,450
天啊
My god.

104
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,960
你的脸蛋比上次见时还要美
You're even cheek-bonier than last time I saw you.

105
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,800
这是...
This is...

106
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,900
埃兰
Alan.

107
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,980
我是艾略特的未婚夫
I'm Elliot's fiance.

108
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,150
请不要在拍照时站在我旁边
Please never stand next to me in a photo.

109
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,690
加比比  问问你
Gabala, quick question.

110
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,890
周六你可以为我们的婚礼准备一百人的开胃菜吗
Can you make appetizers for 100 people for our wedding Saturday?

111
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,630
这周六吗  让我看看日程...
Uh, this Saturday, let me check my schedule...

112
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,370
可以
yes!

113
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,390
不行
No.

114
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,470
《造型》和《旧金山杂志》
Our wedding's being covered

115
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,350
都要报道我们的婚礼
by in style and San Francisco Magazine.

116
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,470
必须上档次
It has to be classy.

117
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,970
所以你懂你为什么不能做吧  加比
So you understand why you can't do it, Gabi.

118
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,930
你闭嘴  她很可爱的
Oh, you hush. She's adorable.

119
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,230
我们这是紧要关头了
And we're in a pinch.

120
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,580
我妈的宴会负责人
My mother's caterer...

121
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,450
托瓦·罗森
Tova Rosen...

122
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,640
在筹备晚餐  但我们需要时髦
is doing the sit down dinner, but we need cocktail apps

123
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,290
又有想象力的开胃小吃  而托瓦两者都不是
that are chic and whimsical and Tova is neither.

124
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,830
让开  托瓦
Well, move over, Tova.

125
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,580
因为时髦又有想象力的小吃是我的专长
'Cause chic and whimsical cocktail apps are my specialty.

126
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,850
加比  恭喜  我真为你高兴
Gabi, congratulations! I'm very happy for you.

127
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,860
同时又有点担心
And at the same time, a little concerned.

128
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,680
一周一百个宾客  对你来说工作量很大
Um, one week, 100 guests, that's a lot of work for one person.

129
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,150
很大哦
A lot of work!

130
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,660
你为什么要破坏我的梦想
Why are you crushing my dream?

131
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,950
没有
No! I'm not.

132
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,330
我只是建议  也许
I'm just suggesting, maybe...

133
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,310
你请个人来帮忙  我付钱
you hire a little extra help, my treat.

134
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,000
那就太棒了  谢谢
Oh, that would be great. Thank you.

135
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,480
真好  杰克  你找到了第一份工作
Perfect. Jake, you got your first gig.

136
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,990
-好棒  -不
- Yes! - No!

137
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,800
抱歉[意大利语]
Uh, scusi.

138
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,660
你刚听到了这场婚礼对我来说有多重要
You just heard how important this wedding is to me.

139
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,560
你真觉得一个鼓手/护林员
Do you really think that a drummer/forest ranger

140
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,930
适合做我的助手吗
is really the right guy to be my assistant?

141
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,700
你老板/付你钱的人真这么觉得
Your boss/ the person that pays you really does.

142
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,030
欢迎  杰克
Welcome, Jake.

143
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,040
我很激动/一点也不生气
I am excited/ not annoyed at all.

144
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,580
炖菜做好了
Okay, my stew is done.

145
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,080
你吃过最好吃的
The best you'll ever have.

146
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,160
那真是...
Wow, that's, um...

147
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,510
特别
something special.

148
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,770
我说的吧
Told you.

149
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,200
我觉得我有烹饪基因
I think I got the cooking gene.

150
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,460
好吧
Okay.

151
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,700
杰克  你显然靠这张脸过得很舒坦
Jake, you've obviously coasted through life on your looks,

152
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,300
但烹饪是习得的技能
but cooking is an acquired skill,

153
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,310
不是天生的  我对此很严肃
not genetic, and I take it very seriously.

154
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,860
你觉得我长得帅吗
You think I'm good looking?

155
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,680
你就听到了这句吗  这样吧
That's your takeaway? Okay, you know what?

156
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,630
不如你出去给我买点有机甜菜吧
Why don't you run out and get me some organic beets?

157
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,830
没问题
Done.

158
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,340
最近的市场在哪
Where's the closest market?

159
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,910
俄勒冈州
Oregon.

160
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,720
你没问过我就预定了管弦乐队吗
You booked an 11 piece band without consulting me?

161
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,210
我想要DJ的
I want a DJ!

162
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,730
你能躺在DJ的钢琴上
You can't lay across a DJ's piano

163
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,250
唱《大富豪》吗
and sing Big Spender, now can you?

164
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,130
我刚去取了婚礼穿的裙子
I just picked up my dress for the wedding.

165
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,730
现在你只需要请柬了
Aw, now all you need is an invitation.

166
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,800
他真会开玩笑
He's such a kidder.

167
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,630
你帮我解决了雕刻的事吧
Were you able to take care of that engraving for me?

168
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,740
当然  我表哥一会儿把艾略特的戒指送过来
Sure did. My cousin's dropping off Elliot's ring later today.

169
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,660
你俩嘀咕什么呢
What are you two whispering about?

170
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,440
我喜欢我为她挑选的这条裙子
Oh! Just that I love the dress I picked out for her.

171
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,820
你给她挑的裙子吗
You picked out her dress?

172
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,310
这场婚礼还有哪个部分是你没控制的吗
Is there any part of this wedding you haven't controlled?

173
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,180
他想让裙子搭配珊瑚色的宾客簿
He wanted it to match the coral-colored guest book.

174
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,320
你不了解同性恋婚礼吗
Don't you know anything about gay weddings?

175
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,970
我了解
Yes!

176
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,600
我受够了你自己做出所有决定
And I'm sick of you making all the decisions without me.

177
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,930
这也是人家的婚礼啊
It's my wedding, too.

178
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,830
你说得对  亲爱的
Oh, you're right, honey.

179
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,520
你来策划蜜月吧
Why don't you plan the honeymoon?

180
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,370
好棒  我想去夏威夷
Yay! I wanna go to Hawaii.

181
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,080
因为你想俗套吗
'Cause you want to be a cliche?

182
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,820
我是个在旧金山结婚的基佬
I am a gay man getting married in San Francisco!

183
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,740
老娘就是很俗啊
I am a freaking cliche!

184
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,910
好棒  午餐  一天最棒的时光
Yes! Lunch! Best part of the day.

185
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,880
喜欢吗
You like?

186
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,220
我让你弟弟给你做的
I let your brother make it for you.

187
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,600
挺好吃的
That's good.

188
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,640
是吗  乔什
Is it, Josh?

189
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,800
-真的吗  -很有潜力嘛
- Is it really? - It's got a lot of potential.

190
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,710
如果这是咖喱的话
If it was a curry.

191
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,610
加比  在你的帮助下
But, look, Gabi, with your help...

192
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,250
炖菜只会越来越好
the stew can only get better.

193
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,670
能吗  乔什
Can it, Josh?

194
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,900
真的能吗
Can it really?

195
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,490
因为这个蠢货根本对烹饪一无所知
Because this stew knows nothing about cooking,

196
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,450
他就要毁了我这辈子
and he's messing up my chance

197
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,650
最重要的一次机会
of one of the biggest opportunities of my life.

198
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,990
但是加比
But, Gabi...

199
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,430
那个蠢货是我弟弟呢
The stew is my brother.

200
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,670
我知道  但我想砸他的脸
I know, but I want to punch him in the freakin' face!

201
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,950
等等  加比
Okay, wait, Gabi.

202
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,850
我知道他想一出是一出
I know he's kinda all over the place,

203
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,690
但他好像终于找到了感兴趣的事
but it seems like he's finally found something he's excited about.

204
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,850
也许这就是他的梦想职业
Maybe this is his calling.

205
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,580
也许你该再尝尝他的炖菜
Maybe you should try another bite of his stew.

206
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,460
买甜菜要多久啊
How long does it take to get beets?

207
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,870
等我意识到俄勒冈州是个玩笑后
Well, once I realized Oregon was a joke,

208
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,270
就不用那么久了
not that long.

209
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,950
你讨厌这一切  我能感受到
You're hating this. I can feel it.

210
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,360
-我没有讨厌  -你就是讨厌
- I'm not hating it. - You're hating it.

211
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,780
我是讨厌
I'm hating it!

212
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,090
我得到了这辈子最大的一个机会
Okay, I've been given the biggest opportunity of a lifetime,

213
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,630
而我整天都在浪费时间
and I'm spending the whole day wasting it,

214
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,580
训练我老板的弟弟
training my boss's brother.

215
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,530
我懂
Look, I get it.

216
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,660
很抱歉  我哥哥逼你雇我
I'm sorry. My brother made you hire me.

217
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,460
如果你想的话  我现在就可以走
If you want, I can leave right now.

218
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,170
你会吗
Oh, would you?

219
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,030
但我真的想跟你学
But I really wanna learn from you.

220
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,120
为什么
Why?

221
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,530
为什么是我
Why me? I mean...

222
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,640
为什么不去学公关
Why not publicity?

223
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,530
艾略特肯定很高兴庇护你
I'm sure Elliot would be very happy to take you under his wing

224
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,970
或者压住你
or any other body part.

225
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,250
-你就不能先听我说完吗  -好吧
- Would you at least hear me out? - Okay.

226
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,460
没问题  但是你能一边擀饼皮一边聊天吗
Fine, but can you talk and roll pasta dough at the same time?

227
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,420
加比  问题是...
The thing is, Gabi,

228
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,380
乔什觉得我不定性因为我总在换工作
Josh thinks I'm a total flake because I change jobs a lot.

229
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,310
那的确是挺不定性的
Yeah, well, that's kind of flaky.

230
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,400
但我发誓这次不会了
But, I swear this time's different.

231
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,120
不定性的人都会这么说
Mmm, that's what flakes say.

232
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,030
我是认真的
I'm serious.

233
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,390
我终于找到了我爱的事业
I finally found something I really like.

234
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,550
你给的压力太大了
Okay, you're pushing too hard.

235
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,300
-因为你不相信我  -我是说那块面
- 'Cause I want you to believe me! - On the dough.

236
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,430
这可能听上去很疯狂
All right, this is gonna sound crazy,

237
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,260
我在泰国的时候  住在了一家寺院里
but when I was in Thailand, I ended up living in a monastery.

238
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,180
他们没教会你闭嘴吗
Don't they make you take a vow of silence there?

239
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,240
我不知道你是怎样决定成为一名厨师的
I don't know how you decided to become a chef,

240
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,990
但是我在寺院的时候
but when I was in the monastery,

241
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,290
在厨房帮忙
I got to help out in the kitchen,

242
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,570
为其他僧人做饭
making food for the other monks,

243
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,170
刚开始的时候这只是一份普通工作
and you know, at first, it was just another job...

244
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,550
很好  就这样轻轻地揉
Okay, that's good. That's nice and gentle.

245
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,400
谢谢
Thanks.

246
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,090
你这种专业厨师听来肯定很傻
This is gonna sound really dumb to a professional chef like you,

247
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,120
但是  对我来说
but, you know, for me it wasn't...

248
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,980
我不是热爱烹饪本身
Cooking that gave me the buzz,

249
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,050
而是当别人尝到我的食物时
it was the look on peoples' faces when they tasted...

250
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,760
脸上的表情
What I cooked.

251
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,900
那些僧人不会说话吧
They can't talk, can they?

252
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,080
我无法形容那种感觉
I wish I could put into words what that feeling was.

253
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,470
不用了  我懂的
No, I mean, I get it.

254
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,690
我也是这样爱上做饭的
That's exactly how I fell in love with cooking.

255
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,630
-你开玩笑吗  - 不是
- Are you kidding?  - No, I never met anybody

256
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,360
我从来没遇见到理解那种感觉的人
that understood that feeling before.

257
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,160
好了  差不多了  我来教你
Okay, you're almost there, let me show you...

258
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,570
往下摁  但是别太使劲
You have to push down, but not too hard.

259
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,880
适当用力就可以了
Okay, the right amount of pressure is key.

260
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,480
加比  告诉我
You gotta tell me, Gabi...

261
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,260
你那神奇的时刻是什么样的
When was your magical moment?

262
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,980
就是现在这样  什么
Now-- what?

263
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,190
当时你是看到了谁的表情
Whose face did you see eating your meal

264
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,480
让你有了那种感觉
that gave you the feeling that... that we're talking about.

265
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,430
是我爸爸
Um, my dad.

266
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,550
我和我妈
My mom and I,

267
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,430
以前经常一起看茱莉娅·蔡尔德的节目
we used to watch Julia Child together all the time, and...

268
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,600
我妈去世时  我...
When she died, I...

269
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,730
给他做了茱莉亚的一道菜
made him one of Julia's recipes,

270
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,280
我忘不了他脸上的表情
and I will never forget the look on his face.

271
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,050
只想永远这么做下去
You know, I just wanted to cook forever.

272
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,880
-什么情况  -不好意思  我太投入了
- What was that? - I'm sorry, I went with the moment.

273
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,600
我不知道我是怎么了
I don't know what got into me.

274
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,140
混蛋
Son of a bitch.

275
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,890
天啊  加比
Oh my God, Gabi!

276
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,120
今天下课以后
Today, after teaching my class,

277
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,670
有个妈妈跟我说了这世界上最动听的话
this mom came up to me and said the sweetest thing.

278
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,290
我的单车课...
My spin class...

279
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,350
比生孩子还痛苦
worse than childbirth.

280
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,460
-恭喜  -也恭喜你
- Well... congratulations. - Well, congratulations to you, too.

281
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,270
恭喜什么
For what?

282
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,920
你成功的和乔什他弟共处了一整天
For making it through the entire day with Josh's brother.

283
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,660
我以前从来没见过刀插眼的表情
I didn't even know they made knife-in-eye emojis.

284
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,010
你知道好玩的是什么吗
You know what's funny?

285
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,400
这一天下来...
Is that, you know, as the day went on,

286
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,300
我好像发现了他的另一面
I really feel like I saw a different side of him.

287
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,380
知道吗  他其实...
You know, he's actually a really good--

288
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,660
-吻技不错吗  -是
- Kisser? - Yeah.

289
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,750
-他亲了她  -对
- He kissed her? - Yeah.

290
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,390
而且她还回应了
And she kissed him back,

291
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,570
亲了得有三分半钟
for, like, three and a half minutes!

292
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,270
-好恶心  -可不是吗
- That's sick! - You're telling me.

293
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,980
他俩简直难舍难分
They were all over each other.

294
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,520
我是说你
I meant you!

295
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,480
他们可是在我的开放式客厅里亲
They were in my open concept living room!

296
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,630
问题是  尤兰达  看到他们在一起
And the thing is, Yolanda, seeing them together...

297
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,490
让我觉得我好像...
It made me think I still...

298
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,130
似乎可能还对加比有感觉
kinda might have feelings for Gabi.

299
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,610
"似乎可能"吗
Kinda might?

300
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,370
乔舒亚  这些感觉是真的
Joshua, are these feelings real

301
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,960
还是只是兄弟之间的竞争
or is this just some sibling rivalry?

302
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,630
是真的  千真万确
Real! Genuine.

303
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,960
我觉得
I think.

304
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,640
你觉得吗
You think?

305
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,860
你最好能肯定点
Well, you better be sure.

306
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,850
-因为如果不能肯定  -后果会很严重的
- Because if you're not-- - There could be seismic repercussions.

307
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,900
加比  杰克可是乔什的弟弟
Gabi, Jake is Josh's brother.

308
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,450
我知道  但我情不自禁
I know, but I can't help it.

309
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,770
我们有好多共同点啊
I mean, we have an amazing connection...

310
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,810
-比如食物  比如...  -乔什
- with food and with-- - Josh!

311
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,340
-加比  不行  这太复杂了  -但是...
- No, Gabi, it's too complicated! - But--

312
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,520
但是不行  你正在拿
But no! Look, you're risking

313
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,390
你与老板的关系和你的事业
your entire relationship with your boss,

314
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,870
冒险  而且你都不...
your career, and you're not even--

315
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,260
完全确定自己的感觉
100% sure how you feel.

316
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,540
加比不是杰克从你这儿抢走的玩具
Gabi's not just some toy Jake took from you.

317
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,310
你说得对
You're right.

318
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,370
你说得对  我确定之前是不会进一步行动的
You're right. I won't do anything until I know for sure.

319
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,890
我确定之前是不会进一步行动的
I won't do anything else until I know for sure.

320
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,770
可是会很难的
But it's gonna be really hard

321
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,250
因为我只想盯着他的眼睛
because all I wanna do is stare into his eyes...

322
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,730
夹住他的脖子
Put him in a headlock...

323
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,380
一遍又一遍的亲
And just kiss him over and over again.

324
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,150
直到他跪地求饶
Till he begs for mercy.

325
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,060
可怕  没品味  恶心  粗俗
Horrible, tasteless, disgusting, vile.

326
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,470
我说你的衣服呢  这小吃还挺好吃的
But enough about your outfit. These apps are actually delicious!

327
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,820
谢谢你  艾略特
Wow, thank you, Elliot.

328
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,320
别得意的太早
Don't get too excited.

329
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,480
你们得自己跟犹太公主说清楚
You're going to have to clear these with the Jewish Princess.

330
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,040
杰克  再见
Bye, Jake.

331
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,190
大家好
Oh! Hey, guys.

332
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,080
乔什  艾略特喜欢加比的所有小吃
Josh, Elliot loved all of Gabi's apps.

333
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,520
我们的小吃
Our apps.

334
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,310
我们是个团队嘛
We're a team.

335
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,680
-别闹  -你才别闹呢
- Stop! - No, you stop it!

336
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,490
不如你俩都别闹了
Why don't you both just kinda stop?

337
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,590
杰克
Hey, Jake,

338
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,860
来我办公室待会儿
Why don't you hang in my office?

339
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,780
加比把我们的时间都占了
It's like Gabi's trying to steal all our time together.

340
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,570
过了这么多年  做了这么多份工作
After all these years and all these jobs,

341
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,100
我的多面手杰克终于找到了真爱  烹饪
my Jake of all trades has finally found his trade... cooking!

342
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,620
我很高兴我向你证明了自己
Wow, I'm so glad I've proved myself to you.

343
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,840
证明你自己  可不止呢
Proved yourself? Oh, you did more than that.

344
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,110
你看我有多高兴  都要飞起来了
Look at me, I'm giddy. I'm downright giddy.

345
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,920
都是你的功劳啊
Well, I got you to thank for it.

346
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,050
是你给我和加比牵的线
You're the one who hooked me up with Gabi.

347
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,680
是啊  是我干的
Yeah! I did that.

348
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,420
所以我在想
So I've been thinking...

349
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,780
如何才能让杰克的事业越走越远
What is the best way to get Jake farther

350
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,400
越远  越远  越远呢
and farther and... farther in his career?

351
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,910
然后我想到了
And then, it hit me.

352
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,790
美国烹饪学院吗
The Culinary Institute of America?

353
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,440
这是国内最好的烹饪学校
That's the best cooking school in the country.

354
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,790
杰克  我动用了我所有的关系
Jake, I pulled every string I could,

355
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,150
才把你弄进本学期
and I got you in for this semester.

356
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,400
但是乔什  学费要三万六千块
But, Josh, man, it's 36 grand.

357
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,660
这比我的预算高了...
It's a little out of my price range by...

358
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,150
三万六千块
36 grand.

359
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,410
学费我包了  兄弟
Consider it covered, bro.

360
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,680
真的吗
Are you serious?

361
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,250
我...
I...

362
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,610
我真不知道说什么好
I don't know what to say.

363
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,950
你有这表情就够了
Your face says it all.

364
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,240
你在歌舞伎剧院干的那一年
You know, that year you spent studying Kabuki theater

365
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,560
真的有收获
really paid off.

366
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,770
杰克  你是我弟弟
Jake, you're my brother.

367
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,260
我只在完全相信的事情上投资
I only invest in things I believe in 100%,

368
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,880
而我完全相信你应该离开...
And I'm 100% sure you should go away...

369
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,520
去...上学
there... to school.

370
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,810
但这学校在纽约州北  还有两天就开学了
But it's in upstate New York and it starts in two days.

371
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,430
我来不及啊
What am I gonna do?

372
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,080
今晚赶紧上飞机吗
Jump on a plane tonight?

373
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,410
好主意
Good point.

374
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,270
你就只差一张...
Too bad you don't have a...

375
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,390
头等舱机票
first class ticket.

376
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,890
你好呀
Hey, you--

377
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,350
是你啊
Oh, it's you.

378
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,790
你就这么谢我
That's the thanks I get?

379
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,030
你借烤箱烤馅饼的时候
When you needed an extra oven

380
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,260
我还是你的好朋友呢
to bake your pot pies in, I was your best friend.

381
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,540
太感谢了  你就是救世主
Oh, I know, thank you. You're a life saver.

382
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,630
艾略特肯定会很开心的
Elliot's going to be so happy.

383
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,950
有人喜就有人悲
Well, there's a downside to everything.

384
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,280
我想想啊
Let me see...

385
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,370
你在找什么
What are you looking for?

386
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:24,940
也没什么  我不想引起什么恐慌  只不过...
Oh, nothing really. I don't want to raise any red flags, but...

387
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,210
你见过一枚男式婚戒吗
Have you seen a man's wedding band around here?

388
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,630
你把艾略特的婚戒弄丢了吗
You lost Elliot's wedding ring?

389
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,060
只有彻底找不到了
Ah! It's only lost...

390
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,370
才叫弄丢
if I don't find it.

391
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,240
天呐  你上一次看到它是什么时候
Oh, my god! Well, when was the last time you saw it?

392
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,960
"我上一次看到它是什么时候"
"When was the last time I saw it?"

393
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,070
你以为我没想过
You don't think I've thought,

394
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,820
"我上一次看到它是什么时候"吗
"when was the last time I saw it?"

395
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,330
我上一次看到它是什么时候
When was the last time I saw it?

396
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,710
为防止弄丢  我把它戴在我拇指上
I put it on my thumb because I didn't want to lose it,

397
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,030
然后我帮你做肉馅饼
and then I made your pot pies and...

398
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,160
妈蛋
Oh, my damn!

399
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,160
还好我饿了
Good thing I'm hungry.

400
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,270
-小杰  -尤兰达
- Hey, Jakey. - Hey, Yolanda.

401
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,200
我觉得我们该
Um, I think it would be...

402
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,320
聊一下昨天发生的事比较好
a good idea if we talked about what happened yesterday.

403
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,270
我觉得我们来聊一下
I think it would be a good idea if we talked about

404
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,910
我要去美国烹饪学院这件事吧
the fact I got into the Culinary Institute of America.

405
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,950
什么  这可是大事
What? Oh, my god, that's huge.

406
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,120
这不可能
That's impossible.

407
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,690
怎么会这样
How did that happen?

408
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,870
我是说  恭喜
I mean, congratulations.

409
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,320
你觉得我该去吗
So, you think I should go?

410
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,840
不该  我是说...
No! I mean...

411
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,530
当然  为什么不呢
yes, why wouldn't you?

412
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,210
考虑到昨天的种种...
Well, starting with yesterday...

413
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,490
考虑到我们
because of us.

414
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,260
不是说我们已经在一起了
Not that we're already an "us,"

415
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,830
只是感觉我们正朝着这个方向进行
but I feels like we might be going in an "us" direction.

416
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,820
真好  我也是这么感觉的
That's really sweet. I feel that, too.

417
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,980
但你知道我还有什么感觉吗
Um, but you know what I also feel?

418
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,110
比如我想知道...
Curious as to...

419
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,860
你两天前才决定成为大厨
as to how you got into one of the best schools in the country

420
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,250
为什么就能被全国最好的学校录取
when you just decided you wanted to be a chef, like, two days ago.

421
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,560
所以...
So...

422
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,220
是怎么做到的
how did that happen?

423
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,880
乔什对我有信心  帮我付了学费
Josh really believes in me, and he gave me the money for tuition.

424
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,010
是吗
He did?

425
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,820
是的  为让我录取他还走了后门
Yeah, and he had to pull some strings to get me in.

426
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,030
走后门哈
Pulling strings, is he?

427
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,460
是  我根本没提过
Yeah, I didn't even ask him.

428
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,220
他就很兴奋地要我去上学
He's just so excited for me to go

429
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,310
还为我打理好了一切
that he came up with the whole plan himself.

430
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,910
打理好了一切哈
Coming up with plans, is he?

431
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,610
不得不说  他简直太棒了
What can I say? He's an amazing guy.

432
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,470
是吗
Is he?

433
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,500
真的吗
Is he?

434
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,000
你看到我们俩亲亲了
You saw us kiss.

435
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,080
这是你对杰克突如其来的
That's the only explanation

436
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,580
这一系列安排的唯一理由
for your big sudden gesture to Jake.

437
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,730
-加比  -别叫我
- Gabi... - Don't Gabi me! Okay?

438
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,460
你求了我两天
You've been asking me for two days

439
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,930
让我带一下他  教他怎么烹饪
to take him on and teach him how to cook,

440
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,700
现在突然要把他送到四千公里外
And now you suddenly want to send him 3,000 miles away?

441
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,110
有意思  乔什
Interesting, Josh.

442
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,940
真有意思
Real interesting.

443
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,570
是吗
Is it?

444
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,620
他想学习  你教他
He wanted to learn, you taught him,

445
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,990
他有了进步  现在可以更上一层楼
He showed progress, and how he's moved on.

446
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,060
别给我讲道理
Don't make sense.

447
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,010
对我没用
That doesn't work with me.

448
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,040
肯定不止这样
I know something's up.

449
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,190
真的吗  比如呢
Oh, really? Like what?

450
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,560
比如你看到我和杰克在一起  你嫉妒
Like, you saw me with Jake and you got jealous.

451
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,910
嫉妒吗  加比  我都替你脸红
Jealous? Gabi, I'm almost embarrassed for you.

452
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,910
我做这些全是因为我关心我弟弟
I did this because I care about my brother,

453
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,380
我以为你会很开心的
and I thought you'd be happy.

454
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,710
现在你就可以一个人处理婚礼的事情
Now you get to work on the wedding yourself,

455
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,510
这不是你一直希望的吗
which is what you wanted.

456
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,630
所以  比起冲着无辜的我大呼小叫
So instead of screaming at the innocent party here...

457
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,700
不如去把精力放在那件事上
Moi-- why don't you try focusing on that?

458
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,810
你说得对
Okay, okay. You're right.

459
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,770
埃兰和艾略特的婚礼是当下最重要的事	
Alan and Elliot are the most important thing right now.

460
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,330
婚礼取消
The wedding's off!

461
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,410
为什么全世界都要这样对我
Why does everything happen to me?

462
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,020
小加加
Hey, Gabala.

463
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,780
感谢帮我把我的东西从艾略特那里拿回来
Thanks for bringing my stuff from Elliot's place here.

464
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,530
我无法忍受去顶楼  看到他的脸
I couldn't bear to go to the penthouse and see his face.

465
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,910
还差一步
Okay, one more step...

466
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,870
然后...
and...

467
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,410
加比家吗
Gabi's?

468
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,710
乔什  你说我们要去牛排馆
Josh, you said we're going to a steak house,

469
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,820
不是奇葩馆
not god's mistake house.

470
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,790
他为什么会在这里
What's he doing here?

471
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,540
天呐  这是个圈套
Oh, my god, this is a set up!

472
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,120
惊喜
Surprise!

473
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,560
不管你们在计划什么
I don't know what you two are planning,

474
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,180
都不会有效的
but it's not gonna work.

475
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,060
-童话世界  -魔力梦幻
- It's like a fairy tale! - Pure enchantment!

476
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,310
你以为我会考虑
To think I would even consider

477
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,150
嫁给一个又自私又事儿逼的人
marrying someone so selfish and dramatic.

478
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,790
我事儿逼吗
Oh, I'm dramatic?

479
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,430
拜托
Puhleeze!

480
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,620
我做的一切都是为了我们的婚礼能够完美
All I was trying to do was make our wedding perfect.

481
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,710
没错  "我们的婚礼"
Exactly! "Our wedding."

482
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,480
你完全没把我考虑进去
You didn't include me at all.

483
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,170
我曾经深爱的那个浪漫的人去哪里了
What happened to the romantic man I fell in love with?

484
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,060
你把我逼的都开始暴饮暴食了
You're making me stress eat.

485
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,110
这什么鬼
What the hell is this?

486
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,970
天呐  你找到戒指了...
Oh, my god! You found the ring...

487
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,970
正如埃兰计划的一样
that Alan planted.

488
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,710
永远爱你  我的FMB
"Forever, my FMB."

489
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,520
毛茸茸的面包球
Fluffy matzo ball.

490
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,700
我知道为了这次的婚礼  我有些疯狂
I know I went a little crazy with the wedding,

491
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,950
但我从未忘记过你
but I would never forget you.

492
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,310
我爱你  毛茸茸的面包球
I love you, fluffy matzo ball.

493
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,750
我也爱你  我的犹太小甘薯
And I love you, my yiddish yam.

494
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,190
想离开这里吗
Wanna get outta here?

495
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,960
从踏进来就想了
Since the moment I walked in.

496
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,220
难以置信你的计划居然成功了
I can't believe your plan worked!

497
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,160
没有你  我肯定搞不定
Yeah, well, I couldn't have done it without you.

498
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,370
把戒指藏在肉馅饼里这招  简直...
And planting the ring in the pot pie, I mean...

499
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,620
干得漂亮
nice touch!

500
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,600
我俩配合很默契
We are a good team.

501
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,860
没错
I guess we are.

502
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,900
浪费了这美妙的旋律会遗憾的
Be a shame to let this music go to waste, huh?

503
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,380
我能请你跳支舞吗
May I have this dance?

504
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,520
好的
Okay.

505
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,280
加比  有些话我想对你说
Gabi, there's something I want to tell you.

506
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,170
我也有话对你说
There's something I want to tell you, too.

507
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,550
过去的这几天有些疯狂
These past couple of days have been kinda crazy,

508
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,040
同时也令我也变得狂躁
and they've made me kinda crazy, and...

509
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,850
我指责你嫉妒我
I accused you of being jealous,

510
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,620
但其实你做的一切
when, really, all you were doing was

511
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,340
都是为你弟弟好
looking out for your brother, so...

512
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,730
是我错怪你了
I'm really sorry.

513
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,090
该你说了
Okay, your turn.

514
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,730
加比...
Gabi...

515
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,070
我一定要赶他走的真正原因是...
The real reason I wanted my brother to go away...

516
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,670
因为我对你还...
is because I think I have...

517
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,640
-怎么...  -加比
-What the... - Gabi!

518
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,090
加比  出来
Gabi, come out here!

519
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,210
天呐
Oh, my god!

520
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,930
{\an8}加比和杰克的餐车

521
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,360
那是我弟弟吗
Is that my brother?

522
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,180
看我给你准备了什么
Look at what I got for us!

523
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,500
乔什  我不去烹饪学院了
Oh, hey, Josh! I'm not going to the Culinary Institute.

524
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,730
我为我和加比弄了一辆餐车
I got this food truck for me and Gabi instead!

525
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,210
我的名字还在上面
It's got my name on it!

526
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,920
-什么鬼...  -爱死啦
- What a piece of... - I love it!

527
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,080
戒指就该在这周围
The ring has to be here.

528
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,380
其他地方我都看过了
I've looked everywhere else.

529
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,250
沙发你看了吗
Well, did you check the couch?

530
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,740
天呐  一百块
My god! $100!

531
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,750
比我整个沙发的价值都高
That's more than my whole couch is worth.

532
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,610
给自己提个醒
Note to self,

533
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,250
开始清理沙发
start cleaning the couch.

534
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,520
我们应该花在值得的事情上
We should spend that on something responsible.

535
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,280
-比如付账单吗  -不是
- Like paying bills? - No.

536
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,230
"值得的事情"
"Something responsible"

537
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,660
是我打算下注的马的名字
is the name of the horse I want to bet on.

538
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,310
姐妹  走着
Girl, come on!

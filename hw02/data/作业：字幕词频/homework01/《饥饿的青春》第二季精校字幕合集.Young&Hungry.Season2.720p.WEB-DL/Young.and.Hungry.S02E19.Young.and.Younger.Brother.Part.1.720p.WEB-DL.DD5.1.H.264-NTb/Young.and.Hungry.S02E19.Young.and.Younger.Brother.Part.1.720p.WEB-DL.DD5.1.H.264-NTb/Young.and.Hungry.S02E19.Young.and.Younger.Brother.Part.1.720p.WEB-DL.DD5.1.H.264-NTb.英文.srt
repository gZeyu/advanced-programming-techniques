70
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,560
Good morning.

71
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,920
Gabi, whatever you're making, please make it for two.

72
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,990
Oh, wow. Who's the lucky lady?

73
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,780
Or gentleman.

74
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,250
Let's not judge now.

75
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,600
Gabi, this is my younger brother, Jake.

76
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,570
Jake, this is Gabi.

77
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,240
Oh, hello. Hi. Why didn't you tell me your brother was coming?

78
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,180
I didn't know.

79
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,180
Jake decided to show up at the super conventional hour of 3:00 A.M.

80
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,080
You see, he marches to his own drum...

81
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,200
Which is funny because he's a drummer.

82
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,880
Was...

83
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,760
Then I was a forest ranger, then I worked on an oil rig...

84
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,390
then I was on a tuna boat...

85
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,980
that ended up in Thailand where I...

86
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,590
just hung out for a couple months and now I'm here.

87
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,710
And Jake's got big news.

88
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,820
He's found his calling. Tell her.

89
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,170
I want to be a chef. 

90
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,860
Well, good for you!

91
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,650
Thanks! At first, I wanted to be a cook,

92
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,520
but then I thought, why not be a chef?

93
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,250
It's like the same thing, but with better pay. 

94
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,400
Actually, you know, it's not.

95
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,420
It takes a lot of hard work to be a professional chef.

96
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,850
Oh, I know. I watched Ratatouille on the plane.

97
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,420
The answer is no.

98
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,730
It's my wedding, too, and I want--

99
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,520
Jake!

100
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,650
What are you doing here?

101
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,590
I heard someone was getting married,

102
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,620
and I want to see who I lost out to.

103
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,450
My god.

104
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,960
You're even cheek-bonier than last time I saw you.

105
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,800
This is...

106
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,900
Alan.

107
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,980
I'm Elliot's fiance.

108
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,150
Please never stand next to me in a photo.

109
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,690
Gabala, quick question.

110
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,890
Can you make appetizers for 100 people for our wedding Saturday?

111
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,630
Uh, this Saturday, let me check my schedule...

112
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,370
yes!

113
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,390
No.

114
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,470
Our wedding's being covered

115
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,350
by in style and San Francisco Magazine.

116
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,470
It has to be classy.

117
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,970
So you understand why you can't do it, Gabi.

118
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,930
Oh, you hush. She's adorable.

119
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,230
And we're in a pinch.

120
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,580
My mother's caterer...

121
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,450
Tova Rosen...

122
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,640
is doing the sit down dinner, but we need cocktail apps

123
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,290
that are chic and whimsical and Tova is neither.

124
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,830
Well, move over, Tova.

125
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,580
'Cause chic and whimsical cocktail apps are my specialty.

126
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,850
Gabi, congratulations! I'm very happy for you.

127
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,860
And at the same time, a little concerned.

128
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,680
Um, one week, 100 guests, that's a lot of work for one person.

129
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,150
A lot of work!

130
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,660
Why are you crushing my dream?

131
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,950
No! I'm not.

132
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,330
I'm just suggesting, maybe...

133
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,310
you hire a little extra help, my treat.

134
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh, that would be great. Thank you.

135
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,480
Perfect. Jake, you got your first gig.

136
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,990
- Yes! - No!

137
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,800
Uh, scusi.

138
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,660
You just heard how important this wedding is to me.

139
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,560
Do you really think that a drummer/forest ranger

140
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,930
is really the right guy to be my assistant?

141
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,700
Your boss/ the person that pays you really does.

142
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,030
Welcome, Jake.

143
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,040
I am excited/ not annoyed at all.

144
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,580
Okay, my stew is done.

145
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,080
The best you'll ever have.

146
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,160
Wow, that's, um...

147
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,510
something special.

148
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,770
Told you.

149
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,200
I think I got the cooking gene.

150
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,460
Okay.

151
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,700
Jake, you've obviously coasted through life on your looks,

152
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,300
but cooking is an acquired skill,

153
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,310
not genetic, and I take it very seriously.

154
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,860
You think I'm good looking?

155
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,680
That's your takeaway? Okay, you know what?

156
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,630
Why don't you run out and get me some organic beets?

157
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,830
Done.

158
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,340
Where's the closest market?

159
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,910
Oregon.

160
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,720
You booked an 11 piece band without consulting me?

161
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,210
I want a DJ!

162
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,730
You can't lay across a DJ's piano

163
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,250
and sing Big Spender, now can you?

164
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,130
I just picked up my dress for the wedding.

165
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,730
Aw, now all you need is an invitation.

166
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,800
He's such a kidder.

167
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,630
Were you able to take care of that engraving for me?

168
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,740
Sure did. My cousin's dropping off Elliot's ring later today.

169
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,660
What are you two whispering about?

170
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,440
Oh! Just that I love the dress I picked out for her.

171
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,820
You picked out her dress?

172
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,310
Is there any part of this wedding you haven't controlled?

173
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,180
He wanted it to match the coral-colored guest book.

174
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,320
Don't you know anything about gay weddings?

175
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,970
Yes!

176
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,600
And I'm sick of you making all the decisions without me.

177
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,930
It's my wedding, too.

178
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,830
Oh, you're right, honey.

179
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,520
Why don't you plan the honeymoon?

180
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,370
Yay! I wanna go to Hawaii.

181
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,080
'Cause you want to be a cliche?

182
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,820
I am a gay man getting married in San Francisco!

183
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,740
I am a freaking cliche!

184
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,910
Yes! Lunch! Best part of the day.

185
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,880
You like?

186
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,220
I let your brother make it for you.

187
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,600
That's good.

188
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,640
Is it, Josh?

189
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,800
- Is it really? - It's got a lot of potential.

190
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,710
If it was a curry.

191
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,610
But, look, Gabi, with your help...

192
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,250
the stew can only get better.

193
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,670
Can it, Josh?

194
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,900
Can it really?

195
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,490
Because this stew knows nothing about cooking,

196
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,450
and he's messing up my chance

197
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,650
of one of the biggest opportunities of my life.

198
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,990
But, Gabi...

199
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,430
The stew is my brother.

200
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,670
I know, but I want to punch him in the freakin' face!

201
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,950
Okay, wait, Gabi.

202
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,850
I know he's kinda all over the place,

203
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,690
but it seems like he's finally found something he's excited about.

204
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,850
Maybe this is his calling.

205
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,580
Maybe you should try another bite of his stew.

206
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,460
How long does it take to get beets?

207
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,870
Well, once I realized Oregon was a joke,

208
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,270
not that long.

209
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,950
You're hating this. I can feel it.

210
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,360
- I'm not hating it. - You're hating it.

211
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,780
I'm hating it!

212
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,090
Okay, I've been given the biggest opportunity of a lifetime,

213
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,630
and I'm spending the whole day wasting it,

214
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,580
training my boss's brother.

215
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,530
Look, I get it.

216
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,660
I'm sorry. My brother made you hire me.

217
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,460
If you want, I can leave right now.

218
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,170
Oh, would you?

219
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,030
But I really wanna learn from you.

220
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,120
Why?

221
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,530
Why me? I mean...

222
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,640
Why not publicity?

223
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,530
I'm sure Elliot would be very happy to take you under his wing

224
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,970
or any other body part.

225
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,250
- Would you at least hear me out? - Okay.

226
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,460
Fine, but can you talk and roll pasta dough at the same time?

227
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,420
The thing is, Gabi,

228
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,380
Josh thinks I'm a total flake because I change jobs a lot.

229
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,310
Yeah, well, that's kind of flaky.

230
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,400
But, I swear this time's different.

231
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,120
Mmm, that's what flakes say.

232
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,030
I'm serious.

233
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,390
I finally found something I really like.

234
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,550
Okay, you're pushing too hard.

235
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,300
- 'Cause I want you to believe me! - On the dough.

236
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,430
All right, this is gonna sound crazy,

237
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,260
but when I was in Thailand, I ended up living in a monastery.

238
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,180
Don't they make you take a vow of silence there?

239
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,240
I don't know how you decided to become a chef,

240
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,990
but when I was in the monastery,

241
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,290
I got to help out in the kitchen,

242
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,570
making food for the other monks,

243
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,170
and you know, at first, it was just another job...

244
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,550
Okay, that's good. That's nice and gentle.

245
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,400
Thanks.

246
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,090
This is gonna sound really dumb to a professional chef like you,

247
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,120
but, you know, for me it wasn't...

248
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,980
Cooking that gave me the buzz,

249
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,050
it was the look on peoples' faces when they tasted...

250
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,760
What I cooked.

251
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,900
They can't talk, can they?

252
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,080
I wish I could put into words what that feeling was.

253
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,470
No, I mean, I get it.

254
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,690
That's exactly how I fell in love with cooking.

255
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,630
- Are you kidding?  - No, I never met anybody

256
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,360
that understood that feeling before.

257
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,160
Okay, you're almost there, let me show you...

258
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,570
You have to push down, but not too hard.

259
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,880
Okay, the right amount of pressure is key.

260
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,480
You gotta tell me, Gabi...

261
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,260
When was your magical moment?

262
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,980
Now-- what?

263
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,190
Whose face did you see eating your meal

264
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,480
that gave you the feeling that... that we're talking about.

265
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,430
Um, my dad.

266
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,550
My mom and I,

267
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,430
we used to watch Julia Child together all the time, and...

268
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,600
When she died, I...

269
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,730
made him one of Julia's recipes,

270
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,280
and I will never forget the look on his face.

271
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,050
You know, I just wanted to cook forever.

272
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,880
- What was that? - I'm sorry, I went with the moment.

273
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,600
I don't know what got into me.

274
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,140
Son of a bitch.

275
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,890
Oh my God, Gabi!

276
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,120
Today, after teaching my class,

277
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,670
this mom came up to me and said the sweetest thing.

278
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,290
My spin class...

279
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,350
worse than childbirth.

280
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,460
- Well... congratulations. - Well, congratulations to you, too.

281
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,270
For what?

282
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,920
For making it through the entire day with Josh's brother.

283
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,660
I didn't even know they made knife-in-eye emojis.

284
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,010
You know what's funny?

285
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,400
Is that, you know, as the day went on,

286
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,300
I really feel like I saw a different side of him.

287
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,380
You know, he's actually a really good--

288
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,660
- Kisser? - Yeah.

289
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,750
- He kissed her? - Yeah.

290
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,390
And she kissed him back,

291
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,570
for, like, three and a half minutes!

292
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,270
- That's sick! - You're telling me.

293
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,980
They were all over each other.

294
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,520
I meant you!

295
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,480
They were in my open concept living room!

296
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,630
And the thing is, Yolanda, seeing them together...

297
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,490
It made me think I still...

298
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,130
kinda might have feelings for Gabi.

299
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,610
Kinda might?

300
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,370
Joshua, are these feelings real

301
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,960
or is this just some sibling rivalry?

302
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,630
Real! Genuine.

303
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,960
I think.

304
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,640
You think?

305
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,860
Well, you better be sure.

306
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,850
- Because if you're not-- - There could be seismic repercussions.

307
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,900
Gabi, Jake is Josh's brother.

308
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,450
I know, but I can't help it.

309
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,770
I mean, we have an amazing connection...

310
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,810
- with food and with-- - Josh!

311
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,340
- No, Gabi, it's too complicated! - But--

312
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,520
But no! Look, you're risking

313
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,390
your entire relationship with your boss,

314
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,870
your career, and you're not even--

315
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,260
100% sure how you feel.

316
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,540
Gabi's not just some toy Jake took from you.

317
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,310
You're right.

318
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,370
You're right. I won't do anything until I know for sure.

319
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,890
I won't do anything else until I know for sure.

320
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,770
But it's gonna be really hard

321
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,250
because all I wanna do is stare into his eyes...

322
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,730
Put him in a headlock...

323
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,380
And just kiss him over and over again.

324
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,150
Till he begs for mercy.

325
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,060
Horrible, tasteless, disgusting, vile.

326
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,470
But enough about your outfit. These apps are actually delicious!

327
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,820
Wow, thank you, Elliot.

328
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,320
Don't get too excited.

329
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,480
You're going to have to clear these with the Jewish Princess.

330
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,040
Bye, Jake.

331
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,190
Oh! Hey, guys.

332
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,080
Josh, Elliot loved all of Gabi's apps.

333
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,520
Our apps.

334
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,310
We're a team.

335
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,680
- Stop! - No, you stop it!

336
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,490
Why don't you both just kinda stop?

337
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,590
Hey, Jake,

338
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,860
Why don't you hang in my office?

339
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,780
It's like Gabi's trying to steal all our time together.

340
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,570
After all these years and all these jobs,

341
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,100
my Jake of all trades has finally found his trade... cooking!

342
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,620
Wow, I'm so glad I've proved myself to you.

343
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,840
Proved yourself? Oh, you did more than that.

344
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,110
Look at me, I'm giddy. I'm downright giddy.

345
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,920
Well, I got you to thank for it.

346
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,050
You're the one who hooked me up with Gabi.

347
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,680
Yeah! I did that.

348
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,420
So I've been thinking...

349
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,780
What is the best way to get Jake farther

350
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,400
and farther and... farther in his career?

351
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,910
And then, it hit me.

352
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,790
The Culinary Institute of America?

353
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,440
That's the best cooking school in the country.

354
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,790
Jake, I pulled every string I could,

355
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,150
and I got you in for this semester.

356
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,400
But, Josh, man, it's 36 grand.

357
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,660
It's a little out of my price range by...

358
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,150
36 grand.

359
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,410
Consider it covered, bro.

360
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,680
Are you serious?

361
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,250
I...

362
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,610
I don't know what to say.

363
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,950
Your face says it all.

364
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,240
You know, that year you spent studying Kabuki theater

365
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,560
really paid off.

366
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,770
Jake, you're my brother.

367
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,260
I only invest in things I believe in 100%,

368
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,880
And I'm 100% sure you should go away...

369
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,520
there... to school.

370
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,810
But it's in upstate New York and it starts in two days.

371
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,430
What am I gonna do?

372
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,080
Jump on a plane tonight?

373
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,410
Good point.

374
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,270
Too bad you don't have a...

375
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,390
first class ticket.

376
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,890
Hey, you--

377
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,350
Oh, it's you.

378
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,790
That's the thanks I get?

379
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,030
When you needed an extra oven

380
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,260
to bake your pot pies in, I was your best friend.

381
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,540
Oh, I know, thank you. You're a life saver.

382
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,630
Elliot's going to be so happy.

383
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,950
Well, there's a downside to everything.

384
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,280
Let me see...

385
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,370
What are you looking for?

386
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:24,940
Oh, nothing really. I don't want to raise any red flags, but...

387
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,210
Have you seen a man's wedding band around here?

388
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,630
You lost Elliot's wedding ring?

389
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,060
Ah! It's only lost...

390
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,370
if I don't find it.

391
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,240
Oh, my god! Well, when was the last time you saw it?

392
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,960
"When was the last time I saw it?"

393
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,070
You don't think I've thought,

394
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,820
"when was the last time I saw it?"

395
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,330
When was the last time I saw it?

396
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,710
I put it on my thumb because I didn't want to lose it,

397
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,030
and then I made your pot pies and...

398
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,160
Oh, my damn!

399
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,160
Good thing I'm hungry.

400
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,270
- Hey, Jakey. - Hey, Yolanda.

401
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,200
Um, I think it would be...

402
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,320
a good idea if we talked about what happened yesterday.

403
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,270
I think it would be a good idea if we talked about

404
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,910
the fact I got into the Culinary Institute of America.

405
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,950
What? Oh, my god, that's huge.

406
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,120
That's impossible.

407
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,690
How did that happen?

408
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,870
I mean, congratulations.

409
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,320
So, you think I should go?

410
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,840
No! I mean...

411
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,530
yes, why wouldn't you?

412
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,210
Well, starting with yesterday...

413
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,490
because of us.

414
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,260
Not that we're already an "us,"

415
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,830
but I feels like we might be going in an "us" direction.

416
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,820
That's really sweet. I feel that, too.

417
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,980
Um, but you know what I also feel?

418
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,110
Curious as to...

419
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,860
as to how you got into one of the best schools in the country

420
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,250
when you just decided you wanted to be a chef, like, two days ago.

421
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,560
So...

422
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,220
how did that happen?

423
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,880
Josh really believes in me, and he gave me the money for tuition.

424
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,010
He did?

425
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,820
Yeah, and he had to pull some strings to get me in.

426
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,030
Pulling strings, is he?

427
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,460
Yeah, I didn't even ask him.

428
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,220
He's just so excited for me to go

429
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,310
that he came up with the whole plan himself.

430
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,910
Coming up with plans, is he?

431
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,610
What can I say? He's an amazing guy.

432
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,470
Is he?

433
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,500
Is he?

434
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,000
You saw us kiss.

435
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,080
That's the only explanation

436
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,580
for your big sudden gesture to Jake.

437
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,730
- Gabi... - Don't Gabi me! Okay?

438
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,460
You've been asking me for two days

439
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,930
to take him on and teach him how to cook,

440
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,700
And now you suddenly want to send him 3,000 miles away?

441
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,110
Interesting, Josh.

442
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,940
Real interesting.

443
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,570
Is it?

444
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,620
He wanted to learn, you taught him,

445
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,990
He showed progress, and how he's moved on.

446
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,060
Don't make sense.

447
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,010
That doesn't work with me.

448
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,040
I know something's up.

449
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,190
Oh, really? Like what?

450
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,560
Like, you saw me with Jake and you got jealous.

451
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,910
Jealous? Gabi, I'm almost embarrassed for you.

452
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,910
I did this because I care about my brother,

453
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,380
and I thought you'd be happy.

454
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,710
Now you get to work on the wedding yourself,

455
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,510
which is what you wanted.

456
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,630
So instead of screaming at the innocent party here...

457
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,700
Moi-- why don't you try focusing on that?

458
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,810
Okay, okay. You're right.

459
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,770
Alan and Elliot are the most important thing right now.

460
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,330
The wedding's off!

461
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,410
Why does everything happen to me?

462
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,020
Hey, Gabala.

463
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,780
Thanks for bringing my stuff from Elliot's place here.

464
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,530
I couldn't bear to go to the penthouse and see his face.

465
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,910
Okay, one more step...

466
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,870
and...

467
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,410
Gabi's?

468
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,710
Josh, you said we're going to a steak house,

469
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,820
not god's mistake house.

470
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,790
What's he doing here?

471
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,540
Oh, my god, this is a set up!

472
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,120
Surprise!

473
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,560
I don't know what you two are planning,

474
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,180
but it's not gonna work.

475
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,060
- It's like a fairy tale! - Pure enchantment!

476
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,310
To think I would even consider

477
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,150
marrying someone so selfish and dramatic.

478
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,790
Oh, I'm dramatic?

479
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,430
Puhleeze!

480
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,620
All I was trying to do was make our wedding perfect.

481
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,710
Exactly! "Our wedding."

482
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,480
You didn't include me at all.

483
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,170
What happened to the romantic man I fell in love with?

484
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,060
You're making me stress eat.

485
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,110
What the hell is this?

486
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,970
Oh, my god! You found the ring...

487
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,970
that Alan planted.

488
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,710
"Forever, my FMB."

489
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,520
Fluffy matzo ball.

490
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,700
I know I went a little crazy with the wedding,

491
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,950
but I would never forget you.

492
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,310
I love you, fluffy matzo ball.

493
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,750
And I love you, my yiddish yam.

494
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,190
Wanna get outta here?

495
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,960
Since the moment I walked in.

496
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,220
I can't believe your plan worked!

497
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,160
Yeah, well, I couldn't have done it without you.

498
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,370
And planting the ring in the pot pie, I mean...

499
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,620
nice touch!

500
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,600
We are a good team.

501
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,860
I guess we are.

502
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,900
Be a shame to let this music go to waste, huh?

503
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,380
May I have this dance?

504
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,520
Okay.

505
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,280
Gabi, there's something I want to tell you.

506
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,170
There's something I want to tell you, too.

507
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,550
These past couple of days have been kinda crazy,

508
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,040
and they've made me kinda crazy, and...

509
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,850
I accused you of being jealous,

510
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,620
when, really, all you were doing was

511
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,340
looking out for your brother, so...

512
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,730
I'm really sorry.

513
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,090
Okay, your turn.

514
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,730
Gabi...

515
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,070
The real reason I wanted my brother to go away...

516
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,670
is because I think I have...

517
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,640
-What the... - Gabi!

518
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,090
Gabi, come out here!

519
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,210
Oh, my god!

521
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,360
Is that my brother?

522
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,180
Look at what I got for us!

523
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,500
Oh, hey, Josh! I'm not going to the Culinary Institute.

524
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,730
I got this food truck for me and Gabi instead!

525
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,210
It's got my name on it!

526
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,920
- What a piece of... - I love it!

527
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,080
The ring has to be here.

528
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,380
I've looked everywhere else.

529
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,250
Well, did you check the couch?

530
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,740
My god! $100!

531
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,750
That's more than my whole couch is worth.

532
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,610
Note to self,

533
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,250
start cleaning the couch.

534
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,520
We should spend that on something responsible.

535
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,280
- Like paying bills? - No.

536
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,230
"Something responsible"

537
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,660
is the name of the horse I want to bet on.

538
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,310
Girl, come on!

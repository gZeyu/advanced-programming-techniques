《饑餓的青春》前情回顧
Previously on Young & Hungry.

71
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,080
這是我弟弟杰克
This is my younger brother, Jack.

72
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,870
我想做大廚
I want to be a chef.

73
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,260
好了  差不多了  我來教你
Okay, you're almost there, let me show you...

74
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,670
混蛋
Son of a bitch.

75
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,880
我一定要趕他走的真正原因是...
The real reason I wanted my brother to go away...

76
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,280
我對你還...
is because I have...

77
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,660
天吶
Oh, my god!

78
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,880
{\an8}加比和杰克的餐車

79
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,920
我為我和加比弄了一輛餐車
I got this food truck for me and Gabi!

80
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,970
-什么鬼...  -我愛死啦
- What a piece of... - I love it!

81
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,140
怎么樣
So...

82
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,140
餐車如何
how about that truck?

83
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,260
是不是像你一樣漂亮
Isn't she a beauty? Just like you.

84
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,210
車上寫著我的名字
It has my name on it.

85
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,810
弟弟  弟弟...
Bro, bro, bro...

86
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,960
我有點糊涂了
I'm a little confused.

87
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,910
你應該在去那所我替你付了一大筆學費的
You were on your way to a very expensive cooking school

88
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,710
烹飪學校報到的路上
that I wrote a very big check for.

89
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,080
而你現在開著輛餐車...
And now you stand before me...

90
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,900
出現在我面前
with a food truck.

91
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,560
車上還有我的名字
That has my name on it.

92
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,620
我理解你  伙計
I totally get your confusion, man.

93
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,480
我坐在出租上趕往機場
And I was in a cab going to the airport.

94
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,270
腦子里全是加比  突然間
And I was thinking about Gabi when all of a sudden,

95
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,660
我看見這輛餐車在出售
I see this food truck for sale.

96
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,840
我說  "停車"
I was like, "Stop."

97
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,010
對司機說  "司機  靠邊停車" 
I told the cabbie, "You pull over, cabbie!"

98
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,220
然后我就把它買下來了
And then I bought it.

99
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,320
用我給你的三萬六千元嗎
With the $36,000 I gave you?

100
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,970
別高興太早
That's not how you shwah.

101
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,260
你別高興太早
That is not how you shwah!

102
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,290
加比是名優秀的大廚
Look, Gabi's an amazing cook, 

103
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,410
為什么我不能邊學廚藝邊賺錢呢
so why shouldn't I learn and make money at the same time?

104
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,000
得了吧  杰克
Oh come on, Jake!

105
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,520
你兩周換一份工作
You change jobs every two weeks.

106
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,960
憑什么覺得加比會和你一起
What makes you think Gabi's just gonna jump on the crazy train 

107
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,330
經營這輛餐車
and start a food truck with you?

108
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,450
她才說了她喜歡
She just said she loved it.

109
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,820
那是她出于禮貌
Well, she was being polite.

110
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,410
告訴他你的心里話  加比
Tell him how you feel, Gabi.

111
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,910
這是別人為我做過最浪漫的事了
This is the nicest thing that anybody's ever done for me.

112
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,840
而且車上還有我名字
And it has my name on it.

113
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,330
您好[意第緒語]
Shalom.

114
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,220
我和埃蘭今天要和夏皮羅拉比會面
Alan and I are meeting with Rabbi Shapiro today.

115
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,160
"關我屁事"該怎么用意第緒語來說
Um... what's Yiddish for "who cares?"

116
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,370
埃蘭的媽媽說
According to Alan's mother, 

117
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,690
我們得在他主持婚禮之前得到他的祝福
we need him to give us his blessing before he marries us.

118
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,760
由他主持婚禮的伴侶不會離婚
No couple he's married has ever divorced.

119
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,950
真是太糟了
Oh, that's too bad.

120
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,050
因為我特別招離婚男士的喜愛
'Caused divorced men are my specialty.

121
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,220
你還沒找到參加婚禮的男伴嗎
Oh, you still can't find a date to my wedding?

122
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,160
這在意第緒語里是"令人震驚"的意思
That's Yiddish for "what a shocker."

123
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,660
早上好
Good morning.

124
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,510
這是加比和杰克餐車的加比嗎
Is that Gabi from Gabi and Jake's food truck?

125
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,870
是的
Yeah, it is.

126
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,890
我以為你忙著和我弟弟杰克駕車在城里亂轉呢
I thought you'd be busy driving around town with Jake, my brother.

127
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,970
沒  我在這給老板您做早餐呢
No, I'm here cooking breakfast for you, my boss,

128
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,740
因為這是我的工作
'cause that's my job.

129
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,360
你覺得你可以兼顧兩邊嗎
You think you can do both jobs?

130
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,820
是的  我白天在這里為你工作
Yeah, I'm gonna work here for you during the day,

131
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,160
晚上經營餐車
and I'm gonna take the truck out at night.

132
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,550
你不介意的  對吧
That's cool with you, right?

133
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,950
是的  加比  我絲毫不介意
Yes, Gabi. That's totally cool.

134
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,810
那你笑什么
Why is that funny?

135
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,180
有什么可笑的
Why is that funny?

136
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,570
沒什么
No reason.

137
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:09,910
我敢打包票
I am completely positive and confident

138
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,230
這會是一個明智的  有利可圖的決定
this will be a wise and lucrative decision.

139
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,150
真的嗎  因為我覺得
Really? Because, you know,

140
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,850
你說話的語氣在暗示些什么
your tone is kind of suggesting otherwise.

141
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,940
可能是因為我想知道從昨晚起
Well, I suppose my tone might be pondering the notion

142
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,660
你對于此事考慮了哪些方面
of how much thought you put into this,

143
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,380
說話才會是這種語氣
you know, since last night.

144
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
具體來說  你們的目標消費群是什么
More specifically what's your culinary target market,

145
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,180
有特定的專營市場嗎
is there a certain niche being under-served,

146
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,710
你們的銷售策略是什么
and what's your marketing strategy?

147
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,520
好像這些我們都沒考慮過一樣
Yeah, like we haven't thought through all that already.

148
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,100
好吧  是沒考慮過
Okay, we haven't.

149
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,030
但你知道為什么嗎
But you want to know why?

150
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,080
因為和你不同
Because unlike you,

151
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,290
我和杰克沒腦子
me and Jake don't think...

152
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,260
我們有
We do.

153
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,520
-你說有就有吧  -真的  好嗎
- If you say so. - I do, okay?

154
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,010
這事一定會大獲成功的
This is gonna be a huge success.

155
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,940
想知道為什么嗎
Do you want to know why?

156
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,210
因為餐車上寫著我們的名字
Because we have a food truck with our name on it!

157
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,960
有什么東西上面寫著你的名字嗎
What do you have with your name on it?

158
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,830
公司的辦公大樓  不計其數的雜志封面
A corporate office building, numerous magazine covers,

159
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,290
我每周開給你的支票
the check I write you every week.

160
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,820
{\an8}加比和杰克

161
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,910
這餐車一定能賺很多錢
This truck is gonna make so much money!

162
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,570
然后我把錢都存進銀行
And I'm gonna open a bank account,

163
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,810
喬什會大吃一驚
and Josh is gonna be like, "what?"

164
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,620
我不明白你為什么要這么做
Yeah, well I'm already like, "why?"

165
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,330
加比  你想過經營餐車的問題嗎
Gabi, have you thought any of this through?

166
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,510
在喬什讓我意識到我沒想過之后
Well, after Josh made me think I didn't,

167
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,010
我想了一下
I did.

168
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,180
我想把給婚禮準備餐點賺的錢
I'm gonna use the money I make catering the wedding

169
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,050
用來購買原材料  制作放在餐車上賣的餐食
to buy the ingredients to make the food I sell in the food truck.

170
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,630
該死  喬什問我的時候我怎么沒想到
Damn it! Why didn't I think of that when Josh asked me?

171
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,390
好吧  我只覺得這有點太天真
Okay. I just think it's a little bit naive.

172
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,620
實在不明白你為什么要為一個男人
I really don't understand why you'd risk everything

173
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,720
不惜一切...  你好
over a guy-- hi.

174
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,870
-我叫索菲亞  -我叫杰克
- I'm Sofia. - I'm Jake.

175
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,320
你有兄弟嗎
Do you have any brothers?

176
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,750
-有  喬什  -我明白了
- Yes-- Josh. - Oh, right.

177
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,850
很高興見到你
It's nice to meet you.

178
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,690
我要去檢查一下進氣管
I am going to check on the intake manifold.

179
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,880
-我故意這么說耍帥的  -你成功了
- I just said that to impress you. - It worked.

180
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,000
我想含住他的管子[丁丁]
I'd like to intake his manifold.

181
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,490
加比穿著短裙站在骯臟小巷里
Gabi in a short skirt in a dirty alleyway.

182
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,170
有些事突然解釋通了
Some things just make sense.

183
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,350
小加加  你好
Gabala, hey. 

184
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,470
我媽媽打電話來了
So, my mom called.

185
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,560
說好多客人都是只吃潔食的
It turns out a lot of our guests eat strictly kosher,

186
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,600
所以開胃菜也得是潔食
So the appetizers have to be, too.

187
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,110
好吧  那我就做成潔食
Oh, okay. Well, I'll just make them kosher.

188
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,480
我要怎么辦
What do I gotta do to them?

189
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,820
在新廚房里全部重做一遍
Make them all again in a whole new kitchen.

190
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,120
潔食得用猶太教認可的設備做
Kosher food has to be prepared in a kosher facility.

191
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,300
或許這餐車里的廚房
Well, hey, maybe the kitchen

192
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,050
都是認可的設備
in this food truck is a kosher facility.

193
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,450
這餐車可是頭豬  親愛的
It's in the shape of a pig, sweetheart,

194
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,910
恐怕不會是
So, I'm guessing no.

195
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,520
抱歉  加比
I'm sorry, Gabi.

196
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,720
如果這能讓你好受點  我一開始
If it helps... I never wanted you to be

197
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,320
就不想讓你負責的
a part of this in the first place.

198
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,050
我的夢想破滅了
Well, there went my dreams.

199
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,530
天啊  加比
Oh, god, Gabi.

200
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,940
真對不起
I am so sorry.

201
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,180
杰克  我剛被婚禮開除了
Jake, I just got fired from the wedding,

202
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,690
現在我身無分文
And now all I have is no money

203
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,260
卻有一千份非潔食小吃
and a thousand non-kosher appetizers.

204
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,740
這多棒
That's sweet!

205
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,230
你有小吃  我們有餐車
You have food-- we have a food truck!

206
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,250
今晚就帶它出去遛遛吧
Let's take this baby for a spin tonight.

207
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,930
天啊  這主意好棒
Oh, my god. That's an amazing idea!

208
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,790
棒的是你
You're an amazing idea.

209
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,130
好吧
Oh, okay.

210
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,320
還記得你說我們
Remember how amazing you were 

211
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,500
可以把小吃賣給一大堆人時
when you said we could sell my appetizers

212
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,590
我夸你好棒嗎
to a whole bunch of people,

213
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,850
你卻帶我來個不見人影的公園
and then you took me to a park where there are no people?

214
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,530
某人是緊張了嗎
Is somebody a little nervous?

215
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,810
加比  沒事的
Gabi, it's all good.

216
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,400
我捕鮪船上認識的兄弟艾德
My buddy Ed from my tuna boat days

217
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,990
在附近有場小演出
is playing a small gig near here,

218
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,560
我保證大家看完了表演會餓的
and I'm sure people are gonna be hungry after his show.

219
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,950
小演出嗎
A small gig?

220
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,910
我們可有一千份小吃要賣
We have a thousand appetizers to sell.

221
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,560
如果喬什是對的怎么辦  我們的生意失敗
I mean, what if Josh is right? What if our business fails

222
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,350
不再是生意伙伴了
and we're no longer business partners,

223
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,830
然后不再是任何伙伴
and then we're no longer any type of partners,

224
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,270
然后我們...我們...
and-- and then we... we're not a--

225

還有...
And another thing...

228
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,000
天啊
Oh, my god.

229
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,130
你捕鮪船上認識的艾德是誰
Um... who is Ed from the tuna boat?

230
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,960
他姓希蘭
Oh, his last name is Sheeran.

231
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,760
艾德·希蘭嗎

232
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,310
那個跟霉霉是閨蜜的格萊美提名歌手
The Grammy nominee who's best friends with Taylor Swift?

233
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,610
什么  我以為我才是他閨蜜呢
What? I thought I was his best friend.

234
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,950
喬爾  我是教堂唱詩班的尤蘭達
Hi, Joel, this is Yolanda from church choir...

235
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,280
我周六有個小活動
I have this little event on Saturday,

236
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,530
在想你愿不愿...
and I was just wondering--

237
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,640
你老婆從昏迷中蘇醒了嗎
Oh, your wife came out of that coma?

238
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,350
恭喜你
Congrats.

239
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,400
永久性植物人個屁
Permanent vegetative state, my ass.

240
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,080
真是有愛
Isn't this cute?

241
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,660
加比和杰克給他們的餐車開了個推特賬號
Gabi and Jake started a Twitter account for their food truck.

#快賣完了"
"Hashtag almost sold out."

245
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,040
你猜怎么著  尤蘭達
Well, guess what, Yolanda?

246
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,920
"快賣完了"根本比不上...
"Almost sold out" Is a lot different than--

247
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,520
"#賣完了"
"Hashtag sold out."

248

那你們有許可證嗎
Did you happen to have a permit?

256
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,570

262
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,080

如果我給你張一千塊的支票
If I give you a check for a thousand dollars,

271
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,580
你能閉嘴嗎

272
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,400
我也想
Yeah, I wish.

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,110
您要能祝福我們就太好了
to get your blessing would be a real mitzvah.

280

再跟我說說你們的關系吧
So, tell me more about your relationship.

你們平時會吵架嗎

-吵架  -我們嗎

288
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,380
我們唯一爭吵的  就是誰更愛誰
The only thing we argue about is who loves the other more.

289
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,820
我們甚至會說完對方的...
We even finish each other's...

說完對方的...

291
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,370

So as you can see, Rabbi, we are a delight.

292
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,700
您會祝福我們嗎
Do we have your blessing?

293
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,230
我覺得我們還得見一次面
I think that we are going to have to meet again,

294
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,740
然后再說吧
And then we'll see.

295
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,250
那就是有可能咯
So it's a maybe?

296
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,120
是再說吧
It's a we'll see.

喬什  你看到加比沒
Hey, Josh, have you seen Gabi?

300
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,350
怎么  你倆吵架了嗎
Why? Did you guys have a fight?

301
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,970
事情很糟糕對不對  不是吧
Did something go horribly wrong? I hope not.

302
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,270
實際上  是的
Actually, something did.

303
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,490
加比不想讓我說
Gabi didn't want me to say anything,

304
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,130
但我不想瞞著你
But I hate to keep secrets.

305
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,370
昨晚餐車被扣了
The truck got impounded last night,

306
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,180
因為我不知道還要申請許可
'cause I didn't know we had to get permits.

307
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,890
所以你們沒有很成功嗎
So, it wasn't a huge success?

308
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,460
對  是場慘敗
No, dude. It was a fiasco.

309
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,710
果然
It was!

310
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,220
是嗎  真替你惋惜
It was... and I feel horrible.

311
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,950
你看起來不像  怎么回事
You don't look like you do. What's the deal?

312
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,220
你還在生我花錢買餐車的氣嗎
Are you still mad 'cause I spent the money on the truck?

313
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,150
不  和餐車無關
No. It's not about the truck.

314
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,120
-我不在乎餐車  -那就是...
- I don't care about the truck. - So then it's...

315
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,350
加比嗎  不是加比
Gabi? No. It's not about Gabi.

316
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,860
天啊
Oh, my god.

317
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,130
不敢相信我從沒想到過
I can't believe I never thought about this.

318
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,990
-你是喜歡她嗎  -什么
- Are you into her? - What?

319
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,400
我嗎
Me?

320
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,100
你怎么會想到這上面
Where would you come up with something like that?

321
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,230
你剛才平白無故地說了她名字
Well, you just blurted out her name for no reason,

322
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,290
怪不得你會是這反應
which would explain the way you've been acting.

323
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:08,990
什么
What?

324
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,250
太荒唐了  什么
That is ridic-- what?

325
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,930
這下就說得通了
This is totally making sense.

326
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,600
所以你想把我送去老遠的
That's why you wanted to send me across the country

327
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,710
烹飪學校  你想趕走我
to cooking school-- you wanted to get rid of me

328
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,000
因為你喜歡她
because you like her.

329
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,950
杰克  這...
Jake, that's...

330
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,820
好吧  你沒膽承認是嗎  我有
Fine. You don't have the balls to admit it? I do.

331
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,870
我喜歡她
I like her.

332
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,390
喬什  我真的喜歡她
Josh, I really like her.

333
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,670
好吧
Fine.

334
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,920
你想要膽子是嗎
You want balls?

335
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,140
我也喜歡她
I like her, too.

336
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,300
杰克  猜猜誰拿到...城市之鑰了
Jake! Guess who got the keys to the f-- city?

337
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,560
因為市長  艾德·李
Because the mayor, Ed Lee,

338
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,830
喜歡我們的餐車
likes our food truck!

339
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,090
我走了
I-- I'm out of here.

340
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,790
杰克  怎么回事
Jake, what's going on?

341
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,730
對不起  加比  我需要些空間
I'm sorry, Gabi. I just need some space.

342
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,650
喬什  發生了什么
Josh, what's going on?

343
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,110
杰克不跟我說話
Okay, Jake's not talking to me.

344
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,770
喬什也不跟你說話
Well, Josh isn't talking to you, either.

345
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,540
如果加比誠心地問呢
Well, what if Gabi asked nicely?

346
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,500
是我和我弟弟的一點小矛盾
It's just a little issue between me and my brother

347
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,130
現在激化了
that happened to flare up.

348
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,130
好吧  我不是自戀哈
Okay, I don't mean this in an egotistical way at all,

349
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,460
但有可能是因為我嗎
but could it possibly be about Gabi?

350
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,390
可能吧
Maybe.

351
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,220
他說我喜歡你
Look, he accused me of being into you.

352
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,000
那你跟他說了你不喜歡嗎
Well, did you tell him that you're not?

353
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,490
我跟他說...
I told him...

354
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,390
我說...
I told him...

355
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,970
加比  你怎么能在我說
Gabi, how can you date my brother

356
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,990
我愛你三個月以后  就跟我弟弟約會
when three months ago I told you I loved you?

357
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,820
什么  喬什
What, Josh?

358
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,460
我們不是聊過了嗎
We talked about this, okay?

359
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,990
你說你想我們當朋友
You said you wanted to be friends.

360
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,990
是  加比
Yes, Gabi.

361
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,130
可朋友不會約前任的...
And friends don't go dating their ex...

362
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,170
差點是什么的弟弟
almost something's brother.

363
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,840
但朋友幸福朋友不該高興嗎
But shouldn't friends be happy when their friend is happy?

364
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,500
那我猜我們不是朋友
Then I guess we're not friends.

365
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,340
我猜是的
Well, I guess we're not.

366
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,990
我根本不想要這餐車
I don't even want this truck anymore.

367
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,730
我家鑰匙還在上面
My house keys are on there.

368
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,490
謝謝您回來  拉比
Thanks for coming back, Rabbi.

369
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,580
畢竟婚禮就在明天了
After all, the wedding is tomorrow.

370
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,270
是嗎
Is it?

371
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,130
雖然有上帝在天上保佑
Not for nothing, but god willing,

372
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,720
但天堂都比不上
when I go to heaven, it'll pale in comparison

373
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,040
我和艾略特在一起的每一刻
to the eternal bliss I feel every moment I spend with Elliot.

374
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,500
行了  我看夠了
That's it. I have seen enough.

375
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,910
那您會祝福我們嗎
So, do we get your blessing?

376
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,250
不會
I don't think so.

377
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,310
什么
What?

378
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,190
天啊
Oh, god.

379
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,210
我媽不會同意我們結婚的
My mother will never let us get married now.

380
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,650
同意嗎
Let us?

381
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,850
少當媽寶了
Cut the damn umbilical cord already!

382
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,140
你都九十歲了
You're 90.

383
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,630
這跟我媽媽無關  是傳統
It's not about my mother. It's about tradition.

384
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,980
你要跟我看過《屋頂上的小提琴手》就會知道
You'd know that if you'd ever watch Fiddler with me.

385
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,020
你一天到晚引用那臺詞  我還需要看嗎
Who needs to watch it when you're always quoting it?

386
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,710
夠了
That is enough.

387
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,160
夏皮羅拉比  抱歉讓您看到這樣
Rabbi Shapiro, I'm so sorry you had to see this.

388
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,050
不用道歉
No, you shouldn't be.

389
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,490
我終于看到你們像對情侶了
Finally, I get to see you as a couple!

390
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,350
情侶會斗嘴  會吵架
Couples fight. Couples have arguments.

391
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,120
這是很健康正常的
That's healthy and normal.

392
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,480
那我們就是您見過最健康正常的情侶了
Well, then we're the most healthy, normal couple you'll ever meet.

393
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,360
你這話什么意思
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

394
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,730
好了
There you go.

395
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,900
我祝福你們
You have my blessing.

396
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,260
-真的嗎  -對
- We do? - Yes.

397
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,000
好棒
Yay!

398
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,740
我們去打電話給我媽
Oh! Let's go call my mother.

399
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,000
-然后祈禱她不會接  -你好大膽子
- And pray we get voicemail. - How dare you!

400
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,140
你好  夏皮羅拉比
Hey, Rabbi Shapiro.

401
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,700
喬舒亞  謝謝你請我來你家
Joshua, thank you so much for inviting me into your lovely home.

402
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,300
我祝福了那對新人
I gave the happy couple my blessing.

403
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,070
-我的任務完成了  -真棒
- My work here is done. - That's nice.

404
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,710
您想喝一杯酒嗎
Hey, do you want a splash of this?

405
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,830
不了  謝謝
Oh, no, thank you.

406
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,670
我只在猶太新年
I only drink on high holidays

407
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,760
和主持割禮前喝酒
and just before a circumcision.

408
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,460
你有心事嗎
Is there something on your mind?

409
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,200
很多心事
A lot, actually.

410
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,270
你肯定能想通的
Well, I'm sure you'll work it out.

411
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,350
我真的需要人聊聊
I can really use someone to talk to.

412
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,590
好  倒酒吧
All right. Start pouring.

413
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,280
我弟弟來了城里
My younger brother's in town,

414
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,070
通常  我們相處得很好
and normally, we get along great.

415
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,340
你能長話短說嗎
Can you make this quick?

416
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,880
我在猶太緣上約了個愿意皈依的亞洲人
I have a J-Date with an Asian who's willing to convert.

417
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,400
我做了不好的事  因為我嫉妒
I did something bad because I was jealous

418
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,160
他和我曾經喜歡過的某人
about this new relationship that he's getting into

419
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,100
開始了新戀情
with somebody I used to have feelings for.

420
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,840
曾經喜歡還是依然喜歡
Used to or still do?

421
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,790
我不知道
I don't know.

422
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,260
可能都有吧
Both maybe?

423
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,350
喬舒亞  你這樣很危險
Joshua, you are swimming in dangerous waters.

424
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,190
你聽過該隱和亞伯的故事嗎
Have you ever heard the story of Cain and Abel?

425
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,290
聽過一點
Kinda.

426
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,420
故事的結局可不好
Spoiler alert, it does not end well.

427
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,330
關鍵在于  你是兄長
The point is, you're the older brother.

428
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,980
你要樹立榜樣
You have to set an example.

429
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,060
好好對他  別讓你們的兄弟關系
Do right by him, lest the relationship end

430
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,730
以憤怒和流血結束
in anger and bloodshed.

431
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,690
-這也是《圣經》里說的嗎  -不
- Is that also in The Bible? - No.

432
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,410
是《教父》第二部
Godfather: Part II.

433
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,600
女士們先生們
Ladies and gentlemen,

434
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,150
有請這對新人
for the first time as husband and husband...

435
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,040
帕克洛文斯汀夫夫
Mr. and Mr. Park-Lowenstein!

436
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,340
你還沒有杰克的消息嗎
I take it you haven't heard anything from Jake.

437
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,580
沒有
No.

438
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,020
他不回我電話  我不知道他在哪
He wouldn't answer my calls. I don't know where he is.

439
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,590
或許喬什知道
Maybe Josh knows.

440
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,010
我不知道  我也沒跟他說話
I wouldn't know. I'm not talking to him, either.

441
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,340
看  大家都在跳舞
Aw, look. Everybody's dancing.

442
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,120
恭喜他們了
Well, yipee skippy for them.

443
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,210
尤蘭達
Yolanda...

444
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,160
能賞臉共舞嗎
may I have this dance?

445
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,170
好啊
Oh, all right.

446
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,180
但你不許上我二壘
But you're not getting past second base.

447
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,390
我最后說一次  我有請柬
For the last time, I was invited!

448
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,340
杰克
Jake!

449
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,880
抱歉我沒回你電話
I am sorry I didn't return your calls.

450
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,690
我有很多事情要消化
I've been very confused about everything.

451
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,960
我也是
So have I.

452
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,480
邊跳舞邊說吧
Dance and talk?

453
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,860
走
Let's do it.

454
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,310
喬舒亞  有時候我們得沉著
Joshua, sometimes we have to be steady

455
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,430
放棄最想要得事情  甚至夢想
and give up the things we want most, even our dreams.

456
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,740
-又是《圣經》嗎  -《蜘蛛俠》
- Bible? - Spiderman.

457
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,390
知道嗎  加比  我不想成為離間
You know Gabi, I don't want to be the guy

458
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,170
你和喬什的男人
to come between you and Josh.

459
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,040
我也不想成為離間你和喬什的姑娘
Well, I don't want to be the girl that comes between you and Josh.

460
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,930
那我們怎么辦
So what do we do?

461
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,970
抱歉  我想祝酒
Excuse me, I'd like to propose a toast.

462
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,490
艾略特是我多年的好朋友
Elliot's been my best friend for many years,

463
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,630
我從沒見過他比今天還要高興
and I've never seen him happier than he is today.

464
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,640
這不僅是因為我包下了婚禮費用
And that's not just 'cause I'm paying for the wedding.

465
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,800
還有蜜月
And the honeymoon!

466
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,640
這我們可沒討論過
We never discussed that part.

467
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,000
你們找到了深愛的伴侶
You guys have found something amazing.

468
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,870
更棒的是  這才是開始
And best part about this is that it's just the beginning.

469
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,100
開始充滿著奇妙
And there's magic in beginnings.

470
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,120
它們滿是驚喜
They're full of surprises,

471
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,910
你永遠不知道會發生什么
and you never know what's gonna happen.

472
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,160
所以  請舉起酒杯
So, raise your glasses.

473
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:21,340
各位  敬一輩子的開始
Guys, here's to a lifetime of beginnings.

474
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,540
說到開始和驚喜
So, about beginnings and surprises...

475
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,460
我也有個要送給我弟弟
I have one for my brother...

476
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,710
和我的朋友
and my friend.

477
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,180
{\an8}加比與杰克的餐車

478
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,540
天啊  那是我們的餐車嗎
Oh, my god. Is that our truck?

479
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,780
對  換上了全新的頂級廚具
Yeah. It's got top of the line new appliances,

480
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,150
新發動機  空調  都換了
a new engine, an A.C. Unit-- the works.

481
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,810
看起來好棒
It looks amazing.

482
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,670
還有你的名字在上面
And it's got your name on it.

483
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,870
如果連艾德·希蘭都發推
I figured if Ed Sheeran is tweeting

484
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,950
說你們的餐車好吃了
about how awesome your truck is,

485
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,280
你們就該利用這點  把它開去科切拉
you should capitalize on that and drive it down to Coachella.

486
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,640
科切拉嗎  那可是加州最盛大的音樂節
Coachella? That's like, the biggest music festival in California.

487
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,490
我們不可能拿到許可的
There is no way we can get a permit for that.

488
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,480
是啊
Oh, right.

489
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,540
除非我已經幫你們拿到了
That is unless I already got you one.

490
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,020
沒錯
Yeah!

491
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,010
如果你們現在出發  還能在開幕之前趕到
And if you leave now, you guys can get there before it starts.

492
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,370
加比  我放你兩周的假
Gabi, you have two weeks off.

493
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,110
去追尋你的夢想吧
Go follow your dream.

494
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,610
我不敢相信你會這樣
I-- I can't believe you did this.

495
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,350
你確定嗎
Are you sure about this?

496
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,160
確定
I'm sure.

497
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,280
我不知道該怎么謝你了
I don't know how to thank you.

498
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,760
你知道的
Yeah, you do.

499
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,470
好好照顧她
You take good care of her.

500

我只希望你幸福
All I ever wanted was for you to be happy.

502
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,820
好了  各位  該扔捧花了
Okay everyone! It's time to toss the bouquet!

503
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,650
排好隊  你們這群單身狗
Line up, you single losers!

504
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,510
我們的位置超好
Ooh, we got the best spot.

505
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,510
對吧  不可能搶不到的
Right? There's no way we don't catch this!

506
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,230
我接到了
Hey, I got it!

507
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,120
我沒事  我沒事
I'm okay! I'm okay!

508
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,580
-你好  -魯本
- Hi. - Ruben?

509
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,180
你不穿三明治裝了看起來真帥
You look so handsome without your sandwich suit.

510
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:48,210
你是闖進這婚禮  想浪漫地和我復合嗎
Did you crash this wedding as big romantic gesture to get me back?

511
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,020
我是婚禮服務生
I'm a waiter.

512
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,470
也是個笨蛋
And an idiot.

513
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,360
居然會和你分手
I can't believe I broke up with you.

514
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,260
你是婚禮上最美的姑娘
You're the prettiest girl here.

515
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,400
繼續
Go on...

516
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,060
-我能請你喝一杯嗎  -這里酒水免費
- Can I buy you a drink? - Well, it's an open bar.

517
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,910
所以  多請我喝幾杯吧
So you know, you can buy me several.

518
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,460
我猜這意思是你單身咯
So, I guess that means you're single.

519
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,420
沒錯
I am.

520
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,180
謝謝你  上帝

-無意冒犯  -沒事
- No offense. - No.

522
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,350
你不會碰巧有猶太血統吧
You don't by any chance have any Jewish in you?

523
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,830
沒有
I do not...

524
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,960

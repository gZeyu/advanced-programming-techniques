70
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,910
Previously on Young & Hungry.

71
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,080
This is my younger brother, Jack.

72
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,870
I want to be a chef.

73
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,260
Okay, you're almost there, let me show you...

74
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,670
Son of a bitch.

75
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,880
The real reason I wanted my brother to go away...

76
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,280
is because I have...

77
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,660
Oh, my god!

79
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,920
I got this food truck for me and Gabi!

80
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,970
- What a piece of... - I love it!

81
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,140
So...

82
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,140
how about that truck?

83
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,260
Isn't she a beauty? Just like you.

84
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,210
It has my name on it.

85
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,810
Bro, bro, bro...

86
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,960
I'm a little confused.

87
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,910
You were on your way to a very expensive cooking school

88
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,710
that I wrote a very big check for.

89
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,080
And now you stand before me...

90
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,900
with a food truck.

91
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,560
That has my name on it.

92
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,620
I totally get your confusion, man.

93
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,480
And I was in a cab going to the airport.

94
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,270
And I was thinking about Gabi when all of a sudden,

95
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,660
I see this food truck for sale.

96
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,840
I was like, "Stop."

97
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,010
I told the cabbie, "You pull over, cabbie!"

98
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,220
And then I bought it.

99
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,320
With the $36,000 I gave you?

100
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,970
That's not how you shwah.

101
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,260
That is not how you shwah!

102
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,290
Look, Gabi's an amazing cook, 

103
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,410
so why shouldn't I learn and make money at the same time?

104
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh come on, Jake!

105
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,520
You change jobs every two weeks.

106
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,960
What makes you think Gabi's just gonna jump on the crazy train 

107
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,330
and start a food truck with you?

108
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,450
She just said she loved it.

109
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,820
Well, she was being polite.

110
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,410
Tell him how you feel, Gabi.

111
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,910
This is the nicest thing that anybody's ever done for me.

112
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,840
And it has my name on it.

113
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,330
Shalom.

114
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,220
Alan and I are meeting with Rabbi Shapiro today.

115
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,160
Um... what's Yiddish for "who cares?"

116
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,370
According to Alan's mother, 

117
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,690
we need him to give us his blessing before he marries us.

118
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,760
No couple he's married has ever divorced.

119
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,950
Oh, that's too bad.

120
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,050
'Caused divorced men are my specialty.

121
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,220
Oh, you still can't find a date to my wedding?

122
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,160
That's Yiddish for "what a shocker."

123
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,660
Good morning.

124
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,510
Is that Gabi from Gabi and Jake's food truck?

125
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,870
Yeah, it is.

126
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,890
I thought you'd be busy driving around town with Jake, my brother.

127
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,970
No, I'm here cooking breakfast for you, my boss,

128
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,740
'cause that's my job.

129
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,360
You think you can do both jobs?

130
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,820
Yeah, I'm gonna work here for you during the day,

131
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,160
and I'm gonna take the truck out at night.

132
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,550
That's cool with you, right?

133
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,950
Yes, Gabi. That's totally cool.

134
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,810
Why is that funny?

135
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,180
Why is that funny?

136
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,570
No reason.

137
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:09,910
I am completely positive and confident

138
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,230
this will be a wise and lucrative decision.

139
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,150
Really? Because, you know,

140
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,850
your tone is kind of suggesting otherwise.

141
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,940
Well, I suppose my tone might be pondering the notion

142
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,660
of how much thought you put into this,

143
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,380
you know, since last night.

144
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
More specifically what's your culinary target market,

145
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,180
is there a certain niche being under-served,

146
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,710
and what's your marketing strategy?

147
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,520
Yeah, like we haven't thought through all that already.

148
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,100
Okay, we haven't.

149
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,030
But you want to know why?

150
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,080
Because unlike you,

151
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,290
me and Jake don't think...

152
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,260
We do.

153
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,520
- If you say so. - I do, okay?

154
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,010
This is gonna be a huge success.

155
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,940
Do you want to know why?

156
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,210
Because we have a food truck with our name on it!

157
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,960
What do you have with your name on it?

158
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,830
A corporate office building, numerous magazine covers,

159
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,290
the check I write you every week.

161
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,910
This truck is gonna make so much money!

162
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,570
And I'm gonna open a bank account,

163
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,810
and Josh is gonna be like, "what?"

164
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,620
Yeah, well I'm already like, "why?"

165
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,330
Gabi, have you thought any of this through?

166
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,510
Well, after Josh made me think I didn't,

167
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,010
I did.

168
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,180
I'm gonna use the money I make catering the wedding

169
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,050
to buy the ingredients to make the food I sell in the food truck.

170
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,630
Damn it! Why didn't I think of that when Josh asked me?

171
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,390
Okay. I just think it's a little bit naive.

172
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,620
I really don't understand why you'd risk everything

173
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,720
over a guy-- hi.

174
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,870
- I'm Sofia. - I'm Jake.

175
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,320
Do you have any brothers?

176
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,750
- Yes-- Josh. - Oh, right.

177
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,850
It's nice to meet you.

178
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,690
I am going to check on the intake manifold.

179
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,880
- I just said that to impress you. - It worked.

180
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,000
I'd like to intake his manifold.

181
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,490
Gabi in a short skirt in a dirty alleyway.

182
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,170
Some things just make sense.

183
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,350
Gabala, hey. 

184
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,470
So, my mom called.

185
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,560
It turns out a lot of our guests eat strictly kosher,

186
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,600
So the appetizers have to be, too.

187
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,110
Oh, okay. Well, I'll just make them kosher.

188
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,480
What do I gotta do to them?

189
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,820
Make them all again in a whole new kitchen.

190
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,120
Kosher food has to be prepared in a kosher facility.

191
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,300
Well, hey, maybe the kitchen

192
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,050
in this food truck is a kosher facility.

193
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,450
It's in the shape of a pig, sweetheart,

194
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,910
So, I'm guessing no.

195
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,520
I'm sorry, Gabi.

196
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,720
If it helps... I never wanted you to be

197
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,320
a part of this in the first place.

198
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,050
Well, there went my dreams.

199
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,530
Oh, god, Gabi.

200
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,940
I am so sorry.

201
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,180
Jake, I just got fired from the wedding,

202
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,690
And now all I have is no money

203
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,260
and a thousand non-kosher appetizers.

204
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,740
That's sweet!

205
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,230
You have food-- we have a food truck!

206
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,250
Let's take this baby for a spin tonight.

207
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,930
Oh, my god. That's an amazing idea!

208
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,790
You're an amazing idea.

209
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,130
Oh, okay.

210
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,320
Remember how amazing you were 

211
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,500
when you said we could sell my appetizers

212
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,590
to a whole bunch of people,

213
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,850
and then you took me to a park where there are no people?

214
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,530
Is somebody a little nervous?

215
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,810
Gabi, it's all good.

216
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,400
My buddy Ed from my tuna boat days

217
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,990
is playing a small gig near here,

218
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,560
and I'm sure people are gonna be hungry after his show.

219
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,950
A small gig?

220
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,910
We have a thousand appetizers to sell.

221
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,560
I mean, what if Josh is right? What if our business fails

222
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,350
and we're no longer business partners,

223
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,830
and then we're no longer any type of partners,

224
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,270
and-- and then we... we're not a--

225
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,600
I am really into you.

226
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,580
You are? 

227
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,000
And another thing...

228
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,000
Oh, my god.

229
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,130
Um... who is Ed from the tuna boat?

230
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,960
Oh, his last name is Sheeran.

231
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,760
Ed Sheeran?

232
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,310
The Grammy nominee who's best friends with Taylor Swift?

233
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,610
What? I thought I was his best friend.

234
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,950
Hi, Joel, this is Yolanda from church choir...

235
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,280
I have this little event on Saturday,

236
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,530
and I was just wondering--

237
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,640
Oh, your wife came out of that coma?

238
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,350
Congrats.

239
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,400
Permanent vegetative state, my ass.

240
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,080
Isn't this cute?

241
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,660
Gabi and Jake started a Twitter account for their food truck.

242
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,320
They just tweeted a photo of Gabi, Jake, and Ed Sheeran.

243
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,000
"We are killing it, hashtag blessed,

244
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,940
"Hashtag almost sold out."

245
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,040
Well, guess what, Yolanda?

246
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,920
"Almost sold out" Is a lot different than--

247
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,520
"Hashtag sold out."

248
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,670
Thank you.

249
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,880
We did it!

250
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,020
Hey, officer, we just sold out of everything. I'm sorry.

251
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,830
Me, too. So, what did I miss?

252
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,200
Oh, my god. Lobster pot pies,

253
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,330
Korean short rib waffle cones, bacon mac and cheese pops,

254
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,340
You name it, we had it.

255
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,670
Did you happen to have a permit?

256
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,570
For what now?

257
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,040
Business permit, health permit,

258
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,740
- Commercial driver's license-- - Hold on!

259
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,500
One second.

260
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,590
- Jake? - No.

261
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,900
- No to... - All of those.

262
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,080
Okay, um... officer, we may have a little--

263
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,250
Ma'am, hand over the keys.

264
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,120
We're towing your truck.

265
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,990
What? No! Jake, do something.

266
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,780
Um... maybe we should call Josh.

267
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,100
Here you go, officer. Guess we're shut down.

268
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,020
- We should call-- - We're shut down!

269
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,810
Elliot , this is the worst day ever.

270
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,090
If I give you a check for a thousand dollars,

271
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,580
can I not hear why?

272
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,400
Yeah, I wish.

273
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,240
Alan is insisting we pay you for the work you did on the wedding.

274
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,350
Oh, my god. This is amazing.

275
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,470
I can surprise Jake with the truck!

276
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,780
- I love you, I love you... - I have this, I hate this...

277
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,460
And that's why I'm convinced that Stevie Wonder can see!

278
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,990
Anyway, Rabbi Shapiro...

279
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,110
to get your blessing would be a real mitzvah.

280
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,010
So, tell me more about your relationship.

281
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,940
I think that we're fated to be together.

282
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,530
He's my Woody Allen, and I'm his Soon Yi.

283
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,330
We laugh, we kid...

284
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,740
we stop.

285
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:35,850
So, what are the areas of conflict in your relationship?

286
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,070
- Conflict?  - Us?

287
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,480
As if.

288
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,380
The only thing we argue about is who loves the other more.

289
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,820
We even finish each other's...

290
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,110
We finish each other's...

291
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,370
So as you can see, Rabbi, we are a delight.

292
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,700
Do we have your blessing?

293
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,230
I think that we are going to have to meet again,

294
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,740
And then we'll see.

295
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,250
So it's a maybe?

296
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,120
It's a we'll see.

297
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,480
Sentences!

298
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,570
We finish each other's sentences!

299
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,510
Hey, Josh, have you seen Gabi?

300
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,350
Why? Did you guys have a fight?

301
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,970
Did something go horribly wrong? I hope not.

302
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,270
Actually, something did.

303
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,490
Gabi didn't want me to say anything,

304
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,130
But I hate to keep secrets.

305
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,370
The truck got impounded last night,

306
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,180
'cause I didn't know we had to get permits.

307
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,890
So, it wasn't a huge success?

308
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,460
No, dude. It was a fiasco.

309
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,710
It was!

310
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,220
It was... and I feel horrible.

311
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,950
You don't look like you do. What's the deal?

312
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,220
Are you still mad 'cause I spent the money on the truck?

313
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,150
No. It's not about the truck.

314
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,120
- I don't care about the truck. - So then it's...

315
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,350
Gabi? No. It's not about Gabi.

316
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,860
Oh, my god.

317
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,130
I can't believe I never thought about this.

318
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,990
- Are you into her? - What?

319
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,400
Me?

320
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,100
Where would you come up with something like that?

321
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,230
Well, you just blurted out her name for no reason,

322
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,290
which would explain the way you've been acting.

323
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:08,990
What?

324
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,250
That is ridic-- what?

325
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,930
This is totally making sense.

326
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,600
That's why you wanted to send me across the country

327
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,710
to cooking school-- you wanted to get rid of me

328
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,000
because you like her.

329
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,950
Jake, that's...

330
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,820
Fine. You don't have the balls to admit it? I do.

331
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,870
I like her.

332
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,390
Josh, I really like her.

333
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,670
Fine.

334
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,920
You want balls?

335
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,140
I like her, too.

336
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,300
Jake! Guess who got the keys to the f-- city?

337
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,560
Because the mayor, Ed Lee,

338
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,830
likes our food truck!

339
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,090
I-- I'm out of here.

340
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,790
Jake, what's going on?

341
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,730
I'm sorry, Gabi. I just need some space.

342
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,650
Josh, what's going on?

343
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,110
Okay, Jake's not talking to me.

344
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,770
Well, Josh isn't talking to you, either.

345
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,540
Well, what if Gabi asked nicely?

346
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,500
It's just a little issue between me and my brother

347
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,130
that happened to flare up.

348
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,130
Okay, I don't mean this in an egotistical way at all,

349
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,460
but could it possibly be about Gabi?

350
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,390
Maybe.

351
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,220
Look, he accused me of being into you.

352
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,000
Well, did you tell him that you're not?

353
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,490
I told him...

354
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,390
I told him...

355
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,970
Gabi, how can you date my brother

356
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,990
when three months ago I told you I loved you?

357
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,820
What, Josh?

358
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,460
We talked about this, okay?

359
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,990
You said you wanted to be friends.

360
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,990
Yes, Gabi.

361
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,130
And friends don't go dating their ex...

362
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,170
almost something's brother.

363
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,840
But shouldn't friends be happy when their friend is happy?

364
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,500
Then I guess we're not friends.

365
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,340
Well, I guess we're not.

366
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,990
I don't even want this truck anymore.

367
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,730
My house keys are on there.

368
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,490
Thanks for coming back, Rabbi.

369
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,580
After all, the wedding is tomorrow.

370
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,270
Is it?

371
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,130
Not for nothing, but god willing,

372
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,720
when I go to heaven, it'll pale in comparison

373
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,040
to the eternal bliss I feel every moment I spend with Elliot.

374
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,500
That's it. I have seen enough.

375
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,910
So, do we get your blessing?

376
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,250
I don't think so.

377
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,310
What?

378
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,190
Oh, god.

379
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,210
My mother will never let us get married now.

380
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,650
Let us?

381
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,850
Cut the damn umbilical cord already!

382
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,140
You're 90.

383
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,630
It's not about my mother. It's about tradition.

384
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,980
You'd know that if you'd ever watch Fiddler with me.

385
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,020
Who needs to watch it when you're always quoting it?

386
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,710
That is enough.

387
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,160
Rabbi Shapiro, I'm so sorry you had to see this.

388
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,050
No, you shouldn't be.

389
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,490
Finally, I get to see you as a couple!

390
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,350
Couples fight. Couples have arguments.

391
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,120
That's healthy and normal.

392
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,480
Well, then we're the most healthy, normal couple you'll ever meet.

393
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,360
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

394
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,730
There you go.

395
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,900
You have my blessing.

396
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,260
- We do? - Yes.

397
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,000
Yay!

398
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,740
Oh! Let's go call my mother.

399
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,000
- And pray we get voicemail. - How dare you!

400
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,140
Hey, Rabbi Shapiro.

401
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,700
Joshua, thank you so much for inviting me into your lovely home.

402
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,300
I gave the happy couple my blessing.

403
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,070
- My work here is done. - That's nice.

404
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,710
Hey, do you want a splash of this?

405
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,830
Oh, no, thank you.

406
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,670
I only drink on high holidays

407
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,760
and just before a circumcision.

408
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,460
Is there something on your mind?

409
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,200
A lot, actually.

410
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,270
Well, I'm sure you'll work it out.

411
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,350
I can really use someone to talk to.

412
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,590
All right. Start pouring.

413
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,280
My younger brother's in town,

414
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,070
and normally, we get along great.

415
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,340
Can you make this quick?

416
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,880
I have a J-Date with an Asian who's willing to convert.

417
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,400
I did something bad because I was jealous

418
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,160
about this new relationship that he's getting into

419
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,100
with somebody I used to have feelings for.

420
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,840
Used to or still do?

421
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,790
I don't know.

422
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,260
Both maybe?

423
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,350
Joshua, you are swimming in dangerous waters.

424
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,190
Have you ever heard the story of Cain and Abel?

425
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,290
Kinda.

426
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,420
Spoiler alert, it does not end well.

427
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,330
The point is, you're the older brother.

428
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,980
You have to set an example.

429
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,060
Do right by him, lest the relationship end

430
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,730
in anger and bloodshed.

431
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,690
- Is that also in The Bible? - No.

432
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,410
Godfather: Part II.

433
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

434
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,150
for the first time as husband and husband...

435
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,040
Mr. and Mr. Park-Lowenstein!

436
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,340
I take it you haven't heard anything from Jake.

437
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,580
No.

438
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,020
He wouldn't answer my calls. I don't know where he is.

439
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,590
Maybe Josh knows.

440
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,010
I wouldn't know. I'm not talking to him, either.

441
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,340
Aw, look. Everybody's dancing.

442
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,120
Well, yipee skippy for them.

443
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,210
Yolanda...

444
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,160
may I have this dance?

445
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,170
Oh, all right.

446
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,180
But you're not getting past second base.

447
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,390
For the last time, I was invited!

448
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,340
Jake!

449
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,880
I am sorry I didn't return your calls.

450
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,690
I've been very confused about everything.

451
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,960
So have I.

452
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,480
Dance and talk?

453
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,860
Let's do it.

454
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,310
Joshua, sometimes we have to be steady

455
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,430
and give up the things we want most, even our dreams.

456
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,740
- Bible? - Spiderman.

457
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,390
You know Gabi, I don't want to be the guy

458
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,170
to come between you and Josh.

459
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,040
Well, I don't want to be the girl that comes between you and Josh.

460
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,930
So what do we do?

461
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,970
Excuse me, I'd like to propose a toast.

462
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,490
Elliot's been my best friend for many years,

463
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,630
and I've never seen him happier than he is today.

464
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,640
And that's not just 'cause I'm paying for the wedding.

465
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,800
And the honeymoon!

466
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,640
We never discussed that part.

467
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,000
You guys have found something amazing.

468
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,870
And best part about this is that it's just the beginning.

469
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,100
And there's magic in beginnings.

470
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,120
They're full of surprises,

471
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,910
and you never know what's gonna happen.

472
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,160
So, raise your glasses.

473
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:21,340
Guys, here's to a lifetime of beginnings.

474
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,540
So, about beginnings and surprises...

475
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,460
I have one for my brother...

476
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,710
and my friend.

478
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,540
Oh, my god. Is that our truck?

479
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,780
Yeah. It's got top of the line new appliances,

480
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,150
a new engine, an A.C. Unit-- the works.

481
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,810
It looks amazing.

482
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,670
And it's got your name on it.

483
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,870
I figured if Ed Sheeran is tweeting

484
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,950
about how awesome your truck is,

485
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,280
you should capitalize on that and drive it down to Coachella.

486
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,640
Coachella? That's like, the biggest music festival in California.

487
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,490
There is no way we can get a permit for that.

488
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,480
Oh, right.

489
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,540
That is unless I already got you one.

490
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,020
Yeah!

491
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,010
And if you leave now, you guys can get there before it starts.

492
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,370
Gabi, you have two weeks off.

493
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,110
Go follow your dream.

494
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,610
I-- I can't believe you did this.

495
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,350
Are you sure about this?

496
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,160
I'm sure.

497
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,280
I don't know how to thank you.

498
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,760
Yeah, you do.

499
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,470
You take good care of her.

500
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,810
- Josh, I-- - Gabi...

501
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,950
All I ever wanted was for you to be happy.

502
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,820
Okay everyone! It's time to toss the bouquet!

503
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,650
Line up, you single losers!

504
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,510
Ooh, we got the best spot.

505
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,510
Right? There's no way we don't catch this!

506
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,230
Hey, I got it!

507
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,120
I'm okay! I'm okay!

508
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,580
- Hi. - Ruben?

509
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,180
You look so handsome without your sandwich suit.

510
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:48,210
Did you crash this wedding as big romantic gesture to get me back?

511
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,020
I'm a waiter.

512
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,470
And an idiot.

513
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,360
I can't believe I broke up with you.

514
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,260
You're the prettiest girl here.

515
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,400
Go on...

516
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,060
- Can I buy you a drink? - Well, it's an open bar.

517
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,910
So you know, you can buy me several.

518
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,460
So, I guess that means you're single.

519
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,420
I am.

520
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,180
Thank you, jesus!

521
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,110
- No offense. - No.

522
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,350
You don't by any chance have any Jewish in you?

523
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,830
I do not...

524
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,960
but, the evening is young.

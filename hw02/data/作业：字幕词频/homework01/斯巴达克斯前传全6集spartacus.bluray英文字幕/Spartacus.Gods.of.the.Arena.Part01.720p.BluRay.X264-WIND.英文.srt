1
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,890
There is but one path. We kill them all.

2
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,360
I'm your Dominus. I will have your fucking hearts!

3
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,670
Quintus...

4
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,880
Lucretia!

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,090
What would you do?

6
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,310
To hold your wife again?

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,360
To feel the warmth of her skin?

8
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,560
The taste of her lips?

9
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,240
How many men would you kill?

10
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,890
I left the deed in Barca's hands.

11
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,390
Now you're free.

12
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,990
We have been betrayed by the Beast of fucking Carthage.

13
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,770
You are beneath me.

14
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,530
He is a Magistrate!

15
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,880
One can never know who is plotting violence, can one.

16
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,990
Or when they may commit the act.

17
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,070
Your wife, she moves ever closer, even as we speak.

18
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,310
My word is kept.

19
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,440
They're reunited.

20
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,010
You will become the greatest Lanistain the republic.

21
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,280
And as such a title we will climb beyond our station,

22
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,030
beyond Capua,

23
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,090
perhaps to the very steps of the Senate itself.

24
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,870
The fights are particularly entertaining today.

25
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,840
You'd enjoy them more viewed from the pulvinus.

26
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,250
Fucking shit eater.

27
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,610
Let Vettius preen like a woman.

28
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,310
You'll school him in the ways of men,

29
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,740
when Gannicus takes to the sands.

30
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,280
Ahh, absent Tullius and the Magistrate to bear witness,

31
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,120
what's the fucking purpose?

32
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,070
One man in today's games.

33
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,230
One only, and the seat sneeding to impress

34
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,920
stand empty as Vettius' fucking head.

35
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,370
Get up! Get up!

36
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,550
Solonius! What news?

37
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,470
Tullius and the Magistrate were delayed with pressing business,

38
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,290
but arrive shortly.

39
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,740
As long as the current match continues...

40
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,020
No.

41
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,090
Get up!

42
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,860
Good day!

43
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,400
Get up, get up you fuck...

44
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,880
Vettius begins the match without proper instruction?

45
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,820
Proper?

46
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,700
Vettius and the word are of distant relations.

47
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,300
I for one am grateful to be spared his oratory.

48
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,710
The man's voice causes skull to ache.

49
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,260
Gannicus takes position!

50
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,800
Now there's a fucking gladiator!

51
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,310
Take his fucking face off!

52
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,250
Begin!

53
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,550
Is your man ever of a serious note?

54
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,310
He'd strip naked and fight with his cock, as long as he wins.

55
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,660
Gannicus, I love you.

56
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,420
What is he doing Quintus...

57
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,360
Fucking kill him!

58
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,100
No!

59
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,140
Wait just a little while.

60
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,590
Gannicus, do not kill him.

61
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,540
Do not kill him.

62
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,750
Noooo!

63
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,750
Now they arrive.

64
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,960
A victory regardless.

65
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,680
Won in dewy morn.

66
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,790
None of the important matches happen

67
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,300
until after the midday sun has passed.

68
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,810
Consider yourself fortunate to have a man in the games at all.

69
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,540
Good Solonius stands with empty hands.

70
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,540
Come then.

71
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,490
Let us see them filled with drink.

72
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,690
Tell Doctore to see Gannicus back to the ludus.

73
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,040
And properly rewarded for his showing.

74
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,330
Can we not stay for the rest of the games?

75
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,370
Vettius' men command the prominent matches.

76
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,810
He has more than enough eyes to watch him stroke his cock.

77
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,750
I would not add ours to the sight.

78
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,130
Now you love me, Capua.

79
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,610
Doctore.

80
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,690
Dominus orders Gannicus returned to the ludus,

81
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,530
and seen to reward.

82
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,050
Perhaps one day the pretty little bitch

83
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,010
will fight later in the afternoon.

84
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,890
With the rest of the men.

85
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,680
You and your tiny cock best pray that day never come.

86
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,880
Save blood for the fucking sands, Gannicus.

87
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,350
What seized fucking brain,

88
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,960
releasing your swords in the arena?

89
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,260
I could have killed the man absent an arm

90
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,890
and both fucking legs.

91
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,820
Hubris.

92
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,430
A fine quality.

93
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,120
Often possessed by cunts who perish from it.

94
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,970
Did you catch the manner of his eye,

95
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,570
as he gazed down from the pulvinus?

96
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,760
Fucking Vettius.

97
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,080
Barely free of his mother's tit,

98
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,880
yet carries himself above lanistas

99
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,930
of more deserving years.

100
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,650
Youth often imagines itself swollen beyond its worth.

101
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,050
Time will cure him of the condition,

102
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,820
as it does all foolish young men.

103
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,080
Time is what he holds in abundance.

104
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,200
The new arena will be finished in but a handful of months.

105
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,410
If we are excluded from the opening games...

106
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,280
Vettius is but shit from a shit town.

107
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,240
How could Tullius and the Magistrate

108
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,670
favor a boy from Nola over Capua's own sons?

109
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,230
How do they do it now?

110
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,470
We must prove ourselves in the more important bouts

111
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,700
in the old arena and secure position.

112
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,570
To fight later in the day we must first distinguish ourselves

113
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,410
against Vettius' men.

114
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,200
Yet Vettius' men only fight later in the day.

115
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,130
A vexing conundrum.

116
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,740
Lucretia?!

117
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,540
Gaia!

118
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,720
Gaia!

119
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,120
How come you to Capua without telling me?

120
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,330
I have only this moment returned,

121
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,410
with intentions of seeking you out.

122
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,040
Do you travel with your husband?

123
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,240
He takes to road no more.

124
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,460
Not in this life, at least.

125
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,700
Apologies.

126
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,960
None required.

127
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,890
It was his time.

128
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,090
Are you occupied?

129
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,310
I am fit to bursting with stories of my adventures.

130
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,140
Quintus...?

131
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,600
What man dares stand between women and gossip?

132
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,000
You must tell me everything.

133
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,720
Secret no detail.

134
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,980
Removed from the ears of men, my lips willingly part...

135
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,970
Gaia returns unencumbered.

136
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,580
And in enticing form.

137
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,570
Huh, that woman is a force of fucking nature.

138
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,960
One that has blown many an unsuspecting man to his ruin.

139
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,450
You require someone more refined to grace armas

140
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,460
our fortunes rise.

141
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,690
Have eyes ever beheld such a marvel?

142
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,620
A sight to put the Circus Maximus in Rome to bitter shame.

143
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,950
We will be the ones shamed,

144
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,790
if grand ceremony passes absent our gladiators.

145
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,880
We must force advantage,

146
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,810
before opportunity slips from grasp.

147
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,510
No, we must be patient.

148
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,210
Your father would venture forth with respect and caution.

149
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,290
Then a blessing he is not present.

150
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,460
Perhaps we should send word to him in Sicilia,

151
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,460
petition advice...?

152
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,090
I can already divine content of his reply.

153
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,550
Which is why he never rose above his humble station.

154
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,350
Fuck patience!

155
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,810
Look to Tullius for the way!

156
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,620
He seizes opportunity by the balls

157
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,080
while lesser men are left holding cock!

158
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,870
A simple merchant,

159
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,220
yet he gives honored counsel to the Magistrate

160
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,290
and all the rest of the noble shit eaters of Capua.

161
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,900
Truth told, yet at excessive volume.

162
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,290
I would shout his praise to the fucking heavens.

163
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,810
His hands shaped events

164
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,160
resulting in the erection of the new arena.

165
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,290
He supplies slaves from the furthest reaches

166
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,940
of the Republic to speed its completion.

167
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,340
Through the ambitions of Tullius,

168
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,560
Capua is elevated.

169
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,970
A lesson to be studied, and reproduced in kind.

170
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,950
Is that all?

171
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,340
A simple task then, Batiatus.

172
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,860
Between us, we have the greatest gladiators in Capua.

173
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,770
Barca, Acadeus, Gannicus...

174
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,920
Men forged into something beyond their worth.

175
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,680
Beyond anything that smug little piss Vettius

176
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,080
could ever hope to offer...

177
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,690
Perhaps Tullius should not have strayed

178
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,460
so far abroad in acquiring his slaves.

179
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,280
Pick him up.

180
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,760
Crixus!

181
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,800
You know the rules.

182
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,210
No one breaks the line!

183
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,190
Hold!

184
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,810
This is one of good Tullius' slaves?

185
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,790
It is.

186
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,110
I would make purchase.

187
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,060
Purchase?

188
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,400
What's the man's worth?

189
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,850
He is not for sale.

190
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,220
Fifty denarii.

191
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,810
What are you doing?

192
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,060
Seizing balls.

193
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,990
The man is barely worth ten.

194
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,500
Why would you pay such a sum for a shit Gaul?

195
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,460
Shit?

196
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,740
Do you not see the promise in his eyes?

197
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,020
The spark smoldering in his breast?

198
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,680
I would give it tender, to ignite in the arena!

199
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,690
Fifty?

200
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,050
Add another five to weight your own purse.

201
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,940
Lend me twenty denarii.

202
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,620
You pay too much for the man.

203
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,010
The man is nothing.

204
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,690
I pay to gain favor with Tullius.

205
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,630
A waste of coin.

206
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,430
The shit fuck will never be a gladiator.

207
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,470
Even the lowest man can rise beyond the heavens,

208
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,220
if tempted with the proper reward...

209
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,860
He was well satisfied?

210
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,910
Very well.

211
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,880
Dominus will be pleased.

212
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,660
Not as much as I am.

213
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,540
When are you not so?

214
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,600
Especially with yourself?

215
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,090
It is a curse.

216
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,240
Being blessed with so much to offer.

217
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,080
And so few interested in sharing it.

218
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,370
See yourselves well scrubbed.

219
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,810
I would not have you smell of goat.

220
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,710
Goat?

221
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,820
A dead one.

222
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,430
The smell of victory, brother.

223
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,580
Well earned.

224
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,450
The men all speak of your triumph.

225
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,490
As they will of yours, when you return to the arena.

226
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,960
The crowd will cum in great geysers, drenching the gods

227
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:05,080
gathered to witness Oenomaus once more upon the sands!

228
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,920
I would have words with my wife.

229
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,350
Absent your cock, which has escaped you.

230
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,710
It will be missed.

231
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,350
Has Dominus spoken of my return?

232
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,800
I have not heard it.

233
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,250
More than a year has passed since I faced Theokoles.

234
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,300
Perhaps Dominus does not intend...

235
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,710
You were the only one to ever stand against

236
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,490
the Shadow of Death and live.

237
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,500
Batiatus would be a fool to keep you from the arena.

238
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,940
Or I am the fool,

239
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,520
for ever dreaming of such a thing.

240
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,830
You are many things.

241
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,890
Foolish is not among them.

242
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,010
Batiatus waits but for the perfect day

243
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,520
for his champion to retake glory.

244
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,050
Is it true?

245
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,530
That his thing is large as a horse's?

246
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,460
Diona!

247
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,130
Are you not curious?

248
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,260
Is Gannicus' really that big?

249
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,390
Where is Domina?

250
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,910
In the triclinium with her guest.

251
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,750
Diona, see the girls bathed.

252
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,800
Yes, Melitta.

253
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,980
It is exciting, speaking of such things, is it not?

254
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,790
I was of a similar age, not so long ago.

255
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,800
I know the giddy enticement of the subject.

256
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,380
Yet you and Diona should turn thought from it.

257
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,050
Soon enough your flowers will be plucked.

258
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:34,050
Hastening the moment will only result in bruising of the petals.

259
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,340
Yes, Melitta.

260
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,260
And in regards to Gannicus...

261
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,650
I've seen bigger.

262
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,130
Oh, you don't seem overly distraught at his passing.

263
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,450
How would you present,

264
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,030
after years enduring withered flesh groping at you.

265
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,420
But when you left Capua I thought you madly in love.

266
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,380
I was...with his purse.

267
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:05,300
Sadly his fortunes went dry towards the end.

268
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,950
And did you aid in their evaporation?

269
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,300
What can I say?

270
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,550
I am the glorious sun.

271
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,430
Returned to bless loving rays upon favored friend...

272
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,080
Gaia...

273
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,330
I have far too many baubles brought from Rome.

274
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,520
Along with other pleasures to be shared...

275
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,810
It suits you.

276
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,430
It would dazzle Venus herself.

277
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,480
I fear I have nothing so exquisite to give in return.

278
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,880
Your company is all I ever desire.

279
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,210
And...?

280
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,360
And, I would not refuse the comforts of a well appointed villa,

281
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,190
until I manage other arrangements...?

282
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,640
Involving a ripe purse?

283
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:27,050
So many years have passed, yet nothing has changed.

284
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,410
Everything has changed,

285
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,310
and for the better, by the judging of it.

286
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,570
When last we parted,

287
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,040
this house was but a tomb,

288
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,520
haunted by the living specter of your husband's father.

289
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,860
And you, forced to smile and cater,

290
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,900
bringing him his honeyed wine every evening.

291
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,060
I thought the crusty old bastard

292
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,870
would never succumb to the afterlife.

293
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,460
He is not yet so far removed.

294
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,200
Merely retired to Sicilia for his health.

295
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,320
So he yet controls the ludus?

296
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,050
No.

297
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,120
My husband does.

298
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,790
As his proxy.

299
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,920
Was Gannicus well attended then?

300
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,640
He was, Domina.

301
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,520
Gannicus?

302
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:18,930
That Celt with the ridiculously charming smile?

303
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,020
He has risen to prominence within the Ludus

304
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,100
ever since Oenomaus was injured against Theokoles.

305
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,620
In an amazing display of bravery.

306
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,590
Gannicus.

307
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,010
Oenomaus.

308
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:35,490
All the hard, rippling men right beneath our feet.

309
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,980
One moistens at the thought.

310
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,950
Gaia!

311
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,100
They are but slaves!

312
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,500
Please.

313
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,670
In all the years you've called this ludus home,

314
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,720
you've never once considered fucking one of them?

315
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,990
The very thought of that turns stomach.

316
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,510
I would never lay with any man besides my husband.

317
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,580
Let alone a filthy gladiator.

318
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,470
Fucking Gaul.

319
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,990
Another sacrifice to the gods of the arena.

320
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,160
Ze'irta kema atteta mezayyna, hada.

321
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,770
Ah, Dagan thinks you of a form,

322
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,810
giving odds in your favor.

323
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,050
Odds?

324
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,030
Do you know where you are, friend?

325
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,500
The House of Batiatus.

326
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,290
Trainer of gladiators.

327
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,150
Yes.

328
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,320
You stand among his latest recruits.

329
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,830
Bound by pain and blood,

330
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,200
together we toil beneath the cruel sting of Doctore's whip.

331
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,430
There were eight of us, when training began.

332
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,360
Now we're but three.

333
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,430
Four.

334
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,940
And how are we so blessed by a swelling number?

335
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,910
By what means do you find yourself

336
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,760
among such storied company?

337
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,290
My own.

338
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,550
You willingly present ass for fucking?

339
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,480
No,

340
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,910
no, young Indus.

341
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,890
Do you not see it in his eyes?

342
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:28,790
This is a man with dreams of blood and glory.

343
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,070
I doubt he'll live to see the test.

344
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,500
Test?

345
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,850
Our last trial.

346
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,240
We must all face one of the seasoned men,

347
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,930
and demonstrate to the Dominus what we have learned.

348
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,440
Live, and receive the Mark of the Brotherhood,

349
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,140
proving yourself worthy of the arena.

350
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,080
I will stand upon its sands.

351
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,070
Gammadta mezayyna.

352
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,200
Be-qushya matya maysaeri.

353
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,640
Hm, he longs to call you brother,

354
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,520
and join you as gladiator.

355
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,570
Tell him the feeling is well shared.

356
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,630
Oh, Jupiter's cock!

357
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:15,940
Fifty denarii, for a fucking stone hauler.

358
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,100
Coin well spent.

359
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,690
Was it?

360
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,210
Word surly has reached Tullius' ear,

361
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,100
yet none of gratitude return.

362
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,530
Fifty denarii!

363
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,170
Solonius was right.

364
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,740
I should temper patience, as my father would.

365
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,840
You're not your father.

366
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,840
Nor would I have it so.

367
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,970
Perhaps tomorrow you will find yourself in the market.

368
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,120
Where you have often mentioned Tullius

369
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,210
frequents upon a certain hour,

370
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,230
overseeing his concerns.

371
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,350
A chance encounter, to gauge reaction?

372
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,320
Certain to be favorable.

373
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,780
As I know your reply to my request will be.

374
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,420
Give it voice, and see it considered.

375
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,710
I would have Gaia remain with us.

376
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,290
Just for a few days,

377
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,180
until she can manage other arrangements.

378
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,160
The request does not surprise.

379
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,240
Is that a yes?

380
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:12,920
Ask for the moon,

381
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,820
and I would wrest it from the heavens.

382
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,380
Gaia will be so pleased at your answer.

383
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,760
Let her keep company with her wine a moment longer...

384
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:30,430
Has a wife ever had such a husband?

385
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,130
He but honors her...

386
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,670
and the gods for guiding her to his arms...

387
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,760
Crixus, you lower shield when you thrust.

388
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,320
See it raised, or your fucking brains on the sand.

389
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,770
Yes, Doctore.

390
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,540
A lucky blow.

391
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,970
A blow well struck.

392
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,850
I will not make the same mistake.

393
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,270
Good!

394
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,280
Again!

395
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,570
Doctore!

396
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,800
I would work the palus.

397
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,000
In the shade.

398
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,300
I would not let gaze linger.

399
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,600
Gannicus is a fucking fool,

400
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,440
yet one of deadly skill.

401
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,130
He is often rewarded for his victories

402
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,710
with wine and cunt.

403
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,300
Gain Dominus' favor,

404
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,030
and such delights could be yours.

405
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,150
Drink and women are not my concern.

406
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,910
Ah, more for me then.

407
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,060
Fucking recruits.

408
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,850
Smaller and smaller each year.

409
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,200
Apologies.

410
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,840
Oenomaus.

411
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,260
You return to form.

412
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,120
Pair with Crixus, and bring him to speed.

413
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,040
Dominus.

414
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,090
Gratitude.

415
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,560
For your instructions...

416
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,520
Lesson one: never drop your fucking guard.

417
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,780
Do you lay eyes?

418
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,980
No. Perhaps Tullius did not come today.

419
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,860
He always arrives,

420
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,230
and seldom departs before noonday sun.

421
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,490
Are you his shadow now, adhered to each footstep?

422
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,760
I but study my subject,

423
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,500
as any proper student would in pursuit of knowledge.

424
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,680
Tullius' man.

425
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,880
I seek your master, good Tullius.

426
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,280
Would he be within?

427
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,590
I wish to express my gratitude

428
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:00,720
for allowing me to purchase his slave Crixus.

429
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,640
The Gaul shows great promise towards the arena.

430
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,040
Perhaps you could pass word of my presence...

431
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,260
You owe me a few of those, if you recall.

432
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,210
A costly enterprise, for us both.

433
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,370
That one prays will turn profit.

434
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,580
Good Batiatus.

435
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,600
The gods answer...

436
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,730
In mocking tone.

437
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,420
I hoped for occasion to give gratitude

438
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,760
for relieving me of that troublesome Gaul.

439
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,130
Think nothing of it.

440
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,410
A gesture of respect, for a man deserving of it.

441
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,150
Received with all intentions.

442
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,890
Yet I fear you have overpaid.

443
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:46,290
A common mistake, for those with no head towards business.

444
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,140
Fifty denarii, minus the ten of the Gaul's actual worth.

445
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,420
I do not ask for its return.

446
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,710
Fair bargain was struck.

447
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,610
Fair?

448
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,310
A clumsy maneuver to gain position

449
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,700
for your ill-trained men.

450
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,690
Vettius.

451
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,890
Ill-trained?

452
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,400
Any one of my men could best yours fucking blindfolded,

453
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,490
you pissy little shit.

454
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,250
Listen how the rooster crows.

455
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,290
Let us calm ourselves...

456
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,410
You doubt my words?

457
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,340
Test them.

458
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,250
Request the match in next month's games.

459
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,230
Why delay?

460
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,240
Let us see it here in the morning,

461
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,750
the people to judge who holds the better man.

462
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,910
In the market?

463
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,090
Surely the Magistrate

464
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,660
would not approve such disruption.

465
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,300
Good Tullius has his ear.

466
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,610
The Magistrate could be swayed to allow it...

467
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,440
if that is what you wish?

468
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,880
It is.

469
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,840
And long past due.

470
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,640
Tomorrow then.

471
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,240
A friendly rivalry, well settled.

472
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,620
You press beyond advantage.

473
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,590
No.

474
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,230
I fucking press towards it.

475
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,870
You should have seen young Vettius,

476
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,460
so easily goaded into making challenge!

477
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,860
The fucking child!

478
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,110
All men are reduced in years,

479
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,910
when faced with superior mind.

480
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,010
Superior in all accounting!

481
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,520
A fact Tullius and the rest of the city

482
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,270
will bear witness to in the marketplace!

483
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,430
Sleep will come with difficulty tonight.

484
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,410
It's been ages since I've seen a decent match.

485
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,790
Or Tullius.

486
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,680
In the blush of youth,

487
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,530
he was forever attempting to slip beneath my robes.

488
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,270
You should have fucking let him.

489
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,770
Tullius has grown to be a man of worth.

490
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,940
One to be emulated and admired.

491
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,730
And who will you choose to impress him?

492
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,510
Vettius' foolishness presents rare opportunity.

493
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,940
The question begs careful consideration...

494
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,570
I have news to lift the heart.

495
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,630
Vettius has made challenge.

496
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,170
The coward finds his cock.

497
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,090
And I would see it shriveled.

498
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:46,700
My bestman is to meet his dog in the marketplace come morning.

499
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,580
The market?

500
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,130
Ah, detail of no consequence.

501
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,000
My question to you is plain.

502
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:54,360
Is our man prepared for such a vital match?

503
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,530
Yes, Dominus.

504
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,830
I long to honor this house once again.

505
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,570
No, I fear you have mistaken intentions.

506
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,410
I speak of Gannicus.

507
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,460
Gannicus.

508
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,220
The question would be better put to Doctore.

509
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,060
Leave.

510
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,740
His counsel is always valued,

511
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,260
yet he is my father's man.

512
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,550
His judgment clouded through

513
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,490
a haze of outdated traditions.

514
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:37,380
I seek a more visceral assessment.

515
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,610
You and I practically grew up together in this ludus.

516
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:43,280
You have witnessed the rise and fall of a dozen champions.

517
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,720
What now does your gut tell you of Gannicus?

518
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:51,070
Is he worthy of the mantle?

519
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,370
I believe it so.

520
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,090
He must truly be,

521
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:02,630
for you to offer support despite your own desires.

522
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,210
I would not give false tongue to gain advantage.

523
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,420
There are few that would stand with you so.

524
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,170
Your wife's weekly visit.

525
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,690
Two nights hence?

526
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:13,730
Yes Dominus.

527
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,750
I would see her to your bed tonight as well.

528
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,870
In gratitude for honest thoughts.

529
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,380
Dominus.

530
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,450
Do the gods ever answer your prayers?

531
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:33,150
They often reveal their leanings, though not in words.

532
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,040
Much like my husband.

533
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,330
Dominus summoned me.

534
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,670
To ask of Gannicus.

535
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,820
Gannicus?

536
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,410
He has chosen him as champion,

537
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:48,660
he is to face Vettius' man in the marketplace tomorrow.

538
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,160
And this is why you sulk?

539
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,380
The streets are no place

540
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:57,000
for the mighty Oenomaus to make his return.

541
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,820
The arena will be home to your triumphs,

542
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,890
when the time comes.

543
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,760
And I will be there to witness it...

544
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,940
I will dream of your touch.

545
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:50,510
As I dream of yours every night.

546
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,660
Blood rains down

547
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,810
My cock rages on

548
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,050
The blood rains down, from an angry sky

549
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:18,130
My cock rages on, my cock rages on...

550
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,240
Gannicus!

551
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,460
Brother!

552
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,970
Brother come, drink, join me!

553
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:23,930
Lower voice!

554
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,530
If the Guards were to hear you...

555
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,980
The guards have already passed.

556
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,950
And were well plied with wine

557
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:31,150
to keep nose from fucking business.

558
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,860
Tomorrow you fight for the honor of this ludus.

559
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,220
Now is not the time for drink.

560
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,520
Every night is time for drink.

561
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,660
For the morning sun may greet you

562
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:46,960
with your last fucking day.

563
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,600
Fall to your bed.

564
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,220
Or risk steeper plummet against Vettius' man.

565
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,980
Words of wisdom, well received, well, well, received.

566
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,830
Oenomaus?

567
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,740
It should be you tomorrow.

568
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,990
Where is good Vettius?

569
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,360
Is he among you?

570
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,890
Or did he come to sense, and remain within

571
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:31,530
the warm safety of his bed?

572
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,130
There he stands!

573
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,980
Fresh and young as a newborn calf!

574
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,500
The fool at last shows himself.

575
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,600
Batiatus.

576
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,240
We had begun to fret on your arrival.

577
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,570
Although I see you arrive with unexpected gift...

578
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,550
It has been too long, Gaia.

579
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,190
And grows longer still.

580
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,830
Apologies for my delay.

581
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,180
I had much difficulty in the choosing of a man.

582
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,400
An imposing task,

583
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,220
when each among my stable stands a titan!

584
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,560
Perhaps good Vettius should have taken more time

585
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,440
with the choosing of his own.

586
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,460
Words fall from your mouth, as shit from ass.

587
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,560
Let us not become mired in base exchange.

588
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,960
We are gathered this glorious day

589
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:20,750
to witness honorable contest between respected rivals.

590
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,060
Clear space!

591
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,170
The years have favored Tullius.

592
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,890
And his purse.

593
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,870
A brawl in the streets.

594
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,970
Where is the honor in such a thing?

595
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,390
Fuck honor.

596
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,010
This is business.

597
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:41,460
Gratitude to Magistrate Sextus

598
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,430
The event turns larger than expected.

599
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,470
- For allowing such thrilling event.  - Your mad schemes may yet bear fruit.

600
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,980
Enough for both of us to feast upon.

601
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,810
In the streets of the great city of Capua!

602
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,470
Batiatus.

603
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,470
Present your man.

604
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,350
In honor of the Magistrate, esteemed Tullius,

605
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,600
and the good people of Capua...

606
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,260
I give you the fearless Gaul ever

607
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,790
to take up arms in the arena!

608
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,490
Slayer of beasts!

609
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,390
Conqueror of giants!

610
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:19,190
Behold Gannicus!

611
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,390
Champion of the House of Batiatus!

612
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,520
A fine choice.

613
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,490
Vettius.

614
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:34,900
Present your man.

615
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,850
I have no tongue for overripe embellishment.

616
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,440
Nor is it required.

617
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,280
Otho! Stand forth!

618
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,410
Your day finally comes.

619
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,970
And yours ends.

620
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,900
Gratitude to Batiatus and Vettius.

621
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:01,780
Now, let us judge who stands the better house!

622
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,110
Apologies, Magistrate.

623
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,060
There appears to be something missing.

624
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,350
Where is your man's blindfold?

625
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,280
Blindfold?

626
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,340
What the fuck...

627
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,000
That was your boast, was it not?

628
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:32,570
That your gladiator could best any of my men absent sight...?

629
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,620
You did voice such challenge.

630
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:43,450
A simple figure of speech, not meant to be...

631
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,230
Good Tullius...

632
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:47,020
If Batiatus does not wish to honor terms,

633
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,760
he should remove himself.

634
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,970
With tail between legs.

635
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,780
Doctore.

636
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:07,980
Come...

637
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,650
the task should not be that difficult.

638
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,870
I need only direct my blades towards the smell of shit.

639
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,800
Gannicus. Ever the fool.

640
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,310
You are going to allow this, Quintus?

641
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,490
The choice has been removed from my hands.

642
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,450
Begin!

643
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:02,790
Yes!

644
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,200
How thrilling.

645
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,490
I have never seen such a thing.

646
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,190
For good reason.

647
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,230
A noble attempt.

648
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,630
To be remembered only in its failing.

649
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,360
Get up!

650
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,350
Yes!

651
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,990
Fucking kill him!

652
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,250
Yes!

653
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,010
Have you ever fucking seen the like?

654
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:24,840
Perhaps good Vettius should pit a man less prone to death

655
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,780
against the mighty Gannicus!

656
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,940
An impressive display, Batiatus.

657
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,740
One not soon forgotten.

658
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,210
Gannicus is truly a wonder.

659
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:37,500
One deserving more prominent position in the games.

660
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,510
You gaze upon my very thoughts.

661
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,380
Commitments beckon.

662
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,220
Join me at Nestor's shop after the market closes,

663
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,030
and we shall discuss your man at length.

664
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:07,610
Only mad Gannicus could win contest fucking blindfolded!

665
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,410
Barca could do the same!

666
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,600
And I would kill you for being a fool.

667
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,190
Auctus speaks truth.

668
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:19,720
Facing Vettius' man absent sight was beyond foolish.

669
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:23,850
The gods must have taken pity on your addled brain.

670
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:26,400
The gods had naught to do with it.

671
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:30,330
Otho he grunts like a stuck pig before each attack.

672
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:33,130
His squeals they gave way position!

673
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,890
Your victory lifts the heart.

674
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,240
You will not be rid of Gannicus so easily brother.

675
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,910
Dominus he rewards me with all the wine

676
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:48,840
that I can drink and I would share it with my brothers!

677
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,190
Those that bear the mark.

678
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,870
One day.

679
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,160
Gannicus' victory forges path to greater glory.

680
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,280
With Tullius' support,

681
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,620
we can finally gain proper position in games!

682
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,200
Maybe a place in the opening ceremony of the new arena.

683
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:13,960
After such a magnificent showing,

684
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,270
I have no doubt Gannicus

685
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:17,720
will be offered a place in the primus.

686
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:18,870
Primus...

687
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:23,620
Yeah, I favor the fucking sound of that.

688
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,260
Expect late return.

689
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,320
I would seek out Solonius afterwards,

690
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,770
to discuss extending advantage to his house as well.

691
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:36,160
Send Tullius my regards.

692
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,760
And gauge his response in remembering me.

693
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:43,140
How could he fucking forget you.

694
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:50,430
It staggers mind, the change in him.

695
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,080
Change?

696
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:53,390
You know my meaning.

697
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,220
He always seemed so...

698
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,930
demure and cowed.

699
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:59,170
Now he positively burns.

700
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:01,620
He has always done so.

701
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:05,100
His light was merely muted by the shadow of his father.

702
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,810
The man could turn day to night with disapproving frown.

703
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,900
He never cared much for me.

704
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:18,900
Or, I suspect, anything that smacked of enjoyment...

705
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,230
And what might this be?

706
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,760
More gifts from Rome.

707
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:31,120
The finest opium, carried from Cyprus.

708
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:38,370
I have not partaken in many years.

709
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,600
My husband...

710
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,170
Will be gone most of the night...

711
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,710
Good Batiatus.

712
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,790
Word of Gannicus' victory has spread throughout the city.

713
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:58,400
His name- and yours- fall from every mouth.

714
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,970
May they always find the taste pleasing.

715
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,470
Everyone clamors to see your man again.

716
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,060
With exception of poor Vettius.

717
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,890
He is fit for seizure from the ordeal.

718
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,150
Unfortunate.

719
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:12,870
That he could not provide more worthy opponent.

720
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,870
Yet his stock is well known to be of inferior quality,

721
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:16,460
as is the boy himself.

722
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,950
The manner in which he tends the ludus.

723
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:21,890
The child has no fucking talent for it.

724
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,040
You surprise me, Batiatus.

725
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,290
Your disposition towards business is much more...

726
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:30,710
aggressive than your father's.

727
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,560
We are of diverging temperament.

728
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,030
And desires.

729
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:38,540
How does he fare in Sicilia?

730
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:42,400
The clime is more agreeable to various conditions

731
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,790
brought about by the passing of the years.

732
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:48,480
How did the Magistrate take to Gannicus' display?

733
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,670
Ignited by it, as was the crowd.

734
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,660
He even broached subject of retaining the man

735
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,060
for the opening games of the new arena.

736
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,220
Gannicus in the opening games?

737
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,250
If you could aid in such a thing,

738
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,300
I would forever be in your debt.

739
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,580
It merely requires a word in the proper ear.

740
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:12,160
All that remains is to agree upon a price.

741
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:16,360
Ah, of course I would be happy to see coin to your hand

742
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:18,160
in exchange for assistance.

743
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,610
What, err, sum did you have in mind?

744
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,580
You misunderstand, Batiatus.

745
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,460
I do not offer a broker arrangement.

746
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,200
I offer to purchase your man.

747
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:37,590
Purchase? But why would you want a gladiator?

748
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:38,750
You're not a lanista.

749
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,520
Jupiter's cock, no.

750
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,030
Yet I have many vested interests in

751
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:45,460
shipping goods and services.

752
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,060
This very shop.

753
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,260
And young Vettius' ludus.

754
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,530
Look at the little fuck now.

755
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,860
About to shit himself.

756
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:01,360
Still your tongue.

757
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:03,600
The grownups are talking.

758
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:08,810
Two hundred denarii.

759
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,810
A generous offer.

760
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,980
In respect of your father.

761
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:15,840
Apologies.

762
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:18,770
I would not part with the man.

763
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:26,070
I allowed you to purchase one of my slaves.

764
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:29,280
Yet now you deny me the same opportunity?

765
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:32,040
Gannicus is not for sale.

766
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:36,850
Everything is for sale, Batiatus.

767
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,960
The question is but price.

768
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,500
I make fair offer.

769
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:01,750
And you produce cock to piss on me.

770
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,630
Do you know what that feels like, Batiatus?

771
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,270
Reconsider your answer.

772
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,410
Or be excluded from the games forever.

773
00:50:35,410 --> 00:51:33,410

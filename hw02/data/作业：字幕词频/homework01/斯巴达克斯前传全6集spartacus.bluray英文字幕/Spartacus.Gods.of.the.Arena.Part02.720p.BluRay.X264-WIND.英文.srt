1
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,960
Reconsider your answer.

2
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,600
Or be excluded from the games forever.

3
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,860
This is not the time.

4
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,460
Let us not broach subject again.

5
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,630
Quintus why are you from bed?

6
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,800
The Medicus gave plain instruction you are to rest.

7
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,810
A week upon my back sees advice well heeded.

8
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,480
More and even my cock will cease knowing how to stand.

9
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,480
His spirit returns.

10
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,320
I am not a babe new dropped from fucking womb.

11
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,820
See meat and wine set out.

12
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,990
Yes, Domina.

13
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,490
I always follow the wine.

14
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,590
Your wounds, they are less gruesome.

15
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,130
Has she not yet found some fool's bed to fall to yet?

16
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,130
Or is her sole intent in Capua to drink us dry?

17
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,800
She has been of great comfort.

18
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,300
And seeks the word for herself.

19
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,610
Who do you think dried my tears,

20
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,110
when my husband was returned to me,

21
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,110
bloodied and broken?

22
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,610
His life in question?

23
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,280
I live.

24
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,280
And continue thoughts towards doing so.

25
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,350
I would not see my injuries wound you as well.

26
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,130
Oh, it is a balm, to see you on your feet.

27
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,600
You're going to speak to the magistrate about this?

28
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,440
Towards what end?

29
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,940
Quintus...

30
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,780
He is a puppet.

31
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,450
What redress would Sextus offer,

32
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,120
when the man who grieved me holds his strings?

33
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,290
Tullius has always been a favored son of Capua.

34
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,290
I can not believe he would be capable of doing such a thing.

35
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,730
A man of ambition is capable of anything.

36
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,770
My dealings with the magistrate take precedence tomorrow.

37
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,770
I would have you greet Varus in my stead.

38
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,100
The honor would be mine.

39
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,940
The man pisses wine and shits gold.

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,270
Varus is but a stream leading to an ocean of coin.

41
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,280
One I would see break wave upon our steps.

42
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,780
He comes to choose men?

43
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,110
For the games of the Vinalia,

44
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,950
to ensure his vines bear fruit in the coming year.

45
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,650
I will present only our finest gladiators.

46
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,790
I would enrich our stock, and offer him Gannicus as well.

47
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,000
This had best be the Falernian promised.

48
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,270
If I find you've served your usual swill,

49
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,940
we will have words.

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,770
Put mind to ease.

51
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,110
Tullius.

52
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,110
Note sun and mountains etched in the amphora,

53
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,110
proof of its authenticity.

54
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,610
Yes, of course.

55
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,580
I was unaware you had an appreciation for such tastes,

56
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,820
Solonius.

57
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,450
A gift for a friend recovering from unfortunate injury.

58
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,120
Please.

59
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,130
Allow me.

60
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,590
Generous, but unnecessary.

61
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,360
I believe it is.

62
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,740
I've done nothing to deserve it.

63
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,410
A matter shortly to be rectified.

64
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,410
Come, I would discuss message to be delivered with our gift.

65
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,150
Better received from your tongue than mine.

66
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,080
The Gaul is quite the beast.

67
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,250
What name does he take?

68
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,580
Apologies, I do not know.

69
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,250
His name is Crixus.

70
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,750
He trains in the style of Murmillo.

71
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,760
You have an interest in the games.

72
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,160
Or does it land only upon the men who play them?

73
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,060
So easily made to blush.

74
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,570
A sign of tragic inexperience.

75
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,040
I have not turned such a color since before you were born.

76
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,240
How I envy your youth.

77
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:15,410
And all the wonders you have yet to discover.

78
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,250
Do not be afraid to pursue every delight this world has to offer.

79
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,420
Melitta cautions patience.

80
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,020
Plucking flowers too quickly will bruise the petals.

81
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,580
Words from a mouth

82
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,530
that has only known her husband's cock.

83
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,080
You charge like a crazed goat,

84
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,090
absent thought.

85
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,590
When faced with stronger opponent,

86
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,360
draw him to you, then counter.

87
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,730
Again.

88
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,460
Finally words find way through your thick skull.

89
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,890
Crixus.

90
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,400
Join the recruits, continue your training.

91
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,530
Yes, Doctore.

92
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,570
The mighty Gaul returns.

93
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,210
Or is it his corpse, too stubborn to fall to grass?

94
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,910
Kusita ze'irta hareta.

95
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,420
Ah, Dagan expresses his joy at finding you yet among us.

96
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,920
We feared you fated for the mines,

97
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,220
with all the sand you have been eating.

98
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,430
An acquired taste.

99
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,400
Come, I should serve you some more.

100
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,910
You've done well with the man.

101
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,910
Crixus is undisciplined, but not without promise.

102
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,980
Brings to thought a wild fuck I schooled,

103
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,580
when we yet called Batiatus' father Dominus.

104
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,420
I yet feel the sting of your lessons.

105
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,090
Their knowledge now bestowed upon simple recruits.

106
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,260
I will seek word with Batiatus,

107
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,330
towards your return to the arena.

108
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,730
- Gratitude, Doctore... - Close fucking mouth.

109
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,950
I but seek not to have wasted long years

110
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,570
of pulling your head from your ass.

111
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,220
Doctore.

112
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,550
I require a more worthy opponent.

113
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,720
Perhaps if Oenomaus is finished sipping drink?

114
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,520
Instruct Gannicus in the ways of a true champion.

115
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,900
Do you recall Magnetius, when he fought Trux of the East?

116
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,380
A glorious victory.

117
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,780
Ah, for my father.

118
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,420
Hadrianus.

119
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,290
Acerbitas.

120
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,060
Dolor.

121
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,970
Zephyros.

122
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,710
My father's champions. My grandfather's champions.

123
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,880
The storied history of the house of Batiatus.

124
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,550
With new chapters yet to be added.

125
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,620
Etched upon what tablet?

126
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,960
I'm excluded from the games,

127
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,860
or has such details slipped memory's grasp?

128
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,200
Apologies. I did not mean...

129
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,130
Fault is mine for bearing teeth at trusted friend.

130
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,440
Gratitude for the gift.

131
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,870
It's well received.

132
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,540
I claim only its delivery.

133
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,710
He's willing to see his bid for Gannicus doubled.

134
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,220
If accepted, he will grant your men strong position

135
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,890
in the upcoming games of the Vinalia.

136
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,220
This wine is from Tullius?

137
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,890
I did not seek him out.

138
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,720
He approached me in the marketplace,

139
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,800
expressing regret that his business with you turned to excess.

140
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,700
He even paid for the wine that I'd selected for you.

141
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,600
A gesture of goodwill.

142
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,660
Do you see these marks upon me?

143
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,400
We must consider...

144
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,340
- Do you fucking see them?!  - I see them.

145
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,110
That is the man's true gesture, the only to be considered.

146
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,350
You counsel to suck the cock that pisses on me!

147
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,750
I merely counsel reason, as your father would.

148
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,360
To what purpose?

149
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,160
He brings word and gift from Tullius,

150
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,160
who yet seeks Gannicus to swell his ranks.

151
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,170
After what he fucking did to you?

152
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:14,790
Let us sweep aside such petty grievances in service of reason and reward

153
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,640
he offers twice the sum refused.

154
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,510
And what, I wonder, does good Solonius receive for

155
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,680
convincing me to spread cheeks and accept deeper ramming?

156
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,850
I would share equal position in the games.

157
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,190
You are in remarkable condition, to claim my reflection.

158
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:40,260
Our fates move towards similar end, despite outward appearance.

159
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,790
Refuse Tullius' offer,

160
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,330
and I shall join you in exclusion from the arena.

161
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,500
He makes such a threat?

162
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,770
With exacting clarity.

163
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,740
I did not mean to see you burdened so.

164
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,550
I will think upon the matter.

165
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,050
Tullius requires answer.

166
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,920
I require a fucking moment!

167
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,490
He wishes to present your man to Quintilius Varus tomorrow.

168
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,190
Varus? He comes to Capua?

169
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,200
Vettius is to meet him as he enters the city midday.

170
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,730
I held his acquaintance in Rome, a man of great influence.

171
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,270
And coin.

172
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,540
You would beg for Tullius' scraps?

173
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,210
Without them, I fear we shall both go hungry.

174
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,880
Think upon it.

175
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,850
And know that I stand with you, whatever your decision.

176
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,320
I have witnessed greater spine within a snail.

177
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,030
What are your thoughts?

178
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,040
Doctore!

179
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,740
Send that fucking man to the mines!

180
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,850
Do it!

181
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,050
No, Doctore!

182
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,890
No, please! Doctore!

183
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,560
Dominus...

184
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,260
We do not surrender in this fucking house!

185
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,200
I'll see these walls fall to ruin before Missio is given!

186
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,500
It appears decision is made.

187
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,710
Gannicus will one day stand the champion of Capua.

188
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,880
For the house of Batiatus.

189
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,080
How do we manage such honor, if excluded from the games?

190
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,390
Tullius but brokers interest.

191
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,190
If a man of wealth and position such as Varus requested my men,

192
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,200
even he would be unable to refuse.

193
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,860
He meets with Vettius.

194
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,200
You expect that fucking child to make introduction?

195
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:02,840
No, I expect him to bleed, as I rip Varus from his grasp.

196
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,650
Halt!

197
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,060
Rest!

198
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,890
Eat!

199
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,840
Ah, your numbers shrink like frightened cock.

200
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,140
I would laugh as well

201
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,320
Shevuq leh. Barca yomeh yehweh leh bassima.

202
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,000
A man is condemned to the mines, and they all fucking jest?

203
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,330
If it were a brother lost, you would find the mood solemn.

204
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,970
We must earn the fucking mark to gain respect.

205
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,680
Or follow Indus to his fate.

206
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,180
I will not die a faceless slave, forgotten by history.

207
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,680
We shall rise together.

208
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,690
One day all the Republic will marvel at the sight of us.

209
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,300
Fucking savages.

210
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,600
They pissed in the porridge.

211
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,220
Ah, I have had my fill.

212
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,530
Oh, finally, someone who can hold their wine!

213
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,660
I did not realize we were for company.

214
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,160
He leaves presently.

215
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,330
Oh please, after we have finished the jug.

216
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,170
The last of my spoils to be shared with dearest of friends.

217
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,670
Replace dearest with only, and sentiment becomes truth.

218
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,670
Hmm, subtle argument,

219
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,010
who was the better man as we sparred today?

220
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,840
My husband.

221
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,180
You are swayed by the title of wife.

222
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,680
One day we shall face each other upon the sand,

223
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,020
and have true decision.

224
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,020
What would really happen?

225
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,860
If you had to face each other, sine missione?

226
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,990
No quarter given, no mercy shown?

227
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,000
I would give your husband a glorious death.

228
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,160
You joke of killing a man you love.

229
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,500
When someday you may be asked to.

230
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,500
Oh, you two are a perfect match, are you not.

231
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,510
Both always fretting about what tomorrow may bring.

232
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,180
We are slaves.

233
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,680
Burden of choice and conscience equally removed.

234
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,520
We are truly free when we fight.

235
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,520
Or when we fuck which I shall leave to do presently.

236
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,860
It is you and my husband who are of a perfect match.

237
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,360
One hides true thought in brooding silence.

238
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,830
The other in boastful jest,

239
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,330
meant to hold all at a fair distance.

240
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,830
- Melitta... - I do not hold you at a distance.

241
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,870
You are my two favorite women in this world.

242
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,340
And what happens brave Gannicus, when presented with circumstance

243
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,210
you cannot laugh or fight your way clear of?

244
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,250
Well, I may have to fuck my way clear of it.

245
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,990
Good night!

246
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,840
Gannicus...

247
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,840
Never come up upon my back.

248
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,510
Apologies.

249
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,750
I seek only advice for coming days.

250
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,690
Heed Oenomaus' instruction, you will earn your brand.

251
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,020
Till then, you stay from sight.

252
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,300
It is not the brand that concerns me.

253
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,500
It is becoming champion.

254
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,740
There is only one way to become champion.

255
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,480
Never fucking lose.

256
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,020
See Barca readied.

257
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,520
He is to accompany me into the city.

258
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,460
Another stunt in the market?

259
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,860
Does my last bodyguard's death fucking elude?

260
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,160
Barca is to serve as such? He is a gladiator, not...

261
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,830
He is whatever I fucking say.

262
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,000
Have the Syrians also prepared.

263
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,000
Absent shackles and clothed for the streets.

264
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,840
Ashur and Dagan, what use do you see them to?

265
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,000
None of your concern.

266
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,170
With respect, Dominus, I am the Doctore.

267
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,340
The men are my only concern.

268
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,780
A duty awarded you by my father.

269
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,680
A man who would not condemn a promising recruit

270
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,850
to the mines out of a mood.

271
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,960
Recruits, gladiators,

272
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,190
even you are but slaves.

273
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,820
Mine to command, despite my fucking moods.

274
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,330
You truly believe this man ripe with potential?

275
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,300
Indus will never be champion, but he is not without skill.

276
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,010
Have him loaded with the Syrians.

277
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,180
I will give him opportunity to prove his worth.

278
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,040
Dominus.

279
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:50,350
Has Venus herself ever appeared in such rare form?

280
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,690
You blaspheme.

281
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,990
Frequently and with great relish.

282
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,160
Where is Gaia?

283
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,660
The appointed hour is upon us.

284
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,330
She stands ready.

285
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,830
- Quintus... - Do not give voice to doubt.

286
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,600
We are committed, and will see this to its end.

287
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,850
You each know your parts.

288
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,680
See this act to successful completion,

289
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,190
and earn the mark of the brotherhood.

290
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,020
Without proving ourselves in the test?

291
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,520
This is your test.

292
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,660
But turn thoughts toward escape or fail in your charge,

293
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,830
and I will have you parted from your cocks and crucified.

294
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,670
You're clear to your purpose?

295
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,570
Yes, Dominus.

296
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,640
Take up your positions, and await my signal.

297
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,350
I do not trust the Syrians.

298
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,020
If this does not end in our favor,

299
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,360
they will appear as common thieves.

300
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,060
Absent my fucking mark upon arm.

301
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,170
Oh, this will never work.

302
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,340
Of course it will, look at you.

303
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,170
What man or otherwise, could resist such charms?

304
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,680
Gaia...

305
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,350
Oh, still fluttering heart.

306
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,520
I would not deny myself such pleasures if presented again,

307
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,020
yet necessities shift attention to cock.

308
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,850
And a golden one at that.

309
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,690
You set eyes towards Varus?

310
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,160
He is without wife, last I heard.

311
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,730
We do this to aid my husband, not to secure one of your own...

312
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,670
He arrives.

313
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,000
Let us end discussion and set mind to purpose.

314
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,170
Good Vettius! Thank the gods I have found you.

315
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,830
Your gratitude is misplaced.

316
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,100
I do not know you.

317
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,400
I am Varus' man.

318
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:23,170
He sends word of pressing desire to see the new arena,

319
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,340
before retiring to business.

320
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,680
The arena? No.

321
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,480
I am of clear instruction to meet him as he enters the city.

322
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,520
Of course... Apologies.

323
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,820
I will deliver word of your refusal.

324
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,060
Wait.

325
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,330
Varus is honored guest.

326
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,200
As such, I am but humble servant.

327
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:59,480
It's quicker I think, if we pass through here.

328
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,210
Apologies, for the inconvenience.

329
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,710
Dominus will be most pleased that you've accompanied me.

330
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,150
You've turned yourself about.

331
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,950
This is not the direction of the fucking arena.

332
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,220
No.

333
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,990
It is not.

334
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:55,160
We are to leave this one alive, you simple fuck!

335
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,340
'Aved-leh.

336
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,560
Our charge is met.

337
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,900
I will not see the mines.

338
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,100
I fear they would have been a blessing.

339
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,740
Apologies, brother. Vettius saw your face.

340
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,340
Dominus gave instruction.

341
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,700
Where the fuck is Vettius?

342
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,540
Quintilius?

343
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,380
- It is you! - Gaia!

344
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,380
What finds you in such horrid climes?

345
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,980
A visit to see dearest friend.

346
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:22,220
Lucretia!

347
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:26,170
Lucretia and her husband Batiatus are the saving grace

348
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,890
of this ill-bred town.

349
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,030
This is Quintilius Varus,

350
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:32,700
an acquaintance of my late husband.

351
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,860
His wine is the toast of Rome.

352
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:37,030
Your tongue has lost none of its silver.

353
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,470
It is an honor.

354
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,700
And what good fortune blesses Capua with your presence?

355
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,040
I come to choose gladiators for the Vinalia.

356
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:46,380
Or would if young Vettius ever deigns to appear.

357
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:51,050
We shall entertain you with diverting conversation while you wait.

358
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,220
I fear it shall be tragically one sided.

359
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,380
The sun threatens to bake me senseless.

360
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:59,290
We can not have such esteemed guest expire so, can we?

361
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,360
Well, my husband's villa is but a little ways from here.

362
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,530
- You'd be more than welcome... - Gratitude.

363
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,530
But I would seek Vettius out,

364
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,770
and put foot to ass for his delay.

365
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,200
Lucretia's slaves know the man.

366
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,370
It would be just as easy for them to

367
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,040
bring him to her villa when discovered.

368
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,880
It would give us much needed pause to reacquaint ourselves.

369
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:26,220
Well, it would be ungrateful, to refuse such kind offering.

370
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,550
Your villa, then.

371
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,950
My husband will be most pleased to receive you.

372
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,990
What good fortune to run into you...

373
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,710
The last time I was graced with Gaia's presence

374
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:54,080
was at some sober, airless affair, hosted by um,

375
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,510
oh, what was the man's name?

376
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,350
- Atticus. - Atticus! Yes!

377
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,250
Desiccated specimen.

378
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,350
I fear without Gaia's charms, pronounced boredom

379
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,620
would have carried me to the afterlife that very night.

380
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,020
Oh, my husband returns.

381
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,190
Fetch more wine.

382
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,330
Lucretia, apologies.

383
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,500
I did not realize we were to entertain.

384
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,670
An unexpected pleasure, chanced upon in the city.

385
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,500
Quintilius Varus, an old friend from Rome.

386
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:23,840
Ahh, the name is not unfamiliar. You honor us with your presence.

387
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,010
The honor is mine, to fall upon such

388
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,180
warm hospitality.

389
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,010
Ah, forgive unsightly countenance.

390
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,180
A mount, long trusted, threw me from purchase.

391
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,520
One must be cautious, when dealing with such animals.

392
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:39,290
Yeah, a lesson painfully learned.

393
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,990
What finds you so far from Rome?

394
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,090
Games, of the Vinalia.

395
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,330
You come to choose men?

396
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,000
I have many fine offerings. Gannicus, in particular...

397
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,070
Apologies... You are a Lanista?

398
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,840
Uh, he has already set purpose towards Vettius' men.

399
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:00,680
Ahh, well, fill cup and strike ill-spoken words from mind.

400
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,010
Thing of no concern.

401
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,350
Vettius will see you well attended.

402
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,950
At considerable savings.

403
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,850
Do I appear so light of purse, to require such?

404
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,690
You have never been so taken with the games.

405
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,160
I only assumed you would not waste

406
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,490
excessive coin towards them.

407
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,160
True yet the gods must be properly honored.

408
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:24,070
And Vettius remains annoyingly absent.

409
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,740
Your men.

410
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,370
How stand they in comparison to the boy's?

411
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,340
Well, I would not speak ill of a brother Lanista.

412
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,680
You are too modest.

413
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,680
Vettius offers shit.

414
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,850
I was told by good Tullius that his stable is well stocked.

415
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,350
The boy chooses gladiators as carelessly as his wine.

416
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,860
High quantity, of the lowest quality.

417
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,730
Come let us sample a finer vintage.

418
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,670
Please.

419
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,510
Doctore!

420
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,820
Gladiators, form up!

421
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,690
Present yourselves!

422
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,560
Batiatus, Batiatus, Batiatus!

423
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,500
Did I not tell you?

424
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,670
The finest gladiators in all of Capua.

425
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,500
Hmm, a demonstration, perhaps?

426
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,340
Of course.

427
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,470
Gannicus! Step forward.

428
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,680
Behold! My finest champion!

429
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,410
No man stands his equal.

430
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:47,520
And who would you have face this God of the arena?

431
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,690
Barca perhaps or Oenomaus, who fought so bravely...

432
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,350
How about the Gaul?

433
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,880
Who would not marvel at seeing

434
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,260
such a creature locked in mortal embrace.

435
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,000
Crixus? Apologies the man does not yet

436
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,830
bear the mark of the brotherhood.

437
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,670
Yet he is presented.

438
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:07,000
I fear such a match would be overly brief.

439
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,370
A blessing, considering the heat.

440
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,510
Well, let us move to it then.

441
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,880
Crixus!

442
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,780
Step forward!

443
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,330
A fucking jest.

444
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,510
The house of Batiatus is humbled

445
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:36,330
by the attentions of Quintilius Varus.

446
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,000
Let us show him they are not unwarranted.

447
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,170
Apologies, are they to use those little wooden sticks?

448
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,840
Well, it is the tradition, when blood is not the purpose.

449
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,690
So they are to fight as children,

450
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:49,650
not men?

451
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,680
Why, I would not see you to such an impression.

452
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,350
Doctore!

453
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,520
Have wood give way to steel.

454
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,160
Gladius!

455
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,840
The gods have heard you.

456
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:24,080
They present opportunity to become champion.

457
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,020
Begin!

458
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,570
Oenomaus has trained you well.

459
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,080
Yet you are pale imitation of the man.

460
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,790
You lie! I did no such thing!

461
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,730
Another one of us falls this day.

462
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,410
A fine attempt.

463
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,950
Have there ever before been such a demonstration?

464
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,660
What say you, good Varus?

465
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,990
Should the Gaul live or die?

466
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,600
Well, Gaia chose the man, let the choice be hers.

467
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,810
Let him live.

468
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:44,250
He may yet find his use.

469
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,830
What of my man Gannicus, did you find him to your liking?

470
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:01,830
The man is weary from his travels.

471
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,000
Let us not press him with further business.

472
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,940
Come see yourself inside, to uh,

473
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,340
sample other indulgences.

474
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:14,580
Some delights from Cyprus, perhaps?

475
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,510
A region I'm most fond of.

476
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,750
As I recall.

477
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,180
What the fuck are you doing?

478
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,490
What I do best.

479
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,660
Varus is a man of particular appetites which grow strong

480
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,160
under influence of wine and opium.

481
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,990
See your man Gannicus oiled and scented,

482
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,230
to be presented as the hour passes.

483
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,670
I risk all to lure Varus to our house,

484
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,670
only to find I am no longer the fucking master of it...

485
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,670
She knows the man more intimately than we do.

486
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,510
We must lend her our trust.

487
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,450
Let us pray it is not soiled upon return.

488
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,360
See Gannicus prepared and brought up to the villa.

489
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,190
And what will be required of him?

490
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,860
Whatever I fucking desire.

491
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,030
Ashur and Dagan returned absent Indus.

492
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,700
Did he not prove himself?

493
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,370
He did, and was well rewarded.

494
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,200
And the Syrians, are they to be rewarded as well?

495
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,370
With the mark of the brotherhood.

496
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,040
The mark?

497
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:23,040
Without proving themselves in the test?

498
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,050
They proved themselves in my test.

499
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,050
See it done.

500
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,220
Your father would never approve...

501
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,050
I am not my fucking father!

502
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,520
A fact well known.

503
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,020
See to Gannicus.

504
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:36,020
Brand the fucking Syrians.

505
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:40,030
And inform Oenomaus that he is to assume mantle of Doctore.

506
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,030
Dominus...

507
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,870
You are a relic, as is my father.

508
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,740
Shadows from the past, soon to fade from memory.

509
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,180
See to Gannicus.

510
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,530
See how it caresses the wine.

511
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,030
Is there anything so enticing?

512
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,270
I have seen its rival.

513
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,810
This house indeed offers many pleasures.

514
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,450
With more yet to be presented.

515
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,050
Pleasing this man

516
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,520
must now become your sole fucking purpose.

517
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:43,190
Please him? In what manner?

518
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,560
I have had my fill of being questioned by slaves.

519
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:52,700
If Varus wishes you to suck his cock dry,

520
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:55,040
you will savor every drop.

521
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,270
Are we of a singular mind?

522
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,810
Dominus.

523
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,550
In honor of distinguished guest,

524
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,850
I present my finest man for you personal viewing.

525
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,690
Behold Gannicus.

526
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,120
Yours to command.

527
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,870
You are quite the Lanista, Batiatus.

528
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:29,200
I have never been so well plied towards aid of a sale.

529
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,710
This is not about business.

530
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,540
This is how they live!

531
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:37,710
They grab life and squeeze until the juice flows.

532
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,720
How do you always come by such marvelous acquaintance?

533
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,550
It is a gift.

534
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,520
One among many

535
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,820
set before me.

536
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:53,030
Is he not of a form, our champion?

537
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,530
I have not seen his like.

538
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,700
And more than a few have stood before me.

539
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:01,370
The man stands as a God.

540
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,470
The arena his Olympus.

541
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,870
He once thrust his blade so deep into his opponent's breast,

542
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,210
that tears turned to blood.

543
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,350
I am not impressed... By inflated tales.

544
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:19,690
My interests are grounded in what I can see,

545
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,160
what I can touch.

546
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:30,700
Now that is... Impressive.

547
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:34,640
Are you as skilled in its use as you are with a sword?

548
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,180
I would have demonstration.

549
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,550
The man is yours,

550
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,380
we will lend privacy.

551
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,350
You mistake intent.

552
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,020
No I have had too much wine and other pleasures

553
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:56,520
for such rough exertion.

554
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,360
No, I would prefer a feast of the eyes.

555
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,700
Have him fuck this one,

556
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,600
and I shall watch.

557
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,700
- Apologies...  -For what?

558
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,870
Is she not a slave?

559
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,540
She is.

560
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:15,040
And will do as commanded.

561
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:37,900
Welcome to the fucking brotherhood.

562
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,540
Why are we gathered?

563
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,540
The Syrians receive the mark.

564
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,610
Absent the test?

565
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,190
Wait, are we not to recite the oath?

566
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:03,220
I will not see more shit heaped upon sacred rites.

567
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:09,200
You may bear the mark but don't ever think yourself a gladiator,

568
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,700
you little cunt.

569
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,400
Doctore!

570
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,370
Do not fucking speak to me in such tone!

571
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,540
Apologies...

572
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:23,210
You believe yourself my equal, Oenomaus?

573
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,880
No, Doctore.

574
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,380
Gladius!

575
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,220
Bring fucking swords!

576
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:44,970
Now, let us see if you have learned all I have to teach.

577
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,220
Remove her dress.

578
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,490
Is that what I taught you, Oenomaus?

579
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,820
- Doctore...  - How to turn upon heel?

580
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,160
Doctore!

581
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:47,500
Doctore, stop!

582
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,600
Fight me you coward!

583
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,660
- Melitta I...  - See it done.

584
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:14,210
Prove yourself worthy, Oenomaus.

585
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:54,880
I taught you well.

586
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:15,500
The man is dead?

587
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:17,170
I did not want it.

588
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,510
He forced me to fight.

589
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,640
And I do not know the reason for his anger toward me.

590
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,780
The reason falls to my own tongue.

591
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:32,990
Earlier I revealed intent of

592
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,390
raising you to position of Doctore.

593
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:39,830
I am not to return to the arena?

594
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,160
You are beyond such things now,

595
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:44,330
proven by your training of Crixus.

596
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,630
Let us put the past behind us, and look to future glories.

597
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,170
My wife.

598
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:57,410
I know it is not our time, but I would ask to see her.

599
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,680
I will send her to you when she has finished her duties.

600
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,620
Gratitude.

601
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:19,170
Apologies the demands of a Lanista seldom offer respite.

602
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,830
Oh, none required.

603
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:24,340
This night has been filled with unexpected joys.

604
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:25,670
You remain in Capua?

605
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,670
Until more adventurous opportunities

606
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,610
present themselves.

607
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:34,550
I'll take my leave then with promise of further discourse.

608
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:40,820
Oh, your man, Gannicus.

609
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:43,320
I would see him perform again.

610
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:45,490
In the primus of my games.

611
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:48,660
And you shall have him.

612
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,660
Terms to be discussed.

613
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:52,500
Gratitude for your hospitality.

614
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:54,640
It will not soon be forgotten.

615
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,510
Primus!

616
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,340
Did I not tell you I knew the man?

617
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:04,180
May the gods strike me for entertaining doubt.

618
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,180
You were magnificant!

619
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,350
Did I not tell you!

620
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:11,320
You have elevated this house.

621
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:13,150
Yet speak of how we came by such honor,

622
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:17,160
and see brotherhood shattered and a husband lost.

623
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:53,950
I have done a terrible thing.

624
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,050
We do what we must in this house.

625
00:52:03,050 --> 00:54:58,050

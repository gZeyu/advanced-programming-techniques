1
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,770
We have won many victories in the arena.

2
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,480
Sent many an unworthy opponent to the afterlife.

3
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,750
Yet self important men hold us

4
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,320
to lesser matches of the morning,

5
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,120
absent both eyes and prominence.

6
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,320
Such time has found its end!

7
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,470
Two days hence,

8
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,930
our champion will take to the sands

9
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,800
to face another of Vettius' shit-eating dogs.

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,330
Not in the streets, but in the fucking primus!

11
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,190
Behold the champion whose recent performance

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,860
inspired good Varus to return the House

13
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,150
of Batiatus to proper position!

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,730
Behold, Gannicus!

15
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,190
Gannicus!

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,820
Gannicus!

17
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,160
An inspired performance, indeed.

18
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,630
One not to be repeated.

19
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,460
A true god of the arena!

20
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,300
A man to be admired and emulated!

21
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,170
This is but glorious beginning!

22
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,210
Soon you will litter the sands with the blood and bone

23
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,980
of all who present challenge!

24
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,680
Instructed in the ways of death and glory

25
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,060
by a former champion!

26
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,980
One of our very own!

27
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,020
I give you Oenomaus!

28
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,410
No longer to hold that name!

29
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,190
No longer a gladiator!

30
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,110
Now and forever, to be revered as your Doctore!

31
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,760
This has been wielded with pride

32
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,890
by each before you,

33
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,510
since the time of my grandfather.

34
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,610
Bestowed only on the most loyal and honorable of men.

35
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,110
Your will. My hands.

36
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,820
The primus.

37
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,860
To gain such position, Varus must truly have been impressed

38
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,240
with your prowess.

39
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,110
As am I.

40
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,170
It was nothing.

41
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,050
It is a great honor.

42
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,940
For yourself, and this ludus.

43
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,390
Both of you bring honor to this ludus.

44
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,310
Each in his own way.

45
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,030
Did you note how he could scarce meet my eye?

46
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,770
He must now heed my commands, and does not embrace it.

47
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,920
Will the other men share sentiment

48
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,420
towards my "Honored" Position?

49
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,830
It is his position that stirs troubled thoughts.

50
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,330
He sets mind to the primus.

51
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,390
As you must to training the men.

52
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,950
I know this is not what you wished for.

53
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,610
And yet here I stand.

54
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,610
Elevated.

55
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,840
As you deserve.

56
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,810
For taking a life?

57
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,520
For betraying hand that forged the man before you?

58
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,150
There was no betrayal in what you did.

59
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,950
Some acts cannot be avoided,

60
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,140
when stripped of choice.

61
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,250
Now turn thoughts from unfortunate past.

62
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,690
We must look towards days to come, and embrace them.

63
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,690
Barca.

64
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,840
Pair with Crixus.

65
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,590
The rest of you... Continue training.

66
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,530
At last, the gods remove cock from fucking ass!

67
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,730
The House of Batiatus...no...

68
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,620
The House of Quintus Lentulus Batiatus

69
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,620
rises to the fucking heavens!

70
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,450
Soon my champions will be carved in stone,

71
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,080
towering above all who came before.

72
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,830
And Gannicus

73
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,830
will be the first of them

74
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,390
after victory in the fucking primus.

75
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,160
The position not gained absent aid.

76
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,840
I offered naught but introduction.

77
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,960
And a few selective words of suggestion...

78
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,230
You could wile the Goddess Laverna herself!

79
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,940
Your place in this will not pass without

80
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,320
much fucking gratitude.

81
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,410
The kind I favor most...

82
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,310
Has a man ever been so blessed?

83
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,470
Quintus.

84
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,940
Father...?

85
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,840
Gather yourself.

86
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,480
I would have words.

87
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,310
I leave this house in your care,

88
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,300
and this is what greets me upon return?

89
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,800
I was not expecting your arrival.

90
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,890
Am I to announce myself to the walls that I own?

91
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,590
Of course not. Yet if I had known of your return from Sicilia..

92
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:35,010
The knowledge would have produced what result? Huh?

93
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,480
Flowers and scented oils laid to meet me,

94
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,050
masking sight of a son gone to shit?

95
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,930
I but celebrate.

96
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,370
Upon what cause?

97
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,470
Angering Tullius with refusal of reasonable offer?

98
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,990
Your exclusion from the games?

99
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,360
How do you come by that?

100
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,030
I am old, Quintus.

101
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,900
Not dead.

102
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,870
There are still those in Capua that hold my name in regard,

103
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,240
and would see me well informed.

104
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,240
Good Solonius counted among them.

105
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,220
Solonius?

106
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,230
He sent word of his concerns regarding your dealings with Tullius.

107
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,680
The man is seized by unnecessary worry.

108
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,600
Your face suggests otherwise.

109
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,420
A minor disagreement.

110
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,520
Nothing with a man such as Tullius is ever minor.

111
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,920
A fact obvious to the simplest of minds.

112
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,790
Then it is a blessing a greater one than mine has arrived.

113
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,020
My frustration is more with myself.

114
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,750
You never wished for this.

115
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,670
The ludus, gladiators, the blood, the sand.

116
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,880
Your eyes were always towards the horizon,

117
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,430
to glories and triumphs

118
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,050
forever out of reach of a common lanista.

119
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,720
And yet here I stand. A lanista.

120
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,970
Like my father.

121
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,210
Not like him at all.

122
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,430
You have never been able to look into the eyes of a man, and gauge his true heart.

123
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,610
Only days past, I looked into the eyes of Quintilius Varus.

124
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,450
And "Gauged" Way to secure the primus in his games.

125
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,620
Varus has never employed a lanista not blessed by Tullius.

126
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,410
Why now break tradition?

127
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,040
Because I possess what Tullius does not.

128
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,040
Gannicus.

129
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,030
Gannicus?

130
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,200
The man is a jest, inciting more laughter than awe.

131
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,590
And now I find him desired by half of Rome?

132
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,940
Much has changed in your absence.

133
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,980
And much has remained the same.

134
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,930
I would review my men, and see how they have fared,

135
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,960
denied proper guidance.

136
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,070
Have feast prepared as instructed.

137
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,470
- And send to market for an amphora of mulsum.  - Yes, Domina.

138
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,190
The highest quality, not that shit from Flavus.

139
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,280
Again with the honeyed wine.

140
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,450
Does the corpse drink nothing else?

141
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,250
Lower your fucking voice.

142
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,920
The man has severed you from moorings.

143
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,540
He is the paterfamilias!

144
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,120
One word dropped from his tongue

145
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,660
could see us both to the streets.

146
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,550
We must be beyond reproach, or fall to ruin.

147
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,020
Very well.

148
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,640
I will be a vision of demure obedience and propriety.

149
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,390
On the outside, at least.

150
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,370
We are honored by your return to Capua, father.

151
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,270
I am certain your heart swells.

152
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:51,330
Oh, the clime of Sicilia has most certainly restored health.

153
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,590
Perhaps you do not recall me.

154
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,770
Gaia, a dear friend of..

155
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,470
The memory of you has not yet faded.

156
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,930
Quintus.

157
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,100
We must prove this fucking house in order.

158
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,550
And prompt decision for his quick return to Sicilia.

159
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,820
Withered old fuck.

160
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,710
Eat, brothers! You bear the mark now.

161
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,120
Savor the taste of victory!

162
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,110
Our piss once again finds its way to their mouths!

163
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,150
As if sucked from our cocks!

164
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,650
We bear the fucking mark!

165
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,440
Received absent the test.

166
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,060
A fucking goat may bear the mark.

167
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,870
It does not make him a brother.

168
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,630
- What did he say? - Fucked if I know.

169
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,680
He wants some more.

170
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,860
You should not eat with lower men.

171
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,020
You are Doctore now.

172
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,400
A title I did not seek.

173
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,370
I would not have events absent my control come between us.

174
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,510
Nor would I.

175
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,000
Ah, greetings.

176
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,330
Auctus.

177
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,550
Nurto.

178
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,770
Oenomaus!

179
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,010
You assume mantle of Doctore?

180
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,690
After unfortunate death of his predecessor.

181
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,400
I chose Oenomaus as replacement, knowing that he..

182
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,320
Gather your food and let us retire to your cell.

183
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,700
I would exchange stories of the passing years, old friend.

184
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,570
Dominus.

185
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,450
The way they fawn over him!

186
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,620
Falling to knee to lick his fucking ass!

187
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,870
He takes over my house. My gladiators. My fucking bed!

188
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,710
Did he give voice toward length of stay?

189
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,380
He gives voice only towards considerable faults of un-fucking-worthy son.

190
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,300
Leave.

191
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,720
I secure the primus, and he acts as if

192
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,020
I shit upon the name Batiatus.

193
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,290
Oh, you raise it, beyond anything he can imagine.

194
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,480
He will see this,

195
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,050
and bitter tongue will turn to praise.

196
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,310
He would sooner bite it off,

197
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,200
than have it betray him so.

198
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,870
I had forgotten the feeling.

199
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,310
This sudden abyss, as he sets

200
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,500
disapproving eye upon me.

201
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,720
Come.

202
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,000
You will not need endure his presence long.

203
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,430
His health is fled in these climes before.

204
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,820
Should he fail to realize that his house-- his name-- is in proper hands,

205
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,070
a forced return to Sicilia will eventually arise.

206
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,740
I would see him removed sooner.

207
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,760
Your return lifts the heart, Dominus.

208
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,630
Only for those who yet possess one.

209
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,210
Gratitude.

210
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,640
Attend!

211
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,030
Pair up!

212
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,610
Crixus, spar with Barca.

213
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,350
Auctus... work the palus until Gannicus joins us.

214
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,650
Oenomaus!

215
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,400
This one is too small!

216
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,240
I would have something the size of a man!

217
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,460
Barca.

218
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,550
Do as your Doctore commands.

219
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,700
Yes, Dominus.

220
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,340
Come. Let us see what is between your legs.

221
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,820
The Gaul winces from spear...

222
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,070
as he would from my cock!

223
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,080
Is my long, hard weapon too much for you, little man?

224
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,080
I am without lesson against it.

225
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,200
But your instructions are well received.

226
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,640
Apologies.

227
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,040
You rise earlier than expected.

228
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,230
I rise at proper hour.

229
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,070
An attribute neither you nor your man Gannicus seem to share.

230
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,600
Harsh words will find the man's ear.

231
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:27,490
Uh, it could be shouted yet ignored.

232
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,210
Gannicus is no champion.

233
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,580
I would promote Auctus or half a dozen men in his place.

234
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,080
A matter we disagree on.

235
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,720
One of many.

236
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,240
What man spars with Barca?

237
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,590
Crixus, a fierce Gaul of worthy stock.

238
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,230
I recall name from the ledger.

239
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,010
A sapling of exceeding cost.

240
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,750
The man will earn the mark, and see investment well returned.

241
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,320
Doctore! Bring Crixus up!

242
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,190
My father would have closer inspection.

243
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,970
No. Continue training.

244
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,860
We are to town for necessary business.

245
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,280
I will have Barca prepared as an escort.

246
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,700
Barca is a gladiator.

247
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,250
Trained to wield weapon in the arena,

248
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,480
not be yours in the street. Now come.

249
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,150
Your late rise already threatens the appointed hour.

250
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,050
You would have me sit with this fucking man?

251
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,600
I would have you silent.

252
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,770
While I attempt repair of damaged relation.

253
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,140
Titus.

254
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,480
Good to lay eyes, old friend.

255
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,790
Your experience in delicate matters of business has been sorely missed.

256
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,860
To be rectified presently.

257
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,500
Come, sit.

258
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,000
You recall my associate,

259
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,550
- Vettius? - Vettius?

260
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,430
Oh, you were but a child last I knew.

261
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,930
How the years flee from us.

262
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,430
How fares your father?

263
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,430
Dead.

264
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,850
Oh. Apologies.

265
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,850
How terrible.

266
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:27,110
The boy is ill-starred acquaintance with such misfortunes.

267
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,400
Why only days past he was set upon in our own streets,

268
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,620
on way to appointment with Quintilius Varus.

269
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,100
Varus?

270
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,320
The same man who, absent Vettius' presence,

271
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,050
managed to find way to your ludus..

272
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,290
Where this fucking cock eater stole the primus from me!

273
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,380
Vettius!

274
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,680
Hold your tongue.

275
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:52,180
How do you answer this?

276
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,250
He accuses absent cause.

277
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,220
My wife and her friend Gaia came upon good Varus in town,

278
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
baking under noon-day sun.

279
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,810
Gaia?

280
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,150
She knew Varus from her days in Rome,

281
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,450
offered respite at my villa

282
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,900
while he waited for the absent boy to come to purpose.

283
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,820
A fortunate coincidence for all involved.

284
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,110
And was it this same fortune that saw me set upon by your fucking men?

285
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,220
Did you see faces?

286
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,960
Did they bear my mark, you wet cunt..

287
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,210
Enough!

288
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,410
Remove yourself to the street.

289
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,630
Go.

290
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,750
And leave reasonable men to discourse.

291
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:34,730
Your son has much to learn in the ways of diplomacy.

292
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,850
A subject all young men struggle to master.

293
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,650
Let us school them in its ways.

294
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,930
You are better matched against wooden men.

295
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:20,050
Work the palus, Gaul.

296
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,520
Resume!

297
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:35,520
Are we to follow Barca's commands now?

298
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,570
He shares my thoughts.

299
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,160
The Gaul falters against spear.

300
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,580
Perhaps advice from a champion would aid his cause...

301
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:53,970
Days past you fought me with something approaching skill.

302
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,890
Yet opposite Barca, you act as his lover.

303
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,030
Face down with cheeks your spread.

304
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,010
The spear is unknown to me.

305
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,730
You are Gaul.

306
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,300
Did you never face the Arverni?

307
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,860
My years before capture never held the privilege.

308
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,380
They wield spear with deadly purpose.

309
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,410
As does Barca, from the judging.

310
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,280
He but instructs.

311
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,750
Each blow a lesson never to be repeated.

312
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,170
You should be quite the scholar.

313
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,740
By the time he has beaten you to death.

314
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,580
Crixus.

315
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,760
You fought well against my two swords.

316
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,630
Rid a Hoplomachus of his spear,

317
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,920
and he is left with only one weapon.

318
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,400
Barca!

319
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,530
If you have done with your man's cock,

320
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,370
I would have proper contest.

321
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,820
The gods bless Barca with another tiny man to fuck.

322
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,710
Your Gannicus appears in fine form.

323
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,080
As he will in the primus,

324
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,630
elevating the house with glorious performance.

325
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:18,140
My heart yet races at the thought of his last.

326
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,730
We'll place such memories behind us.

327
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,720
A difficult feat, when so enjoyed by all.

328
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,640
Some more than others.

329
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,810
Come here.

330
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,860
Apologies, Domina.

331
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,980
Guests have arrived.

332
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,150
Guests...?

333
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,670
Varus.

334
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,590
We were not expecting..

335
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,960
Oh, the fault is mine, for failing to announce.

336
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,800
Good Cossutius is on stay from Rome to celebrate the Vinalia.

337
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,300
After I extolled the virtues of the House of Batiatus..

338
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,500
I demanded introduction immediately.

339
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:07,270
You honor us, but my husband tends to

340
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,020
final preparations for tomorrow's games in town.

341
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,030
Oh. How disappointing.

342
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,850
Yet we could remove ourselves to the balcony

343
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,650
for proper viewing of his gladiators until his return.

344
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,900
I fear you mistake intent.

345
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:26,370
I was not regaling Cossutius with tales of your men.

346
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,630
But of your house's more...

347
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:33,500
intimate delights.

348
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:40,470
I fear that was a... special consideration.

349
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,090
Was it?

350
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,040
Perhaps Vettius will be more accommodating then.

351
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,600
Concerning this and my primus.

352
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:56,770
It would be unfortunate to have come so far,

353
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,890
and find hands empty.

354
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,780
Would it not?

355
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,230
I would not have it so.

356
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,100
Excellent!

357
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,150
Let us prepare Gannicus and -

358
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:15,540
No. What joy is there in exploring ground already discovered?

359
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,510
None at all.

360
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,930
What do you offer?

361
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,350
A gladiator of your choosing,

362
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,190
paired with a slave

363
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,710
as yet untouched...?

364
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,060
Untouched?

365
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:41,400
A delicacy no longer present at the moment in my house.

366
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,820
Then it is fortunate you find yourself in ours.

367
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,610
Solonius! A word.

368
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,950
I would share its equal.

369
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,500
I came to you as trusted friend,

370
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,300
carrying news of Tullius' renewed offer towards Gannicus..

371
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:14,090
You carried but shit, spewed from an errant hole.

372
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:17,140
And what of other knowledge I lighted upon treacherous ears?

373
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,810
That of Varus' arrival, to be met by Vettius?

374
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,130
Vettius is a fool.

375
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,760
Under the employ of Tullius!

376
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,180
He will think I had hand in the boy's assault..

377
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,470
He suspects nothing!

378
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,150
His thoughts have turned towards my father inside.

379
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,970
What seized fucking mind, dispatching message to him?!

380
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,240
Your father is in Capua?

381
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,990
He sits with Tullius as you bleat, stroking fucking cock.

382
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,110
Why do you remain in the streets?

383
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,940
Oh, why do you think!?

384
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,310
I did not mean for his return.

385
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,670
I sought only advice, towards worry

386
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,150
for a man I hold as brother.

387
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,870
Intentions well-received.

388
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,170
Let us place transgressions aside,

389
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,540
in favor of more pressing concern.

390
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,660
Your patience and reason recalls joyous times,

391
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,130
when business was conducted by those who shared respect for it.

392
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:03,000
I fear we are a dying breed.

393
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,170
I am certain you shall outlive us all, Master Batiatus.

394
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,480
Solonius.

395
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,040
I hardly placed you.

396
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:12,350
The years weigh heavy on a man, do they not?

397
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,230
Your presence is fortuitous,

398
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,520
striking need to seek you out.

399
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:20,120
Share walk, and let us review recent events...

400
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,250
Am I allowed voice now?

401
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,170
Could the gods halt the sound?

402
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,930
Whatever Tullius and the boy may think,

403
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:43,230
I gained the primus on merit of Gannicus' prowess.

404
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,320
Even if true, it is of no matter now.

405
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,430
Gannicus will not appear in the games.

406
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,190
But Varus has made personal request!

407
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,600
A necessary sacrifice,

408
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,560
towards leveling unequal ground.

409
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,110
You will make apology to Varus,

410
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,530
relaying Gannicus found injury in training.

411
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,890
And that Vettius is amply capable

412
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,610
of seeing the primus attended.

413
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,200
You give away the primus, and now ask

414
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,420
that I tongue the fucking boy's ass?

415
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,920
I ask nothing.

416
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,240
This is how it will be.

417
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,920
In return a few of our men will be paired

418
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:15,130
against each other after mid-day sun.

419
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,540
Our men fight themselves?

420
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,380
The only plank salvaged from such wreckage.

421
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,770
Then we must choose the men with care.

422
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,520
They have been chosen for us.

423
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,220
Tullius now selects my fucking men as well?

424
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,440
An unavoidable concession.

425
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,260
Barca and Gnaeus, Auctus

426
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,860
to face your Gaul, Crixus.

427
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:32,880
Crixus? Is but a recruit,

428
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,260
not yet a fucking gladiator!

429
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,280
Who you failed to mention was purchased from Tullius.

430
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,270
To gain...

431
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,930
To gain his favor.

432
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,540
And what fruits did your scheme bear?

433
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,610
Oh, this is price due for attempting to maneuver men above your station.

434
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,710
Be thankful it was not more costly.

435
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,310
Are you certain you would not prefer

436
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,090
the man bathed and scented?

437
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,930
He stands perfect towards his cause.

438
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,600
I would, however, gauge the freshness of your offerings.

439
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,330
Remove your robes.

440
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,880
Did I not tell you?

441
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:41,380
They are of a form.

442
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,850
But a woman's worth

443
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,380
is not always revealed to the eyes.

444
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,720
A man must probe deeper for true value...

445
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,300
Remove yourself to the vestibule.

446
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,290
Return if dominus and his father

447
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,490
are seen upon the road.

448
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:22,000
I shall have this one.

449
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:24,540
She's considerably tighter.

450
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,220
Move on top of him.

451
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,580
Do you know why I chose this man?

452
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,070
So crudely etched?

453
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,690
The smell of shit hot upon his breath?

454
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,230
Because this world is filled with the grotesque.

455
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,700
And the divine.

456
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,360
They exist together,

457
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,890
two sides of a coin.

458
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,900
You cannot have one...

459
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:33,870
absent threat of the other.

460
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:43,530
Yet words do not convey the true nature of this.

461
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:47,350
It must be experienced.

462
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,060
It must be felt...

463
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,080
And never forgotten.

464
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:06,130
Oh, your absence has been missed in Rome

465
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
since your husband's passing.

466
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,420
Your charms will brighten darkest night.

467
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,670
I long to return.

468
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,390
And crest dawn upon a husband yet of this world.

469
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,600
How does your dowry stand?

470
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,720
I was under impression you were absent family of means.

471
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:31,610
Gaia is a treasure within herself.

472
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,010
One to be coveted.

473
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,240
By a man untethered

474
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,580
to the burden of position and appearance.

475
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:45,340
Cossutius.

476
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,240
You were well satisfied?

477
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:50,340
Praise laid upon your house has not been exaggerated.

478
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,940
It is a wonder.

479
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:56,250
That such base diversion would be impossible to conceal in Rome.

480
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,770
Capua is city of many pleasures.

481
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,350
Often obscured by pressing business,

482
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:04,420
to which we sadly must attend.

483
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,590
You take leave? So soon?

484
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,230
A regrettable necessity.

485
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,600
Gratitude for your hospitality.

486
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,260
I look forward to seeing you at the games.

487
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,440
And your man Gannicus upon my primus.

488
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,040
Oh, you honor us.

489
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,850
Crixus begins to show promise.

490
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,460
Upon his back?

491
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,630
The man always rises. A trait to be admired.

492
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,730
So you have eyes for the Gaul now?

493
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,850
And if I did?

494
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,600
I would fucking kill you.

495
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,150
Come here...

496
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,450
You fucking cunts!

497
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,200
You soil our food!

498
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:43,240
Why should we not make meal of your fucking pets..

499
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,230
Crixus...

500
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,230
You do not help your friend?

501
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,450
This is a fight between brothers.

502
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,120
I do not yet bear the mark.

503
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,710
Have you lost fucking mind?!

504
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,180
Stand down!

505
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,440
Calm yourselves!

506
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,000
Is this what my house has fallen to?

507
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,500
Brother setting upon brother,

508
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,750
so far removed from the honor of the arena,

509
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,420
where such contest holds meaning?

510
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:32,980
This points to reason the gods have turned from us,

511
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,100
stripping the primus from our hands.

512
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,600
I do not fight in the games?

513
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,470
You do not.

514
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,520
Yet our sacrifices do not stand unrewarded.

515
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:48,810
A few of you will take to the sands after mid-day sun.

516
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:52,930
And I expect those chosen to bring more honor

517
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,330
to the House of Batiatus

518
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,370
than you now bring to yourselves.

519
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:12,770
Yeah! Fuck you!

520
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:14,440
Gnaeus fights Barca!

521
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,520
And I will split your ass in two.

522
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,810
Fuck.

523
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,030
You do not gain position?

524
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,940
I do. Against Crixus.

525
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:26,730
Uh, your favorite.

526
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,950
The man does not even bear the fucking the mark.

527
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:31,820
I am to fight?

528
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:38,630
You are to die.

529
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,880
At the end of my spear.

530
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:53,220
So you fight in the arena, I do not.

531
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,710
The gods truly punish me.

532
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,010
I long to be of the brotherhood.

533
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,050
To become a gladiator.

534
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:07,440
But to be awarded position..

535
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,310
it is an honor I have not earned.

536
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,530
There are many things given to us in this life,

537
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,950
for the wrong reasons.

538
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,680
What we do with such blessings

539
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,650
that is the true test of a man.

540
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,870
Go well, return victorious brother.

541
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:04,040
May Auctus fall.

542
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,050
And Barca follow.

543
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,800
Auctus, Gnaeus..

544
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,930
Return victorious, brothers.

545
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,390
For I am out of wine.

546
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:31,240
After all we've done.

547
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,990
The sacrifices made.

548
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:37,860
Only to have the primus torn from grasp.

549
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,610
Torn would imply resistance.

550
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,530
My father offers none.

551
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,530
You could not move him from this decision?

552
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,620
Hercules would fail in the labor.

553
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,170
Are we set to leave?

554
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,920
I would not arrive late.

555
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,840
Doctore gathers the men.

556
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:53,660
Perhaps some mulsum while you wait, father.

557
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,800
To celebrate your return to the games.

558
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:00,420
You seek to ply me with honeyed-wine?

559
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,770
You find my weakness.

560
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,220
And I would have it exploited.

561
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:09,510
I shall join you.

562
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,450
It disquiets your stomach too much.

563
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:13,350
Especially in hot weather such as this.

564
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,320
It never did agree with you.

565
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:17,990
A trait gained from your mother.

566
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,570
A presence sorely missed.

567
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:21,790
Every day.

568
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:32,300
Your Gaul appears ragged.

569
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:33,650
The result of extensive training.

570
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,890
In preparation for the test he has yet to take.

571
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:37,300
You set this in motion, Quintus.

572
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:39,170
By purchasing the man to gain favor.

573
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,010
Only after I looked into his eyes, and saw a spark.

574
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,140
As you always spoke of.

575
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:46,680
Then today presents rare opportunity.

576
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,550
Auctus, a man forged beneath my rule,

577
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,820
to face Crixus, forged beneath yours.

578
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:54,390
The outcome to prove if son has learned

579
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,020
anything of worth from father.

580
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,080
Your time has come.

581
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,050
Gratitude.

582
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,310
For all you have taught me.

583
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,010
Fight with honor.

584
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,890
And if the gods will it...

585
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,390
die the same.

586
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,960
Crixus.

587
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,100
A word.

588
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:24,110
You have shown great promise.

589
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,310
In practice. In exhibition against Gannicus.

590
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:28,480
Yet this is the arena.

591
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:32,340
This is where men become gods.

592
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:36,260
Legions with far greater training and skill than you

593
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,930
have fallen upon this sacred ground.

594
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:39,510
Many beneath Auctus' spear.

595
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:42,410
But I do not think that you will be one of them.

596
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,330
You have the blood of a champion.

597
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,140
To rival any my father has ever heralded.

598
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:55,640
Do you wish to behold such miracle come to pass?

599
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,280
It is all I desire.

600
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:03,520
Then seize fucking glory.

601
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,450
And see us both proven worthy.

602
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:35,180
Have you set Crixus to purpose?

603
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:36,770
I stoke the flame as best I can.

604
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,800
It is now up to the man to ignite.

605
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:42,190
Or be forever extinguished.

606
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,240
A pity it is not Gannicus, nor the primus.

607
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:46,390
It was well earned.

608
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:50,060
Yet he is the one honored.

609
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,450
While his only fucking son is left to languish.

610
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:55,130
Soon your father will attest your worth.

611
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,700
Or decay into the afterlife.

612
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:59,910
Either way, we will be free of him.

613
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,330
An epic showing from the House of Batiatus,

614
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,460
certain to please the gods!

615
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:52,620
In gratitude, we will be merciful,

616
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:54,410
and grant life!

617
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,800
You are overly kind.

618
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:11,690
Your house has been most accommodating,

619
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,550
and should be rewarded.

620
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:17,150
Well, gratitude. I...

621
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:22,080
Are you unwell?

622
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:25,620
Perhaps the excitement is too much for him.

623
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:27,450
It is but the heat and dust.

624
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:29,370
Water.

625
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,870
I would not have torrid throat

626
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,540
announce your final offering.

627
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:35,340
Address the crowd?

628
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:38,830
The honor is unfit a lanista.

629
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,470
We decide what befits a lanista, Batiatus.

630
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,180
Make introduction and let us move on.

631
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:58,120
I stand humbled before the great people of Capua.

632
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:00,900
My home and my heart,

633
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:04,260
too long parted from chest.

634
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:06,820
In gratitude,

635
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:09,380
I present the final offering

636
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:13,000
from the House of Batiatus.

637
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:15,080
Entering the arena,

638
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:17,840
a virgin upon its sands...

639
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:21,060
I give you Crixus!

640
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:22,450
Murmillo!

641
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,270
His opponent,

642
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,950
a warrior unmatched in skill and honor.

643
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,450
I give you Auctus!

644
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,940
Hoplomachus!

645
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:05,380
Capua!

646
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,520
Begin!

647
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:01,970
Auctus wields spear to rival Mars himself.

648
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,990
Well he has been well trained.

649
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,310
The same cannot be said of Crixus.

650
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,160
Perhaps he should have remained a hauler of stone.

651
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,820
Stupid fuck!

652
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,390
Kill the little cunt!

653
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,970
Fuck!

654
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,430
What?

655
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,630
Fuck!

656
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:44,670
Fuck!

657
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,370
Barca has taught you well...

658
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,790
Yes!

659
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:01,650
A fine showing, Batiatus!

660
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,250
With unexpected conclusion!

661
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:05,110
Indeed it was.

662
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:16,100
I swear to be burned, chained, beaten, or die by the sword.

663
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:18,380
In pursuit of honor in the arena.

664
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:27,690
Welcome to the brotherhood.

665
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,760
Crixus proves himself.

666
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:50,580
Perhaps even as match for Gannicus one day.

667
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:54,400
In and out of the arena.

668
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,600
You fought well. Brother.

669
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:37,000
Your Gaul, still yet a recruit,

670
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:41,340
defeated a gladiator I considered among the best of my men.

671
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:47,580
It would appear I underestimated Crixus.

672
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,350
As I did my son.

673
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:54,480
You honor me, father.

674
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:56,770
Oh, you honor yourself.

675
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:59,270
When cleared of plots and schemes.

676
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,440
Thoughts far removed, never to return.

677
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:05,240
Nothing pleases more than to see reason take hold of senses.

678
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:07,710
And a house righting its path.

679
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,880
I will see it continued in your absence.

680
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:11,950
Absence?

681
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,500
I assume you return to Sicilia. Your health...

682
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:17,170
Seeing Crixus' victory stirred

683
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,620
passions I have not felt in many years.

684
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,180
For the blood and the sand,

685
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:24,480
the roar of the crowd. Oh, it lifts spirits

686
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:26,930
more than change of clime could hope to offer.

687
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,350
No, I will stay at your side,

688
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:32,600
and together we shall see the House of Batiatus

689
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:35,160
rise to former glories. Huh.

690
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:36,810
You remain here?

691
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:39,410
Until breath flees wearied flesh,

692
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,270
calling me to the afterlife.

693
00:56:44,270 --> 00:57:41,270

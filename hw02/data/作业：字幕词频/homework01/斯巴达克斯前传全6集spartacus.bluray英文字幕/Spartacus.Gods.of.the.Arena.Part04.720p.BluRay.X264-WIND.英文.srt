1
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,930
Keep in line.

2
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,970
Chase me.

3
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,560
This way.

4
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,120
A net and trident?

5
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,060
The man appears more common fisherman than gladiator.

6
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,890
The style is called Retiarius,

7
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,480
carried from the outer regions.

8
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,510
They should carry it back.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,830
I favor the Murmillo.

10
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,000
The crowd is of the opposite opinion.

11
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,520
Soon there will be a Retiarius in the sands in every game.

12
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,030
And the ludus absent them tragically lacking.

13
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,780
Very well.

14
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,610
Yet place net and trident in hands of one of our lesser man.

15
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,860
Did I not tell you?!

16
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,090
Listen to them!

17
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,810
A spectacle, to be sure.

18
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,010
All the more thrilling,

19
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,900
if viewed from the pulvinus.

20
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,780
Invitation was extended.

21
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,780
And refused?

22
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,940
Well, the pulvinus is too far removed.

23
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,370
I would witness the games here, among the people.

24
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,290
With son beside me.

25
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,970
Your hour is upon you.

26
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,390
A fine blade.

27
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,070
To be wielded with deadly purpose.

28
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,300
Re-form my words, in manner Dagan understands.

29
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,640
You bear the mark of the brotherhood.

30
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,590
An honor you have not earned.

31
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,760
Your true test awaits you.

32
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,950
Live, and count yourself among us.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,500
Die...

34
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,200
and prove yourselves as unworthy as I suspect.

35
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,680
Dagan says he will honor the House of Batiatus

36
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,450
with gifts of blood.

37
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,490
As will the mighty Ashur.

38
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,610
And do not die too quickly.

39
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,570
Go on Ashur!

40
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,330
Go on!

41
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,590
Fucking yes!

42
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,100
Hasdrubal falls!

43
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,890
As all men who face Ashur!

44
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,020
The man assumes credit owed his betters.

45
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,940
He is but swollen by the moment.

46
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,600
Perhaps he will turn greater performance next time.

47
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,730
You speak of what may never pass.

48
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,650
Now the lesser matches have passed,

49
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,790
let us see something of note.

50
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,240
Vettius, make presentation.

51
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,000
I give the good people of Capua this day my latest acquisition!

52
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,130
Certain to inflame passion!

53
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,200
And ignite fear in all who oppose him!

54
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,420
From the darkest lands east of the Rhine...

55
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,980
Behold Caburus!

56
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,510
Murmillo!

57
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,900
The crowd favors Vettius' offering.

58
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,140
They greet Gannicus with louder voice,

59
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,940
yet he stands removed from the games.

60
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,030
Enter Drappes!

61
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,140
Thraex!

62
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,310
Crixus shows promise, yet again the same fate.

63
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,030
Our men see victory, only to be awarded exclusion.

64
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,040
The fruits reaped, when you offend a man beyond our station.

65
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,660
Begin!

66
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,210
I but stood ground to protect our house.

67
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,050
As any lanista would.

68
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,180
Yet ambition beyond the title clouds your judgment.

69
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,840
We must be humble if I am to repair relations with Tullius,

70
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,560
and see all our men returned to the sands.

71
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,840
Quickly, I pray.

72
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,440
If we are to place our men in the opening games

73
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,530
of the new arena..

74
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,530
Reaching for such heights

75
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,480
is what sent you tumbling from favor.

76
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,350
Strike it from your thoughts,

77
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,520
and place mind and effort

78
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,040
towards more reasonable pursuits.

79
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,860
Perhaps the procuring of a man as worthy as Caburus.

80
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,840
Fleeting opportunity to enjoy the old arena,

81
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,720
and yet we're swept aside.

82
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,590
Absent even casual regard.

83
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,730
I consider it a blessing,

84
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,100
to be so reprieved from condemning presence.

85
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,260
The manner Titus glares,

86
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,180
it is a shock we do not burst into flame.

87
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,890
He is but an old man, set upon his ways.

88
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,270
He is a Gorgon with a cock,

89
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,840
turning all around him to stone.

90
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:37,360
Titus does not fare well in the dust and the heat.

91
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,030
His health will prompt return

92
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,410
to the coast of Sicilia very soon.

93
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,750
Until such glorious event,

94
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,330
I would fade from beneath his oppressive roof.

95
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,370
You would leave me?

96
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,680
You are with husband.

97
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,880
A man who would never see you harmed by whim or circumstance.

98
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,970
I stand alone, severed from such protection.

99
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,720
A perilous condition that must be attended.

100
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,590
You are never alone, while I draw breath.

101
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,860
Words of much comfort.

102
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,620
Though a husband with heavy purse would be more so.

103
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,040
Then we must find one suitable to cause.

104
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,410
A possibility presents itself, in most pleasing form.

105
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,790
You know the man?

106
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,790
I have seen him about in Rome.

107
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,630
Absent encumbrance of a wife.

108
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,500
Oh how fortunate that we should come upon him,

109
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,450
at this time and place.

110
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,920
In desperate times fortune must give way

111
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,220
to more assertive hands.

112
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,180
Petronius?!

113
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,130
Would the gods have me so blessed?

114
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,490
Gaia.

115
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,950
We were introduced at one of Varus' affairs.

116
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,970
Oh, yes, yes, yes of course.

117
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,970
Apologies.

118
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,580
None required.

119
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,280
Seeing you so unexpected has lifted questionable spirits.

120
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,980
Lucretia can attest...

121
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,080
You're Lucretia?

122
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,040
Wife to the lanista, Batiatus?

123
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,540
I do call him husband, yes.

124
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,130
I have heard your house spoken of.

125
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,010
And the, um, pleasures contained within...

126
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,580
Barca has lost form, since Auctus fell.

127
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,580
His cock will find another hole to fuck.

128
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,300
We return anointed in the blood of our enemies!

129
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,700
Hasdrubal and Kleitos met their end!

130
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,010
The first of many to fall beneath our swords in the arena!

131
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,980
See yourselves to the baths.

132
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,940
Gannicus.

133
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,770
Pair with Rhaskos.

134
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,340
To what end?

135
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,570
If I am not to fight in the arena,

136
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,240
I will remain here in the shade.

137
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,740
Doctore.

138
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,860
Send the man up.

139
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,530
I would have words.

140
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,780
Magnetius.

141
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,670
One of the finest champions this house has ever forged.

142
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,410
He stood a titan.

143
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,880
As all my champions.

144
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:48,250
The culmination of years of training. Dedication. Sacrifice.

145
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,260
You would hold yourself their equal?

146
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,390
In the arena, I am every man's equal.

147
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,370
A champion is more than his victories upon the sands.

148
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,090
He is the sum of his actions.

149
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,920
Every decision, no matter how small, speaks to the man.

150
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,210
And the balance of his heart.

151
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,380
And in his breast beats the heart of a lion.

152
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,770
And what does it beat for?

153
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,090
The House of Batiatus.

154
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,340
Return him to the ludus.

155
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,020
You see?

156
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,490
Man fights for the honor of this house.

157
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,570
As all your champions have in the past.

158
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,260
Gannicus speaks but words he knows I seek to hear.

159
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,490
He is no champion of my house.

160
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,650
I stand before Petronius with obvious charms,

161
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,620
and all he can do is prattle about the House of Batiatus.

162
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,680
I fear I've lost delicate touch.

163
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,680
Your touch is many things.

164
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,300
"Delicate" not among them.

165
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,680
You are of a mood.

166
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,770
If word of what we have offered has spread to Petronius,

167
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,840
how long before it lights on Titus' ear?

168
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,970
Perhaps it should.

169
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,390
The shock would no doubt end the old goat.

170
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,110
You jest, while all around us threatens to fucking crumble.

171
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,280
The only threat is of you and Quintus becoming favored among the elite.

172
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,570
As a whore is favored by the man atop her.

173
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,120
It is not as if all of Rome knows.

174
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,940
Only the most privileged tongues

175
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:38,040
whisper of the delights offered within these walls.

176
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,460
Delights Petronius and his friends

177
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,460
long to witness for themselves...

178
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,050
To even consider it is, is beyond reason.

179
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,250
If Titus were to discover..

180
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,870
What joys does my father prevent now?

181
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,230
None of note...

182
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,830
We came across Petronius in the market.

183
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,230
You are familiar with the name...?

184
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,820
As any man with an eye towards business,

185
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,070
and the procuring of it.

186
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,520
He is familiar with yours as well.

187
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,390
And spoke with great interest of sampling

188
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,910
of your more exotic offerings,

189
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,900
with acquaintances of equal position.

190
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,230
And how did good Petronius come to know of such things?

191
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,780
Varus and Cossutius.

192
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,700
Their tongues are looser than their cocks.

193
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,410
Petronius departs for Rome the day after next.

194
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,790
Decision must be given quick birth,

195
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,690
or see opportunity aborted.

196
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:29,910
With the support of Petronius',

197
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,670
we may yet find Position in the opening games of the new arena.

198
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,670
Quintus, your father..

199
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,750
Make the arrangements.

200
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,140
I'll attend to my father.

201
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,660
Melitta.

202
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,740
A word.

203
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,990
I have none to give.

204
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,210
It is a matter of some importance.

205
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,410
A moment.

206
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,920
You avoid my gaze.

207
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,790
As you should mine.

208
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,090
Lest suspicions be aroused.

209
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,150
Should they not also be aroused,

210
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,850
if two friends are no longer seen to speak?

211
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,020
What happened between us...

212
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,770
Was not of our choosing.

213
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,640
We must turn it from thought,

214
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,240
and never give it voice.

215
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,450
My tongue it bends to such warning.

216
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,080
Yet the thought of you...

217
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,330
It proves troublesome.

218
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,460
The memory will fade with time. As do all things born of misfortune.

219
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,760
We were as brothers once...

220
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,180
but no more.

221
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,520
The men no longer accept me as a gladiator.

222
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,840
And do not yet give respect as Doctore.

223
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,680
Even Gannicus refuses to heed my instruction.

224
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,850
Gannicus heeds nothing but his own desires,

225
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,470
beyond all reason.

226
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:20,540
You must teach him that you alone are in command.

227
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:24,040
And by firm hand, erase all doubts.

228
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,530
Show them all the man I have given my heart to.

229
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,920
Gnaeus!

230
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,660
Your mastery of the sword falls to question.

231
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,260
The net and trident are your weapons now.

232
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,330
A fucking net, Oenomaus?

233
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:36,360
You will do as commanded, absent complaint.

234
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,570
Or see flesh stripped from bone.

235
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,290
Yes, Doctore.

236
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,880
Return to training!

237
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,800
You speak as Jupiter,

238
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,200
hurling bolts from the heavens.

239
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,000
Raised there by words and touch of loving wife.

240
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,760
Now pair with Barca.

241
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,760
And remain far from the shade.

242
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,930
Barca!

243
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,690
Bring fucking spear to purpose.

244
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,490
Again!

245
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:26,030
Your man shows fire today.

246
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,530
Ignited by your words, I am sure.

247
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,340
Honeyed wine. Quickly.

248
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,620
I'm fine.

249
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,340
Sound and pallor threaten disagreement.

250
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,710
You are too long from salt air of the coast.

251
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,910
And shall remain from Sicilia longer still.

252
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,710
Do not waste breath on the matter.

253
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,130
I would not see you so far removed.

254
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,890
But a day or more by the waters of Neapolis...?

255
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,220
Yes, to revive color.

256
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,930
My concern lies only with this ludus,

257
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,480
and seeing it to former glories.

258
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,110
Well then let our journey serve dual cause.

259
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,730
We can review the latest shipment of slaves,

260
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,740
with mind towards procuring a champion favored by us both.

261
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,600
Someone to rival Vettius' new man...?

262
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,610
Drink.

263
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,800
You conspire against an old man.

264
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,260
To your advantage.

265
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,760
Make preparation.

266
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,730
We leave for Neapolis.

267
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,430
See to my father.

268
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,940
He is attended to as promised.

269
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,820
Have Gaia send word to Petronius.

270
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,070
You entertain tonight.

271
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,030
If he and his circle overreach?

272
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,480
The appetites of men are not easily set aside

273
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,080
by the words of a woman.

274
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,420
We'll send message to Solonius. He can stand in my place,

275
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,780
speak for the house if so needed.

276
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,980
Quintus...

277
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,650
The risk outwieght concerned.

278
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,420
See to Petronius and his guests.

279
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,160
With their satisfaction,

280
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,340
our position in the opening games secured.

281
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,010
Snare any fish today in your little net?

282
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,780
Reward, for victory in the arena.

283
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,280
Continue and see more weigh palm.

284
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,820
Dagan questions receiving the greater sum.

285
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,140
We stood equally upon the sands.

286
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,710
Tell him he receives twice the coin...

287
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,660
because you are half the man.

288
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,020
I am a gladiator, as he is.

289
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:48,460
If we did not need you to exchange our words for his,

290
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,890
you would never have been given chance to take up sword.

291
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,250
Bread.

292
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,570
For your pets.

293
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,830
Doiros was the brother I held closest to me.

294
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,030
He was a fierce warrior,

295
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,430
as was my father and all before us.

296
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,430
I watched as they all fell

297
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,800
beneath the spears of the Arverni.

298
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,170
My hand yet too small to pick up sword.

299
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,040
I was forced to serve.

300
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,680
To bow and scrape.

301
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,480
First of all to the shits that took my family.

302
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,510
And then to the Romans they sold me to.

303
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,690
Not a day passes where I do not dream

304
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,920
of honoring the dead in blood and victory.

305
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,390
Auctus is the first life I've ever taken in battle.

306
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,600
He will not be forgotten.

307
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,120
They were Auctus' pets.

308
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,540
I never favored them.

309
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,680
Now they're all that's left.

310
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,320
Stand up straight.

311
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,170
What of this one?

312
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,820
See how his form is carved,

313
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,010
with each muscle building on to the next?

314
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,670
A worthy addition to any ludus.

315
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,960
A fine offering, is he not?

316
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,510
I would not waste coin.

317
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,680
The man favors his left,

318
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,470
revealing injury to the leg.

319
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,770
Unsuitable for men of discerning eye.

320
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,720
Let us turn to something of rarer quality.

321
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:25,640
I have a Thracian of the Maedi tribe,

322
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,010
the likes of which you have..

323
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,810
Thracians are too difficult to control.

324
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,650
And aggravate the Gauls beyond reason.

325
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,900
My son speaks truth.

326
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,940
You offer us piss and claim it wine.

327
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,330
You will find none better in Neapolis.

328
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,030
I but hope your city's drink holds higher standard.

329
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,500
Come, let us seek libation to wash taste of shit from mouth.

330
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Diona.

331
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,400
It does not hurt.

332
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,820
Wait.

333
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,720
We haven't spoken.

334
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,100
Or laughed, as we usually do...

335
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,990
I have no time for childish things.

336
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,410
Domina wishes me bathed. For tonight.

337
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,730
Take this to Oenomaus.

338
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,620
These men are to be brought up to the villa, properly oiled and scented.

339
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,000
Yes, Domina.

340
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,200
There is much I need attended to tonight.

341
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,870
I would have you by my side,

342
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,380
not be dislodged by any request.

343
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,260
Gratitude.

344
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,470
There is one thing that I would ask you in return.

345
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,090
It's well known your husband's allegiance lies with Titus.

346
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,740
Sway him to keep what we do here confined to shadow.

347
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:48,280
Or I fear that other secrets

348
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,110
will find their way into the light.

349
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,620
Am I understood?

350
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,290
Yes, Domina.

351
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,040
See it done.

352
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,780
Venus blushes in her garden,

353
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,890
shamed by such beauty.

354
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,810
Would that she stood in my place,

355
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,920
and I among the roots and leaves.

356
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,230
These hands are not meant for common earth.

357
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,850
They have held me close as dearest friend.

358
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,650
As sister.

359
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,690
Tonight mine shall return favor,

360
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,860
and aid yours in seizing position so richly deserved.

361
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,320
Solonius arrives.

362
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,790
Let us greet him,

363
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,000
and forge memory of a night not soon forgotten.

364
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,240
The man is no Gannicus,

365
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,240
yet he surpasses in enthusiasm.

366
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,380
They are well received.

367
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,630
As are all things born of base desire.

368
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,920
Apologies.

369
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,510
We ask too much of you in this,

370
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,670
but your presence is of great comfort.

371
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,890
The situation forces us all to actions

372
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,480
otherwise never considered.

373
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:49,880
The blame lies in the Fates, absolving weighted heart.

374
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,730
See this to the pantry.

375
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,400
And remain there until I call upon you,

376
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,170
after all have left.

377
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,630
We dishonor this house.

378
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,680
We but do as commanded.

379
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,410
The cause does not alter result.

380
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,300
No. Yet we must move beyond it,

381
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,040
or be driven to madness.

382
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:36,560
The man fucks as a bull, horns to purpose.

383
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,290
Gratitude for gracing the House of Batiatus

384
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,160
with esteemed presence.

385
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,410
One which my husband regrets he cannot share, due to pressing business.

386
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,250
Oh, I had not noticed his absence.

387
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,970
What you have seen is but a taste of the pleasures

388
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,750
afforded you beneath humble roof.

389
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,390
Our gladiators, our slaves,

390
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,810
everything within these walls,

391
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,680
I place at the whims of your desire.

392
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,100
For a single night,

393
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,650
you are the masters of this house.

394
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,150
An enticing offer.

395
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,300
One I would see to full advantage.

396
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,180
Tullius.

397
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,210
I have never cared for surprises.

398
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:41,130
And you have provided many in your days.

399
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:45,380
Your disappointment has often been given a voice. A loud and clear one.

400
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,970
Disappointment can only exist upon expectation.

401
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,500
You proved from tender age

402
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:53,810
that you would listen to no one's counsel save your own.

403
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,730
When did I ever turn from iron advice?

404
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,780
A desire to gain military experience raised your objection.

405
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,720
I turned from it.

406
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,370
You commanded that I run the ludus in your absence.

407
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,490
I obeyed, abandoning my own desires,

408
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,510
long since forgotten.

409
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,490
When has son ever denied the father?

410
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,880
When he married a woman beneath him.

411
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,580
You were wrong about her.

412
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,080
As you have been of many things.

413
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,390
An old man's mistakes swell in the breast,

414
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,090
as remaining days shrink.

415
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,350
You will outlive us all.

416
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,020
You are too stubborn to die.

417
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,480
Do you think me a fool, Quintus?

418
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,890
There are many words I would use towards your description.

419
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,720
Fool lives not amongst them.

420
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,230
No, it's not.

421
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,210
You knew those slaves were shit before we ever set foot to path.

422
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,920
The purchase of men was not the reason

423
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,920
you parted me from the ludus, was it?

424
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,910
You wish to find common ground,

425
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,910
far from the site of former disagreements.

426
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,250
My deception meant only to strengthen bond

427
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,940
between father and son.

428
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,690
This surprise is one most welcome.

429
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,900
And long overdue.

430
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:28,250
Yet we did not need to travel so far from comfort.

431
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,620
I would return home,

432
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,040
and continue in warmer surroundings.

433
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,040
What now?

434
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,570
Yeah.

435
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,440
Should we not wait until break of day?

436
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,990
Oh, a few hours upon the road,

437
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,430
and our own beds to fall to.

438
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,060
Come.

439
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,220
Let us put this wretched city behind us,

440
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,170
and embrace closer future.

441
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,970
How does that man find himself here?

442
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,850
Petronius, or perhaps loose tongue

443
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,440
of his confederates...

444
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,160
His presence changes nothing.

445
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,580
It upends the fucking earth.

446
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,910
I will break words, and gauge intent.

447
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,670
To stand with a smile in our fucking house.

448
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,150
After the injury put to my husband.

449
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,120
Force him from thought, or see effort and risk fall short of reward.

450
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:28,330
Petronius and his guests stand erect with expectation.

451
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,180
Let us see them to climax.

452
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,100
Bring them in.

453
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,480
Good Tullius.

454
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,280
Seeing you here comes a surprise.

455
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,620
Surely not to you.

456
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,020
I warned you of Batiatus' maneuverings not as invitation,

457
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,690
but in hopes you would prevent such foolishness.

458
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,910
And the retribution to valued friend that it would bring.

459
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,530
You warned me to grow favor.

460
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,320
Continue speaking and see it wither.

461
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,170
You have shared drink.

462
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,090
Food.

463
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,640
Distractions of the eye and ear.

464
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,760
Yet these are common things.

465
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:31,790
Enjoyed by men bound by accusing morality of their deeds.

466
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,930
I would see you freed from such human constraints.

467
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,490
Touch these to flesh.

468
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,740
Sever all ties from the mortal world.

469
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,410
And rise as gods in the House of Batiatus.

470
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,860
Jupiter!

471
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:59,750
Never in our dealings Tullius have I been so elevated.

472
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,100
This house is truly is a marvel.

473
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,600
If I am to assume the mantle of a god,

474
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:10,440
I would first prove myself against one.

475
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,410
Oh, you would challenge Gannicus?

476
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,860
Oh, a harmless exhibition.

477
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:17,730
To measure humble skill against vaunted prowess.

478
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,560
I would pause in my desires, to witness such a thing.

479
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,250
Gather the practice swords..

480
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,900
Wood?

481
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,900
Oh, the clash of steel rings through the halls of Olympus, does it not?

482
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,180
Give them your swords.

483
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,570
Let us clear space, and have contest!

484
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,610
See grin removed.

485
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,220
You are to indulge him,

486
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,840
allow a show of blood

487
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:52,130
but level no insult nor injury in return.

488
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,900
Such action would bear unfortunate consequence.

489
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,980
I am to lose?

490
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,150
And win your life.

491
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,650
Come!

492
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,610
Let us see if I recall what I learned,

493
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,820
years ago in service to the Republic.

494
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:51,230
It begins to return to me.

495
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,290
Come on. Come on.

496
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,280
I stand unscathed.

497
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,540
Perhaps you are not the champion I believe.

498
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,450
This goes too far.

499
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,490
Tullius!

500
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,840
The man gives the missio.

501
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:55,090
The match is yours.

502
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,190
A god of the arena.

503
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,340
Saved by a woman.

504
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,930
See him to the Medicus.

505
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,970
An excellent diversion!

506
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,680
Gratitude for allowing it!

507
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:19,580
I have delayed proceedings past reason.

508
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:22,800
Come, let us explore what other pleasures

509
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:26,570
may be mined from the House of Batiatus...

510
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,370
That fucking animal.

511
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,980
To turn simple exhibition to blood.

512
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:39,260
I could have ended the man in half a breath.

513
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,760
Yet you allowed him to nearly kill you?

514
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,180
I was ordered not to raise hand.

515
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,660
Other commands have been more pleasurable.

516
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,070
Are you never serious?

517
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,490
On occasion.

518
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,900
I should return to the villa.

519
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,480
You should.

520
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,640
Why are you doing this?

521
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:11,410
Because to not would be a lie,

522
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,260
much deeper than the one we tell Oenomaus.

523
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,520
I did not want this.

524
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:19,530
I love that man like a brother.

525
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,860
Yet what I feel for you...

526
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,690
Tell me it does not stir in your breast as well.

527
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,830
What I feel means nothing.

528
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,450
It holds the world.

529
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,570
What would you do, if you were my husband?

530
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,950
And you learned of such a thing?

531
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,310
I would kill us both.

532
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,040
You are an imposing brute.

533
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,360
Tell me, giant.

534
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,630
Where do your tastes lie?

535
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,350
Toward cock, or cunt?

536
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,380
Apologies, he does not grasp your language.

537
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,130
Are you able to form words, so that he may?

538
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,030
I serve but to do so.

539
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:53,260
I do not care for struggle nor complaint.

540
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,620
Will you submit to all I ask for?

541
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,300
He is agreeable.

542
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,360
Come then.

543
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,130
I would have your ass quickly.

544
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,780
He tells me he hopes you are not of a gentle nature.

545
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:25,190
Brutes such as this craves rough hands, and cock their equal.

546
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,290
Then he shall be well satisfied.

547
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,950
Come.

548
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,980
He does not drink.

549
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,980
He does not fuck.

550
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,030
Why does he remain?

551
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,290
The man is a mystery.

552
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,600
One I would have forever solved.

553
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,710
You could gauge nothing of his intent?

554
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,130
He fears your husband attempts maneuver.

555
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,450
I believe his presence is meant only to rattle nerves.

556
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,800
Tullius will give voice of this

557
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,450
until the din reaches Titus' ears.

558
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,170
Then we must keep his tongue occupied.

559
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,960
I believe your charms will sway him?

560
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,390
You know nothing of women, Solonius.

561
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,260
And even less of their charms.

562
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,930
Oh, I would not ask you to do this.

563
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,820
That is why I offer.

564
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,440
The only reason?

565
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,910
The man proves troublesome thorn.

566
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,910
Who better to remove it than trusted friend?

567
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,110
Gaia..

568
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,950
Keep thoughts towards elevating this house.

569
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,410
I will see to Tullius...

570
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:47,080
and in the act secure elevation of my own.

571
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,580
To the benefit of all.

572
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:58,680
The woman thinks highly of herself.

573
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,120
An estimation deeply shared.

574
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:06,380
You've become a difficult man to gain private audience with.

575
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,630
It was not always so.

576
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,220
Much has changed since our youth.

577
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,470
Not everything I hope.

578
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,540
I remember a time when it was you,

579
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,770
it was impossible to trap alone.

580
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,790
Every man in Capua was at your feet.

581
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,410
Now I would have but one.

582
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,580
Standing beside me.

583
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,970
I was saddened to hear of your husband's passing.

584
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,810
Were you?

585
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,740
Only with thoughts toward you.

586
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:03,060
Once again with no family to speak of.

587
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,770
No one to care for you.

588
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:12,090
It is a difficult thing.

589
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,580
To find a man of my standing.

590
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,040
I always favored this color.

591
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:25,170
I know.

592
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,720
The gods smile upon me,

593
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:32,550
having had word of this night reach my ears.

594
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:35,030
The fortune is mine.

595
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,050
Yet I would have word of it travel no further.

596
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:45,140
You petition this for yourself?

597
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,650
Or for the House of Batiatus?

598
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,910
Lucretia is as a sister to me.

599
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:02,160
I would not see her injured by wagging tongue.

600
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,720
You ask much.

601
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,340
I offer more...

602
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,940
I swear never to speak of what has happened this night.

603
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,860
If you will deliver message to your friend...

604
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,320
and her husband.

605
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:35,060
One they will take to heart,

606
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:38,870
coming from you...

607
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:04,200
Words have not inflated beyond truth.

608
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:06,120
The offerings of the House of Batiatus

609
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:09,990
are truly to be admired.

610
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,280
Well, even more so upon the sands.

611
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,040
Imagine the excitement our wares would cause,

612
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:18,630
if included in opening celebration of the new arena.

613
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,630
Capua would be blessed by such appearance.

614
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,290
I will send word to your husband to discuss the matter.

615
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:33,680
Oh, I thought this night never to end.

616
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,650
It concludes with this house soaring to the heavens,

617
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,600
upon your wings.

618
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:39,880
A feat aided by your presence.

619
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:42,520
The evening would have gone as well had I never known.

620
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,570
Perhaps more so.

621
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,890
The hour is late.

622
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,410
Take to your bed,

623
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,490
and carry with you my gratitude.

624
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,970
I would err, linger, until all guests have departed.

625
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,420
Oh, Gaia is a woman of great appetite.

626
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:01,350
Dawn will threaten before she's had her fill.

627
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:05,230
Lucretia?

628
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,010
This house is pale shadow, absent your light.

629
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:28,900
See everything restored to proper place.

630
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:31,040
Nothing must be suspected.

631
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,730
Yes, Domina.

632
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,620
I know you feel it's a betrayal.

633
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,650
But there are times when the truth is more hurtful.

634
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,050
Titus must never know.

635
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,740
Domina.

636
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,910
Apollo.

637
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:55,380
God of the sun.

638
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:59,090
And truth.

639
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,540
Something often obscured by the masks we wear.

640
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,910
Your guests have abandoned you.

641
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,810
I thought the toad Solonius would at least remain.

642
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,140
The hour is late.

643
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,330
He believed you occupied for the night.

644
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,500
They say Apollo brings warmth and prosperity,

645
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,490
to those who would pray to him.

646
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,170
Those who understand their place.

647
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,830
On their knees.

648
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,330
Tullius..

649
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,330
You know I often dreamt of Gaia's touch,

650
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,670
when I was a younger man?

651
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:37,300
The taste of her lips.

652
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:39,390
Now they form words in my ear,

653
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,610
asking favor for this house.

654
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:44,020
Placing me in difficult position.

655
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:47,860
Gaia's affections for this house are genuine.

656
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,530
As are her feelings for you.

657
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,190
Returned in kind.

658
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:56,240
She holds my reply.

659
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:59,450
Go to her, and see it delivered.

660
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,000
Gaia...Gaia.

661
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,370
Have you lost mind!?!

662
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,790
Again attempting to maneuver around Tullius?

663
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,260
I only sought to elevate our position...

664
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:54,240
By plunging the good name of this house into muck and shit!

665
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,080
What would you have me do?

666
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,350
Bow and scrape to that fucking lunatic?

667
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,350
He is above our station!

668
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,520
I gave warning not to provoke the man.

669
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:04,970
You ignore it and here are the results.

670
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,260
A Roman citizen.

671
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:08,560
Dead in my house.

672
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:11,530
By the hands of the very man you defend.

673
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,780
You help set this in motion,

674
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,840
and now claim innocence in the outcome?

675
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,230
I claim vengeance.

676
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,390
His life for hers.

677
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,740
Blood and brains on the fucking floor.

678
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,580
Reward well deserved.

679
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:29,960
No.

680
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:31,930
There will be no retribution.

681
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,580
I will see him dead!

682
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:35,860
You will do as fucking commanded!

683
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,070
And what of Gaia?

684
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,310
She partook of too much wine...

685
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,100
as she was often known to do.

686
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:54,760
In the night she lost footing...

687
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,230
and fell to her death at the bottom of the cliff.

688
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:01,310
Do not look to him!

689
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,410
I am the dominus of this fucking house.

690
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,480
See it done.

691
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:06,160
Quintus.

692
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:24,020
So this is why you spirited me to Neapolis.

693
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:26,100
Not to find common ground, but to bury your father.

694
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:27,550
That was not my intent.

695
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,390
You knew nothing of this?

696
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,800
It was all that woman's doing?

697
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:34,730
The two of you feed off each other,

698
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:37,400
fattening yourselves with lies.

699
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:39,850
Well I would see the feast at an end.

700
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,000
What is your meaning?

701
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:43,150
You know my fucking meaning.

702
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,280
That ill bred woman has brought this family nothing but shame.

703
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,470
She is my wife!

704
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:49,130
Because I foolishly allowed it!

705
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:53,230
I wanted you to have something of your own.

706
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,800
Something that held meaning to you,

707
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,080
even if no one else saw it.

708
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:58,670
Yet what has she given you?

709
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,970
No dowry to speak of.

710
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,370
No name to elevate status.

711
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,720
And no heir to carry the name Batiatus.

712
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:14,790
Every choice you make, shapes your fate, Quintus.

713
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,490
I cannot change missteps of the past.

714
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,860
But I will see you on proper path.

715
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:21,810
And Lucretia must be swept from it.

716
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:23,910
You would dissolve my marriage?

717
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,400
No.

718
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:27,830
You will make that choice for yourself.

719
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,190
Or be gone from this house with her.

720
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,170
Wait.

721
00:50:02,170 --> 00:51:00,170

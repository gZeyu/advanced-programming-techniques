1
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,690
How did you get beyond the gates?

2
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,200
They are a weak thing, against such strong purpose...

3
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,360
You risk discovery.

4
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,850
I would risk everything.

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,030
For you.

6
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,420
We cannot do this.

7
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,110
No.

8
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,580
We cannot...

9
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,220
You fucking whore.

10
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,860
Apologies.

11
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,700
Domina summons you.

12
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,670
Apologies. I did not hear you calling.

13
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,710
Gather Gaia's belongings.

14
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,130
Titus would have them removed.

15
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,440
I know how close you held her.

16
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,510
It was an unfortunate accident.

17
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,450
She was taken from us too soon.

18
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,750
Yet blessed to count you as friend, while she was among us.

19
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,420
She was more than friend.

20
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,050
She was family.

21
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,730
Titus has ordered Gaia's slave removed,

22
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,630
and commanded that salt and spelt be scattered.

23
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,220
Decision and ritual, to cleanse

24
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,140
all trace of Gaia from beneath his roof.

25
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,070
I asked Quintus to speak to his father.

26
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,010
To not let Gaia be so easily swept from memory.

27
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,760
But a wife's desires do not always mirror

28
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,150
those of her husband.

29
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,800
Then she must keep them hidden.

30
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,550
We will tell them ritual was performed,

31
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,990
even in absence of the deed.

32
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,160
Naevia and Diona to attest, if questioned.

33
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,500
Gratitude.

34
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,960
I am assaulted on all fronts!

35
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,430
Tullius spills blood in our own house,

36
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,660
yet my father condemns innocent son!

37
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,180
The blame is mine.

38
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,100
If only I had stayed a while longer...

39
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,350
You might have joined Gaia in untimely end.

40
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,890
No. The fault rests with Tullius alone.

41
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,440
Listen to them.

42
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,340
Cheering the final games of the old arena.

43
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,150
Yet here we stand.

44
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,850
As removed from them as Gaia from this world.

45
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,740
Courtesy again of fucking Tullius.

46
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,020
It appears I will be making appearance after all.

47
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,210
You gain invitation to the games?

48
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,080
At request of the Magistrate.

49
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,750
A minor position, the effort far exceeding the reward.

50
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,140
It stirs heart, to know you unscathed

51
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,170
from association with me.

52
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,890
Petronius seemed quite pleased with your offerings.

53
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,090
Perhaps there is still opportunity

54
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,880
for you to gain placement

55
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,010
in the opening games of the new arena.

56
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,150
Fuck the new arena.

57
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,710
Fuck Tullius, fuck the fucking gods!

58
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,730
None of it matters now.

59
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,770
My father gives ultimatum.

60
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,290
Lucretia must no longer hold title of wife.

61
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,490
Titus dissolves your marriage?

62
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,490
That would be a kindness.

63
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,660
He demands that I dissolve it.

64
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,410
Or find myself put to street with her.

65
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,410
Perhaps it best...

66
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,310
if she were to find another husband.

67
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,500
I would sever cock from fucking body,

68
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,730
than see her from my arms.

69
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,450
I would hold the same at first, in your position.

70
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,240
Yet it would crumble to simple reason:

71
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,540
If you still intend to run the ludus,

72
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,340
what other choice remains?

73
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,970
Your friend, he seems of a mood.

74
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,920
As would you, if trusted brother presented your ass

75
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,340
to a Roman for rough pleasure.

76
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,590
You speak of piss.

77
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,640
And your fortunes shrivel, absent Dagan.

78
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,900
Much like his cock.

79
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,370
Friend.

80
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,380
What do you make of Dagan?

81
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,180
Size and skill an advantage.

82
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,600
If dull wit can be honed, he will prove asset.

83
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,520
Gannicus.

84
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,440
Work the palus, if you are able.

85
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,980
Schemes plotted while back is turned.

86
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,730
And there stand the results.

87
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,030
Apologies, Dominus.

88
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,450
You but did as commanded.

89
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,900
The burden lies with errant son,

90
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,240
cast adrift upon churning sea

91
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,790
of impropriety.

92
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,880
I would navigate this house towards calmer waters,

93
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,380
your hands to aid me.

94
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,750
Speak, and see them set to task.

95
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,420
A good count of these men were acquired in my absence.

96
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,430
Arrange competition,

97
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,680
so that I may determine true worth

98
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,930
of all beneath my roof.

99
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:17,730
Our champion should be absent such contest, until recovery.

100
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,400
I hold no man champion, until proven so to my eyes.

101
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,610
Those who stand victorious at ranking's end

102
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,110
will find honored position within these walls.

103
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,180
Those who do not will be sold to the mines.

104
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,120
Harsh reward, for men already bearing own mark.

105
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,400
I remain unconvinced all here are deserving of it.

106
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,250
You are clear to your purpose?

107
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,010
Yes, Dominus.

108
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,190
Gladiators!

109
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,300
Attend!

110
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,780
Diona..

111
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,530
Where is Lucretia?

112
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,730
I will fetch her, Dominus.

113
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,820
No, leave her where she is. You may answer question.

114
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,220
Has salt and spelt been scattered?

115
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,270
Yes, Dominus.

116
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,990
We have swept it from the villa.

117
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,110
A step towards proper path.

118
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,330
Should have let the bitch tell her own lies.

119
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,250
Diona. Lower voice.

120
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,050
So now you command me?

121
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,140
Will you decide who fucks me as well?

122
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,620
I did not mean...

123
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,980
Do not think you stand above me.

124
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,510
Cossutius could easily have chosen you,

125
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,810
had your cunt not been so loose.

126
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,270
Why would you say such things?

127
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,340
We have been as one since we were children.

128
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,470
I count you dearest friend.

129
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,310
Friendship is a privilege.

130
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,630
One not deserving of a whore.

131
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,150
Gnaeus!

132
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,480
Pollux!

133
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,700
Take position!

134
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,290
What is this?

135
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,040
Contest, to rank the men.

136
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,290
My decision yet to be given voice,

137
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,110
and you proceed as if I am already absent.

138
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,960
This house must be turned to order,

139
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,710
regardless of whether you happen upon your senses.

140
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,550
Lucretia is my wife.

141
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,670
A word that should lift a man,

142
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,640
filling his life with ease and children.

143
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,770
She gives you neither.

144
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,260
You seek to tear heart from chest,

145
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,810
and expect gratitude it no longer beats.

146
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,980
I seek only to call you son,

147
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,360
absent shame in the title.

148
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,690
And I only ever wished to make you proud,

149
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,820
father.

150
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,110
The rankings will be decided at contest's end, two days hence.

151
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,110
I will grant you equal time to prove

152
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,950
that you have moved beyond past transgressions.

153
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,790
Dissolve your marriage...

154
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,970
or call me father no more.

155
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,040
I bow and scrape, eating his shit

156
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,160
and thanking him for the pleasure.

157
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,660
And this is reward?

158
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,050
To be turned from my home? My husband?

159
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,890
You must make greater show.

160
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,300
Ply him with dutiful words,

161
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,190
see his cup always filled with wine..

162
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,560
To what end?

163
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,260
He's already made his decision.

164
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,360
No.

165
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,610
He places it in my hands.

166
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,120
To prove that I am worthy of being called his fucking son.

167
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,190
And what response have you given?

168
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,660
I have managed to delay the presenting of it,

169
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,780
until the men have been ranked in contest.

170
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,000
I would have thought your answer immediate.

171
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,470
Well, we need time to convince him of your worth.

172
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,470
Is he the one that needs convincing, Quintus?

173
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,590
I will not have that fucking tone.

174
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,340
I defend you at every turn.

175
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,760
And I have made every sacrifice,

176
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,980
I have borne every duty asked

177
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,880
and yet here I stand on the brink.

178
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,900
What more can I do? I've given you everything.

179
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,650
Except a child.

180
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,690
I speak without thinking.

181
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,990
No, you speak your heart.

182
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,360
Lucretia..

183
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,450
Fuck..

184
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,930
The gods call you from our bed?

185
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,020
I seek their guidance.

186
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,240
Return to sleep.

187
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,910
I would only dream of you.

188
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,790
My own are filled with troubling image.

189
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,000
The walls alive with secrets,

190
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,250
condemning those privy to them.

191
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,180
We have borne witness to unfortunate events,

192
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,810
removed from our hands.

193
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,950
Yet this is an honorable house.

194
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,070
You truly love this place.

195
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,350
My life held no meaning before I was brought here.

196
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,910
This house is the foundation upon which I was built.

197
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,200
I feel nothing but the weight of its beams.

198
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,260
The burdens placed upon us often overwhelm.

199
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,510
But it remains our duty to bear them.

200
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,570
Come.

201
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,600
Let us pray,

202
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,990
and together see weight lifted.

203
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,830
Fuck him up.

204
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,270
Perhaps I should throw the fucking tadpole back.

205
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,450
Gnaeus continues to gain in skill as Retiarius.

206
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,150
Soon he will ignite the crowd, as I promised.

207
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,740
Apologies for the hour of my rising.

208
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,620
Sleep came with difficulty last night.

209
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,130
Your absence was not noticed.

210
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,300
Yet the apology stands.

211
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,880
A noble gesture, well appreciated.

212
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,470
The mulsum more so.

213
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,720
Let me fill your cup.

214
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,230
Duratius!

215
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,260
Crixus!

216
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,710
Take position!

217
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,450
Begin!

218
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,700
Crixus appears of a form, does he not?

219
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,880
He has proven a wise addition.

220
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,210
One Gaia favored from first sight.

221
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,470
Apologies. Tullius arrives.

222
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,590
Tullius?

223
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,890
See him to my office.

224
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,140
Dominus.

225
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,590
What is that man doing in our house?

226
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,440
My house.

227
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,530
And he comes in response to invitation.

228
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,480
Tullius should be hurled from fucking cliffs.

229
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,400
Instead my father takes knee to swallow cock.

230
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,320
And you do nothing to stop him.

231
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,410
Save lay blame where none should rest.

232
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,910
I am a fool in such regard.

233
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,110
Allowing frustration to strip sense from tongue.

234
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,380
And spilling truth as consequence.

235
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,000
I would not hurt you.

236
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,970
Oh everything spins from fucking control.

237
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,460
You desire a son of your own.

238
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:37,630
To carry your name and make you proud.

239
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,630
I would do anything to give you such a treasure.

240
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,990
I must give him my answer tomorrow.

241
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,140
It is too late for such dreams.

242
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,340
It is never too late,

243
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,330
when will is set to purpose.

244
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,210
What would you have me do?

245
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,640
Whatever we must to rid ourselves of this problem.

246
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,060
I recalled your fondness for mulsum.

247
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,350
Varus assures the vintage to be his finest.

248
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,020
I am plied with honeyed wine at every turn this day.

249
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,630
A simple gesture.

250
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,030
To smooth edge from jagged events.

251
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,750
Jagged?

252
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,580
A woman is dead, Tullius.

253
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,150
A Roman woman, in my house.

254
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,390
You go too far.

255
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,980
I have come to make amends.

256
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,140
With a gift.

257
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,900
You offer wine to wash away blood?

258
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,550
I offer position.

259
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,770
In the opening games of the new arena.

260
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,690
Why would you do this?

261
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,110
In honor of history.

262
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,230
Capua has marveled over many champions

263
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,080
from the House of Batiatus over the years.

264
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,830
The storied victories of your men

265
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,570
were part of the old arena

266
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,340
as much as its wood and its sand.

267
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,090
Yet its final day passed

268
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,630
absent the House of Batiatus.

269
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,910
An unforgivable tragedy,

270
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,400
caused by the actions of a foolish son.

271
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,570
He knows my mind towards this regard.

272
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,100
Yet his actions do not stand

273
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,590
alone in deserving condemnation.

274
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,210
The past cannot be changed.

275
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,690
Let us turn eye towards horizon of glories untold.

276
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,510
Ones to be shared in together.

277
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:11,220
And what is it you seek in return for such generosity?

278
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,790
The only thing I have ever sought.

279
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,410
Gannicus.

280
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,300
My son believes the man a champion.

281
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,530
Above all others.

282
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,420
You are a reasonable man, Titus.

283
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,590
You always have been.

284
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,600
All I ask is that you consider what is best for your house.

285
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,820
Enjoy the wine.

286
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,950
Domina calls for food and wine.

287
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,090
Diona?

288
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,340
Pause a moment, if you need.

289
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,000
I will say I could not find you.

290
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:14,000
Naevia...?

291
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,600
My words.

292
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,300
I did not mean them.

293
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,690
I know.

294
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,560
Your friendship...

295
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,510
your love...

296
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,400
It is constant reminder of what I have lost.

297
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,660
I pray to the gods every night.

298
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,440
That the next man I am forced to lie with takes my life...

299
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,010
Gannicus!

300
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,140
You are the victor.

301
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,020
I nearly had you.

302
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,820
Nearly.

303
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,410
Ashur. Dagan.

304
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,170
Take position.

305
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,520
Begin!

306
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,230
Good Tullius has taken his leave?

307
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,020
He has.

308
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,900
And what has he carried from our house this time?

309
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:12,050
Ashur, fucking victor!

310
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,800
Rest, and tend wounds.

311
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,460
Tomorrow brings end of contest.

312
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,600
And appropriate reckoning.

313
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,400
I would have words.

314
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,070
As would I.

315
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,570
Accompany me to town, and let us break them.

316
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,950
Melitta.

317
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,590
Once they have departed,

318
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,890
there is something I would ask of you.

319
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,650
I have felt your eyes lingering.

320
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,550
Yet they always turn away when I meet them.

321
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,320
As should yours.

322
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,990
Then I must tear them out.

323
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,360
If they are to obey such a command.

324
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,750
You must stop this.

325
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:32,250
I have vowed to, a thousand times a day.

326
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,700
To return to drink

327
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,870
and whores, forcing you from my mind.

328
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,930
Then I catch glimpse of you.

329
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,850
And my world ends.

330
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,180
I have never felt greater love...

331
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,760
than when I hold my husband in my arms.

332
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,190
Gannicus.

333
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:20,410
What seizes you?

334
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,480
You drop guard, allowing Barca advantage.

335
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:26,170
The man almost had you.

336
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,720
I was lost in a moment.

337
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,690
Caught by a dream.

338
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,490
Then wake from it.

339
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,040
Leave us.

340
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,220
You are a Gaul, are you not?

341
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,560
Yes, Domina.

342
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,140
Many believe the seed of a Gaul

343
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,590
to rival that of Jupiter himself.

344
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,820
Tell me.

345
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,120
How many sons sprang from your father's cock?

346
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,200
Five, Domina.

347
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,960
And from his father before him?

348
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,430
The same.

349
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,250
Your subligaria.

350
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,740
Remove it.

351
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,790
You are never to speak of this.

352
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,720
Do you understand, slave?

353
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,970
Yes, Domina.

354
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,410
Well, I would not look upon you.

355
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,650
The sight turns stomach.

356
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,910
Enter me.

357
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,710
And do not cease until you have spilled seed.

358
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:59,520
My very first memories were formed within this arena.

359
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,890
Attending the games as a child,

360
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,710
upon my father's knee.

361
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,680
Too young to yet form words.

362
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,190
Yet even then I knew.

363
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,570
That I would give my life to this place.

364
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,230
A noble calling.

365
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,330
One I had dreamed you would share in.

366
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,870
Was I not raised here as well? Upon your knee?

367
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,370
You were.

368
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,600
I fear it is the one thing we hold common now.

369
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,440
And you stand me at fault.

370
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,590
As you always have.

371
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,790
I stand you accountable for your actions.

372
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:46,420
You have caused much heartache.

373
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,560
Never heeding my words.

374
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,790
Fighting me at every turn,

375
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:57,400
your ambition the bolt hurled against my wishes.

376
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:02,120
And here is where it has led.

377
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,410
Two men at constant odds.

378
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:09,030
Mired in the ruins of what might have been.

379
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,800
Ruins I aided in creation.

380
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:16,220
I wanted you to join me here, to see them buried.

381
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,800
You are my son, Quintus.

382
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,890
And I will always love you.

383
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,720
No matter the path you take.

384
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:30,930
What moves such downpour, after eternal drought?

385
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,240
Tullius makes offer.

386
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,510
Position in the opening games.

387
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,540
At what price?

388
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,940
Gannicus.

389
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,610
And your response?

390
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,780
Without meaning, if you are not

391
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,450
by my side upon the day's arrival.

392
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,520
You give me until tomorrow,

393
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,290
and yet now press for answer?

394
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,370
A day, a year...

395
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,290
A man either knows his heart or he does not.

396
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,720
Stand with me. And we shall rise together, huh?

397
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,720
I will not turn from my wife.

398
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,090
You really did not want this life, did you?

399
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,230
Well, whatever one you find in this world,

400
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,980
I pray it brings you peace.

401
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,450
Father.

402
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,790
A memento.

403
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,380
Of days past.

404
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,180
I could not do it.

405
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,800
Sit beside me.

406
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:28,880
I had instrument in hand.

407
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:32,000
His back was turned.

408
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:35,810
One simple motion, and our troubles removed forever.

409
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,650
But when the moment came...

410
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,200
He spoke to me with affection.

411
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,670
Giving voice to sentiment...

412
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,540
I was wrong to push you to such thoughts against him.

413
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,920
Some actions carry too steep a price.

414
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,520
Even in refraining, the ground beneath us pitches.

415
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,440
Tomorrow we must prepare to leave this house.

416
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,680
You've given your answer?

417
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,860
The only one my tongue could ever speak.

418
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,770
You honor me.

419
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,970
I attempt to gain the sun, only to plunge into the depths.

420
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,030
While Tullius rides with Apollo,

421
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,780
bribing his way with an amphora of mulsum

422
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,450
and promises to the air.

423
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,830
It does not matter.

424
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,940
We must leave this house.

425
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:49,050
With nothing but our clothes, a few possessions.

426
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,960
Not even a slave to attend us.

427
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,100
We have lost everything.

428
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,590
Not everything.

429
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,540
It pains to lose Dagan.

430
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,690
The Syrian had shown much promise.

431
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,010
Yet Dagan is now blind to attack from the right.

432
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,680
Well, let us shift from the unfortunate to the blessed.

433
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,200
Who holds the pinnacle?

434
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:21,360
Two men own equal victory. Crixus and Gannicus.

435
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,640
They are to face each other in the final contest.

436
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:26,010
Oh, Gannicus is removed from contention.

437
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,760
I have sent word to Tullius agreeing to terms of sale.

438
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,600
Sale to Tullius?

439
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,790
Well, he makes offer.

440
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,990
I had thoughts towards refusal, but they have dimmed.

441
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,460
I would speak towards reigniting them.

442
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,830
Oh, strong words Oenomaus.

443
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:45,130
Quintus has plied me with many upon the subject.

444
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:48,120
He inflates Gannicus' worth, at great cost to this house.

445
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,920
Apologies, but in this your son and I are in agreement.

446
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,640
None stand more worthy to hold the title of champion.

447
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,980
You allow personal relation to cloud judgment.

448
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,650
True, Gannicus is trusted friend.

449
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,310
Yet I speak from position of Doctore.

450
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,070
If I pull acceptance to Tullius,

451
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,640
we will be excluded from future games.

452
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:10,770
We would be forced to beg for matches

453
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,320
in the lesser venues of Nola or Neapolis.

454
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:15,490
A heavy price.

455
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,660
As is often that of the honorable choice.

456
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,830
Let the gods show us the way then.

457
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,450
If Gannicus proves himself against Crixus,

458
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
he shall remain. Yet if he falls,

459
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,090
he shall leave this house.

460
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,840
Following the others that have failed to honor it.

461
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,930
Dominus.

462
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,140
I am to be sold to fucking Tullius?

463
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,310
Only if you fall.

464
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,480
Clear mind.

465
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,410
Prove yourself the man I know you to be.

466
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,560
Doctore.

467
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,950
Let us begin.

468
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,030
And know who truly stands champion of this house.

469
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,660
Crixus.

470
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,660
Gannicus.

471
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,930
Take position.

472
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:15,000
A second chance to prove myself against you.

473
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,440
The gods have heard my prayers.

474
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,350
And they curse you in the answering.

475
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,810
Begin!

476
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,300
Father.

477
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,470
We're near ready to leave.

478
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,420
Pause a moment. And see contest ended.

479
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,100
Finish preparations.

480
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,310
Domina.

481
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,600
Crixus again shows form.

482
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,610
As does Gannicus.

483
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:12,570
Both men you have often praised.

484
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:20,250
Perhaps you have learned something after all these years.

485
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,570
Perhaps.

486
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,420
You have lost sense.

487
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:43,220
All attention is upon the match.

488
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,140
No one will notice your absence for many hours.

489
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,860
They will brand me fugitivus!

490
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,480
They will not find you.

491
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,570
Buy passage far from Capua.

492
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,540
And the things that have been done to you.

493
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,950
Where did you get this?

494
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,410
Spirited from Gaia's things.

495
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,070
They will not be missed.

496
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:04,740
You fade with each day.

497
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,460
Do not make me bear witness to your passing.

498
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,460
Come with me.

499
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,300
I attend Domina.

500
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,550
My absence would be noticed.

501
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,640
Go. Before contest is ended.

502
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:21,010
I will see you again, one day. I swear to you.

503
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,980
Go.

504
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,840
I shall miss this.

505
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,820
Water.

506
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:55,130
Crixus, victor.

507
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,120
Why did you drop guard?

508
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,790
You are champion now.

509
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,090
That is all that matters.

510
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,820
I would not thought it possible.

511
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,320
To be said of many things this day.

512
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:22,190
Quintus, it's not too late ..

513
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,580
Father?

514
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,120
Fetch the Medicus!

515
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:41,210
Your father burns high fever.

516
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:42,630
A worrisome condition,

517
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:43,630
for a man of his years.

518
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,880
Well, is there nothing to be done?

519
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:47,520
I have not the herbs.

520
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,020
And the hour is late for us to procure them.

521
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,470
Go. I'll watch over him.

522
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,470
I'll pound on every door in Capua

523
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,920
until we have what is needed.

524
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,510
And I would aid in the effort.

525
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,680
And be welcomed for it. Come.

526
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,110
Keep him still until we return.

527
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,870
A little wine, if seized by fit.

528
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:19,380
Drink.

529
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:23,950
Move Tullius' wine from sight.

530
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,060
Apologies, Domina.

531
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:39,700
I would have permission to see Gannicus.

532
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:42,070
You ask this now?

533
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,770
I know he is to be sold tomorrow.

534
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:46,780
I would have final words, before he departs.

535
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:21,530
I would share drink. With an old friend.

536
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:27,450
Is that all that I am?

537
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,170
A friend?

538
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,620
Gannicus...

539
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:36,020
I do not care for honey in my wine.

540
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:37,990
It serves only to mask bitter taste.

541
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,630
A blessing, in such moments.

542
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,340
You are to be sold to Tullius.

543
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:57,230
Oenomaus warned of it, should I fall to Crixus.

544
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,150
You let Crixus win.

545
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,980
Why would you do such a thing?

546
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:06,190
Because I cannot stay within these walls.

547
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,610
To gaze upon you every day...

548
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,620
and be denied your touch...

549
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:13,030
I have never turned from challenge.

550
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,700
Yet I am without strength to face this one.

551
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:19,170
Then it is for the best.

552
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,780
Because despite my words...

553
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,460
I stand as weak...

554
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,930
I want no wine.

555
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,310
Medicus gave order.

556
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:50,520
Drink.

557
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,470
Should help you rest.

558
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:03,550
My son... gives up everything for you.

559
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,880
As I for him.

560
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,090
You truly love him?

561
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:12,990
With all my heart.

562
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:17,180
He is never happier, than when he is by your side.

563
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,830
Tell me I have been mistaken about you.

564
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,070
Tell me you are not the serpent I have thought you to be.

565
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:32,390
I am not.

566
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,110
I'm far worse.

567
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:40,080
I never cared what you thought of me.

568
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,080
My lack of breeding.

569
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,850
The absence of family or a name of worth.

570
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,360
These things I cannot deny.

571
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:50,430
But how low you considered your son...

572
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:54,300
a man I love more than life itself...

573
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:58,900
That could not be tolerated.

574
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,540
So I began poisoning your beloved honey wine.

575
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:08,780
My intent not to rob you of life.

576
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,900
Only to mimic illness.

577
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:18,400
A cough, increasing in its discomfort,

578
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:22,070
easily blamed on Capua's dust and heat.

579
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,160
It brought much joy when you departed

580
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,830
for the wet shores of Sicilia.

581
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,660
And Quintus,

582
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,330
how he flourished when removed

583
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,300
from overbearing shadow.

584
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:36,810
And then you returned.

585
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:37,580
To torture him,

586
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,060
as you did all those years.

587
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:44,600
So I began bringing you your honeyed wine again.

588
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:47,770
To force you back to Sicilia.

589
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,600
Yet it was not enough.

590
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:52,590
You were not moved, despite ailing health.

591
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,780
No.

592
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:03,420
A more permanent solution was required between us.

593
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,370
One that I added to Tullius' gift.

594
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:41,200
Quintus will not forgive Tullius this.

595
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:44,910
He will strike in your name.

596
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:46,960
And Gaia's death will be avenged.

597
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,910
Breath. Breath.

598
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,040
Breath.

599
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,970
You curse this house.

600
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:17,170
No, father.

601
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,190
I elevate it.

602
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,900
Breath. Melitta.

603
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:48,700
Melitta. Breath.

604
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:51,470
Melitta. Breath!

605
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,980
Noooo!

606
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,980
Domina.

607
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:38,900
Melitta..

608
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,740
The wine...

609
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:42,940
it was the wine...

610
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,000
Take her.

611
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,760
Oenomaus must not know she came to your cell.

612
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,870
She was never with you.

613
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,880
Return to the ludus.

614
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,140
Go!

615
00:53:13,140--> 00:54:11,140

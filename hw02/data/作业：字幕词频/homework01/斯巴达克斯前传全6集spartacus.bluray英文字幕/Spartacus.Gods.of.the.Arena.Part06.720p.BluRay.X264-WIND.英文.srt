1
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,910
It is a heavy thing...

2
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,510
to see your father, so strong in life,

3
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,980
unable to rise.

4
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,760
The weight of it keenly felt.

5
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,460
Titus was much loved by this city.

6
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,200
Hold comfort in the knowledge.

7
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,200
The magistrate himself pays respect?

8
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,300
It's a great honor.

9
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,650
For my father.

10
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,390
Years I wished for blistering tongue to cool.

11
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,640
Only to long for it to scorch ear once more.

12
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,990
I know you did not wish him gone in such a manner.

13
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,900
Nor did I, despite our many differences.

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,960
Yet the gods have willed it.

15
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,980
The gods had no fucking hand in this.

16
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,710
Tullius' alone inflicts injury.

17
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,900
And how shall it be answered?

18
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,650
Apologies.

19
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,880
Unwelcome guest makes appearance.

20
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,970
Vettius.

21
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,530
Temper emotion, and greet him with measured voice.

22
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,120
It would serve no purpose to have confrontation here

23
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,310
in front of the Magistrate.

24
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,290
Good Batiatus.

25
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,030
My sympathy for the passing of your father.

26
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,330
A titan, standing far above all who follow.

27
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,410
You come absent Tullius?

28
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,400
I thought nothing could keep the man

29
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,600
from observance of such a tragedy.

30
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,400
He confers with dignitaries from Antioch.

31
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,470
Antioch?

32
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,110
He is engaged in business there,

33
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,720
to the further glory of the Republic.

34
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,560
He sends regret that he could not be present.

35
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,950
And a reminder

36
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,230
that a bargain was struck with your father before he passed.

37
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,620
Concerning the sale of Gannicus.

38
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,430
You dare broach subject on such a fucking day?

39
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,540
We have respectfully waited for eight of them to pass.

40
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,290
Your period of mourning comes to conclusion.

41
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,920
Tomorrow the sun greets a ninth day,

42
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,320
and with it we expect delivery of Gannicus.

43
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,320
Turn desire towards piss and shit,

44
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,010
and see yourselves well satisfied.

45
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,380
Then Tullius will be forced to withdraw offer

46
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,490
to include your men in the opening games of the new arena.

47
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,420
And all that follow.

48
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,610
Apologies.

49
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,610
Batiatus summons the men.

50
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,840
You will see her ashes beneath the ground?

51
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,380
As is her people's custom.

52
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,220
I did not know of them.

53
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,240
There were many things that I did not pause to ask her of.

54
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,600
Now I am but filled with questions.

55
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,990
Speak of her, in quiet moments.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,480
And see them answered.

57
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,900
Oenomaus--

58
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,060
She was the rarest of women.

59
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,650
A flower of beauty and compassion,

60
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,530
in a world of shit.

61
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,170
I would assume her place, so that her laugh may once again fill solemn air.

62
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,990
She would not wish it.

63
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,380
She loved you.

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,460
As a brother.

65
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,550
As I loved her.

66
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,220
We have known the agony of heart ripped

67
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,670
yet beating from sundered chest.

68
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,240
And yet here we stand.

69
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,540
The House of Batiatus is no stranger to misfortune.

70
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,270
To the cruel whims of the gods,

71
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,940
and base men that would position themselves as such.

72
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,940
And yet.

73
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,130
Here we stand.

74
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,560
This house is built atop unshakable foundation

75
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,090
of honor and respect.

76
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,790
And in no man were these qualities more evident

77
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,350
than Titus Lentulus Batiatus.

78
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,130
I will laud my father's memory

79
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,800
by seeing the House of Batiatus elevated

80
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,570
beyond the imagining of my ancestors.

81
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:36,770
I will need all of you to see it done. Men of hard purpose and desire.

82
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,940
Let previous decisions fall aside.

83
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,450
None among you will be sent to the mines,

84
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,460
regardless of standing!

85
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,910
The sun has set on an era.

86
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,990
Let us celebrate the name Titus Lentulus Batiatus

87
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,580
with drink and the clash of swords!

88
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,070
To carry my father to the afterlife!

89
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,100
Take position!

90
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,010
Will you fight your man to conclusion?

91
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,650
Or drop defense and allow for hollow victory,

92
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,770
as you did with me before Titus?

93
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,650
You are champion now.

94
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,800
Do not broach fucking subject again.

95
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,570
Spill blood upon the sand,

96
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:32,000
yet live to one day die with glory and honor in the arena!

97
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,590
Begin!

98
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,160
This is all that remains.

99
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,160
When the smoke clears and the embers die.

100
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,740
The sum total of a man's life.

101
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,340
This was my father's last act before his death.

102
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,310
A bill of sale, transferring your ownership.

103
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,140
The cause that moved you to seek audience,

104
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,700
on the day I watched my father burn?

105
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,120
Apologies, Dominus.

106
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,380
I could wait no longer.

107
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,080
To honor my father's wishes sees you fall to control

108
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,800
of a man most hated.

109
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,630
To defy them sees this house forever

110
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,120
excluded from the new arena.

111
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,660
A cock in the ass, from either direction.

112
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,200
Speak, and give reason

113
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,390
to see this join my father's ashes.

114
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,590
I have no words towards such end.

115
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,290
I come to see agreement honored.

116
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,550
You wish to leave this house?

117
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,050
I wish to see blood.

118
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,820
See me delivered to Tullius' care,

119
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,220
and I will see his life for your father's.

120
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,780
My father never aimed a favored word towards you.

121
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,620
Yet you entreat to be the instrument of his vengeance?

122
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,930
Or is it another you seek it for?

123
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,760
You would sacrifice your life,

124
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,410
in the memory of hers?

125
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,860
I would sacrifice a thousand if I had but had them.

126
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,880
If you had such stirrings for Melitta,

127
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,940
why did you not fight harder in the contest before my father?

128
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,640
You could have taken Crixus, and remained here,

129
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,720
close to your heart's desires.

130
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,920
The match was lost before sword was ever raised.

131
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,260
The same can be said of your plan against Tullius.

132
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,450
He is forever surrounded not only by his own men,

133
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,480
but by good citizens who would quickly come to the aid

134
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,150
of such a "Noble" Roman.

135
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,950
Then they too shall fall.

136
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,440
You do not fucking think!

137
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,920
This grants ownership to Tullius' lap dog Vettius!

138
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,130
You would be sent to the boy's ludus in fucking Nola.

139
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,230
A year could pass before you find yourself close enough to Tullius.

140
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,920
I would suffer a lifetime but to have the chance to strike.

141
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,840
This house would be the one that suffers!

142
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,500
A year of the greatest gladiator in the Republic

143
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,560
fighting for those shits!

144
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,480
A year of you needing to win each fight

145
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,980
against my fucking men

146
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:15,320
in the hopes of gaining an audience with Tullius.

147
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,940
Will he not wish to see the man he has fought so hard to gain?

148
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,990
When so delivered?

149
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,130
Your desires are well noted.

150
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,460
I will weigh argument,

151
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,100
and come to an answer in the balance.

152
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,490
Dominus.

153
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,000
Fetch more wine.

154
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,590
Vettius' appearance was ill timed.

155
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,760
He is a dog, untrained where not to shit.

156
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,650
The hand that grips his leash is of greater concern.

157
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,770
Has Quintus voiced thought towards Tullius?

158
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,490
He has not.

159
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,460
Yet what would any of us do,

160
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,020
to see the death of one so loved avenged?

161
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,990
The very heart of my concern.

162
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,460
To take action against Tullius

163
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,330
is to invite mortal consequence.

164
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,170
He has made repeated attacks against this house.

165
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,470
You would have us do nothing?

166
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,100
I would have you live.

167
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,970
If the situation with Tullius turns to further disadvantage...

168
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,450
Know that you may always seek refuge beneath my roof.

169
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,230
As a friend.

170
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,320
Where is the fucking wine?

171
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,940
Naevia brings more.

172
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,270
I should take my leave.

173
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,270
No, stay.

174
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,640
I would have your counsel.

175
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,910
Gannicus presses to honor terms towards his sale.

176
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,310
Then the matter is resolved.

177
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,780
Fuck resolution.

178
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,030
The man only desires close proximity to Tullius,

179
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,830
and the villain's throat beneath his hands.

180
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,100
He would kill Tullius for us?

181
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,650
Do you believe it possible?

182
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,510
You speak of madness!

183
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,260
Tullius is far too cautious to ever lower guard.

184
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,630
Especially in the presence of a man

185
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,710
loyal to the House of Batiatus.

186
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,350
And what would brave Solonius do in my fucking position?!

187
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,820
Turn blind eye towards the murder of his father?!

188
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,440
He would be certain to strike appropriate target.

189
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,470
What if Tullius had no hand in this?

190
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,840
His gift of wine was tainted with death.

191
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,530
But was it by Tullius' hand?

192
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,730
Or another moved by equal grievance?

193
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,700
What if Vettius is the true cause of this?

194
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,530
The boy's hatred for you is well known.

195
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,780
You are right.

196
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,280
Vengeance would stand a hollow vessel were it

197
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,040
not filled with retribution against all who have injured this house.

198
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,830
Including young Vettius.

199
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,030
You twist my intention!

200
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,530
He but straightens purpose.

201
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,830
Is this not what set tragedy in motion?

202
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,830
Arrogance and impatience?

203
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,300
You are forever reaching beyond grasp,

204
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,090
and dragging those beside you as you fall.

205
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,540
And you have never had the stomach

206
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,660
to do what it takes to make a fucking name in this world!

207
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,810
Good Solonius, forever bowing and scraping

208
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,710
in the shit of his betters.

209
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,700
Is it any wonder no woman would have you?

210
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,520
Emotion carries us beyond reason.

211
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,830
Solonius has been as a brother to us.

212
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,320
It has been a trying day, in a long succession of many.

213
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,900
Apologies.

214
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,780
I have asked much of our friendship, with little reward.

215
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,900
Yet I must seek more,

216
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,880
if we are to see injuries against our house redressed.

217
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,820
What are your thoughts?

218
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,260
They yet stand clouded.

219
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,340
Come, let us put minds together,

220
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,020
and see them cleared.

221
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,050
This mark carries great honor.

222
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,930
And even greater responsibility.

223
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,690
Melitta held many years as my body slave.

224
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,110
And shall be missed beyond the measure of words.

225
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,890
I expect equal loyalty from you now.

226
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,290
You are always to stand by my side,

227
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,900
never to leave it.

228
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,450
Or this house.

229
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,270
As Diona chose.

230
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,630
I understand why she fled.

231
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,660
It was an unfortunate thing,

232
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,640
to be so used by men for base entertainment.

233
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,330
I understand.

234
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,450
Yet cannot forgive.

235
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,760
Yes, Domina.

236
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,680
What I can do...

237
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:41,040
is make promise that no one will ever lay hands upon you for sport.

238
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,350
Your maidenhood will be preserved as precious gift,

239
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,630
and given only to the most worthy.

240
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,190
As Melitta was given to Oenomaus.

241
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,250
There.

242
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,200
We are forever bound to each other.

243
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,480
Bring oil and a sharpened blade.

244
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,690
I would be rid of this fucking beard.

245
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,820
Solonius?

246
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,990
His courage hardened, and hands set to task.

247
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,040
Then you have come to decision.

248
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,380
One that not even good Tullius will see coming.

249
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,750
Gather my father's ashes.

250
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,520
And tell Oenomaus to prepare Gannicus to leave these walls.

251
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,760
Batiatus again spits in my face?

252
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,560
News absent surprise.

253
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,850
A snake by nature favors maneuvering upon its belly.

254
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,800
I would stand upright. Among honorable men.

255
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,230
Where does he take Gannicus?

256
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,780
Batiatus sent me to secure sale

257
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,280
to the Syrian trader Galeagra.

258
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,080
By morning Gannicus will be on a ship

259
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,320
sailing towards points unknown.

260
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,620
Forever beyond your reach.

261
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:55,560
You aided Batiatus in this?

262
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,460
I have known the man for many years.

263
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,490
I was...

264
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,540
conflicted.

265
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,940
As am I.

266
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,080
On whether to strip flesh from your fucking face.

267
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,080
Wait!

268
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,300
I came to you with this!

269
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,640
After the fact.

270
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,850
There is still time!

271
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,330
He meets the Syrian at the edge of the city!

272
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,670
Gather the men.

273
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,470
I cannot believe even Batiatus so thick, to imagine concealing such an act.

274
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,440
He will spin story... of Gannicus escaping.

275
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,710
To perhaps follow his slave Diona,

276
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,540
who recently went to foot.

277
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,000
He thinks me the fool, to accept the tale?

278
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,900
Batiatus knows you will summon him to meeting.

279
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,500
To "Discuss" The matter.

280
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,000
He lays plans to see much coin in your men's hands.

281
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:46,230
Payment in aid against your life when he stands before you.

282
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,950
The fucking cock on him.

283
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,270
Batiatus has always thought himself above those around him.

284
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,490
Even closest friend.

285
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,230
I shall prove the notion false.

286
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,290
And see fucking son join his father.

287
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,990
Where are they?

288
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,880
I will search ahead.

289
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,050
Stay where you are.

290
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,520
I would not have you from my fucking side.

291
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,850
If you had sold me to Tullius,

292
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,860
no one else's life would be at risk.

293
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,940
With great risk comes greater reward.

294
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,170
And I would have mine.

295
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,070
The Syrians arrives.

296
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,450
I grow weary of these games, Batiatus.

297
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,680
And would see them to bitter end.

298
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,940
As would I.

299
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,330
Come.

300
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,790
Let us embrace, you fucking cunt.

301
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,800
Fucking kill him Barca!

302
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,470
Fuck you!

303
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,550
You fucking shit!

304
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,360
You fuck!

305
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,660
Wait, hold!

306
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,200
Said hold!

307
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,500
Such a death...

308
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,510
would be far too quick.

309
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,310
Bind him.

310
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,270
And you.

311
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,410
You played your part to fucking perfection!

312
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,810
It was not difficult.

313
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,220
When passion for vengeance overtakes caution,

314
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,930
even the keenest of minds is easily deceived.

315
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,980
Modest to the fucking last.

316
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,950
See these bodies put to grass.

317
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,650
Then get yourself to the Medicus.

318
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,870
You are sure to your purpose?

319
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,760
My path has never been clearer.

320
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,270
Good Tullius.

321
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,780
Let us have final words.

322
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,260
Before you depart this life.

323
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,780
The lamb finally wakes.

324
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,280
Calm yourself.

325
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,470
I merely wish to break words.

326
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,120
Seek to raise alarm,

327
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,290
and find throat slit well in advance of aid.

328
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,180
We are clear?

329
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,630
You are fucking dead.

330
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,900
Threats absent form,

331
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:07,170
without Tullius to support them.

332
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,600
What have you done to him?

333
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,140
Me?

334
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,730
I have done nothing.

335
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,110
In all of this,

336
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,370
I have never known quarrel with good Tullius.

337
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,110
Yet Batiatus...

338
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,080
he is of a contrary nature.

339
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,530
And moves even as we speak to end his conflict with your man.

340
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,400
Forever.

341
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,740
The opening of the arena is upon us.

342
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,620
Tullius' absence will be noted.

343
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,110
And your part in it quick upon heel.

344
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,790
You are mistaken.

345
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,700
No one will suspect Tullius has left this world.

346
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,780
Not when trusted Vettius heralds news

347
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,420
that he has unexpectedly set sail abroad.

348
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,370
To attend pressing matters in Antioch.

349
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,920
What would move tongue to voice such fucking lie?

350
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:50,310
It more easily forms words to see you and Batiatus

351
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,640
executed for your crimes.

352
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,480
Based upon what evidence?

353
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,130
We were not found knife in hand,

354
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,600
kneeling beside body.

355
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,240
A body which even now Batiatus

356
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,320
conceals beyond reach of human eyes.

357
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:06,130
Now, my concern rests with your safety.

358
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,960
Attempt to raise unwarranted suspicion,

359
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,820
and Batiatus would be sure to take offense.

360
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,400
And without Tullius to protect you...

361
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,100
Youth finally matures.

362
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,380
Now that we have settled issue,

363
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,160
let us turn to other matters.

364
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,030
Of a more personal nature...

365
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,340
All things change...

366
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,030
What we hold close to our hearts

367
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,150
eventually pass from this world.

368
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:47,350
And what we once turned from in disgust...

369
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,660
We embrace as necessity.

370
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,330
Raise your eyes.

371
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,130
What do you see?

372
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,030
The Domina of this house.

373
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,390
Is that all?

374
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,390
I see a woman.

375
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,620
Unlike any I have seen before.

376
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,120
Better.

377
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:16,880
I did not think I pleased you.

378
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,160
When last called to your chambers.

379
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,490
I love my husband, beyond all men.

380
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,890
I would do anything for him.

381
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,390
And his legacy.

382
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:35,530
I do not need seek pleasure.

383
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,500
I need only your cock.

384
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,530
Speak of this,

385
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,630
and see it parted from your body.

386
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,300
Yes, Domina.

387
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,110
Your hair and your beard

388
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,720
give the appearance of a fucking animal.

389
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:02,690
I would have you reformed into the semblance of a man.

390
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,540
To make the lie I must tell myself more convincing...

391
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,580
A game well played, Batiatus.

392
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,120
Now let us come to terms.

393
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,530
Your man Gannicus obviously means a good deal to you,

394
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,500
to press to such extremes.

395
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:02,410
I will cease my pursuit of him.

396
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,670
Offer more.

397
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,780
I will see your house take prominence in all upcoming games.

398
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,210
More.

399
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,550
Speak desire, and see it attended.

400
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,100
I desire to see you suffer.

401
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,550
As I have suffered at your fucking hands.

402
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,190
Your suffering has only begun, lanista.

403
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,860
When it is discovered what you have done to me!

404
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,640
You will not be discovered.

405
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,630
Nor missed.

406
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,280
Solonius moves young Vettius,

407
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,860
towards offering proper explanation

408
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,450
for your disappearance.

409
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,230
Vettius?

410
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,570
The city will mourn.

411
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,490
Soon your name will be spoken of less and less.

412
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,790
Until it is lost to history.

413
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,780
I should have had your life at the beginning of this.

414
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,750
The mistake is mine,

415
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,180
having stayed hand in respect of your father.

416
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,200
Respect?

417
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:07,160
Then pay it to the remains of the man himself!

418
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,890
Tell him how high you hold him!

419
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,110
Even as your poisoned wine robs him of fucking life!

420
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,110
Tell him!

421
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,690
Tell him, you fucking shit!

422
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,870
Why should I strike against your father?

423
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,380
He was an honorable Roman.

424
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,620
A man who knew his place.

425
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:32,570
As I know yours.

426
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,100
There will be an accounting, Batiatus.

427
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:41,440
For this and everything that follows.

428
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,500
The gods will see to it some day.

429
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,750
But not this one.

430
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,860
This arena was your life.

431
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,220
Add to its foundation.

432
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,490
Have eyes ever beheld such a sight?

433
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,660
The laurel crown of the Republic.

434
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:30,640
Its majesty even more evident when viewed from the pulvinus.

435
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,450
A great honor, to be invited by Tullius.

436
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,820
One I fear undeserved.

437
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,870
Yet he is a difficult man to turn from.

438
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,920
A fact well known to all present.

439
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,760
I am surprised by his delay.

440
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,010
The opening of the arena

441
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,010
has been the only subject on his tongue.

442
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,440
Now he stands late to his own celebration.

443
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,670
Apologies.

444
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,860
Tullius regrets he will be absent altogether.

445
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:04,280
What could wrest him from so high a perch?

446
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,520
Pressing concerns abroad in Antioch.

447
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,240
His departure was...

448
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,440
unexpected.

449
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,750
The arena would not exist without Tullius.

450
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:16,540
We would not be standing here, were it not for his actions.

451
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,300
We should halt the celebrations until his return.

452
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,300
Agreed.

453
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,460
I shall address the crowd --

454
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,630
Tullius sends hard instruction for ceremony

455
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,560
to carry without him.

456
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,970
This arena was a gift to his beloved city.

457
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,310
He would not see misfortune

458
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,060
to stand in the way of the giving of it.

459
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:35,330
A most gracious offer, well received.

460
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,010
Come.

461
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,480
Haunt Tullius' place by my side,

462
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,550
possessing his spirit for the occasion.

463
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,940
Again I must offer apology.

464
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:46,190
I make preparations to follow Tullius to Antioch.

465
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,190
What of your ventures here?

466
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,740
Your ludus?

467
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:52,780
I am retiring from the lowly call of the lanista.

468
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,720
In favor of station more befitting a man of breeding.

469
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:58,120
What will become of your men?

470
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,670
They fight this very day.

471
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,460
I would not see your brief labors turn to naught.

472
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:05,380
Solonius and I can make fair offer to divide them.

473
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,760
Deeply appreciated.

474
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,800
Yet unnecessary.

475
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,030
Solonius and I have already come to terms.

476
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,020
Terms?

477
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:16,770
I have transferred deed to all my gladiators to Solonius,

478
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,390
under whose noble banner they will fight this day.

479
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,940
You are indeed blessed, Solonius.

480
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:26,180
Your ludus now stands above all others in sheer numbers.

481
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,370
May the gods continue to show favor.

482
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,900
I must take my leave.

483
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,820
Give good Solonius all consideration

484
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:36,260
towards future games.

485
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,470
Tullius and I would have it so.

486
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,050
You are overly generous.

487
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,220
Come. I would see you away.

488
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,250
The boy all but runs from us.

489
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,560
Vettius has always been little more than Tullius' pet.

490
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,230
Is it any wonder he runs to heel

491
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,040
when leash is jerked?

492
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,630
Batiatus speaks truth.

493
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,590
Let us put absent friends from mind,

494
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,500
and turn towards the glories of the day.

495
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,110
You have done well.

496
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,920
I but dance to the yank of strings.

497
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,170
Avoid them forming a noose,

498
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,290
and never return to Capua while I draw breath.

499
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,680
I shall pray for the day it ceases.

500
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,510
We were supposed to divide Vettius' men among us.

501
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,460
What the fuck are you doing?

502
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,970
What it takes to make a name in this world.

503
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,140
After years of "Bowing and scraping in shit".

504
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,270
Is that what this is about?

505
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,520
A few words spoken in anger absent thought?

506
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,440
A few words?

507
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,030
You name me friend and brother,

508
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,610
yet at every turn remind that I lack this trait or that.

509
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,030
You take information given to aid

510
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,700
and move against Tullius,

511
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,990
absent regard of the difficult position it places me.

512
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,540
You talk of nothing.

513
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,620
Every tongue that is not your own is accused of the same.

514
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:03,580
It has taken years and the price of blood,

515
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,450
but I at last see you for what you are.

516
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,820
A man that holds no one in esteem beyond himself.

517
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,950
I owe you gratitude.

518
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,190
Without you to show the way,

519
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,870
I would never have raised nerve to betray

520
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,680
those closest to me.

521
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,690
What excuse does Solonius give?

522
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,420
None that merit consideration.

523
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,450
What has the crowd in such a state?

524
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,430
Sextus announces executions before the games begin.

525
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,980
Is that not one of yours, Batiatus?

526
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:12,220
The girl on the end, what was her name...

527
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,260
Diona.

528
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,740
Diona, yes.

529
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,400
Apologies, Batiatus.

530
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,880
The girl was only rounded up this morning.

531
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:33,330
If you wish her removed to be dealt with personally...

532
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,840
No.

533
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,640
Let her death stand as warning

534
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:41,400
to all others who would seek to betray me.

535
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,970
Caburus is your man now, Solonius.

536
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,460
Rise, and see him to purpose.

537
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,370
As you wish.

538
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:35,730
A pity, to lose one so fetching.

539
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,430
Soon you join. Cunt.

540
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,550
Doctore.

541
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:46,280
I can fight.

542
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,410
Have word with dominus

543
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,560
I already have.

544
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:55,190
Aid your brothers in preparing for the day.

545
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,980
You will fight again when you are able.

546
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:00,060
Yes, Doctore.

547
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,210
You will face Tasgetius and Synetos.

548
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,850
In the match before the primus.

549
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,500
Our days have been filled.

550
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:19,200
Show all of Capua why you are considered such a prize.

551
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,480
Fight.

552
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,540
And honor the House of Batiatus.

553
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:25,510
There are many things I would die for.

554
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,920
Many things I deserve to die for.

555
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:31,250
This house is no longer among them.

556
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,860
Then fight for her.

557
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:39,490
Every life you take. The blood you shed.

558
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,560
She will see it from the afterlife.

559
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,600
Then I shall fill her eyes.

560
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,480
Crixus!

561
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,370
You are first.

562
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,980
Ready!

563
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,290
The sands have been moistened

564
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,340
with our first offerings of blood!

565
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:21,030
But more is demanded on such a day.

566
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,570
And you shall have it!

567
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,200
The houses of Solonius and Batiatus

568
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:33,040
will battle each other in deadly contest.

569
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,810
No mercy shown!

570
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,260
No quarter given!

571
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:41,920
The victors all to face each in the primus!

572
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,090
You will school that little shit

573
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,160
in the ways of a true lanista.

574
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,160
A lesson to be remembered.

575
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,560
It shall be a spectacle the likes of which

576
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:01,120
the gods themselves have never witnessed!

577
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,970
Glory to Capua!

578
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,200
Glory to Rome!

579
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,530
Yes!

580
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:19,570
Yes!

581
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:24,240
Once more Gannicus proves himself a god of the arena!

582
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:28,550
Were that Tullius present to witness such triumph!

583
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,640
Yet I fear the numbers stand against you in the primus.

584
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:34,170
Solonius holds twice your men.

585
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,590
Numbers are meaningless.

586
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,700
A lesson good Solonius is about to discover.

587
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,660
You shall stand above all others

588
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:01,830
eclipsed only by the gods themselves!

589
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,540
So at last meet upon the sands.

590
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:07,240
Two among many.

591
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,340
I give no shit about other men.

592
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:10,570
I shall prove myself against you

593
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,260
in proper contest.

594
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:14,530
We face Solonius' men, not each other.

595
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,800
Only until they have fallen.

596
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:18,220
Then we shall stand alone,

597
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:19,800
absent thought of brotherhood.

598
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:21,920
Attend.

599
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:24,530
Your Dominus would have words.

600
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:31,860
Everything we have dreamed of.

601
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:35,280
Suffered and died for.

602
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:38,660
The worth of it all turns upon this single moment.

603
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,950
You face the House of Solonius,

604
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,040
and his ill gotten men.

605
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:45,160
You stand outnumbered.

606
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:47,830
But not outmatched.

607
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,410
Only one man will claim victory this day

608
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,200
and earn the title Champion of Capua.

609
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:55,370
And by the gods that man will be

610
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,060
from the fucking House of Batiatus!

611
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,180
Gladiators!

612
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:39,610
Form!

613
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:59,490
Many have fought this day.

614
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,700
Many have died, their blood staining the sands.

615
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:08,410
Yet this arena towers above all others in the Republic.

616
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:11,170
It is a vast beast.

617
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,480
And it yet hungers!

618
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:18,980
Two great houses face each other.

619
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:21,050
Yet every man must ultimately stand

620
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:24,790
for himself and himself alone.

621
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:39,550
What are they doing?

622
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,980
It matters not.

623
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,690
Fire burns within their breasts.

624
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,790
And it is fire that shall bind them in final contest!

625
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:09,080
Fall to the sands beyond the flames,

626
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:12,580
and find yourself removed from the primus.

627
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:16,990
Fall within them, and be removed from this world.

628
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,180
Take position!

629
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:43,990
Do not die before we meet.

630
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,550
Split heaven with the sound of your fury!

631
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,890
Begin!

632
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,550
First blood to Solonius!

633
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:05,370
It is a pity you did not land

634
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:07,990
more men in the primus, Solonius.

635
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,400
I fear you may be eliminated prematurely.

636
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,950
You crazy fuck.

637
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:29,280
Batiatus' men think so little of his house,

638
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:31,510
they seek to kill each other.

639
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:02,100
Who stands now?

640
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:49,180
Capua!

641
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:53,150
Fuck!

642
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,040
Let us press advantage, brother!

643
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,240
Kill Gannicus!

644
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:26,990
Then decide who is champion between us!

645
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,320
No!

646
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:37,170
Your men again set upon each other

647
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,860
before common foe is defeated.

648
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:41,750
To be expected, when animals are not properly trained.

649
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,410
Gannicus is mine!

650
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:22,160
It appears odds have shifted.

651
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:46,650
The odds return to balance.

652
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:22,540
The House of Batiatus stands fucking triumphant!

653
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:24,900
Apologies.

654
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,950
None required.

655
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,990
A most impressive showing.

656
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,790
I do but honor this city.

657
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,290
And my champion continues to do the same.

658
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,830
I have mind towards your man for my own games.

659
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,500
As do I.

660
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:40,170
Listen how he ignites the crowd.

661
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:47,200
Gannicus!

662
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:54,710
Would they not forever remember this day,

663
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,600
and the men responsible for it...

664
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:59,680
if Gannicus were granted freedom?

665
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:01,990
Freedom?

666
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,160
I would have granted the same in deference to the crowd.

667
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:05,160
Had my man survived.

668
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:07,860
An excellent suggestion.

669
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:09,560
You can always train another gladiator.

670
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:12,250
Yet to conclude the opening ceremonies

671
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,420
with such a blessing...

672
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:18,040
As I said. I but honor this city.

673
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,330
Gannicus has proven himself to the city of Capua!

674
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:38,030
Let him be rewarded...

675
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:40,650
with freedom!

676
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:48,040
Gannicus!

677
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:05,860
Gannicus!

678
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:19,280
After all we have suffered.

679
01:00:19,290 --> 01:00:21,260
Gannicus is still lost to us.

680
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:23,450
I offered the man coin,

681
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:25,020
freedom to come and go as he pleases,

682
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:26,510
if he would yet fight for our house.

683
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,100
Memories haunt the man.

684
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:34,140
Drive him from our walls.

685
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:38,810
Crixus afforded himself well in the games.

686
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:42,590
Let us turn our hope towards him,

687
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:46,280
that he may bring us honor and good fortune.

688
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:53,270
Yes.

689
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,900
Let us place stock in the Gaul.

690
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:58,420
And see what ends he may service.

691
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:00,610
Real proud of you brother.

692
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:07,840
I shall join you one day, you mad fuck.

693
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:10,810
Of that there is no doubt.

694
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,680
We have not yet had proper contest.

695
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:29,940
Win your own freedom, and seek me out.

696
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:38,590
Crixus.

697
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:44,210
I was given this when I became champion of this house.

698
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:53,550
Wear it with more honor than I have.

699
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,340
You have earned the rudis.

700
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:30,520
Proof you no longer stand a slave.

701
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:41,370
A lifetime of blood.

702
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:43,120
And victory.

703
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:44,530
It lifts troubled heart,

704
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:46,720
to see my brother gain his freedom.

705
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,540
Melitta would have been proud.

706
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:57,330
Oenomaus...

707
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,420
She loved you.

708
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:09,240
Above all others.

709
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:14,670
The thought shall keep me warm.

710
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:17,550
Until I join her in the afterlife.

711
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,750
I shall meet you both there.

712
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:29,180
Doctore.

713
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,500
Begin the day's training.

714
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:44,730
First position!

715
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,720
I would not hear the name Gannicus spoken within these walls.

716
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:59,810
Nor that of Tullius or his cock eating apprentice.

717
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:02,500
These things are of the past.

718
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,920
Let us look towards brighter future.

719
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:11,310
My eyes are firmly fixed.

720
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:20,330
We will see this house elevated.

721
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:21,930
Beyond my father.

722
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:23,000
Beyond Solonius.

723
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:25,850
Beyond the fucking gods themselves.

724
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:29,100
We will leave our mark upon this city.

725
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:31,690
And one day,

726
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:35,080
see proper reward for all we have done.

727
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:41,010
I have done this thing because it is just!

728
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:44,660
Blood demands blood.

729
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,820
We have lived and lost

730
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:51,190
at the whims of our masters for too long.

731
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,720
I would not have it so.

732
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:58,250
Your lives are your own.

733
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,750
Forge your own path...

734
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:03,670
or join with us,

735
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:07,280
and together we shall see Rome tremble!

736
01:06:12,280 --> 01:08:07,280

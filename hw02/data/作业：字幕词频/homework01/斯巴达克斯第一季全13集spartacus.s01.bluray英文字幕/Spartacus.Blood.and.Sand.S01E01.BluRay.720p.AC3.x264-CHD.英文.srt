1
00:01:24,316 --> 00:01:25,783
Uh! Uh!

2
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:36,126
Raaarrhh!

3
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:46,704
Come on!

4
00:01:46,704 --> 00:01:47,738
Uh!

5
00:01:51,576 --> 00:01:52,977
Yeah!

6
00:01:54,779 --> 00:01:55,529
Uh!

7
00:01:58,049 --> 00:01:58,983
Rrrrah!

8
00:02:31,149 --> 00:02:33,117
Oh what do you know about it?

9
00:02:33,117 --> 00:02:34,284
Just fucking go!

10
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:38,188
Hold your fucking tongues!

11
00:02:38,188 --> 00:02:39,957
Let the roman have his say!

12
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:44,728
Thrace and the Republic

13
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:47,031
have known their differences.

14
00:02:47,031 --> 00:02:50,467
We've not always been as brothers.

15
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:53,303
But let us put aside such matters,

16
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:55,506
uniting in just cause.

17
00:02:55,506 --> 00:02:57,775
<i>You pushed your way into our land,</i>

18
00:02:57,775 --> 00:03:01,278
and now you stand asking for our help.

19
00:03:01,278 --> 00:03:04,114
Your hand extended?

20
00:03:04,114 --> 00:03:09,553
I extend no hand.
I am here merely to inform.

21
00:03:09,553 --> 00:03:11,188
Mithridates and his greeks

22
00:03:11,188 --> 00:03:12,256
attack from the east...

23
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,191
Encroaching from the black sea.

24
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:16,960
Far removed from our villages.

25
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,097
True. But the getae

26
00:03:20,097 --> 00:03:23,000
take advantage of the distraction.

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,270
Their barbarian hordes
amass to the north.

28
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,139
Barely half a week's
march from your villages.

29
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:30,841
How many?

30
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:32,276
Thousands.

31
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:37,848
Align yourselves with Rome!

32
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:39,950
Pledge your service to the auxiliary

33
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,486
and join us in our campaign!

34
00:03:42,486 --> 00:03:43,987
To what end?

35
00:03:43,987 --> 00:03:45,889
To what end?!

36
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:50,861
Victory.

37
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:53,497
And how is it to be measured?

38
00:03:53,497 --> 00:03:56,366
The getae have raided our
villages in the past.

39
00:03:56,366 --> 00:04:00,137
Raped our women. Killed our children.

40
00:04:00,137 --> 00:04:02,272
Each time have pushed them back.

41
00:04:02,272 --> 00:04:03,907
Only to see them return.

42
00:04:03,907 --> 00:04:05,709
He speaks out of turn.

43
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:08,312
Yet the truth falls from his mouth.

44
00:04:08,312 --> 00:04:11,482
If we are to align with Rome,

45
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:13,383
the purpose must be clear.

46
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:18,722
The getae dead.

47
00:04:18,722 --> 00:04:20,023
All of them.

48
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:27,865
Dead. All of them.

49
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,019
The council has decided?

50
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:52,823
We go to war.

51
00:04:52,823 --> 00:04:55,125
I've asked the gods to bless your sword.

52
00:04:59,597 --> 00:05:01,165
Once the getae are wiped from our lands,

53
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:03,200
there'll be no reason to
ever pick it up again.

54
00:05:05,303 --> 00:05:07,604
And what would my husband
do without it in his hands?

55
00:05:10,074 --> 00:05:12,342
Grow crops. Raise goats.

56
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,146
Make children...

57
00:05:24,222 --> 00:05:25,956
You'd fight no more?

58
00:05:25,956 --> 00:05:29,326
Forever. To be by your side.

59
00:05:38,436 --> 00:05:40,804
How soon do you march?

60
00:05:40,804 --> 00:05:41,905
First light.

61
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:49,513
Then come to bed.

62
00:05:49,513 --> 00:05:51,582
If one night is all we have left...

63
00:05:51,582 --> 00:05:53,350
I should make the most of it.

64
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:32,422
Be strong my wife.

65
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:42,065
I woke expecting my wife beside me.

66
00:06:43,635 --> 00:06:45,035
She rose early to pray.

67
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:49,606
That her husband would stay with her.

68
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:53,176
I thought were in agreement.

69
00:06:53,176 --> 00:06:54,578
We were. Were?

70
00:06:57,715 --> 00:07:00,017
The gods came to me last night.

71
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:01,752
In my sleep.

72
00:07:01,752 --> 00:07:03,387
What did they show you?

73
00:07:03,387 --> 00:07:06,089
My husband on his knees,

74
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:09,293
bowing before a great red serpent.

75
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:13,196
The life draining from his veins.

76
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:15,165
What meaning did you take from it?

77
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:17,167
A warning.

78
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:19,369
If you go to war,

79
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:22,205
you are destined for great
and unfortunate things.

80
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:29,980
The getae worship the mountain wolf.

81
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,581
They place no faith in snakes.

82
00:07:33,985 --> 00:07:36,186
It was just a dream.

83
00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:37,321
And if it isn't?

84
00:07:37,321 --> 00:07:39,923
I gave my word, Sura.

85
00:07:39,923 --> 00:07:43,160
Blood and honor.

86
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,494
It speaks to the man.

87
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:50,834
Nothing will keep me from
returning to your arms.

88
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:54,471
Not the getae. Not the romans.

89
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:56,306
Not the gods themselves.

90
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:02,379
The nights grow so cold.

91
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:04,781
What am I to do without you in our bed?

92
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:10,187
Lift your dress.

93
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:29,973
Keep me close to your thighs,

94
00:08:29,973 --> 00:08:31,641
the thought will warm us both.

95
00:08:50,995 --> 00:08:53,897
Kill them all.

96
00:08:53,897 --> 00:08:55,031
For you.

97
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,541
Charge!

98
00:09:43,514 --> 00:09:44,714
Rahhh!

99
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:50,353
Urgh!

100
00:09:54,592 --> 00:09:56,359
Hold the line!

101
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:02,032
Raaa! Urgh!

102
00:10:02,032 --> 00:10:04,167
I'll fuck your women!

103
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:06,770
I'll fuck them all!

104
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,071
Ahhh!

105
00:10:11,642 --> 00:10:13,710
Where the fuck are the romans?

106
00:10:19,484 --> 00:10:21,618
Show the cunts no mercy.

107
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:23,220
Uhh!

108
00:10:26,357 --> 00:10:27,858
Yaaah!!

109
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:46,810
Ahhh!

110
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,419
Raaa!

111
00:11:07,932 --> 00:11:10,867
Romans! Forward!

112
00:11:16,707 --> 00:11:18,041
<i>Where are you going?</i>

113
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:22,546
Little late.

114
00:11:22,546 --> 00:11:24,347
They'd just get in the way.

115
00:12:03,154 --> 00:12:04,955
My own shit would taste better!

116
00:12:04,955 --> 00:12:07,257
I cook what they give us, Drenis.

117
00:12:07,257 --> 00:12:08,858
Guts and bones!

118
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:11,795
While Glaber and his
romans feast on meat.

119
00:12:11,795 --> 00:12:14,998
We're the last to eat,
the last to share the spoils.

120
00:12:14,998 --> 00:12:18,868
But always first to be sent
against those barbarian cunts!

121
00:12:20,338 --> 00:12:23,640
Maybe Legatus fucking Glaber
rolls out of his nice warm tent

122
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,042
and finds his thracian
dog have returned to the wild.

123
00:12:27,144 --> 00:12:28,211
Uh hum.

124
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:31,748
Something to add, little man?

125
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,484
A word.

126
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:36,286
Which word might that be?

127
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:37,921
The one I gave the romans.

128
00:12:37,921 --> 00:12:40,423
And my body and blood with it.

129
00:12:40,423 --> 00:12:42,525
We all did, to push the getae back.

130
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:44,227
We can defend our own lands!

131
00:12:44,227 --> 00:12:47,163
We gave our word.

132
00:12:47,163 --> 00:12:50,867
In my village such a thing
still bears meaning.

133
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:52,636
Your village.

134
00:12:52,636 --> 00:12:56,539
Is that why you're here?
To defend your village?

135
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:58,408
Or maybe you're trying to
impress that sweet taste

136
00:12:58,408 --> 00:13:00,977
you're always going on about,
with stories of war.

137
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:11,921
Struck the mark near, did I?

138
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:16,159
Words and honor, my great fat ass!

139
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,728
All comes back 'round to a pair of tits

140
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:20,797
and a tight little hole.

141
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:50,727
<i>The Legatus is here.</i>

142
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:56,199
The Legatus needs volunteers

143
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:59,436
to scout beyond the forward line.

144
00:13:59,436 --> 00:14:02,806
You. Tactical report by sunrise.

145
00:14:02,806 --> 00:14:05,241
Or go without rations.

146
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:09,279
"Please" would have done.

147
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,648
We'll finish this discussion later.

148
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:26,096
And if we're dead?

149
00:14:26,096 --> 00:14:30,033
Then my boot will find
your ass in the afterlife.

150
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:02,448
Ilithyia.

151
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:04,684
What if I'd been an assassin?

152
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:05,785
I'd be a widow.

153
00:15:07,054 --> 00:15:08,654
What's the respectful period of mourning

154
00:15:08,654 --> 00:15:10,056
before I could remarry?

155
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:12,959
You overstep.

156
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,727
Women are forbidden
within the encampment.

157
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:15,828
I was discreet.

158
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:16,996
Not you?

159
00:15:16,996 --> 00:15:20,166
Your man helped whisk me
through the sentries.

160
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:23,169
After I threatened to run
naked through the camp,

161
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:24,737
screaming he laid his hands

162
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:26,305
on the wife of the Legatus.

163
00:15:33,347 --> 00:15:35,681
Does your father know you're in Thrace?

164
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:38,084
Please. He's too busy colluding

165
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:40,820
with the other corpses in the senate.

166
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,890
He thinks I'm still lounging
at the villa in Capua.

167
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,525
Far too arid.

168
00:15:45,525 --> 00:15:47,560
Hasn't rained there since last forever.

169
00:15:49,096 --> 00:15:50,796
You should have written.

170
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:53,633
You would have told me not to come.

171
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:55,635
I'm in the middle of a war.

172
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:56,969
I brought you a gift.

173
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,209
Something to remind you of Rome.

174
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:05,178
Sestii wine!

175
00:16:05,178 --> 00:16:07,079
Let me fill up your cup

176
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,449
while you tell me about your little war.

177
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:13,352
Too brief a tale.

178
00:16:13,352 --> 00:16:15,988
Mithridates and his army of greek whores

179
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:19,659
press the legion in the
east by the black sea.

180
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:22,695
Here I sit. Protecting
the northern border...

181
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:24,397
Of the land of piss and shit

182
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:26,532
from simple barbarian raiders.

183
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:31,237
Mithridates. Victory against him

184
00:16:31,237 --> 00:16:33,739
would have your name on
every roman's tongue.

185
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:36,676
Cotta leads the assault.

186
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:38,544
He steals your laurels.

187
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:40,513
He's the consul. Theft is his privilege.

188
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:44,884
Father will be disappointed.

189
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:48,087
He secured this
position for you to shine.

190
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:50,489
And here you sit. Eclipsed.

191
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:52,525
I'm doing what I can.

192
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,465
Of course you are. I just

193
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:01,467
wish you were back home.

194
00:17:02,703 --> 00:17:04,704
Father's planning a full day

195
00:17:04,704 --> 00:17:07,406
of spectacles and gladiators!

196
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:09,742
It's the talk of Capua.

197
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:11,644
I hadn't realized
elections were nearing.

198
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:15,214
Never too early to campaign.

199
00:17:15,214 --> 00:17:17,883
If things were heading better,

200
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:20,987
you could be by his side.

201
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:21,737
If.

202
00:17:23,957 --> 00:17:27,226
So serious! Bad for the humors.

203
00:17:35,535 --> 00:17:39,639
Come. You haven't tasted your gift yet.

204
00:18:37,664 --> 00:18:38,864
They're breaking camp.

205
00:18:38,864 --> 00:18:40,299
Frightened little gashes,

206
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:44,170
running away with their
cocks between their cheeks.

207
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,171
Retreat would take them beyond

208
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:47,206
the mountains to the north.

209
00:18:47,206 --> 00:18:49,041
Their tores bear west.

210
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,643
West?

211
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:52,878
They're swinging around to attack
the villages below the pass.

212
00:18:55,148 --> 00:18:57,383
Our villages.

213
00:18:57,383 --> 00:18:59,185
Slippery little cunts.

214
00:19:01,288 --> 00:19:02,822
They break for the mountain pass here.

215
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:04,790
It will take them four days at most,

216
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,359
to reach the villages below.

217
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:10,830
Food. Supplies.
Women... all unprotected.

218
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,969
It's a simple thing to be turned
in the mountains at night.

219
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:19,572
Perhaps I should send a roman

220
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:21,607
to properly assess the situation.

221
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:24,176
Send the gods themselves.
They'll report the same.

222
00:19:27,381 --> 00:19:28,881
Dismissed.

223
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:30,716
If we march by midday we can easily...

224
00:19:30,716 --> 00:19:33,052
Dismissed!

225
00:19:50,637 --> 00:19:52,071
The barbarians head west.

226
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:53,506
So it appears.

227
00:19:53,506 --> 00:19:56,742
Further yet from
Mithridates and the greeks.

228
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:58,244
And the glory you deserve.

229
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:03,816
Return to Capua.

230
00:20:06,753 --> 00:20:09,388
And my father?

231
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:12,558
How will he measure the man he
so blessed with his daughter?

232
00:20:16,997 --> 00:20:22,168
A colossus, towering above
the enemies of Rome.

233
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:30,543
Pompous, arrogant, roman boy-lover!

234
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:32,011
All but called us liars.

235
00:20:32,011 --> 00:20:33,012
How are you certain?

236
00:20:33,012 --> 00:20:34,713
You heard at he said.

237
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:36,115
"Turned in the mountains at night!"

238
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:37,616
Like he's speaking to children!

239
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:40,119
No, no about the boys.
How do you know he favors them?

240
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,520
Now who's having a laugh?

241
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,156
Well there is this tickle
at the back of my throat.

242
00:20:44,156 --> 00:20:46,826
That would be the cock
Glaber just forced down it.

243
00:20:46,826 --> 00:20:48,627
If he wants to send his own men let him.

244
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:50,162
Won't change the direction of the getae.

245
00:20:50,162 --> 00:20:53,732
Glaber is the most
dangerous kind of fool.

246
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:55,100
One with a title.

247
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,703
Truth. But perhaps he has better sense

248
00:20:57,703 --> 00:21:00,806
when it comes to wine.

249
00:21:00,806 --> 00:21:02,041
You stole his wine?!

250
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:05,211
Only borrowed it.
Plan to piss it all back shortly.

251
00:21:31,872 --> 00:21:32,838
Up.

252
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:34,373
Uh. Fuck your mother.

253
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:35,708
The romans sound the call.

254
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,177
Fuck the romans.
And their fucking horns.

255
00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:41,080
Up Drenis, you drunken goat.

256
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,315
The Legatus has gained his senses.

257
00:21:43,315 --> 00:21:46,719
Is there any wine left?

258
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:48,053
Your belly holds the sum.

259
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:50,022
It may return the balance presently.

260
00:21:51,024 --> 00:21:53,259
How far to the mouth of the pass?

261
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:54,994
Three days by foot,

262
00:21:54,994 --> 00:21:57,263
if we march with meaning.

263
00:21:57,263 --> 00:21:59,265
A drink would spur my intent.

264
00:22:01,434 --> 00:22:03,602
My village is only a ways further west.

265
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:05,337
My wine is yours after we...

266
00:22:05,337 --> 00:22:06,639
<i>West?</i>

267
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:11,544
We march east, to challenge Mithridates.

268
00:22:11,544 --> 00:22:13,512
Did the Legatus send his
own men to scout the front?

269
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:15,548
How the fuck should I know?

270
00:22:15,548 --> 00:22:18,017
They blow their fucking horns,
a roman dog barks

271
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:20,085
and the gods shit on me.

272
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:22,087
Welcome to the fucking auxiliary.

273
00:22:36,736 --> 00:22:38,938
A word, Legatus?

274
00:22:38,938 --> 00:22:42,675
Move to formation. Advance east.

275
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:45,844
Surely you mean west,
as the getae advance.

276
00:22:45,844 --> 00:22:50,282
Mithridates and the greeks
are of pressing concern.

277
00:22:50,282 --> 00:22:53,319
You have aligned yourself with Rome.

278
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:56,789
I am its body and voice.

279
00:22:56,789 --> 00:23:00,259
We march east to the black sea.

280
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:01,760
Fall to formation.

281
00:23:05,765 --> 00:23:07,399
Fall to formation.

282
00:23:11,137 --> 00:23:12,438
No.

283
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,710
You would defy an
order from your Legatus?

284
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,046
I gave my word to
defend against the getae.

285
00:23:21,046 --> 00:23:24,817
Not to march east to attack Mithridates.

286
00:23:24,817 --> 00:23:27,152
You will march where you are commanded!

287
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:34,059
Urgh!

288
00:23:36,563 --> 00:23:38,364
Kill them!

289
00:23:39,466 --> 00:23:40,633
Urrr! Wait, wait!

290
00:23:55,915 --> 00:23:57,182
Urgghh!

291
00:24:01,721 --> 00:24:03,255
Haaa!

292
00:24:03,255 --> 00:24:04,957
Throw, damn you.

293
00:24:10,997 --> 00:24:11,997
Yah!

294
00:24:21,808 --> 00:24:23,976
What have you done, you stupid shit?!

295
00:24:23,976 --> 00:24:26,645
He did what he had to!

296
00:24:26,645 --> 00:24:28,147
Break and go your way!

297
00:24:28,147 --> 00:24:29,715
West if your lives are there.

298
00:24:29,715 --> 00:24:32,418
If not, I could give a fuck.

299
00:24:32,418 --> 00:24:33,786
Ohh!

300
00:24:34,854 --> 00:24:36,155
What of the Legatus?

301
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:43,128
Leave him in the mud.

302
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:43,968
Um! Go.

303
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,280
No! Ah!

304
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,567
Urghhh!

305
00:26:20,593 --> 00:26:21,794
Yah!

306
00:26:38,211 --> 00:26:40,045
Urgh!

307
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:41,780
Rrrraa!

308
00:26:46,786 --> 00:26:47,536
Uh!

309
00:26:51,724 --> 00:26:53,592
Oh god, oh my god.

310
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:07,673
The village...

311
00:27:18,484 --> 00:27:21,887
We have to go. Now.

312
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:44,843
They haven't followed.

313
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:07,065
You were right. I never should've left.

314
00:28:10,136 --> 00:28:12,437
You had given your word.

315
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:14,640
The fault lies with the
romans in breaking theirs.

316
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,246
You're hurt.

317
00:28:21,246 --> 00:28:22,748
It's nothing. Let me see.

318
00:28:22,748 --> 00:28:25,284
Sura. Let me see.

319
00:28:27,954 --> 00:28:29,388
Your tone is disquieting.

320
00:28:29,388 --> 00:28:30,389
You should be used to it by now.

321
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:41,099
I'm all right.

322
00:28:43,703 --> 00:28:46,171
Of course you are. Hold still...

323
00:29:01,454 --> 00:29:02,621
It's gone, isn't it?

324
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:07,225
The village.

325
00:29:07,225 --> 00:29:08,293
Everyone we knew.

326
00:29:11,397 --> 00:29:12,798
We'll move south.

327
00:29:15,301 --> 00:29:18,704
I had people there once.

328
00:29:18,704 --> 00:29:21,006
The getae won't venture that far.

329
00:29:21,006 --> 00:29:22,507
Not to the risk of
thinning their numbers.

330
00:29:27,914 --> 00:29:28,914
And the romans?

331
00:29:31,684 --> 00:29:34,853
Their concern rests
Mithridates to the east.

332
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:41,126
South it is.

333
00:29:46,866 --> 00:29:49,067
I wish I had been a thousand men.

334
00:30:03,816 --> 00:30:07,019
You did what you could.

335
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:10,188
You came back. For me.

336
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:14,092
Knowing it could mean your life.

337
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:26,238
There is no life without you.

338
00:32:40,907 --> 00:32:43,909
My tribune dead.
Half the auxiliary deserted.

339
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:46,811
Now orders recalling me to Rome.

340
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:48,613
All from your hand.

341
00:32:48,613 --> 00:32:51,783
I own my actions. But my wife...

342
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:53,652
Has been condemned to slavery,

343
00:32:53,652 --> 00:32:56,087
courtesy of her husband.

344
00:32:56,087 --> 00:32:57,407
No! No! No!

345
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,462
The shadow of Rome is vast.

346
00:33:04,462 --> 00:33:06,431
And you, thracian,

347
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:08,266
will die under it.

348
00:33:33,626 --> 00:33:35,994
Good of you to join us.

349
00:33:35,994 --> 00:33:38,530
Thought you were dead there for a while.

350
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,766
He smells dead. Stupid fuck.

351
00:33:43,703 --> 00:33:46,771
Argh! Ahh! Easy, easy.

352
00:33:46,771 --> 00:33:48,306
You've been out for days.

353
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:55,113
We're at sea?

354
00:33:55,113 --> 00:33:57,582
Upon the adriatic.

355
00:33:57,582 --> 00:34:00,452
Bound for Capua.

356
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:01,292
Sura...

357
00:34:02,788 --> 00:34:05,257
Your woman?

358
00:34:05,257 --> 00:34:06,458
The romans took her.

359
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:13,198
Best to forget her then.

360
00:34:49,302 --> 00:34:53,538
What if I'd been an assassin?

361
00:34:53,538 --> 00:34:56,341
Father's in town. He'll be back shortly.

362
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:58,076
How shortly?

363
00:34:58,076 --> 00:35:01,680
He's not very happy with you.

364
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,815
And his daughter?

365
00:35:03,815 --> 00:35:07,385
She missed her husband.

366
00:35:07,385 --> 00:35:10,722
But fears his reappearance
has come too soon.

367
00:35:15,194 --> 00:35:18,129
The games your father
presents the people of Capua.

368
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:19,898
They begin tomorrow.

369
00:35:19,898 --> 00:35:20,965
The feast is tonight?

370
00:35:20,965 --> 00:35:24,035
That's to his purpose in town.

371
00:35:24,035 --> 00:35:26,638
I would have a word with him.

372
00:35:26,638 --> 00:35:31,576
It will take more than
one to regain his favor.

373
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:33,111
The senate chamber is full of whispers

374
00:35:33,111 --> 00:35:37,415
over your...Early return.

375
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:43,688
Cheers of the crowd will
still their tongues.

376
00:35:43,688 --> 00:35:48,326
Cheers? How will you draw them,
short of victory?

377
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:52,530
By giving them
something few have ever seen:

378
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:56,601
Thracian blood, spilled in the arena.

379
00:35:56,601 --> 00:36:00,338
When the hearts of the crowd...

380
00:36:00,338 --> 00:36:03,708
And the senate will beg to follow.

381
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:04,876
<i>Get out of my sight!</i>

382
00:36:06,746 --> 00:36:08,813
<i>Inbred shit whores.</i>

383
00:36:08,813 --> 00:36:11,983
I should sale the lot of
you to the mines. Out!

384
00:36:11,983 --> 00:36:15,787
Father's returned. And in a fine state.

385
00:36:15,787 --> 00:36:17,989
If he refuses to aid my intentions...

386
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:20,825
He refuses his daughter nothing,

387
00:36:20,825 --> 00:36:23,161
when pleaded with teary eye.

388
00:36:48,788 --> 00:36:53,024
Good citizens of Capua! Revered guests!

389
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:55,693
A debt of gratitude for
partaking in this celebration...

390
00:36:55,693 --> 00:36:58,196
Of the family name of Albinius.

391
00:36:58,196 --> 00:37:00,965
Albinius! Albinius!

392
00:37:03,436 --> 00:37:06,871
Your attendance honors
the memory of my elders,

393
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:09,808
gone too soon from the
realm of the living...

394
00:37:09,808 --> 00:37:13,545
And the joy of a daughter,
yet so full of life.

395
00:37:15,548 --> 00:37:19,284
I repay your kindness
with gifts of water!

396
00:37:19,284 --> 00:37:20,652
Carried from Rome

397
00:37:20,652 --> 00:37:23,955
where the gods have seen fit
to keep the drought at bay!

398
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:28,259
And gifts of blood,
to be spilled in the arena!

399
00:37:32,932 --> 00:37:34,933
Quintus Lentulus Batiatus!

400
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:37,135
Step forward.

401
00:37:47,513 --> 00:37:49,147
Present your gladiators.

402
00:37:52,585 --> 00:37:54,419
In honor of senator Albinius

403
00:37:54,419 --> 00:37:58,690
and the people of
Capua, I give you Barca!

404
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,757
The Beast of Carthage!

405
00:38:04,129 --> 00:38:08,333
Yet his ferocity pales against
the titan of the arena!

406
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:11,069
The god of blood and sand!

407
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:14,439
Crixus! The Undefeated Gaul!

408
00:38:19,545 --> 00:38:22,146
Gratitude to Batiatus!

409
00:38:31,524 --> 00:38:36,227
<i>And now to Marcus Decius Solonius,</i>

410
00:38:36,227 --> 00:38:37,495
<i>and his offerings!</i>

411
00:38:44,703 --> 00:38:46,437
In honor of senator Albinius

412
00:38:46,437 --> 00:38:48,573
and the people of Capua.

413
00:38:48,573 --> 00:38:50,542
I give you six of my finest men!

414
00:38:51,777 --> 00:38:55,413
<i>Behold Arkadios! Scourge of athens!</i>

415
00:38:58,817 --> 00:39:01,219
Preening shit eater.

416
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:03,421
A mockery to the profession.

417
00:39:03,421 --> 00:39:04,422
A mockery is it?

418
00:39:04,422 --> 00:39:05,657
Oh, you disagree?

419
00:39:05,657 --> 00:39:08,393
Let it pass.

420
00:39:08,393 --> 00:39:10,762
We're guests of the senator.

421
00:39:10,762 --> 00:39:13,464
He's invited us to sit
in the pulvinus tomorrow.

422
00:39:13,464 --> 00:39:15,533
As consolation!

423
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:16,668
Only two of my men have been retained

424
00:39:16,668 --> 00:39:17,835
to fight in tomorrow's games!

425
00:39:17,835 --> 00:39:18,937
While Solonius secures half a dozen

426
00:39:18,937 --> 00:39:21,439
of his ill-trained simians.

427
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:27,312
That man has fingers in
all the proper assholes.

428
00:39:27,312 --> 00:39:29,447
He wiggles them and everyone shits gold.

429
00:39:32,384 --> 00:39:33,384
Gratitude to Solonius!

430
00:39:37,189 --> 00:39:39,691
But water and games are
distant praise, for the city

431
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:43,494
that has held the
name Albinius as its own.

432
00:39:43,494 --> 00:39:45,463
More is deserved!

433
00:39:45,463 --> 00:39:46,965
And the gods have seen fit

434
00:39:46,965 --> 00:39:50,735
to deliver it in the form
of my daughter's husband,

435
00:39:50,735 --> 00:39:52,870
Legatus Claudius Glaber.

436
00:39:54,273 --> 00:39:57,075
Newly returned from the
savage lands of Thrace!

437
00:40:14,593 --> 00:40:18,830
More gifts for the people of Capua!

438
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:22,467
Six thracian jackals!

439
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:27,205
Deserters from the war
against the barbaric getae!

440
00:40:27,205 --> 00:40:32,410
To be executed ad gladium
in tomorrow's games!

441
00:40:35,781 --> 00:40:36,948
Well? Um!

442
00:40:45,891 --> 00:40:48,626
He is well received.

443
00:40:48,626 --> 00:40:49,894
Ask favor for him again,

444
00:40:49,894 --> 00:40:53,665
and your tears
will fall short of notice.

445
00:40:53,665 --> 00:40:58,069
Right now to more music and drink! Um!

446
00:41:10,382 --> 00:41:12,917
Thracians. Between those animals

447
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:15,086
and Solonius' inferior offerings.

448
00:41:15,086 --> 00:41:16,454
A mockery, on all accounting.

449
00:41:16,454 --> 00:41:17,755
Glaber mentions execution.

450
00:41:17,755 --> 00:41:20,058
Perhaps a word could
lend our men to the task.

451
00:41:20,058 --> 00:41:22,060
The position has been occupied.

452
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:26,030
Good Solonius! I was just
marveling at your wares!

453
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,965
Oh and I at yours...

454
00:41:27,965 --> 00:41:30,168
Oh you flatter.

455
00:41:30,168 --> 00:41:32,704
No, I appreciate.

456
00:41:32,704 --> 00:41:34,472
Good to lay eyes, old friend.

457
00:41:34,472 --> 00:41:37,408
I feared for a time
you would be excluded.

458
00:41:37,408 --> 00:41:40,378
Games absent Batiatus?
! A dawn without the sun!

459
00:41:40,378 --> 00:41:44,415
Ah, Crixus and Barca. Two fine entries.

460
00:41:44,415 --> 00:41:46,250
They should provide distraction between

461
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,385
the more important bouts.

462
00:41:52,057 --> 00:41:53,991
The senator beckons.

463
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:55,993
If I miss you at the games
tomorrow, Lucretia...

464
00:41:55,993 --> 00:41:58,930
Well its unlikely. We've been
invited to sit in the pulvinus.

465
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:01,432
The pulvinus? With the senator?

466
00:42:01,432 --> 00:42:04,535
A great honor.

467
00:42:04,535 --> 00:42:05,770
I'll enjoy your company there.

468
00:42:09,608 --> 00:42:11,709
I shall witness his heart on a day.

469
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:14,278
Parted from his chest.

470
00:42:14,278 --> 00:42:15,613
And I shall grip the knife.

471
00:43:00,284 --> 00:43:02,451
I've never beheld such sights.

472
00:43:04,321 --> 00:43:06,222
Nor will you again.

473
00:45:34,304 --> 00:45:36,906
The crowd approves his gifts.

474
00:45:36,906 --> 00:45:38,674
As do we all.

475
00:45:38,674 --> 00:45:41,677
I've withheld something
of note for the last...

476
00:46:11,675 --> 00:46:12,675
Ready? Thracian cunt.

477
00:46:32,796 --> 00:46:33,996
Yaaaa!

478
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:47,676
The odds seem out of favor.

479
00:46:47,676 --> 00:46:50,179
This thracian caused Rome a
great disservice, father.

480
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:53,015
His cowardice led to mass desertion.

481
00:46:54,384 --> 00:46:56,318
Is his life not ample repayment?

482
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:00,222
He must be humiliated in example.

483
00:47:00,222 --> 00:47:01,857
Solonius was kind enough to offer

484
00:47:01,857 --> 00:47:04,126
his services in this act.

485
00:47:10,934 --> 00:47:12,701
Give the command.

486
00:47:38,028 --> 00:47:38,961
No!

487
00:47:50,307 --> 00:47:51,057
Ah!

488
00:47:57,581 --> 00:47:58,331
Uh!

489
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,705
Gladiator.

490
00:48:29,412 --> 00:48:31,113
A mockery.

491
00:48:31,113 --> 00:48:32,147
Be still.

492
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:48,230
<i>Kill them all...</i>

493
00:48:54,237 --> 00:48:55,487
Yaaa!

494
00:48:59,609 --> 00:49:00,859
Yaaa!

495
00:49:58,768 --> 00:50:00,018
<i>Kill.</i>

496
00:50:29,766 --> 00:50:32,568
<i>Live, live!</i>

497
00:50:52,055 --> 00:50:54,623
Well this presents some difficulty.

498
00:50:54,623 --> 00:50:56,859
The sentence of death holds.

499
00:50:56,859 --> 00:50:58,994
But to defy the wishes of the crowd,

500
00:50:58,994 --> 00:51:00,396
it's not wise.

501
00:51:00,396 --> 00:51:01,830
Even for a senator.

502
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:03,999
He gave me grievance,
I will not see him freed!

503
00:51:05,101 --> 00:51:06,969
A solution, perhaps.

504
00:51:06,969 --> 00:51:09,638
If you will entertain, Legatus?

505
00:51:09,638 --> 00:51:12,040
The thracian shown promise
in the arena albeit

506
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,344
against Solonius's inferior stock,

507
00:51:15,344 --> 00:51:17,746
I have a batch of new
recruits arriving tomorrow.

508
00:51:17,746 --> 00:51:20,349
If I were to purchase
this man in addition

509
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:23,385
to be trained at my ludus
in the gladiatorial arts,

510
00:51:23,385 --> 00:51:25,187
why in his condition,

511
00:51:25,187 --> 00:51:27,289
I doubt he'll survive
to the quarter moon.

512
00:51:29,025 --> 00:51:30,692
Live, live.

513
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:36,799
We will be merciful, hm?

514
00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:39,435
And by such, gain the favor you seek.

515
00:51:42,372 --> 00:51:44,973
What name does the man carry.

516
00:51:44,973 --> 00:51:47,075
I never cared to ask.

517
00:51:48,812 --> 00:51:50,879
The way he fights,

518
00:51:50,879 --> 00:51:53,682
like the legend of the
thracian king of old.

519
00:51:58,154 --> 00:52:00,155
Spartacus he was called.

520
00:52:11,434 --> 00:52:12,868
People of Capua!

521
00:52:14,471 --> 00:52:18,006
This man, this Spartacus,

522
00:52:18,006 --> 00:52:21,210
has proven himself in the arena

523
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:25,280
for this Legatus Claudius Glaber and I

524
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,683
grant him...

525
00:52:27,683 --> 00:52:28,817
Life.

526
00:52:35,692 --> 00:52:37,826
Spartacus!

527
00:52:39,262 --> 00:52:41,129
<i>Spartacus, Spartacus!</i>

528
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:49,037
<i>Spartacus, Spartacus!</i>

529
00:53:04,780 --> 00:54:29,670

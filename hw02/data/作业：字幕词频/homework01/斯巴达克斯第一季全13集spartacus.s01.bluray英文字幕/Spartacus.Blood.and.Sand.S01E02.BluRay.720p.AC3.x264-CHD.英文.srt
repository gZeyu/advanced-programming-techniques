1
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:44,282
Sura...

2
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,825
When the romans came...

3
00:00:55,962 --> 00:00:56,928
I thought I'd never see you.

4
00:00:56,928 --> 00:00:58,063
Shhh.

5
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,234
I will always be with you.

6
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:05,837
The gods themselves could
not keep me from your side.

7
00:01:05,837 --> 00:01:08,306
I would kill them all for trying.

8
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:14,223
Have him taken to the baths.

9
00:02:14,223 --> 00:02:17,292
But first attend to
all that fucking hair.

10
00:02:17,292 --> 00:02:18,460
Uh!

11
00:02:22,498 --> 00:02:23,458
Uh! Ahh!

12
00:02:36,913 --> 00:02:38,480
Dominus.

13
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,056
The pool's dry.

14
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:22,791
Yes we need rain.

15
00:03:24,994 --> 00:03:26,695
Money would also see it filled.

16
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:28,764
We need that, too.

17
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:32,034
How fares your new pet?

18
00:03:32,034 --> 00:03:33,802
He breathes.

19
00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:36,104
His cost was enough for us
to fill our pool for a month.

20
00:03:36,104 --> 00:03:37,439
You paid beyond the asking.

21
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,808
I paid his worth, Lucretia.

22
00:03:39,808 --> 00:03:42,577
Spartacus is a corpse yet walking.

23
00:03:42,577 --> 00:03:44,746
How long before he takes
his place in the grave,

24
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:46,181
dragging your investment with him?

25
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:48,550
Not before he serves his purpose.

26
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:52,587
From the Legatus Claudius Glaber.

27
00:03:54,424 --> 00:03:55,857
His intentions?

28
00:03:55,857 --> 00:03:57,659
Nudging toward my desires.

29
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:00,462
He comes here?

30
00:04:00,462 --> 00:04:01,997
Two days hence.

31
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:04,933
Well, the reason for
his visit is absent.

32
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,835
In words, but the meaning shines.

33
00:04:06,835 --> 00:04:08,403
He comes to thank me.

34
00:04:08,403 --> 00:04:10,305
For what?

35
00:04:10,305 --> 00:04:12,507
For paying too much for the thracian?

36
00:04:12,507 --> 00:04:16,278
Spartacus defied Glaber's attempt
at assassination in the arena.

37
00:04:16,278 --> 00:04:17,913
The people demanded freedom,

38
00:04:17,913 --> 00:04:20,315
an embarrassment for the Legatus.

39
00:04:21,984 --> 00:04:25,354
I offered an alternative,
by purchasing him.

40
00:04:25,354 --> 00:04:26,822
At inflated price.

41
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:29,157
If Spartacus survives to swear the oath,

42
00:04:29,157 --> 00:04:32,127
the arena will be his
tomb as first intended.

43
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,695
If not..

44
00:04:33,695 --> 00:04:36,798
Then his passing becomes an
early delight for the Legatus.

45
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:42,604
Um. Desires well nudged.

46
00:04:44,006 --> 00:04:48,610
Huh. There's yet more stroking needed.

47
00:04:51,047 --> 00:04:54,383
A simple gesture of gratitude
from the Legatus falls short.

48
00:04:54,383 --> 00:04:57,319
Patronage is the reward we seek.

49
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,454
Nothing less.

50
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:04,526
The Legatus as patron...

51
00:05:04,526 --> 00:05:08,230
His coins will fill our
pool to overflowing.

52
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,298
We'll need to prepare a feast.

53
00:05:10,298 --> 00:05:11,500
A small one.

54
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,971
With wine. And water. Lots of water.

55
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:19,274
Just enough... to wet the tongue.

56
00:05:27,016 --> 00:05:29,451
I'll sacrifice a bull to appease
the gods in our venture.

57
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:33,121
Well perhaps something smaller?

58
00:05:34,457 --> 00:05:36,658
A ram, then.

59
00:05:36,658 --> 00:05:37,859
To the gods.

60
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:41,696
May they bless us with good fortune...

61
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,533
Well lick my hole.
The pig-fucker's still alive.

62
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,619
This is the one?

63
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:39,223
The Spartacus everyone's
been pissing about?

64
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:41,792
Spartacus? My name is...

65
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:45,062
No one gives shit to
who you were, thracian.

66
00:06:45,062 --> 00:06:48,132
I give no shit to who he is.

67
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:52,303
What is this place?

68
00:06:52,303 --> 00:06:54,638
The afterlife, friend.

69
00:06:54,638 --> 00:06:57,341
Or least outside its rusted gates.

70
00:06:57,341 --> 00:07:00,411
You're now an honored guest of Batiatus,

71
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:04,215
master of the greatest ludus in Capua.

72
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:08,052
Ludus?

73
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,854
A school of training.

74
00:07:09,854 --> 00:07:12,323
Where men are forged into gods,

75
00:07:12,323 --> 00:07:17,394
blood their ambrosia,
the arena, their mountaintop.

76
00:07:20,532 --> 00:07:22,466
Gladiators.

77
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:24,702
The truest of brotherhoods!

78
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,706
Live the next few days,

79
00:07:28,706 --> 00:07:33,210
you and the other recruits
will count yourself among us.

80
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,912
And bare our mark.

81
00:07:36,848 --> 00:07:40,084
In the mean, can we fetch you something?

82
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,653
Food? Water?

83
00:07:42,653 --> 00:07:45,356
Maybe some scented oils for your feet?

84
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:48,692
Water.

85
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:57,501
Oh, he's slow this one, isn't he?

86
00:07:57,501 --> 00:07:59,770
What do you
expect from a thracian?

87
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,506
Smells like fresh shit.

88
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:05,543
Oh, they all do.

89
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:07,912
Except for their women.

90
00:08:07,912 --> 00:08:13,050
They smell like piss and shit.

91
00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:19,056
What are you, then?

92
00:08:19,056 --> 00:08:21,358
I'm a gaul, little man.

93
00:08:21,358 --> 00:08:26,697
The greatest of my kind.
Crixus, the undefeated!

94
00:08:26,697 --> 00:08:27,898
A gaul.

95
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:34,405
That explains why you
smell like a woman.

96
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:46,684
Oh you tend to your wounds.

97
00:08:46,684 --> 00:08:47,884
Eat. Rest.

98
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:54,458
When you gain your strength,
we'll revisit that remark.

99
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,437
Freak!

100
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:45,042
Pile of shit. Not a cock among them.

101
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,945
Well then you should join them,
you little cunt.

102
00:10:12,804 --> 00:10:15,572
What is beneath your feet?

103
00:10:19,177 --> 00:10:20,811
Answer!

104
00:10:20,811 --> 00:10:23,647
What is beneath your feet?

105
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:27,985
Sand?

106
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,021
Crixus!

107
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:33,123
What is beneath your feet?

108
00:10:33,123 --> 00:10:34,792
Sacred ground, Doctore!

109
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:38,228
Watered with the tears of blood!

110
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:40,597
Doctore your tears. Your blood.

111
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:44,368
Your pathetic lives,
forged into something of worth.

112
00:10:44,368 --> 00:10:48,939
Listen. Learn.
And perhaps, live.

113
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,275
As gladiators.

114
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,377
Now, attend your master!

115
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,153
You have been blessed!

116
00:11:03,153 --> 00:11:06,223
Each and every one of you,

117
00:11:06,223 --> 00:11:08,425
to find yourselves here,

118
00:11:08,425 --> 00:11:12,162
at the ludus of Quintus
Lentulus Batiatus!

119
00:11:12,162 --> 00:11:15,599
Purveyor of the finest gladiators
in all of the Republic!

120
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:20,704
Prove yourselves,
in the hard days to follow.

121
00:11:20,704 --> 00:11:23,073
Prove yourselves more
than a common slave.

122
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:24,875
More than a man.

123
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,177
Fail, and die.

124
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:31,348
Either here where you stand,
or sold off to the mines.

125
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:36,387
Succeed, and stand
proud among my titans!

126
00:11:36,387 --> 00:11:40,190
Batiatus. Batiatus. Batiatus.

127
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:53,437
A gladiator does not fear death.

128
00:11:53,437 --> 00:11:57,608
He embraces it. Caresses it. Fucks it.

129
00:12:02,414 --> 00:12:05,282
Each time he enters the arena,

130
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:10,421
he slips his cock into
the mouth of the beast.

131
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:15,526
And prays to thrust home
before the jaws snap shut.

132
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:16,677
Uh!

133
00:12:17,662 --> 00:12:22,566
None of you stray dogs would
last a fleeting moment.

134
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,238
Except one.

135
00:12:31,743 --> 00:12:37,014
This sad, battered thracian
stood against four in the arena.

136
00:12:37,014 --> 00:12:41,685
Condemned to die, given nothing but
a sword to wager his life upon.

137
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:45,122
They came at him!

138
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:52,629
<i>Again and
again and again!</i>

139
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:53,379
Uh!

140
00:12:57,302 --> 00:12:58,052
Uh!

141
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:06,510
<i>He defied death! Fate!
The gods themselves!</i>

142
00:13:08,012 --> 00:13:09,246
Raaaa!

143
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:12,683
Yaaaa!

144
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:16,653
Argh! Argh!

145
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,190
Yaaaaa! Uh!

146
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:24,194
Spartacus.... Spartacus...Spartacus...

147
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,499
Gaze at this man!

148
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:31,602
Study him. And realize...

149
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:33,937
He is nothing.

150
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:38,809
A coward.
A deserter from the auxiliary.

151
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:42,012
His victory in the arena,
as hollow as his courage.

152
00:13:42,012 --> 00:13:45,716
He fought against the il
l-trained men of Solonius,

153
00:13:45,716 --> 00:13:47,384
your master's rival.

154
00:13:47,384 --> 00:13:50,454
Had Spartacus entered the
arena with any gladiator here...

155
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,924
His head would have left
well in advance of his body!

156
00:13:59,497 --> 00:14:01,365
The thracian disagrees.

157
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,334
A demonstration, perhaps?

158
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:08,805
Crixus!

159
00:14:10,074 --> 00:14:11,175
Practice swords.

160
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,054
Prove us wrong, Spartacus.

161
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:35,265
Pick it up.

162
00:14:40,538 --> 00:14:41,605
Spartacus!

163
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,281
That is not my name.

164
00:14:51,281 --> 00:14:52,449
Grrr!

165
00:14:59,624 --> 00:15:04,161
Your name, your life, is what we decide.

166
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:30,687
Perhaps the coward requires advantage
to still his trembling knees.

167
00:15:32,023 --> 00:15:33,457
Gladius!

168
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:50,874
Pick it up.

169
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,180
I can do nothing with this one.

170
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,082
Send him to the mines.

171
00:16:03,821 --> 00:16:04,888
Uh!

172
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,197
Feeling rested, are we?

173
00:16:25,743 --> 00:16:29,379
An attack must be grounded
in proper footing.

174
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:32,749
He attempts to press
before regaining balance.

175
00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:37,888
Ahhh!

176
00:16:39,524 --> 00:16:41,291
Crixus!

177
00:16:53,071 --> 00:16:54,137
Ahh!

178
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,406
Ahh!

179
00:17:01,946 --> 00:17:03,947
Allow advantage to your back...

180
00:17:03,947 --> 00:17:05,549
And you are dead.

181
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:31,191
Oh!

182
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:38,648
Become entangled with a
more powerful opponent...

183
00:17:38,648 --> 00:17:40,784
..And you are dead.

184
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,625
Raaa!

185
00:17:51,562 --> 00:17:52,729
Uh!

186
00:18:02,774 --> 00:18:04,541
Hurl your sword in the arena...

187
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,977
And you are dead again.

188
00:18:23,027 --> 00:18:25,028
Your foolishness has cost a life.

189
00:18:25,028 --> 00:18:28,498
But yours may yet be redeemed.

190
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:31,067
Two fingers. A sign of surrender.

191
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:33,904
A plea of mercy to the
editor of the games!

192
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:42,145
Beg for your life, little rabbit.

193
00:18:46,651 --> 00:18:47,717
Bash his skull in!

194
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,487
Crixus!

195
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:55,926
Dominus.

196
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,527
Continue training.

197
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:04,601
He tries to kill your best man,
and yet you let him live?

198
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,770
Glaber visits tomorrow.

199
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,273
His intention towards the
thracian may include blood.

200
00:19:10,273 --> 00:19:15,145
Until his patronage is secured I
intend to keep it warm and flowing.

201
00:19:15,145 --> 00:19:17,881
God, the heat!

202
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:20,650
Enough to boil the tongue from the head!

203
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,920
Raa!

204
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,264
Eat it!

205
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:04,187
Shit-fucking slaves and criminals,
the lot of them.

206
00:21:05,923 --> 00:21:08,291
Are we the better?

207
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,260
You survived your own execution.

208
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,329
Twice, if you mark the gaul over there

209
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:14,497
not introducing your brains to the sand.

210
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:19,369
You are of a difference, thracian.

211
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:21,938
Above this unfortunate collection.

212
00:21:21,938 --> 00:21:23,206
And you?

213
00:21:24,308 --> 00:21:25,028
Varro.

214
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,312
The worst of the lot.

215
00:21:29,312 --> 00:21:32,182
A free man consigned by his own hand.

216
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:37,053
Why would a man willingly
condemn himself to this?

217
00:21:37,053 --> 00:21:40,523
A small matter of debt, grown large.

218
00:21:40,523 --> 00:21:42,525
The repaying of it proves difficult.

219
00:21:43,861 --> 00:21:46,162
If the concern was only to me...

220
00:21:48,332 --> 00:21:49,899
A family?

221
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:51,868
Wife and child.

222
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,471
A boy.

223
00:21:55,873 --> 00:21:58,808
Two years in the arena,
my winnings will keep them fed.

224
00:21:59,877 --> 00:22:01,111
Winnings?

225
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,613
Fight well, and you're
rewarded with coin.

226
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:06,149
Enough even to balance what I owe,
the gods be fortunate.

227
00:22:07,652 --> 00:22:08,985
The gods.

228
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,289
You are a fool.

229
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:15,125
And in good company, by the judging.

230
00:22:17,595 --> 00:22:19,162
They're the best
I could do at the moment.

231
00:22:19,162 --> 00:22:21,297
One or two show promise. But the rest

232
00:22:21,297 --> 00:22:22,632
my own mother would
have them in the arena.

233
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:23,767
You have no mother.

234
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:25,368
You were belched from the
cunt of the underworld.

235
00:22:25,368 --> 00:22:26,369
That's why I favor you.

236
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:27,537
Were there no better offerings?

237
00:22:27,537 --> 00:22:28,538
Better, yes!

238
00:22:28,538 --> 00:22:30,440
Within the reach of my purse, no!

239
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,577
You stand questioning and complaining
instead of setting yourself to the task!

240
00:22:34,577 --> 00:22:38,248
I press to honor you, Batiatus.
And this ludus.

241
00:22:38,248 --> 00:22:39,816
Legatus Glaber visits tomorrow.

242
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,351
With him hope of renewed fortunes.

243
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:44,821
Till then, these men are
all the straw afforded.

244
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:48,058
Bake them into brick,
or crumble them to the mines.

245
00:22:48,058 --> 00:22:50,593
Your will. My hands.

246
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:57,934
Ovidius! Apologies for the delay!

247
00:22:57,934 --> 00:22:59,602
Accepted, if made with coin.

248
00:23:01,105 --> 00:23:04,808
Three months of grain,
the payment standing past due.

249
00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:05,809
Three, is it?

250
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:06,943
To the day.

251
00:23:10,081 --> 00:23:12,148
The games of the Vulcanalia approach.

252
00:23:12,148 --> 00:23:14,184
If I could carry the debt till then...

253
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,453
The principle, plus thirty percent.

254
00:23:16,453 --> 00:23:18,321
Thirty?!

255
00:23:18,321 --> 00:23:21,624
Or settle the debt as it stands.

256
00:23:21,624 --> 00:23:25,328
Huh, principle plus thirty.
After the Vulcanalia.

257
00:23:25,328 --> 00:23:27,097
The day after.

258
00:23:43,013 --> 00:23:44,280
Uh!

259
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,317
I could have taken him.

260
00:23:47,317 --> 00:23:51,721
Crixus? Pff, the shit would
be running down your leg.

261
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,324
I wouldn't have ended up in the dirt,
fucked like a dog.

262
00:23:54,324 --> 00:23:57,961
Without training, the gaul would
have bested any of us, Kerza.

263
00:23:57,961 --> 00:24:00,463
Speaking otherwise is bloated air.

264
00:24:00,463 --> 00:24:04,667
I pray not to face
Crixus in the final test.

265
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:08,338
Nothing to worry. You'll
never make it that far, cock hole.

266
00:24:08,338 --> 00:24:11,608
All can make it to the test. And beyond.

267
00:24:12,777 --> 00:24:14,911
Freedom.

268
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,413
One day. If you fight well.

269
00:24:17,413 --> 00:24:21,417
Freedom, it's piss without
the money to keep it, Varro.

270
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:24,487
Win the hearts of the crowd in the
arena and you'll be blessed with both.

271
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:30,226
You fought the gladiators there.

272
00:24:30,226 --> 00:24:32,162
What do you think of our chances?

273
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:38,434
You're all going to die.

274
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:51,247
Up! You will sleep when
you prove yourselves men.

275
00:25:12,236 --> 00:25:13,169
Ah!

276
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:14,404
Keep pace!

277
00:25:24,114 --> 00:25:25,348
It's late.

278
00:25:26,717 --> 00:25:30,320
It is. Return to your dreams.

279
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,855
In a minute.

280
00:25:34,358 --> 00:25:35,792
We need better wine.

281
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:37,861
We need many things.

282
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,430
We'll have them, again.

283
00:25:42,566 --> 00:25:44,701
The arrangements are set?

284
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:47,070
I've taken care of everything.

285
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,738
Cannot fall short tomorrow.

286
00:25:48,738 --> 00:25:51,007
If I can secure Glaber's patronage...

287
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,242
You will.

288
00:25:54,278 --> 00:25:55,545
How are you certain?

289
00:25:57,615 --> 00:25:59,449
We've done everything we can.

290
00:25:59,449 --> 00:26:01,284
It's in the hands of the gods now.

291
00:26:07,124 --> 00:26:08,358
Come to bed.

292
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,494
And bring that awful wine.

293
00:26:14,231 --> 00:26:15,531
I beg you.

294
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:18,735
Do not fuck me.

295
00:26:48,766 --> 00:26:50,300
Halt!

296
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,002
The day's training will begin shortly.

297
00:26:53,002 --> 00:26:54,304
Eat.

298
00:26:58,208 --> 00:26:59,742
Eh! Jupiter's cock.

299
00:26:59,742 --> 00:27:01,678
Now we train all day?

300
00:27:05,516 --> 00:27:08,217
Still believe every man
will live to see the test?

301
00:27:12,022 --> 00:27:14,223
Mostly.

302
00:27:14,223 --> 00:27:16,159
Yet the fool, then.

303
00:27:18,662 --> 00:27:20,263
Batiatus paid for these men?

304
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:23,199
Very little, by the look of them.

305
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:27,770
The roman way. Lives for coins.

306
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:30,106
Some deserving more than others.

307
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:34,444
I've heard a certain
thracian was quite the price.

308
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,113
I would see the
cost rise higher still.

309
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:44,854
Um!

310
00:27:47,224 --> 00:27:49,225
I recall the
hardship of the march,

311
00:27:49,225 --> 00:27:50,526
when I was a recruit.

312
00:27:50,526 --> 00:27:53,830
You must be mad with hunger.

313
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,365
Fill your bellies!

314
00:28:09,413 --> 00:28:11,314
Shit.

315
00:28:17,454 --> 00:28:19,722
Wake me when it's time to die again.

316
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,800
Apologies for the porridge.

317
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,269
Barca finds the jest amusing.

318
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:34,504
Least he didn't piss in it this time.

319
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,205
Adds an unpleasant bite.

320
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:43,446
The days will be hard.
Without food, more so.

321
00:28:43,446 --> 00:28:45,681
You would give me your bread?

322
00:28:45,681 --> 00:28:46,761
Mine, no.

323
00:28:49,386 --> 00:28:51,988
I move things from here to there,
this hand to that.

324
00:28:51,988 --> 00:28:54,524
Even from outside these walls.

325
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,293
Whatever your needs, Ashur provides.

326
00:28:57,928 --> 00:28:59,762
I owe no man.

327
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:04,767
I ask nothing in return.

328
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:08,704
My only concern is your strength
and well being in the coming day.

329
00:29:08,704 --> 00:29:10,940
Come to plain words.

330
00:29:12,643 --> 00:29:14,077
Simply stated, then.

331
00:29:15,312 --> 00:29:19,148
In addition to other services,
I offer odds.

332
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:20,817
Will this man live? That one die?

333
00:29:20,817 --> 00:29:23,319
How fast? How slow? On what day or hour?

334
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:26,456
Games to pass the time. And the coin.

335
00:29:26,456 --> 00:29:27,657
And how am I fixed?

336
00:29:27,657 --> 00:29:30,426
Twelve to the one, favoring the mines.

337
00:29:30,426 --> 00:29:31,594
Higher towards your death.

338
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,933
Crixus stands to lose a sum
if you defy the numbering.

339
00:29:37,835 --> 00:29:39,635
I would see it so.

340
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:50,246
Ahh.

341
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:55,084
Do not think me friend.

342
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,019
The thought is well removed.

343
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,406
How did you manage this?

344
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:20,009
By playing the odds.

345
00:30:21,645 --> 00:30:23,713
I fear they're about to worsen.

346
00:30:57,514 --> 00:30:58,514
Glaber.

347
00:30:58,514 --> 00:31:00,883
You will address me by title of Legatus.

348
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:10,126
Yet the animal. The mark of your kind.

349
00:31:10,727 --> 00:31:11,928
Where is she?

350
00:31:11,928 --> 00:31:13,162
Who?

351
00:31:15,199 --> 00:31:16,332
That little wife of yours?

352
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:17,333
Where?

353
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,569
Wherever I please!

354
00:31:24,942 --> 00:31:27,210
She served you no grievance.

355
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:27,960
No.

356
00:31:29,313 --> 00:31:32,815
None. But you...

357
00:31:32,815 --> 00:31:34,917
You have grieved me.

358
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:36,652
By stirring the auxiliary to desertion.

359
00:31:36,652 --> 00:31:38,254
Calling my command into question,

360
00:31:38,254 --> 00:31:41,991
imperiling my standing with the senate.

361
00:31:41,991 --> 00:31:44,794
And then in the arena
you grieve me again,

362
00:31:44,794 --> 00:31:47,597
by not knowing when to die.

363
00:31:47,597 --> 00:31:48,831
My life, then.

364
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:52,001
In exchange for hers.

365
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:53,869
Your life is no longer yours to bargain!

366
00:31:56,073 --> 00:31:57,406
If I wish it ceased,

367
00:31:57,406 --> 00:31:59,275
I have but to whisper

368
00:31:59,275 --> 00:32:02,078
and good Batiatus will command it!

369
00:32:02,078 --> 00:32:04,247
Then tongue the words in his ear.

370
00:32:08,685 --> 00:32:11,454
You mistake me, thracian.

371
00:32:11,454 --> 00:32:16,726
True. I once sought death in
repayment for your slights.

372
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:23,366
But I see the error of that now.
Wishing for an end too quick.

373
00:32:24,868 --> 00:32:28,371
No. My desires have turned to blood.

374
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:32,808
Spilled by the drop, over time,
until you are drained.

375
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:36,312
I told you Rome's shadow was vast.

376
00:32:36,312 --> 00:32:41,183
And you will yet die under it. Sliver
by sliver, to the roar of the crowd.

377
00:32:45,956 --> 00:32:46,706
Oh.

378
00:32:51,228 --> 00:32:55,264
A parting kindness, to bind us.

379
00:33:01,471 --> 00:33:08,544
I took it from her thigh
to preserve the scent.

380
00:33:08,544 --> 00:33:11,881
Before my men stained it with their own.

381
00:33:12,516 --> 00:33:15,117
Raaa! No!

382
00:33:15,117 --> 00:33:19,088
She was a savage amusement.

383
00:33:19,088 --> 00:33:22,224
And when the fight
finally left her eyes.

384
00:33:22,224 --> 00:33:26,162
I sold her to an unpleasant
syrian for half a coin.

385
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:36,839
You see the thracian finally
learns his place before me.

386
00:33:39,576 --> 00:33:41,510
On his knees.

387
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:48,217
Raaaa!

388
00:33:48,217 --> 00:33:51,220
Your visit with the thracian
was satisfying, then?

389
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,422
The man is of no more concern to me.

390
00:33:53,422 --> 00:33:57,360
No none whatsoever! We've
prepared a feast in your honor!

391
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,527
I leave for Rome.

392
00:33:58,527 --> 00:34:00,096
Rome? Now?

393
00:34:00,096 --> 00:34:02,798
Errr, something for your trip, then?

394
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,639
You really shouldn't have
gone to the trouble, Lucretia.

395
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,642
These common dishes leave
my stomach unsettled.

396
00:34:15,045 --> 00:34:17,613
Some wine perhaps,
while we wait for your husband?

397
00:34:17,613 --> 00:34:19,014
Sestian?

398
00:34:19,014 --> 00:34:22,184
No, but something of equal taste?

399
00:34:22,184 --> 00:34:23,686
Water, then.

400
00:34:26,823 --> 00:34:31,394
The heat and the dust.
Will it ever rain again?

401
00:34:31,394 --> 00:34:33,529
We can only pray.

402
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,297
Can't place foot on street in Capua

403
00:34:35,297 --> 00:34:38,200
without hearing someone pleading
to the heavens for a sprinkle.

404
00:34:39,002 --> 00:34:42,371
And the gods yet ignore us.

405
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,974
Perhaps we've done
something to offend them.

406
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:50,179
I try to do a little something everyday.

407
00:34:51,515 --> 00:34:53,182
So you're the cause, Ilithyia.

408
00:34:53,182 --> 00:34:58,854
I'd stand a bit away. Jupiter
could hurl a bolt at any moment.

409
00:34:58,854 --> 00:35:01,190
He'd have to choose between targets.

410
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:07,830
And I thought I was in the
presence of a proper roman woman.

411
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:12,668
Proper is a word forged by men who
would seek to enslave us with it.

412
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:15,905
Kerza!

413
00:35:45,368 --> 00:35:48,304
Have you ever been inside a ludus?

414
00:35:48,304 --> 00:35:53,843
No. I've always wanted to.
But father would never allow it.

415
00:35:53,843 --> 00:35:56,745
You obey his commands?

416
00:35:56,745 --> 00:36:00,015
Not all of them. Or my husband's.

417
00:36:00,015 --> 00:36:05,788
How do you live with the noise and the
smell, surrounded by these animals?

418
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:09,391
Yes, they are wild and savage,
aren't they?

419
00:36:09,391 --> 00:36:14,063
Something out of a fever dream.
Isn't it a worry?

420
00:36:14,063 --> 00:36:17,700
I mean, what if they went insane
all at once, clamoring for blood?!

421
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,269
This ludus has been in my
husband's family for generations.

422
00:36:20,269 --> 00:36:21,837
And yet it stands.

423
00:36:21,837 --> 00:36:26,442
What about your children?
Do you let them play with them?

424
00:36:26,442 --> 00:36:29,712
Um, I'm without children.

425
00:36:32,382 --> 00:36:35,885
Oh. Apologies. I just thought
a woman of your age...

426
00:36:35,885 --> 00:36:36,635
Um.

427
00:36:41,391 --> 00:36:44,126
Come. We leave for Rome.

428
00:36:44,126 --> 00:36:45,761
So soon?

429
00:36:45,761 --> 00:36:49,899
Well, can't we stay awhile?
I want to watch the gladiators.

430
00:36:49,899 --> 00:36:52,701
Another time. Come.

431
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,137
Kerza!

432
00:37:31,174 --> 00:37:33,108
Pair with Spartacus.

433
00:37:33,108 --> 00:37:34,376
Yes, Doctore.

434
00:37:35,478 --> 00:37:38,280
Recruits! Attend!

435
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,783
Show the thracian what we've
learned in his absence.

436
00:37:52,629 --> 00:37:54,863
Form one. Attack!

437
00:37:54,863 --> 00:37:56,565
Raaa!

438
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,641
Ahhh!

439
00:38:08,445 --> 00:38:10,412
Form two. Attack!

440
00:38:10,412 --> 00:38:11,880
Yaaaa!

441
00:38:34,237 --> 00:38:35,304
Raaa!

442
00:38:36,673 --> 00:38:37,740
Uh!

443
00:38:38,808 --> 00:38:39,875
Spartacus!

444
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:44,346
Spartacus!

445
00:39:19,516 --> 00:39:20,266
Uh!

446
00:39:35,465 --> 00:39:38,367
The gods haven't pissed
on me enough for one day?!

447
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:42,538
Legatus fucking Glaber spurns
me like a common slave, but no!

448
00:39:42,538 --> 00:39:45,340
Let's add shit to the piss
let's pour it in his mouth!

449
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,377
If word gets out that Batiatus
can't control his own men...

450
00:39:48,377 --> 00:39:49,978
I warned you of their quality.

451
00:39:49,978 --> 00:39:53,182
You warn me nothing! You counsel,
and make promises to the air!

452
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,950
"My hands, your will."

453
00:39:57,153 --> 00:39:59,455
The Legatus, barely
beyond my fucking gates!

454
00:39:59,455 --> 00:40:00,723
The thracian is unpredictable.

455
00:40:00,723 --> 00:40:02,458
Then school him to our standards.

456
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:05,861
Rod and lash fall unnoticed. He's an
animal, best unleashed in the mines.

457
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:09,431
No. The rest to the gods,
they were all of little cost.

458
00:40:09,431 --> 00:40:15,604
Spartacus is more highly valued, his
worth well exceeding their entire sum.

459
00:40:15,604 --> 00:40:18,640
I will have return.
If not from the Legatus,

460
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,209
then from the man himself.

461
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,078
Even though he is unpredictable?

462
00:40:23,078 --> 00:40:27,583
He is but passionate,
and he stirs the same in others.

463
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:31,487
A boon to the crowds, if we can but
divine the instrument of his taming.

464
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:38,961
He struggled to retain this bit of
fabric, even as the guards beat him.

465
00:40:38,961 --> 00:40:41,764
It may bring you some service.

466
00:40:41,764 --> 00:40:45,567
I noted this in the hand of
the Legatus, upon his arrival.

467
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:58,981
Bring him to my chamber.
I'll press to discovery.

468
00:41:11,961 --> 00:41:13,562
Why are you here?

469
00:41:13,562 --> 00:41:17,399
In this place. Under my hospitality.
Do you know why?

470
00:41:17,399 --> 00:41:20,803
Because I trusted in
the honor of a roman.

471
00:41:20,803 --> 00:41:25,374
You are here because of my grandfather.

472
00:41:25,374 --> 00:41:28,210
He built this ludus.

473
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:31,079
He believed that no
man was without worth.

474
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:35,150
That even the most vile among us
could rise to honor and glory.

475
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:38,053
He instilled these beliefs in my father,

476
00:41:38,053 --> 00:41:40,789
who in turn passed them on to me.

477
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:47,462
I am a lanista, like my forefathers.
A trainer of gladiators.

478
00:41:47,462 --> 00:41:50,199
I see things in men that
they themselves have lost.

479
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:52,634
A small spark. An ember.

480
00:41:52,634 --> 00:41:56,738
I give it breath, tinder.
Until it ignites in the arena.

481
00:41:58,107 --> 00:42:00,242
I burn for no cause but my own.

482
00:42:00,242 --> 00:42:03,345
And what might that be? Money?

483
00:42:03,345 --> 00:42:05,447
You've cost me enough on that front.

484
00:42:05,447 --> 00:42:07,749
No, not so base a cause for this one.

485
00:42:07,749 --> 00:42:11,486
Position, then? Power? Love?

486
00:42:15,225 --> 00:42:17,693
You have a woman, thracian?

487
00:42:17,693 --> 00:42:19,695
I have a wife.

488
00:42:19,695 --> 00:42:21,029
And do you love her?

489
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,466
Of course you do.
I can see it in the eye,

490
00:42:24,466 --> 00:42:25,901
tensing of the jaw.

491
00:42:25,901 --> 00:42:29,905
What might be the name
of this delicate flower?

492
00:42:29,905 --> 00:42:32,007
Sura.

493
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,976
Where is she?

494
00:42:33,976 --> 00:42:36,478
He took her. When he came for me.

495
00:42:37,413 --> 00:42:39,882
Legatus Glaber? He has her?

496
00:42:39,882 --> 00:42:41,750
He sold her to a syrian.

497
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,486
Well then how do you
know she still lives?

498
00:42:44,486 --> 00:42:48,190
How do you know the heart
beats beneath your chest?

499
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:53,061
Most days, I don't.
I'm just a simple roman

500
00:42:53,061 --> 00:42:58,233
trying to make his way against the
whim of the gods, the politicians,

501
00:42:58,233 --> 00:43:01,036
the miscreants, though often you
can't tell one from another.

502
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:05,707
But you, you are the most
dangerous of animals.

503
00:43:05,707 --> 00:43:08,143
The beast born of the heart.

504
00:43:08,143 --> 00:43:10,846
What would you do to hold your wife again?

505
00:43:10,846 --> 00:43:14,583
To feel the warmth of her skin,
to taste her lips?

506
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:16,585
Would you kill?

507
00:43:16,585 --> 00:43:19,488
Whoever stood between us.

508
00:43:19,488 --> 00:43:23,025
How many men? A hundred? A thousand?

509
00:43:23,025 --> 00:43:24,559
I would kill them all.

510
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:26,862
Then do it in the arena!

511
00:43:26,862 --> 00:43:30,332
Fight for me and the
honor of my forefathers!

512
00:43:30,332 --> 00:43:34,503
Prove yourself. Climb to the pinnacle,
gain your freedom

513
00:43:34,503 --> 00:43:37,306
and that of the woman you've lost.

514
00:43:37,306 --> 00:43:43,211
I did not lose her.
She was taken from me.

515
00:43:43,211 --> 00:43:47,716
A man must accept his fate.
Or be destroyed by it.

516
00:43:49,953 --> 00:43:54,957
Why would I place my fate in
the hands of another roman?

517
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:57,759
Because of what they hold.

518
00:44:02,065 --> 00:44:03,932
Your wife's?

519
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:11,440
Pass the final test, tonight.
With honor and servitude.

520
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,044
Call me Dominus.
And I will help to reunite you.

521
00:44:28,091 --> 00:44:29,758
The choice is yours.

522
00:45:13,936 --> 00:45:15,303
Cease!

523
00:45:17,206 --> 00:45:21,009
Varro has stood to a draw!
The test is passed!

524
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:36,591
Barca! Marcus! Positions!

525
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:44,066
Barca! Barca!

526
00:45:55,845 --> 00:45:56,812
Begin!

527
00:45:56,812 --> 00:45:57,979
Raaaa!

528
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,661
That's disappointing.

529
00:46:12,661 --> 00:46:15,030
Not every venture ends in climax.

530
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:17,232
A fact known well to every woman.

531
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,546
Crixus!

532
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:36,151
Spartacus! Positions!

533
00:46:47,797 --> 00:46:50,132
Crixus! Crixus!

534
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:18,026
One final lesson, before I
send you to the afterlife.

535
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:30,539
Begin!

536
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:43,652
Fuck.

537
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,354
Expensive and worthless,
all in a measure.

538
00:47:48,024 --> 00:47:49,824
Fight! You thracian bitch!

539
00:48:00,036 --> 00:48:01,603
Tears!

540
00:48:05,141 --> 00:48:07,876
The rabbit is fixed to piss himself!

541
00:48:29,999 --> 00:48:31,666
Skin the rabbit!

542
00:48:34,337 --> 00:48:36,071
Ah! Oh!

543
00:48:46,349 --> 00:48:47,849
Ahh! Ahhh!

544
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,020
Finish him!

545
00:48:55,291 --> 00:48:56,858
Thracians.

546
00:49:06,969 --> 00:49:08,903
Ahhh!

547
00:49:26,689 --> 00:49:28,490
The lesson is well learned.

548
00:49:30,059 --> 00:49:31,293
Spartacus!

549
00:49:33,496 --> 00:49:35,263
Cease.

550
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:44,072
You have passed the test.

551
00:49:54,717 --> 00:49:56,051
Dominus.

552
00:49:58,688 --> 00:50:04,592
<i>Your life now promises
meaning. Swear it to me.</i>

553
00:50:04,592 --> 00:50:06,961
<i>Recite the Sacramentum
Gladiatorum.</i>

554
00:50:08,931 --> 00:50:15,236
<i>I commit my flesh. My mind.
My will.</i>

555
00:50:15,236 --> 00:50:21,643
<i>To the glory of this ludus, and the
commands of my master, Batiatus.</i>

556
00:50:24,113 --> 00:50:29,517
<i>"I swear to be burned, chained,
beaten,</i>

557
00:50:29,517 --> 00:50:31,853
or die by the sword.

558
00:50:31,853 --> 00:50:34,622
In pursuit of honor in the arena.

559
00:50:47,603 --> 00:50:49,838
Welcome to the brotherhood.

560
00:50:51,600 --> 00:51:49,840

1
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,737
Spartacus!

2
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:50,840
You charge without thought.

3
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,045
A weakness an opponent
could turn to advantage.

4
00:01:56,045 --> 00:01:58,147
A difficult feat from his backside.

5
00:01:58,147 --> 00:02:00,683
You speak without thought as well.

6
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:05,688
Another weakness.

7
00:02:08,993 --> 00:02:10,560
Thracians.

8
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,862
Always on their backs,
with their legs spread.

9
00:02:12,862 --> 00:02:15,565
Where they belong.

10
00:02:15,565 --> 00:02:19,969
Forget everything you
learned outside these walls.

11
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:22,639
For that is the world of men.

12
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,974
We are more!

13
00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:26,976
We are gladiators!

14
00:02:30,648 --> 00:02:32,048
Study.

15
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:33,416
Train.

16
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,136
Bleed.

17
00:02:35,686 --> 00:02:38,388
And one day your name will be legend,

18
00:02:38,388 --> 00:02:41,958
spoken in hushed
whispers of fear and awe.

19
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:45,795
As the city speaks of Crixus,
the Champion of Capua!

20
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:53,303
But his legend was
not birthed in the arena.

21
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:55,471
It was given life here.

22
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:58,141
In this ludus.

23
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:00,176
Under the sting of my whip!

24
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,880
Attack!

25
00:04:10,264 --> 00:04:11,104
Attend!

26
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,167
The Vulcanalia is announced!

27
00:04:17,838 --> 00:04:19,639
Vulcanalia?

28
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,541
A festival to ward off wildfires.

29
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:26,713
Dominus Batiatus has
seen fit to fight twenty

30
00:04:26,713 --> 00:04:29,449
at this year's Vulcanalia.

31
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:32,852
His gift to the people of Capua!

32
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:35,488
Our lowest shall fight at dawn.

33
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:37,657
Eight pairs to follow.

34
00:04:37,657 --> 00:04:43,329
After which your master
will present his Primus.

35
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:46,933
Two of our finest, to meet in the arena!

36
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:50,670
Crixus, then?

37
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,938
Crixus certainly.

38
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,275
And his opponent?

39
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:58,278
Against the Champion of Capua?

40
00:04:58,278 --> 00:05:00,213
What would it matter?

41
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,227
Twenty men,

42
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:16,996
I pledge twenty men to fill
the ranks of the Vulcanalia,

43
00:05:16,996 --> 00:05:20,300
my own coin to see each victor paid,

44
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,769
what thanks do I
get from the magistrate?

45
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:24,637
He fears he will be unable
to attend our reception

46
00:05:24,637 --> 00:05:27,974
on the eve of the games due
to "pressing concerns"!

47
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:29,609
Of what sort?

48
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:32,045
I hear rumor he
dines with Solonius instead.

49
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:33,680
Solonius?

50
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,183
But he offers not one
man for the Vulcanalia.

51
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:38,851
Yet his tongue still
manages to find his way

52
00:05:38,851 --> 00:05:40,853
to the magistrate's asshole.

53
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:43,723
Is that new?

54
00:05:43,723 --> 00:05:46,859
For the reception, yes.

55
00:05:46,859 --> 00:05:49,862
The rising cost of this
thing raises concern.

56
00:05:49,862 --> 00:05:52,699
It raises opportunity.

57
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:53,700
I question not its import.

58
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,102
I question its scale.

59
00:05:56,102 --> 00:05:57,704
This drought has stretched
our resources thin

60
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:59,472
and now without the attendance
of the magistrate...

61
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:04,677
Darling, you must spend
coins to receive coins.

62
00:06:04,677 --> 00:06:06,879
My husband taught me that.

63
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,981
A wise man.

64
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:10,083
He has his moments.

65
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,385
And this will be one of them.

66
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:13,786
You'll delight and astound,

67
00:06:13,786 --> 00:06:15,822
securing business for the year to come.

68
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:17,991
And perhaps even tempt Glaber's wife

69
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:19,892
to take up the cause of patronage.

70
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:21,394
Ilithyia?

71
00:06:21,394 --> 00:06:22,395
I thought she was still in Rome

72
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:24,030
with that ungrateful husband of hers.

73
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,133
She returns absent him for the games.

74
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:29,402
She's acquiring quite a taste for them.

75
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:31,671
One which I shall nourish to advantage.

76
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,641
This new color suites you.

77
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:37,710
Oh, shall I dye the rest to match?

78
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,798
The bird would be
better served in my bowl.

79
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:03,303
Odds the meal would be your last.

80
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:04,023
Barca?

81
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:08,274
He stands but tall.

82
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:10,243
He stands a legend.

83
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:14,814
After Carthage suffered
defeat by the romans,

84
00:07:14,814 --> 00:07:16,616
they forced hundreds of his people

85
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:18,785
to fight against
each other in the arena.

86
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:24,424
Half a day passed,
and only two remained...

87
00:07:29,963 --> 00:07:30,683
Barca.

88
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:33,333
And the chief of his people,

89
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:37,804
the noble Mago.

90
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:43,710
Skill and the testament
of years were his allies.

91
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:51,517
Strength and youth Barca's.

92
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:56,522
Mago fell to his knees...

93
00:08:01,362 --> 00:08:04,697
And Barca became the Beast of Carthage.

94
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:10,002
He sent an old man on his way.

95
00:08:10,002 --> 00:08:12,572
Mago was a warrior fierce renown.

96
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:14,674
A chief upon a throne of blood.

97
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:20,813
He was also Barca's father,
as the story tells.

98
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:28,388
Is it true?

99
00:08:28,388 --> 00:08:30,289
In the world of the gladiator,

100
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:32,825
a man's fame and glory
constructs its own truth.

101
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:36,329
Fame and glory.

102
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:40,633
I seek neither.

103
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:44,737
Coin, then. Like me...

104
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:46,239
<i>Open the gates.</i>

105
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:48,841
<i>Have the guard ready.</i>

106
00:08:51,612 --> 00:08:52,812
A moment Dominus.

107
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:56,716
Ten paces.

108
00:08:58,018 --> 00:08:59,819
Is there any news of my wife?

109
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:01,888
She was indeed sold
to a syrian merchant.

110
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:03,156
You found her?

111
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:05,925
I have cause to believe she
sails upon the orontes.

112
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:06,993
To Damascus, then?

113
00:09:06,993 --> 00:09:09,228
Or perhaps Antioch?

114
00:09:09,228 --> 00:09:12,198
Do I appear a fucking arrow,
my nose pointing towards

115
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:13,866
your wife's dripping thighs!?!

116
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:15,802
You press beyond position!

117
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:17,236
Dominus.

118
00:09:17,236 --> 00:09:18,771
The search continues,
that's all you need to know

119
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:20,773
until then, fight, win.

120
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:22,041
The price of her freedom requires

121
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,310
substantial sums on your part.

122
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:40,693
Show me something of note.

123
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:42,595
A moment. I have just the thing.

124
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:44,330
My finest piece.

125
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,232
A flawless gem imported at great cost

126
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:47,900
from the mines of Scythia.

127
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:03,082
Price? Thirty denarii.

128
00:10:03,082 --> 00:10:04,917
Thirty?

129
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:06,252
This piece.

130
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:08,654
Is it something that
Ilithyia would favor?

131
00:10:08,654 --> 00:10:10,556
It's the only piece I'd show her.

132
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:13,726
She has very refined tastes.

133
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:15,161
Twenty-five.

134
00:10:15,161 --> 00:10:16,796
Twenty-nine.

135
00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:21,467
Twenty-eight and I'll resist
pitching you off the balcony.

136
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:23,102
Twenty-eight, then.

137
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:23,852
Um.

138
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,006
Come along then.

139
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,649
<i>Form two! Ready!</i>

140
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:37,750
<i>One.</i>

141
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:43,089
Form one, ready!

142
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:45,992
One...

143
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:49,896
Two..

144
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:53,499
Form two.

145
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:54,500
Ready!

146
00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:57,136
One..

147
00:11:00,274 --> 00:11:01,340
Two.

148
00:11:05,312 --> 00:11:06,412
Form three!

149
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:11,250
Stand.

150
00:11:18,058 --> 00:11:19,625
Spartacus!

151
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,761
Do you dream of the mines?

152
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:24,230
My focus is on
blood and battle, Doctore.

153
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,766
Yet your training proves
you worthy of neither.

154
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:31,304
I am a thracian.

155
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:32,838
It is in my blood.

156
00:11:32,838 --> 00:11:34,040
Thrace.

157
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:41,747
A swamp of piss.

158
00:12:07,908 --> 00:12:09,575
Kneel.

159
00:12:29,096 --> 00:12:33,899
The lands from which you
hail matters no longer.

160
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:39,138
The only thing that does
is the sound of my voice...

161
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:41,841
And the sand beneath your feet.

162
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:51,350
You will learn to worship it.

163
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,585
Back to training.

164
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:57,023
The sand smells like Thrace.

165
00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:02,094
Perhaps I should shit
to complete the aroma.

166
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:08,100
You. You are summoned.

167
00:13:25,285 --> 00:13:26,686
This drought seems never to end.

168
00:13:29,523 --> 00:13:32,024
How do you fare?

169
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:33,292
Domina provides for me.

170
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:37,096
That's good.

171
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:38,564
Good.

172
00:13:38,564 --> 00:13:39,765
How long have you served Domina?

173
00:13:42,736 --> 00:13:44,937
All my life.

174
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:46,505
I was born in this ludus.

175
00:13:47,574 --> 00:13:50,409
And recently come to blossom.

176
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:53,279
I barely noticed till I,
I saw you at the games with Domina

177
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,450
three moons past,
I fought Arnoch of Tarquinii.

178
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,453
Did you enjoy my victory?

179
00:14:00,453 --> 00:14:03,189
I was pleased. When it ended.

180
00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:06,992
It's no easy task to sever a man's head.

181
00:14:08,595 --> 00:14:11,030
You must find the right angle.

182
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:15,134
I do not favor the games.

183
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:19,305
Well that is an odd bent,

184
00:14:21,742 --> 00:14:23,776
for a slave,

185
00:14:23,776 --> 00:14:25,578
at a gladiator school.

186
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:30,049
One not to be straightened.

187
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:32,818
I did not mean to insult.

188
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:34,053
Domina awaits.

189
00:15:02,883 --> 00:15:06,385
You walk too slowly to my chambers.

190
00:15:06,385 --> 00:15:07,753
I do not want to arouse the suspicions

191
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:09,688
of my men as to my purpose.

192
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:13,793
And what might that be,
oh, Champion of Capua?

193
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:17,763
Whatever Domina desires.

194
00:15:30,777 --> 00:15:33,946
I brought this
necklace for the reception...

195
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:36,015
Do you think its too much?

196
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:38,684
My blood rises.

197
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:41,787
But to give the necklace
credit would be false.

198
00:15:41,787 --> 00:15:43,389
And what quickens your pulse?

199
00:15:46,927 --> 00:15:49,528
The touch of your lips.

200
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:52,431
Your breasts...

201
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:54,400
And all of the pleasures below...

202
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,509
I need your cock inside me.

203
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:05,411
And I need it in me now.

204
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:15,354
Never lose focus!

205
00:16:15,354 --> 00:16:17,389
Not if Jupiter himself

206
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:19,325
were to rip open the heavens

207
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:21,927
and dangle his cock from the skies!

208
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:26,765
A gladiator's first
distraction is his last.

209
00:16:26,765 --> 00:16:29,668
Not all contests end in death...

210
00:16:29,668 --> 00:16:31,770
Two fingers.

211
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,039
A sign of surrender.

212
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:35,541
And shame.

213
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,714
The oath I swore to this place
did not including begging.

214
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:47,820
He inquires as to the nuances of..

215
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,989
I need no lesson in submission.

216
00:16:53,126 --> 00:16:55,761
You favor a different lesson?

217
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:58,464
In obedience, perhaps?

218
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,201
To the hole!

219
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:03,736
Both of you!

220
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:20,019
Perhaps I spoke out of turn.

221
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:22,388
Perhaps?

222
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:25,190
What I perceived as courage in
you reveals itself foolishness.

223
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,027
To surrender in the arena...I cannot do.

224
00:17:28,027 --> 00:17:29,862
I must have victory.

225
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:31,797
What happens when that is
something you cannot provide?

226
00:17:35,135 --> 00:17:37,269
Silence, then.

227
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:38,604
Next time you vex Doctore,

228
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:40,172
you'll find my
tongue of a similar fashion.

229
00:17:40,172 --> 00:17:41,907
Your company here was not my intent.

230
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:46,178
Yet here I stand beside you,
my cock soaking in the same shit.

231
00:17:46,178 --> 00:17:48,213
Apologies.

232
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:50,950
Well, that's all?

233
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,319
No reason behind it,

234
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,687
no glimpse int the fevered brain

235
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,989
of what the fuck are you doing?

236
00:17:56,989 --> 00:17:58,924
I seek only to please Batiatus.

237
00:17:58,924 --> 00:18:01,593
Pluto's asshole.

238
00:18:01,593 --> 00:18:03,529
The answer has no
balance with your actions.

239
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,800
He made a promise.

240
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,502
What could he offer a man who
seeks neither fame nor glory.

241
00:18:12,005 --> 00:18:13,706
My wife.

242
00:18:16,176 --> 00:18:19,411
Taken from me when I was
captured by the romans.

243
00:18:19,411 --> 00:18:21,647
I prevail in the arena,
and he will find her.

244
00:18:24,617 --> 00:18:25,718
Is she worth it?

245
00:18:28,355 --> 00:18:29,688
She's worth everything.

246
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:37,963
As is mine.

247
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:40,299
Two years here.

248
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:41,767
Pay my debts with the winnings.

249
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:43,702
Hold her in my arms again.

250
00:18:45,772 --> 00:18:48,440
Perhaps the smell will
have washed off by then.

251
00:18:55,382 --> 00:18:56,815
What name do you call her?

252
00:18:56,815 --> 00:18:57,775
Aurelia.

253
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:00,172
Yours?

254
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:03,022
Sura.

255
00:19:04,657 --> 00:19:05,407
So.

256
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:09,495
Buried up to your balls in garbage.

257
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:12,831
This part of your plan to get Sura back?

258
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:21,940
You'd waste your ration
cleaning a bit of cloth?

259
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:26,211
It bears meaning to me.

260
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:32,618
Gather.

261
00:19:36,189 --> 00:19:38,690
Your master's hand has been at work.

262
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,727
The pairings of the
Vulcanalia have been decided.

263
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,864
Crixus!

264
00:19:45,864 --> 00:19:48,767
The unbeaten Champion of Capua.

265
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:51,103
You will honor the House of Batiatus

266
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:53,305
by fighting in his Primus!

267
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:55,507
And who will challenge me, Doctore?

268
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,482
A man of skill and dedication.

269
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:06,819
His ability, his hard
work and his hunger

270
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:09,555
shall be rewarded.

271
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:11,156
Gnaeus!

272
00:20:14,394 --> 00:20:16,328
At last we meet brother.

273
00:20:17,464 --> 00:20:19,164
Don't die to quickly.

274
00:20:19,164 --> 00:20:19,914
Me?

275
00:20:22,068 --> 00:20:24,470
I will fuck your corpse.

276
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:27,873
With what cock?

277
00:20:30,877 --> 00:20:32,778
Ashur carries the remainder.

278
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:34,580
May the gods be with you!

279
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:38,484
One by one.

280
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:39,918
One by one you fucking cunts!

281
00:20:39,918 --> 00:20:41,286
Batiatus himself handed me this list..

282
00:20:41,286 --> 00:20:43,122
<i>Give it here, shit fuck.</i>

283
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:48,227
Savages.

284
00:20:52,132 --> 00:20:53,398
Fucking cock.

285
00:20:57,537 --> 00:20:58,770
Let me see it.

286
00:20:59,672 --> 00:21:01,740
Give it here.

287
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,243
Did you gain position?

288
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:06,645
As did you.

289
00:21:06,645 --> 00:21:11,150
We are set to fight each other,
at the start of the games.

290
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,819
The first match?!

291
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:16,555
The slot of the meek and insubstantial!

292
00:21:16,555 --> 00:21:17,789
We shall prove otherwise.

293
00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:19,358
To what aim?

294
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:21,660
The victor's purse won't
be more than half a coin.

295
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,728
So little?

296
00:21:22,728 --> 00:21:24,530
Not enough for either of our causes.

297
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,998
And for the Primus?

298
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:27,666
Considerably more.

299
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:31,036
I already bested Crixus once,
in the final test.

300
00:21:31,036 --> 00:21:32,604
Now I must fight my
way up through the dregs

301
00:21:32,604 --> 00:21:34,072
to face him again?

302
00:21:34,072 --> 00:21:35,140
Dregs am I?

303
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,876
You know my meaning.

304
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:38,977
If Batiatus hadn't stayed my hand,

305
00:21:38,977 --> 00:21:41,980
I would have parted his
brains from his skull.

306
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,616
There is no love lost
between myself and Crixus...

307
00:21:46,386 --> 00:21:49,054
But I caution, he's dangerous.

308
00:21:50,823 --> 00:21:52,691
A reputation built on what?

309
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:55,894
Facing men such as Gnaeus
and his little net?

310
00:21:55,894 --> 00:21:59,031
Crixus forged his reputation
against far worse.

311
00:21:59,031 --> 00:22:02,568
Demons, belched from the underworld.

312
00:22:02,568 --> 00:22:04,369
The gargan twins.

313
00:22:07,473 --> 00:22:09,208
Decimus and Tiberius.

314
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,410
Sons of a whore, raped by a jackal.

315
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,845
More beasts than men.

316
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:16,081
They terrorized the eastern
seaboard for many years,

317
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:18,150
<i>until their capture.</i>

318
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,484
They were cast into the arena to die.

319
00:22:19,484 --> 00:22:22,888
But instead flourished on
meals of bone and blood...

320
00:22:30,697 --> 00:22:33,799
<i>The bodies of stout men
left in their wake, half devoured.</i>

321
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:36,034
<i>No one dared face them willingly.</i>

322
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:37,436
<i>Except for one...</i>

323
00:22:37,436 --> 00:22:40,138
<i>Crixus! Champion of Capua!</i>

324
00:22:41,474 --> 00:22:44,977
<i>The blood flowed. The crowd roared.</i>

325
00:22:44,977 --> 00:22:47,379
<i>And the demons fell beneath
his sword...</i>

326
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:13,021
The sons of a jackal?

327
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,391
So they say.

328
00:23:18,227 --> 00:23:20,228
The story is a jest.

329
00:23:20,228 --> 00:23:23,331
Like Crixus himself.

330
00:23:23,331 --> 00:23:24,699
Did you hear this one?!

331
00:23:28,204 --> 00:23:30,572
One day, maybe you prove yourself.

332
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:33,742
Until then, you fight at dawn
with the rest of the shit whores.

333
00:24:00,136 --> 00:24:02,370
I keep pace with the mighty Spartacus.

334
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,772
Still place my worth among the dregs?

335
00:24:05,274 --> 00:24:06,241
I misspoke.

336
00:24:06,241 --> 00:24:08,176
A theme with you, is it not?

337
00:24:08,176 --> 00:24:10,045
I shall call you equal.

338
00:24:10,045 --> 00:24:12,714
More will need to be earned.

339
00:24:12,714 --> 00:24:14,683
It will be a good fight.

340
00:24:14,683 --> 00:24:17,018
May the gods see us both survive.

341
00:24:17,018 --> 00:24:19,287
There are many I would
see dead in this place.

342
00:24:19,287 --> 00:24:21,656
You are not among them though.

343
00:24:23,225 --> 00:24:25,060
You may not have a choice.

344
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,728
There is always a choice.

345
00:24:35,838 --> 00:24:37,739
That look gives me worry.

346
00:24:39,775 --> 00:24:41,443
Words I've heard often from my wife.

347
00:24:47,483 --> 00:24:50,251
Your net's aim is
remarkably true, Gnaeus.

348
00:24:52,955 --> 00:24:55,824
You strike an impressive figure.

349
00:24:55,824 --> 00:24:58,460
Battling that little wooden man.

350
00:25:00,496 --> 00:25:03,064
I long to see you in the arena.

351
00:25:03,064 --> 00:25:06,468
Among the men, there you are...

352
00:25:06,468 --> 00:25:08,870
With your fearsome net!

353
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:12,641
Like a young, wet girl.

354
00:25:13,943 --> 00:25:15,477
Fucking cunt!

355
00:25:25,788 --> 00:25:28,056
The sun has made Gnaeus mad.

356
00:25:28,056 --> 00:25:29,791
He charged like crazed goat.

357
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:31,493
I saw his eyes.

358
00:25:31,493 --> 00:25:32,994
They were wild with thirst.

359
00:25:34,463 --> 00:25:37,732
Barca! Kerza!

360
00:25:37,732 --> 00:25:40,635
Tend to Gnaeus.

361
00:25:40,635 --> 00:25:42,404
Back to work!

362
00:26:04,326 --> 00:26:05,293
Ashur.

363
00:26:08,497 --> 00:26:10,632
There is something
I want you to get for me.

364
00:26:10,632 --> 00:26:14,269
Whatever your needs, Ashur provides.

365
00:26:15,971 --> 00:26:19,274
Follow me, away from prying ears...

366
00:26:41,163 --> 00:26:43,364
I must make a point to
stop standing beside you.

367
00:26:45,668 --> 00:26:48,503
Gnaeus was of an unsteady nature.

368
00:26:48,503 --> 00:26:50,739
If your intent was to claim
Gnaeus' berth in the Primus,

369
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:52,741
you're a fool.

370
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:55,009
He served five years before
he was afforded the privilege.

371
00:26:58,347 --> 00:27:00,882
Sura cannot afford years.

372
00:27:00,882 --> 00:27:02,851
Nor your death,

373
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:03,918
which is surely your station

374
00:27:03,918 --> 00:27:05,754
if you face Crixus in the arena.

375
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:08,556
<i>Gladiators!</i>

376
00:27:08,556 --> 00:27:10,158
Your public has arrived.

377
00:27:10,158 --> 00:27:12,460
Dress quickly.

378
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,762
The reception begins.

379
00:27:26,642 --> 00:27:28,076
Crixus!

380
00:27:28,076 --> 00:27:31,079
Let good Mercato have a
closer look at your sword.

381
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:32,680
Dominus.

382
00:27:35,518 --> 00:27:40,188
The very blade used to strike
down Tiberius and Decimus.

383
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:44,726
If you were to bestow Capua
with the gift of a munus,

384
00:27:44,726 --> 00:27:47,562
what better means than securing Crixus?

385
00:27:47,562 --> 00:27:49,597
Along with a dozen or
so of my other offerings

386
00:27:49,597 --> 00:27:52,267
to round out the proceedings?

387
00:27:52,267 --> 00:27:54,936
I have been contemplating games
in honor of my good friend..

388
00:27:54,936 --> 00:27:56,504
Ashur!

389
00:27:56,504 --> 00:27:58,239
Good Mercato has set his
mind to a day of games.

390
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:00,208
Let us see his order
well filled... shall we?

391
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:04,946
Ahh, the dust and the heat,

392
00:28:04,946 --> 00:28:07,315
it worsens by the hour.

393
00:28:07,315 --> 00:28:09,484
I'd yet be in Rome if it
weren't for the games.

394
00:28:09,484 --> 00:28:11,085
You must promise
to visit while I'm here.

395
00:28:11,085 --> 00:28:13,588
My father's villa is beyond depressing.

396
00:28:13,588 --> 00:28:15,256
It's unfortunate your
husband couldn't join you.

397
00:28:15,256 --> 00:28:17,225
How fares the Legatus?

398
00:28:17,225 --> 00:28:19,160
In a mood.

399
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,562
Since his return from Thrace,

400
00:28:20,562 --> 00:28:22,664
the senate has become his mistress.

401
00:28:22,664 --> 00:28:24,499
Her demands on him are boundless.

402
00:28:24,499 --> 00:28:26,734
Men and their ambitions.

403
00:28:26,734 --> 00:28:27,735
You know they should learn to appreciate

404
00:28:27,735 --> 00:28:29,704
the finer things in life.

405
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:35,410
That necklace. I adore it.

406
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,477
Oh this?

407
00:28:36,477 --> 00:28:37,846
It's a trinket.

408
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:41,216
It calls to mind a piece I
had from Ramel one season.

409
00:28:41,216 --> 00:28:43,218
When emerald was still the fashion.

410
00:28:45,254 --> 00:28:48,289
I hear it's coming back around.

411
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:51,759
Oh. Perhaps I'll root mine out, then.

412
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:54,529
<i>Friends, old and new!</i>

413
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:57,198
Gratitude for honoring the
storied ludus of Batiatus

414
00:28:57,198 --> 00:28:59,467
with your presence this eve.

415
00:28:59,467 --> 00:29:04,072
Tomorrow's Vulcanalia promises
many glories in the arena.

416
00:29:04,072 --> 00:29:05,573
But tonight...

417
00:29:05,573 --> 00:29:09,477
May I present to you the finest
gladiators in all the Republic!

418
00:29:16,118 --> 00:29:17,318
Look!

419
00:29:17,318 --> 00:29:19,153
Touch!

420
00:29:19,153 --> 00:29:22,423
Feel the quality of the stock!

421
00:29:22,423 --> 00:29:24,926
Place your orders for any
of the men you covet!

422
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:29,163
Come! Don't be bashful, they won't bite!

423
00:29:30,366 --> 00:29:32,567
And if they do, a ten percent discount!

424
00:29:42,077 --> 00:29:45,146
The crowd fancies
our thracian, don't they?

425
00:29:45,146 --> 00:29:48,483
A curiosity, born of his
fortune against Solonius' men.

426
00:29:48,483 --> 00:29:51,419
Better curiosity than indifference!

427
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:52,987
Perhaps we could fuel this interest

428
00:29:52,987 --> 00:29:56,124
into a conflagration of coin...

429
00:29:56,124 --> 00:29:57,592
With Gnaeus of questionable skull,

430
00:29:57,592 --> 00:30:01,062
what make you of Spartacus
as replacement in our Primus?

431
00:30:01,062 --> 00:30:05,033
With respect Dominus,
the public seeks an honorable fight.

432
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:06,701
Spartacus is yet the animal.

433
00:30:08,704 --> 00:30:10,705
Um, well I'll think on.

434
00:30:10,705 --> 00:30:11,739
One day, though.

435
00:30:11,739 --> 00:30:14,208
A contest to be promoted...

436
00:30:19,014 --> 00:30:20,415
A moment alone.

437
00:30:20,415 --> 00:30:23,885
A rarity for a man with
such an adoring public, huh?

438
00:30:26,922 --> 00:30:28,456
To business, then.

439
00:30:28,456 --> 00:30:30,124
A difficult task on short notice, yet...

440
00:30:32,761 --> 00:30:34,062
Carried to completion.

441
00:30:42,471 --> 00:30:43,805
Cock fucker.

442
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:48,643
Your gaul is of a fine cut, is he not?

443
00:30:48,643 --> 00:30:51,546
None finer in all the Republic.

444
00:30:51,546 --> 00:30:53,715
Such a man...

445
00:30:58,721 --> 00:31:02,056
I tremble to see
him again at the arena...

446
00:31:02,056 --> 00:31:03,524
As do we all.

447
00:31:21,443 --> 00:31:21,776
The thracian yet lives?

448
00:31:21,776 --> 00:31:23,845
For now.

449
00:31:23,845 --> 00:31:27,215
Is there nothing
more of interest to see?

450
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:29,851
Well my husband will shortly
announce his Primus,

451
00:31:29,851 --> 00:31:32,053
and there's is ample wine...

452
00:31:32,053 --> 00:31:34,288
I fear it already beckons my sleep.

453
00:31:38,093 --> 00:31:41,162
Perhaps I'd best take leave.

454
00:31:41,162 --> 00:31:42,002
Course.

455
00:31:43,665 --> 00:31:48,002
Of course there is one thing
that I thought you might enjoy,

456
00:31:48,002 --> 00:31:51,305
its something of a much
more physical nature.

457
00:31:51,305 --> 00:31:52,305
You.

458
00:31:54,143 --> 00:31:55,243
Come with me.

459
00:32:23,972 --> 00:32:26,741
Five denarii says he doesn't
last another twenty strokes.

460
00:32:33,315 --> 00:32:36,384
I've never seen a
gladiator fuck before...

461
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,421
Look at the way he rams her!

462
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:45,760
Like an enraged bull!

463
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,795
A gladiator's virtues
extends well beyond

464
00:32:47,795 --> 00:32:50,698
the sands of the arena.

465
00:32:50,698 --> 00:32:54,102
As lovers, they are said
to be ravenous beasts.

466
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:55,536
You can touch.

467
00:33:00,275 --> 00:33:03,344
Oh, forgive me, Aurelia.

468
00:33:03,344 --> 00:33:05,947
They provide unimaginable pleasures..

469
00:33:20,195 --> 00:33:22,497
Can he do it again?

470
00:33:22,497 --> 00:33:23,865
Make him do it again!

471
00:33:26,802 --> 00:33:28,636
Proceed.

472
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:35,243
So, we are in agreement.

473
00:33:35,243 --> 00:33:36,611
Rabanus will meet Crixus.

474
00:33:36,611 --> 00:33:39,013
Move Hamilcar up to fill the void.

475
00:33:46,688 --> 00:33:49,757
I overheard Batiatus and
Doctore in conference.

476
00:33:49,757 --> 00:33:52,560
The Primus their intent.

477
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,762
The sardinian is to face Crixus.

478
00:33:57,799 --> 00:33:59,333
The news does not balance my cause.

479
00:34:06,408 --> 00:34:08,576
Whatever your thoughts, cast them out.

480
00:34:10,145 --> 00:34:12,246
<i>Good citizens!</i>

481
00:34:12,246 --> 00:34:13,848
You've enjoyed my food!

482
00:34:13,848 --> 00:34:15,650
My wine!

483
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,886
The aphrodisiac presence
of my beautiful wife!

484
00:34:18,886 --> 00:34:21,956
Now marvel at the announcing
of tomorrow's Primus!

485
00:34:21,956 --> 00:34:26,093
Crixus, the Champion of Capua,

486
00:34:26,093 --> 00:34:28,629
will stride across the sands and face..

487
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:36,003
Spartacus!

488
00:34:37,072 --> 00:34:38,806
No! Let them fight!

489
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:51,852
Enough!

490
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,161
I will take your fucking heart!

491
00:35:00,161 --> 00:35:01,529
Come and take it, coward!

492
00:35:10,672 --> 00:35:11,672
Haa!

493
00:35:12,908 --> 00:35:16,711
See their hatred,
burning beyond control!

494
00:35:16,711 --> 00:35:17,912
Huh?

495
00:35:17,912 --> 00:35:19,647
This was merely a taste!

496
00:35:19,647 --> 00:35:24,752
Tomorrow they will settle
this grudge in the arena!

497
00:35:29,858 --> 00:35:34,061
Crixus, the undefeated!

498
00:35:34,061 --> 00:35:39,634
Spartacus, the dog who defies death!

499
00:35:39,634 --> 00:35:42,737
A fight for the ages!

500
00:35:42,737 --> 00:35:45,239
Glory to Capua!

501
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,440
Glory to Rome!

502
00:36:04,092 --> 00:36:07,061
The reception nearly ruined,
and what is his punishment?

503
00:36:07,061 --> 00:36:08,396
The fucking Primus!

504
00:36:08,396 --> 00:36:11,399
You heard the crowd.
I made the best of a situation.

505
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:14,602
The thracian has yet to stand
a single match as gladiator.

506
00:36:14,602 --> 00:36:16,971
Why leap him ahead of all
others to face Crixus?

507
00:36:16,971 --> 00:36:19,473
Because of what he possesses.

508
00:36:19,473 --> 00:36:21,375
The public's interest.

509
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:22,977
They stroke a rabid dog.

510
00:36:22,977 --> 00:36:23,978
Spartacus has struck a chord.

511
00:36:23,978 --> 00:36:26,280
I intend to maximize its profit.

512
00:36:27,916 --> 00:36:30,985
He's unpredictable,
he has no regard for rules

513
00:36:30,985 --> 00:36:32,920
or for honor and if something
happens to Crixus...

514
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,822
He poses no threat to Crixus.

515
00:36:34,822 --> 00:36:35,956
He is but a novelty.

516
00:36:35,956 --> 00:36:38,459
To be used and
discarded after a purpose.

517
00:36:38,459 --> 00:36:40,828
Fucking god's cock
is there no wine left!

518
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:44,865
Well, what are you standing there for,

519
00:36:44,865 --> 00:36:46,233
go and get some fucking wine.

520
00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:02,316
Apologies.

521
00:37:02,316 --> 00:37:03,317
I did not mean to startle.

522
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:14,428
When we spoke last, I meant no offense.

523
00:37:14,428 --> 00:37:17,598
I am practiced with sword not words.

524
00:37:17,598 --> 00:37:19,800
If Domina discovers I
dropped the last jug...

525
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,569
Hand me the pieces.

526
00:37:21,569 --> 00:37:22,737
I'll see them over the cliff.

527
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,185
Wait.

528
00:37:43,992 --> 00:37:47,862
Perhaps this gift will
explain where words fail.

529
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:52,700
Please.

530
00:38:24,132 --> 00:38:26,934
I'm trying to decide.

531
00:38:26,934 --> 00:38:28,903
Upon what?

532
00:38:28,903 --> 00:38:32,273
Congratulations or condolences.

533
00:38:32,273 --> 00:38:34,208
You may have bested Crixus
once by tripping him

534
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:37,011
with that bit of cloth,

535
00:38:37,011 --> 00:38:39,547
but to face him in the arena...

536
00:38:39,547 --> 00:38:42,683
I believe his reputation inflated.

537
00:38:42,683 --> 00:38:46,220
Tomorrow I shall prove it so.

538
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,989
Next he'll boast he can
defeat Theokoles himself.

539
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:51,192
Perhaps.

540
00:38:51,192 --> 00:38:52,726
If I knew the man.

541
00:38:54,529 --> 00:38:56,430
Theokoles.

542
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,898
The shadow of death.

543
00:38:57,898 --> 00:39:00,434
He speaks so brazenly of the arena,

544
00:39:00,434 --> 00:39:02,670
he knows nothing of its history.

545
00:39:05,707 --> 00:39:07,975
<i>Theokoles is no man, thracian.</i>

546
00:39:10,812 --> 00:39:12,680
<i>He is something else entirely...</i>

547
00:39:14,816 --> 00:39:18,452
<i>They say he stand over ten feet tall.</i>

548
00:39:18,452 --> 00:39:22,256
<i>The very ground trembles at his feet.</i>

549
00:39:22,256 --> 00:39:25,860
<i>His shadow eclipsing the sun.</i>

550
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:29,930
<i>Most men fall dead at the
sight of the giant.</i>

551
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,733
<i>They are the fortunate ones.</i>

552
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,210
My father tells of a munus in which

553
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,845
the shadow fought over a hundred men.

554
00:39:47,883 --> 00:39:49,216
Not one survived.

555
00:39:52,654 --> 00:39:55,823
A tale, to frighten children.

556
00:39:57,792 --> 00:40:00,928
Theokoles is no legend.

557
00:40:00,928 --> 00:40:02,062
Before he retired from the arena,

558
00:40:02,062 --> 00:40:05,900
only one man ever faced him and lived.

559
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,269
And he breathes among us,

560
00:40:08,269 --> 00:40:10,471
his whip ever at our backs.

561
00:40:12,908 --> 00:40:16,243
Now is not the hour for idle talk.

562
00:40:16,243 --> 00:40:19,847
Tomorrow you step into the arena.

563
00:40:19,847 --> 00:40:23,083
Many for the first time.

564
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:25,386
For some, perhaps the last.

565
00:40:45,006 --> 00:40:47,141
They cheer for blood.

566
00:40:47,141 --> 00:40:48,375
And they shall have it.

567
00:40:53,214 --> 00:40:55,916
May the gods bring you fortune,
as they did me this morning.

568
00:40:59,421 --> 00:41:00,721
Sura believed in the gods.

569
00:41:03,692 --> 00:41:06,393
And when the romans took her,

570
00:41:06,393 --> 00:41:09,997
not one descended from
the heavens to intervene.

571
00:41:12,767 --> 00:41:15,469
I shall correct their mistake presently.

572
00:41:20,909 --> 00:41:22,443
I believe you will.

573
00:41:31,653 --> 00:41:33,387
The crowd favors your offerings.

574
00:41:33,387 --> 00:41:35,356
Yes, a fine showing all around.

575
00:41:35,356 --> 00:41:37,424
You honor our fair city, Batiatus.

576
00:41:37,424 --> 00:41:39,226
The honor is mine, magistrate.

577
00:41:39,226 --> 00:41:41,428
Truth told, I feared
the event would pass

578
00:41:41,428 --> 00:41:43,731
without anything of note this year.

579
00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:45,199
Its very difficult to
procure men of worth

580
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:48,002
for these minor games.

581
00:41:48,002 --> 00:41:51,538
Good Solonius was already taken
with loftier engagements.

582
00:41:51,538 --> 00:41:54,241
Perhaps Solonius will
be available next year.

583
00:41:54,241 --> 00:41:56,510
One can but pray.

584
00:42:00,315 --> 00:42:02,750
Perhaps I was wrong to
return absent the rain.

585
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,721
Some water perhaps.

586
00:42:07,721 --> 00:42:09,556
Or maybe some wine.

587
00:42:09,556 --> 00:42:12,860
Uhh, the thought churns the stomach.

588
00:42:14,863 --> 00:42:19,400
Your company last night
yet astounds the senses.

589
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,401
Too much?

590
00:42:20,401 --> 00:42:23,303
Of wine, definitely.

591
00:42:23,303 --> 00:42:25,706
Of other interests...

592
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:29,543
I think the surface barely scratched.

593
00:42:29,543 --> 00:42:34,348
Some water then,
to slake your current thirst.

594
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,123
Here we go, then.

595
00:42:46,261 --> 00:42:48,429
Good citizens of Capua!

596
00:42:48,429 --> 00:42:52,833
It is my great honor to
introduce to you the Primus

597
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:55,569
of Quintus Lentulus Batiatus!

598
00:43:08,149 --> 00:43:10,250
Enter Thraex!

599
00:43:17,025 --> 00:43:19,626
Behold Spartacus!

600
00:43:19,626 --> 00:43:22,730
<i>Spartacus! Spartacus!</i>

601
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:24,264
<i>Spartacus! Spartacus!</i>

602
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:29,069
Renowned for his magnificent victory

603
00:43:29,069 --> 00:43:31,972
at the games of senator Albinius!

604
00:43:31,972 --> 00:43:33,841
Where he single handedly slaughtered

605
00:43:33,841 --> 00:43:36,276
four of Solonius' gladiators!

606
00:43:36,276 --> 00:43:38,078
Four!

607
00:43:42,617 --> 00:43:44,051
Enter Murmillo!

608
00:43:58,066 --> 00:44:01,135
The marvel before
you needs no introduction!

609
00:44:02,871 --> 00:44:04,838
He's known by his sword!

610
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:07,141
By his shield! By his glory!

611
00:44:12,881 --> 00:44:14,948
Crixus!

612
00:44:14,948 --> 00:44:17,117
The Champion of Capua!

613
00:44:24,692 --> 00:44:27,261
Finally, Crixus!

614
00:44:29,397 --> 00:44:31,665
Look how his form catches the sun!

615
00:44:34,435 --> 00:44:35,155
Capua!

616
00:44:46,881 --> 00:44:47,601
Capua!

617
00:44:52,954 --> 00:44:57,324
In honor of the name Batiatus
and the sacred Vulcanalia...

618
00:45:14,475 --> 00:45:15,676
You had not yet finished the oration

619
00:45:15,676 --> 00:45:17,311
and yet the thracian attacks!?!

620
00:45:18,613 --> 00:45:20,013
Was that not supposed to happen?

621
00:45:20,013 --> 00:45:22,216
No, it was not.

622
00:45:22,216 --> 00:45:24,351
How exciting...

623
00:46:25,246 --> 00:46:27,648
Is that all the thracian is capable of?

624
00:46:27,648 --> 00:46:30,117
After what he did against Solonius' men,

625
00:46:30,117 --> 00:46:32,152
I had hoped for more.

626
00:47:39,587 --> 00:47:41,388
Capua!

627
00:47:43,157 --> 00:47:44,858
Shall I begin!?!

628
00:49:25,259 --> 00:49:27,127
Now you die, thracian.

629
00:49:28,763 --> 00:49:30,163
Kill. Kill.

630
00:49:30,163 --> 00:49:32,232
Kill, kill.

631
00:49:35,503 --> 00:49:37,437
Kill, kill!

632
00:50:45,773 --> 00:50:49,109
Spartacus fought well!

633
00:50:53,981 --> 00:50:55,515
Let him live to fight another day!

634
00:51:10,965 --> 00:51:14,100
A sour bite to end the meal.

635
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,236
Apologies.

636
00:51:16,236 --> 00:51:18,605
Yet Spartacus was of some cost to me...

637
00:51:21,242 --> 00:51:22,609
You've already lost the crowd.

638
00:51:30,351 --> 00:51:31,484
He lives?

639
00:51:34,255 --> 00:51:35,855
How disappointing.

640
00:52:14,662 --> 00:52:17,197
His reputation is well earned.

641
00:52:17,197 --> 00:52:19,666
My blade could find no weakness.

642
00:52:25,139 --> 00:52:28,508
And yet... it was there.

643
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:34,781
At least ten points where you
could have seized advantage.

644
00:52:35,816 --> 00:52:37,584
You needed more training.

645
00:52:41,889 --> 00:52:43,957
I shall train harder then.

646
00:52:45,893 --> 00:52:46,643
No.

647
00:52:49,196 --> 00:52:50,797
It is too late for such things.

648
00:52:53,510 --> 00:59:55,110

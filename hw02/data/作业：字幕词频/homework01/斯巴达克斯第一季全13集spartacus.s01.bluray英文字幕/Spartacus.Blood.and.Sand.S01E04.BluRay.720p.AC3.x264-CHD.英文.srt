1
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,925
Do you think me a fool?

2
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:48,059
No, Dominus.

3
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,694
<i>Yet you dishonor me.</i>

4
00:00:49,694 --> 00:00:52,597
An agreement reached, an oath sworn!

5
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:55,633
<i>You would submit to gladiatorial
training.</i>

6
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:57,368
<i>Call me master,</i>

7
00:00:57,368 --> 00:00:59,571
attend to the rules!

8
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:02,807
In return, I would search for

9
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:04,576
your precious wife!

10
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:08,379
<i>But your haste bested you.</i>

11
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:10,682
Defying Doctore, maneuvering to usurp Gnaeus

12
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:12,750
to face Crixus in the arena.

13
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,186
Your first contest!

14
00:01:15,186 --> 00:01:16,688
With Crixus!

15
00:01:16,688 --> 00:01:18,756
The champion of fucking Capua!

16
00:01:18,756 --> 00:01:20,391
I realize the mistake in it.

17
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:21,559
<i>Mistake?</i>

18
00:01:25,798 --> 00:01:28,600
Fuck, you had the crowd!

19
00:01:30,536 --> 00:01:32,103
You survived execution

20
00:01:32,103 --> 00:01:34,739
against four of Solonius' men!

21
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:36,908
Your name was on every tongue!

22
00:01:36,908 --> 00:01:39,544
Now after your showing with Crixus,

23
00:01:39,544 --> 00:01:41,479
it's spoken of with contempt!

24
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:44,282
Your little mistake makes reunion

25
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:46,751
with your wife problematic.

26
00:01:46,751 --> 00:01:48,486
You have knowledge of her?

27
00:01:52,057 --> 00:01:53,625
The syrian gable I sold her to

28
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,194
was last noted heading north.

29
00:01:56,194 --> 00:01:58,029
We've yet to divine their destination.

30
00:01:58,029 --> 00:02:00,031
You must keep searching for her.

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,901
You shit on honorable agreements

32
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:06,404
and press for fresh demands?

33
00:02:06,404 --> 00:02:07,872
Tell me, thracian,

34
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:10,608
how will you pay for her release if found?

35
00:02:10,608 --> 00:02:12,810
Her transport?

36
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,812
Do you shoot magic coins out of your ass?

37
00:02:14,812 --> 00:02:17,081
If so, squat and produce!

38
00:02:17,081 --> 00:02:18,750
I shall fight in the arena, my winnings...

39
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,085
No one wishes to see you fight!

40
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:25,890
The crowd's favor,
like the wind, is fleeting.

41
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,226
Their interest in you has blown out.

42
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:36,901
There must be a way for me to fight.

43
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:38,836
Only one.

44
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:40,638
In a place where you needn't follow rules,

45
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:41,806
because none exist.

46
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:48,846
The pits of the underworld.

47
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:50,048
Fight there and survive,

48
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:52,483
and you will fill both our hands with coin.

49
00:02:52,483 --> 00:02:53,203
And...

50
00:02:54,887 --> 00:02:57,455
You may yet feel your wife's touch again.

51
00:03:19,144 --> 00:03:20,378
Thracian bitch.

52
00:03:20,378 --> 00:03:21,546
<i>Barca! Release!</i>

53
00:03:26,552 --> 00:03:28,820
I think your wife's binding
should remain here.

54
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,388
Where you're going, you might lose it.

55
00:03:30,388 --> 00:03:31,723
Along with an arm.

56
00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:44,535
Finish preparing him.

57
00:03:54,446 --> 00:03:56,180
A word, Dominus?

58
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,815
If hastened.

59
00:03:57,815 --> 00:04:00,985
The walls spread rumor of the pits.

60
00:04:00,985 --> 00:04:02,420
You find objection to this course?

61
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,155
It is a place of pain and suffering,

62
00:04:04,155 --> 00:04:06,124
beasts dying without honor.

63
00:04:06,124 --> 00:04:07,125
Your father would never have...

64
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,427
The decision is made!

65
00:04:09,427 --> 00:04:11,996
If a beast cannot be tamed,
it must be unleashed.

66
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:22,373
If the rains ever return,

67
00:04:22,373 --> 00:04:24,976
I shall soak in a bath for a week.

68
00:04:27,346 --> 00:04:28,446
Ahh, perfume.

69
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:36,187
Only a few drops remain, Domina.

70
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:40,191
I shall save them for Jupiter.

71
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,860
I will douse his altar and pray

72
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,695
that the scent sparks a deluge.

73
00:04:46,465 --> 00:04:49,133
Have you seen my dagger? It eludes me.

74
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:51,035
What purpose requires it?

75
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:53,671
I've divined an additional
stream of revenue.

76
00:04:55,607 --> 00:04:57,708
One that will provide us a proper bath.

77
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:01,612
And this stream,

78
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:03,281
it flows from what orifice?

79
00:05:05,484 --> 00:05:06,584
The pits.

80
00:05:09,388 --> 00:05:10,488
The pits.

81
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:15,893
Look, Crixus remains the
single draw of the ludus.

82
00:05:15,893 --> 00:05:18,996
Of the new recruits,
Varro is the only man of promise.

83
00:05:18,996 --> 00:05:21,365
Spartacus and Kerza prove
worthless in the arena.

84
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:22,967
So I fight them both
tonight where they may yet

85
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:24,001
fill our purse.

86
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:25,169
Quintus.

87
00:05:26,905 --> 00:05:28,873
Dispatching the thracian brings me relief.

88
00:05:28,873 --> 00:05:32,176
You descending into the pits does not.

89
00:05:32,176 --> 00:05:34,245
It stains the name, and threatens the body.

90
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:35,613
My body will be well protected.

91
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:38,082
Barca looms over it, ready to break bone

92
00:05:38,082 --> 00:05:40,885
at the slightest provocation.

93
00:05:40,885 --> 00:05:42,920
Inform Barca that if you return scathed,

94
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,857
I'll have his cock in a jar.

95
00:05:45,857 --> 00:05:47,859
The message will be dutifully delivered.

96
00:05:50,662 --> 00:05:52,763
Give Crixus a woman tonight.

97
00:05:52,763 --> 00:05:54,732
<i>Motivation to the others
that success brings</i>

98
00:05:54,732 --> 00:05:56,300
decoration in many forms.

99
00:05:58,237 --> 00:05:59,770
I'll see him well satisfied.

100
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:25,196
<i>Keep moving you fuck!</i>

101
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,433
Where do they take him?

102
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:36,340
To the underworld, where he belongs.

103
00:06:37,809 --> 00:06:38,910
Back to training!

104
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:47,518
Tell me I don't look like I have been shit

105
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:49,453
from a boar's ass like you.

106
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,027
I am not dying in the pits.

107
00:06:58,096 --> 00:06:59,764
I'll show these fucking cunts my cock

108
00:06:59,764 --> 00:07:01,299
was forged in vulcan's flames.

109
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:03,434
I will fuck them all!

110
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:25,656
<i>Tear his ass open!</i>

111
00:07:25,656 --> 00:07:26,991
<i>Rip his head off!</i>

112
00:07:28,527 --> 00:07:31,329
Get up, get up, you useless...

113
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:32,496
Shit.

114
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:17,441
Shit!

115
00:08:26,351 --> 00:08:27,451
Ovidius approaches.

116
00:08:30,155 --> 00:08:32,790
Ovidius, good to lay eyes!

117
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,192
I had expected them laid earlier.

118
00:08:35,192 --> 00:08:37,695
Our agreement calls for
repayment of your debt

119
00:08:37,695 --> 00:08:39,430
<i>plus thirty percent, to be delivered</i>

120
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,699
<i>the day after the games of the
Vulcanalia.</i>

121
00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:43,434
Yet I find you here,

122
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:45,803
wagering coin still owed.

123
00:08:45,803 --> 00:08:47,972
You'll be first to receive
what is due, I assure you.

124
00:08:47,972 --> 00:08:49,874
Words spewed by Janus,

125
00:08:49,874 --> 00:08:52,343
from both sides of his face.

126
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:55,312
You'll be repaid soon enough.

127
00:08:56,848 --> 00:08:59,050
Unless you'd care to press the matter?

128
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,889
At your convenience then.

129
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:06,824
<i>Until such time,</i>

130
00:09:06,824 --> 00:09:08,793
the points still accrue.

131
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,467
Ass eating shit.

132
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:18,669
Speak to me such again,
I will accrue your fucking head.

133
00:09:22,707 --> 00:09:25,142
Ixion, victor!

134
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:31,315
You want to face me?

135
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:05,983
May the gods fare you better, thracian.

136
00:10:07,052 --> 00:10:08,319
For both our sakes.

137
00:10:15,327 --> 00:10:17,828
<i>Your neck is bare of my gift.</i>

138
00:10:17,828 --> 00:10:18,548
It is.

139
00:10:19,898 --> 00:10:21,732
You did not favor it, then?

140
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:23,100
The necklace I gave you?

141
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,268
Lower your voice.

142
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:29,507
Your gift, I cannot accept it.

143
00:10:34,045 --> 00:10:35,279
Pardon my mistake.

144
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,914
You must understand, if Domina...

145
00:10:36,914 --> 00:10:38,516
You've made your intention clear.

146
00:10:52,797 --> 00:10:54,398
Does it excite you?

147
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:57,935
To know that your very footsteps

148
00:10:57,935 --> 00:10:59,770
moisten my thighs?

149
00:11:01,173 --> 00:11:02,973
I would have them dripping even more.

150
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:08,345
Well draw closer and make it so.

151
00:11:15,787 --> 00:11:17,054
What are you clutching?

152
00:11:19,858 --> 00:11:20,958
Show me.

153
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:29,934
A humble gift.

154
00:11:32,637 --> 00:11:33,737
For a goddess.

155
00:11:36,141 --> 00:11:37,241
Put it on.

156
00:11:49,387 --> 00:11:50,654
Does it please you?

157
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:57,695
Yes.

158
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,769
Witness the captive beasts,

159
00:12:39,904 --> 00:12:43,040
<i>quenching our thirst with blood!</i>

160
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,976
Set to die in the pits...

161
00:12:47,245 --> 00:12:50,180
<i>Payment for their offensive births!</i>

162
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:53,384
Let death descend anew!

163
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,688
Behold, Myrmex!

164
00:13:00,892 --> 00:13:03,794
Behold, Spartacus!

165
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:10,334
The crowd does not seem to favor him.

166
00:13:10,334 --> 00:13:12,770
Why would they,
after his showing in the arena?

167
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,171
<i>What weapons</i>

168
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:16,206
shall the gods bless them with?

169
00:13:16,206 --> 00:13:18,075
Or curse them

170
00:13:18,075 --> 00:13:20,744
with empty hands!

171
00:13:20,744 --> 00:13:21,912
Choose your fate!

172
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:33,190
Myrmex draws sphairai!

173
00:13:44,402 --> 00:13:48,138
Spartacus draws caestus!

174
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,117
Myrmex has the advantage.

175
00:14:01,853 --> 00:14:03,620
Thank you for the fucking obvious.

176
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,057
We have but a single rule!

177
00:14:07,057 --> 00:14:08,225
Only one survives!

178
00:14:09,728 --> 00:14:12,796
<i>Mongrel on mongrel,</i>

179
00:14:12,796 --> 00:14:15,099
till Charon arrives!

180
00:14:17,635 --> 00:14:19,336
What do you make of the odds?

181
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:21,538
Four to one against our man.

182
00:14:21,538 --> 00:14:22,706
Maybe five.

183
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:25,843
Place ten denarii on Spartacus.

184
00:14:25,843 --> 00:14:27,344
And pray for ample return.

185
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:28,512
Dominus.

186
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,791
Do something!

187
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:49,860
Spartacus! Victor!

188
00:15:53,798 --> 00:15:56,667
Give him a moment's rest,
then fight him again.

189
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:20,991
You're hurt.

190
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:24,562
I'm all right.

191
00:16:26,464 --> 00:16:29,133
You push yourself too far.

192
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:31,001
And yet I live.

193
00:16:31,001 --> 00:16:33,070
<i>For how long?</i>

194
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,606
As long as it takes.

195
00:16:35,606 --> 00:16:37,374
Then kill them all.

196
00:16:53,124 --> 00:16:56,293
Do you plan to return to the pits?

197
00:16:56,293 --> 00:16:58,295
They fill our hands with coin...

198
00:16:59,664 --> 00:17:01,599
With yet more to be mined.

199
00:17:03,702 --> 00:17:05,636
And what when the shaft caves in on you?

200
00:17:05,636 --> 00:17:06,804
What then?

201
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:09,740
You know the law, without an heir

202
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,775
I'd be forced to marry another.

203
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:13,644
Is that what you want?
Someone else's hands upon me?

204
00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:16,947
I want everything!

205
00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:21,719
Yet can afford nothing.

206
00:17:25,123 --> 00:17:27,057
My concerns only with you, Quintus.

207
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:32,129
If you're lost, my reason for breath

208
00:17:32,129 --> 00:17:34,431
would surely follow.

209
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:37,134
I remain firmly rooted,
banish it from thought.

210
00:17:38,837 --> 00:17:40,437
When Spartacus ends,
so does my time in the pits.

211
00:17:40,437 --> 00:17:42,773
Till then, his victories swell our purse.

212
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:50,481
Which you deflate with new purchases.

213
00:17:50,481 --> 00:17:52,516
This simple thing?

214
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:54,184
Its rediscovery today pleased me.

215
00:17:54,184 --> 00:17:56,220
<i>It was my mother's, lost amongst her
things.</i>

216
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,223
A woman of modest taste, sorely missed.

217
00:17:59,223 --> 00:18:01,058
Perhaps we should return
the emerald necklace

218
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:03,427
we bought from Ramel.

219
00:18:03,427 --> 00:18:05,162
Well, it was excessive,

220
00:18:05,162 --> 00:18:07,564
and if the coin will help speed
you from the pits I'd be...

221
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:09,500
Keep them both.

222
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,169
I will not have my wife return jewelry.

223
00:18:16,608 --> 00:18:18,842
I should wash, I smell of death.

224
00:18:18,842 --> 00:18:20,744
No, you smell like a man.

225
00:18:52,811 --> 00:18:53,911
You live.

226
00:18:56,314 --> 00:18:57,915
I told you he would.

227
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:00,451
What of Kerza?

228
00:19:02,587 --> 00:19:03,427
Fallen,

229
00:19:04,923 --> 00:19:06,190
never to rise whole.

230
00:19:10,161 --> 00:19:13,197
This is where gladiators sleep.

231
00:19:13,197 --> 00:19:14,965
Not dogs.

232
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:16,133
Hold your tongue.

233
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:20,371
He stays,

234
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:22,473
he wakes beside Kerza in the afterlife.

235
00:19:44,963 --> 00:19:46,397
Spartacus...

236
00:19:46,397 --> 00:19:49,400
Pay no mind to those inbred fucks.

237
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,902
They speak the truth.

238
00:19:51,902 --> 00:19:53,370
I am no longer a gladiator.

239
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,139
You are still a man.

240
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:56,206
Am I?

241
00:19:56,206 --> 00:19:58,342
<i>One deserving respect.</i>

242
00:19:58,342 --> 00:19:59,676
Though I'll grant the pits could force

243
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:01,678
Jupiter himself to doubt his cock.

244
00:20:03,047 --> 00:20:04,548
What do you know of the pits?

245
00:20:04,548 --> 00:20:05,628
Too much.

246
00:20:07,752 --> 00:20:09,887
I wagered coin there at a time.

247
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:12,723
You were of the crowd?

248
00:20:12,723 --> 00:20:13,891
Howling for blood?

249
00:20:16,628 --> 00:20:18,562
Pride does not follow the statement.

250
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:25,469
These fights, Spartacus, they're...

251
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:27,438
They're different from the arena.

252
00:20:27,438 --> 00:20:30,741
<i>I've seen them twist the mind,</i>

253
00:20:30,741 --> 00:20:32,476
<i>turning men into beasts...</i>

254
00:20:33,878 --> 00:20:36,680
Their senses flown.

255
00:20:42,387 --> 00:20:43,487
Sleep, then.

256
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:47,658
And dream of better days.

257
00:21:04,576 --> 00:21:06,877
Would you have me bake in
the sun or offer a price?

258
00:21:10,248 --> 00:21:11,782
Fourteen denarii.

259
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:13,417
Fourteen?

260
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:15,486
That's half of what I paid not days ago.

261
00:21:15,486 --> 00:21:18,021
Used gems fail to command full value.

262
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:19,122
Oh.

263
00:21:19,122 --> 00:21:21,225
Oh, in the business of jewelry, perhaps.

264
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:27,865
A beautiful piece.

265
00:21:27,865 --> 00:21:29,967
Allow me to buy from you.

266
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:32,836
At full price.

267
00:21:32,836 --> 00:21:35,639
You have a woman in mind who
might favor it, Solonius?

268
00:21:36,841 --> 00:21:38,575
Indeed.

269
00:21:38,575 --> 00:21:39,910
She stands before me.

270
00:21:42,981 --> 00:21:44,081
A vision.

271
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,084
Take it,

272
00:21:47,084 --> 00:21:49,086
and keep your emeralds.

273
00:21:49,086 --> 00:21:51,722
The thought of them against
your skin warms mine.

274
00:21:53,491 --> 00:21:56,426
Perhaps you mistake the heat of the sun.

275
00:21:56,426 --> 00:21:58,529
I'll have your offer, Ramel.

276
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:00,030
Pride.

277
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,566
Always part of your considerable attraction.

278
00:22:02,566 --> 00:22:05,002
A trait which yet endears me to my husband.

279
00:22:06,271 --> 00:22:08,171
How is he fairing these days?

280
00:22:08,171 --> 00:22:10,307
Beloved Ovidius mentioned something

281
00:22:10,307 --> 00:22:12,643
about fighting his men in the pits.

282
00:22:15,847 --> 00:22:17,714
Oh, it's a temporary measure.

283
00:22:17,714 --> 00:22:19,149
Oh, to be sure.

284
00:22:30,495 --> 00:22:31,595
With honor.

285
00:22:35,633 --> 00:22:36,733
Fourteen denarii.

286
00:22:38,002 --> 00:22:40,103
May the gods shrivel your cock.

287
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:49,980
Study the flaws of your opponent.

288
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,686
<i>Strike with your mind as well as your
sword.</i>

289
00:22:56,955 --> 00:22:59,790
Fail to use your wits in the arena...

290
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,960
And risk tumbling after Spartacus

291
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,394
<i>into the pits.</i>

292
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:10,634
<i>The man is no base humor to be laughed
at.</i>

293
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,304
He is a tale of caution.

294
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:18,542
Ponder on that

295
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:21,578
<i>while you fill your bellies.</i>

296
00:23:21,578 --> 00:23:22,746
Eat!

297
00:23:34,525 --> 00:23:36,360
A little porridge, and some water.

298
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,797
It's just a sip, but,
you know, the drought...

299
00:23:40,797 --> 00:23:43,000
Pietros!

300
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,334
<i>Get away from him!</i>

301
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,670
Thank you.

302
00:23:54,445 --> 00:23:56,246
Your boy fancy the thracian, does he?

303
00:23:58,116 --> 00:23:59,883
My cock keeps him well filled.

304
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,354
The Beast of Carthage!

305
00:24:04,354 --> 00:24:06,990
I always wondered how you acquired the name.

306
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,361
If you have words of purpose, speak them.

307
00:24:11,361 --> 00:24:15,165
I was merely curious, Crixus.

308
00:24:15,165 --> 00:24:17,367
The gift I procured for you,

309
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:19,102
did it satisfy its intent?

310
00:24:19,102 --> 00:24:20,904
Gift?

311
00:24:20,904 --> 00:24:22,639
An opal necklace, of the finest...

312
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:25,475
Your tongue rattles too
freely in your mouth!

313
00:24:25,475 --> 00:24:28,645
Secure it, or it will join
that useless leg of yours.

314
00:24:31,716 --> 00:24:32,916
Apologies.

315
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,351
The question was born of goodwill,

316
00:24:34,351 --> 00:24:36,153
I assure you.

317
00:24:36,153 --> 00:24:38,689
Well you can stick your
good will in your ass.

318
00:24:40,024 --> 00:24:42,359
What necklace does the shit speak of?

319
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:44,294
It's nothing, best forgotten.

320
00:24:44,294 --> 00:24:45,862
You mad fuck.

321
00:24:45,862 --> 00:24:48,899
A trinket for Lucretia's pet, wasn't it?

322
00:24:48,899 --> 00:24:50,467
Rest your mind.

323
00:24:50,467 --> 00:24:53,170
I am of no interest to Naevia.

324
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:56,373
Nor her to you, if you value your cock

325
00:24:56,373 --> 00:24:58,241
attached to your balls.

326
00:24:58,241 --> 00:25:00,043
Barca!

327
00:25:00,043 --> 00:25:01,311
<i>See to Spartacus.</i>

328
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:03,647
I want him ready to fight
before the sun falls.

329
00:25:03,647 --> 00:25:04,815
<i>Yes, Dominus!</i>

330
00:25:07,785 --> 00:25:10,587
Rise, dog.

331
00:25:10,587 --> 00:25:11,988
More death awaits.

332
00:25:41,352 --> 00:25:42,452
Fuck!

333
00:25:53,898 --> 00:25:54,898
He's finished.

334
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:06,586
That's how you send a dog to the afterlife!

335
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:17,931
Spartacus, victor!

336
00:27:40,788 --> 00:27:42,388
<i>The odds soar in Spartacus' favor.</i>

337
00:27:42,388 --> 00:27:43,957
They believe he's unbeatable.

338
00:27:43,957 --> 00:27:46,659
<i>A dead man whose soul refuses
to leave its body.</i>

339
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:48,895
Spartacus has no soul.

340
00:27:48,895 --> 00:27:51,297
<i>It resides in the heart of another.</i>

341
00:27:51,297 --> 00:27:54,300
Prepare yourself, you fight Mytilus next.

342
00:28:15,055 --> 00:28:17,257
Crixus, you are summoned.

343
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,310
Thank you.

344
00:28:41,282 --> 00:28:42,382
Wait.

345
00:28:45,953 --> 00:28:47,520
Domina will grow impatient.

346
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,490
You know the urgency of her desires.

347
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:53,293
She did not summon you.

348
00:28:53,293 --> 00:28:54,961
Then why am I here?

349
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,431
The necklace,

350
00:28:58,431 --> 00:29:00,967
you purchased it for me?

351
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:02,669
As I've said.

352
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:04,804
Then why does it grace the neck of Domina?

353
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:10,143
The mind of a woman!

354
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:13,146
You deflect a gesture only
to question where it lands.

355
00:29:13,146 --> 00:29:15,682
Your words were I cannot accept this.

356
00:29:15,682 --> 00:29:17,817
Yes, my words.

357
00:29:17,817 --> 00:29:19,719
Cut off before completion.

358
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:21,054
Well then complete.

359
00:29:21,054 --> 00:29:22,956
That it is impossible for me to keep it,

360
00:29:22,956 --> 00:29:25,058
regardless of desire.

361
00:29:25,058 --> 00:29:26,392
There is nothing in my possession

362
00:29:26,392 --> 00:29:28,461
that was not given to me by Domina.

363
00:29:28,461 --> 00:29:31,397
Are you so thick that this fact was ignored?

364
00:29:31,397 --> 00:29:33,733
Did you think she would not notice?

365
00:29:35,302 --> 00:29:37,704
I misunderstood your
meaning in returning it.

366
00:29:37,704 --> 00:29:39,439
Of course you misunderstood!

367
00:29:39,439 --> 00:29:42,141
You have no mind outside the arena!

368
00:29:42,141 --> 00:29:44,611
You think only with your
sword and your shield,

369
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:45,845
you stupid, lumbering...

370
00:29:54,788 --> 00:29:56,055
You are a fool.

371
00:29:57,258 --> 00:29:58,358
Guard!

372
00:30:14,575 --> 00:30:16,843
<i>Only one survives!</i>

373
00:30:29,556 --> 00:30:30,657
<i>Mongrel.</i>

374
00:30:33,794 --> 00:30:35,928
<i>Spartacus!</i>

375
00:30:35,928 --> 00:30:37,163
<i>Victor!</i>

376
00:30:44,505 --> 00:30:45,605
How much longer?

377
00:30:48,142 --> 00:30:50,109
How much blood until we're free?

378
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:51,359
Soon.

379
00:30:52,913 --> 00:30:54,747
I promise you.

380
00:30:54,747 --> 00:30:56,749
Just the thought of holding you...

381
00:30:57,985 --> 00:30:59,252
Feeling you against me...

382
00:31:02,556 --> 00:31:04,524
It's the only thing that
keeps my heart beating.

383
00:31:05,893 --> 00:31:07,160
<i>You look like shit.</i>

384
00:31:09,863 --> 00:31:10,897
I've endured worse.

385
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:14,701
What man could,

386
00:31:14,701 --> 00:31:16,869
and still count himself of this world?

387
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:21,240
This world. All it holds is suffering.

388
00:31:24,945 --> 00:31:27,714
It will end one day.

389
00:31:27,714 --> 00:31:29,449
And we will be reunited.

390
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:30,616
As gladiators?

391
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:33,252
<i>A welcomed thought.</i>

392
00:31:35,422 --> 00:31:38,057
One that keeps me from the
grasp of the afterlife.

393
00:31:38,057 --> 00:31:40,593
Your condition speaks to its encroachment.

394
00:31:43,897 --> 00:31:45,365
<i>Mandrake root,</i>

395
00:31:45,365 --> 00:31:46,699
acquired from Ashur.

396
00:31:48,635 --> 00:31:50,236
Chewed to numb the pain.

397
00:31:50,236 --> 00:31:51,404
Take it.

398
00:31:54,575 --> 00:31:55,608
I can't.

399
00:31:59,446 --> 00:32:01,814
I need what remains of
my senses to save you.

400
00:32:01,814 --> 00:32:04,484
<i>Save me from what?</i>

401
00:32:04,484 --> 00:32:05,651
Spartacus?

402
00:32:10,657 --> 00:32:13,159
Your offer is well received.

403
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:15,495
Even in the turning away of it.

404
00:32:28,308 --> 00:32:29,776
Spartacus handsomely returns.

405
00:32:29,776 --> 00:32:32,111
Will the sum balance our debts?

406
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:34,480
The scales are well nudged...

407
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,382
But balanced?

408
00:32:36,382 --> 00:32:37,550
No.

409
00:32:41,255 --> 00:32:42,388
Pay out the most egregious.

410
00:32:42,388 --> 00:32:44,457
But leave Ovidius with empty fucking hands.

411
00:32:44,457 --> 00:32:45,625
<i>Ovidius?</i>

412
00:32:46,994 --> 00:32:48,461
The magistrate's cousin?

413
00:32:48,461 --> 00:32:50,229
You should be in bed, the hour is late.

414
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:53,099
And our debts follow.

415
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:54,667
If money is owed to Ovidius...

416
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:56,936
<i>Then it will be paid, in due course.</i>

417
00:32:56,936 --> 00:32:59,138
The man offered me insult and I
won't reward it with it swift coin.

418
00:32:59,138 --> 00:33:00,440
<i>Is that wise?</i>

419
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,341
If he complains to the magistrate, I worry...

420
00:33:02,341 --> 00:33:05,645
I am the paterfamilias,
the worry is mine alone!

421
00:33:05,645 --> 00:33:07,146
Is that how you woke this morning?

422
00:33:07,146 --> 00:33:08,614
Alone?

423
00:33:08,614 --> 00:33:10,016
<i>Was I not by your side?</i>

424
00:33:11,185 --> 00:33:13,953
Lucretia...

425
00:33:13,953 --> 00:33:15,788
How did you come to possess those coins?

426
00:33:15,788 --> 00:33:17,457
Lucretia!

427
00:33:17,457 --> 00:33:19,125
Lucretia...

428
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:20,393
From Ramel, if you must kn,

429
00:33:20,393 --> 00:33:22,762
in exchange for the emerald necklace.

430
00:33:22,762 --> 00:33:24,363
I commanded you to do no such thing!

431
00:33:24,363 --> 00:33:25,565
Commanded?

432
00:33:25,565 --> 00:33:27,567
You mistake me for a slave.

433
00:33:29,203 --> 00:33:31,103
You know my intentions better.

434
00:33:31,103 --> 00:33:32,271
Lucretia, the emeralds...

435
00:33:34,241 --> 00:33:35,808
They looked lovely on you.

436
00:33:35,808 --> 00:33:38,978
To see them returned,
a casualty of ill finances...

437
00:33:38,978 --> 00:33:41,714
The fault was mine,

438
00:33:41,714 --> 00:33:44,317
in pressing the purchase in the first place.

439
00:33:44,317 --> 00:33:46,986
Your worries are my worries Quintus.

440
00:33:46,986 --> 00:33:49,188
You are never alone.

441
00:33:49,188 --> 00:33:51,190
A notion to warm the heart.

442
00:33:56,096 --> 00:33:58,264
The emerald necklace,

443
00:33:58,264 --> 00:33:59,599
what did it bring?

444
00:34:01,401 --> 00:34:02,702
Fourteen denarii.

445
00:34:02,702 --> 00:34:05,071
Fourteen?

446
00:34:05,071 --> 00:34:07,006
Days past it commanded twice that!

447
00:34:08,642 --> 00:34:10,977
Women and business,
and these are the results!

448
00:34:10,977 --> 00:34:13,613
An offer for the full price
was made by Solonius,

449
00:34:13,613 --> 00:34:15,014
who happened by.

450
00:34:15,014 --> 00:34:16,682
Better business had I accepted?

451
00:34:19,653 --> 00:34:21,254
You struck the wiser bargain.

452
00:34:22,623 --> 00:34:25,057
Solonius knows of your
activities in the pits.

453
00:34:25,057 --> 00:34:26,359
The whole city does by now.

454
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:27,493
Let their tongues wag.

455
00:34:27,493 --> 00:34:29,962
The winnings will return
this ludus to solvency.

456
00:34:29,962 --> 00:34:32,765
Then we'll have at Solonius
and all his shit eaters.

457
00:34:32,765 --> 00:34:34,700
How long can the thracian last?

458
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,769
A handful of nights, if that.

459
00:34:38,539 --> 00:34:41,374
Even the walking dead
eventually return to the grave.

460
00:34:54,821 --> 00:34:57,590
<i>Send him back to the pits!</i>

461
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,325
<i>He's not a fucking gladiator!</i>

462
00:34:59,325 --> 00:35:01,894
<i>Spartacus!</i>

463
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:04,463
Here take it, Spartacus.

464
00:35:13,674 --> 00:35:15,274
You have fought well, Spartacus.

465
00:35:17,311 --> 00:35:18,578
The gods reward you.

466
00:35:24,985 --> 00:35:26,252
The promise is kept.

467
00:35:41,868 --> 00:35:42,969
Sura...

468
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:54,413
I will always be with you...

469
00:35:56,116 --> 00:35:57,216
Even in death.

470
00:36:00,387 --> 00:36:01,654
The rains are coming.

471
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,690
Save me.

472
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,092
Before they wash everything away.

473
00:36:06,092 --> 00:36:07,259
Sura...

474
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:13,733
No...

475
00:36:18,138 --> 00:36:19,238
No!

476
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,695
Not so much fight in him now, is there?

477
00:36:44,998 --> 00:36:48,100
He saves his fury for the pits.

478
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,470
A place you wouldn't last a fucking breath.

479
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,638
Spartacus.

480
00:36:54,941 --> 00:36:56,809
<i>You've fought well.</i>

481
00:36:56,809 --> 00:36:59,145
The gods may yet reward you.

482
00:36:59,145 --> 00:37:01,213
The gods.

483
00:37:01,213 --> 00:37:03,549
They came to me last night.

484
00:37:03,549 --> 00:37:04,884
In a dream.

485
00:37:04,884 --> 00:37:05,951
What did they show you?

486
00:37:05,951 --> 00:37:08,287
The truth.

487
00:37:08,287 --> 00:37:10,456
Your profit from my blood ends tonight.

488
00:37:10,456 --> 00:37:13,626
Refuse to fight,
and I will cease my attempts

489
00:37:13,626 --> 00:37:15,661
to find your wife.

490
00:37:15,661 --> 00:37:17,329
I have to save her.

491
00:37:18,732 --> 00:37:19,999
Before the rains come.

492
00:37:22,502 --> 00:37:25,504
Give way to your meaning, you mad fuck!

493
00:37:30,377 --> 00:37:32,645
The odds remain high in my favor?

494
00:37:34,481 --> 00:37:36,248
Still.

495
00:37:36,248 --> 00:37:38,584
Then bet everything you have against me.

496
00:37:39,886 --> 00:37:40,920
You would die in the pits?

497
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,788
Willingly, to see my fortune rise?

498
00:37:42,788 --> 00:37:46,459
Yes, if you will hold to wrest my wife

499
00:37:46,459 --> 00:37:49,395
from the syrian with a piece of it.

500
00:37:49,395 --> 00:37:50,496
What's to keep me to this bargain

501
00:37:50,496 --> 00:37:53,032
once your blood is spilled?

502
00:37:53,032 --> 00:37:53,752
Honor.

503
00:37:55,268 --> 00:37:57,570
And the promise of vengeance
from the afterlife

504
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,904
if you betray it.

505
00:38:03,343 --> 00:38:05,778
The deal is struck.

506
00:38:05,778 --> 00:38:07,780
Make it appear a sincere fight.

507
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,121
Finish preparing him.

508
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:53,793
Behold...

509
00:38:53,793 --> 00:38:54,994
Spartacus!

510
00:38:58,865 --> 00:39:01,267
Behold, Ixion!

511
00:39:07,908 --> 00:39:09,175
The wager is placed?

512
00:39:09,175 --> 00:39:10,509
The sum has been spread among

513
00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:12,444
the brokers to ease suspicion.

514
00:39:12,444 --> 00:39:13,913
<i>What weapons</i>

515
00:39:13,913 --> 00:39:16,315
shall the gods bless them with?

516
00:39:16,315 --> 00:39:18,150
Or curse them

517
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,319
with empty hands?

518
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:21,487
Choose your fate!

519
00:39:25,492 --> 00:39:28,594
Ixion draws bipennis!

520
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:44,176
Spartacus draws sica!

521
00:39:50,584 --> 00:39:53,786
<i>We have but a single rule!</i>

522
00:39:55,055 --> 00:39:56,322
Only one survives!

523
00:39:57,924 --> 00:40:01,527
<i>Mongrel on mongrel,</i>

524
00:40:01,527 --> 00:40:04,096
<i>till Charon arrives!</i>

525
00:41:19,706 --> 00:41:22,474
Not yet, not yet...

526
00:41:46,066 --> 00:41:47,166
No!

527
00:42:52,399 --> 00:42:54,767
My protector, and here I stand bloodied!

528
00:42:54,767 --> 00:42:56,335
I did not see there was another.

529
00:42:56,335 --> 00:42:58,604
<i>You must see all when my life
is in the balance!</i>

530
00:42:58,604 --> 00:43:00,906
<i>Ring your crown with eyes, or have the two
you possess</i>

531
00:43:00,906 --> 00:43:02,374
ripped from your fucking skull!

532
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:05,144
Their flesh carries a brand, Dominus.

533
00:43:05,144 --> 00:43:06,645
Of what origin?

534
00:43:06,645 --> 00:43:08,680
<i>Unfamiliar,</i>

535
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,283
but certainly the mark of a slave.

536
00:43:11,283 --> 00:43:12,451
Slaves?

537
00:43:14,487 --> 00:43:15,721
They send

538
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:18,223
common fucking slaves

539
00:43:18,223 --> 00:43:20,526
to kill Batiatus!

540
00:43:20,526 --> 00:43:23,662
Common fucking slaves?

541
00:43:23,662 --> 00:43:24,830
<i>Fuck!</i>

542
00:43:27,934 --> 00:43:29,034
Fuck!

543
00:43:32,705 --> 00:43:33,806
Discover their master.

544
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:39,078
I wish to have words with him.

545
00:43:46,152 --> 00:43:48,053
Juno's lips,

546
00:43:48,053 --> 00:43:50,689
Juno's heart,

547
00:43:50,689 --> 00:43:51,790
Juno's belly.

548
00:43:57,363 --> 00:43:58,964
The kalends are upon us.

549
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,733
The first day of the new month.

550
00:44:01,733 --> 00:44:03,735
<i>Prepare a sacrifice.</i>

551
00:44:03,735 --> 00:44:05,604
Perhaps the gods will finally grace us

552
00:44:05,604 --> 00:44:07,239
with a child in return...

553
00:44:08,908 --> 00:44:10,275
Quintus!

554
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:12,644
Aye, it's nothing, a minor annoyance.

555
00:44:12,644 --> 00:44:14,213
Minor?

556
00:44:14,213 --> 00:44:15,714
Why do you speak of children,

557
00:44:15,714 --> 00:44:17,483
yet press to make me a widow?

558
00:44:17,483 --> 00:44:19,051
It will take more than a scratch

559
00:44:19,051 --> 00:44:20,519
to wrest me from your side.

560
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:21,687
Barely more, sit.

561
00:44:24,858 --> 00:44:28,227
And tell me who must die in response.

562
00:44:28,227 --> 00:44:30,629
The agents have already been
dispatched to the underworld.

563
00:44:30,629 --> 00:44:34,533
The hand behind them yet to be revealed.

564
00:44:34,533 --> 00:44:37,336
I warned you of the dangers of the pits.

565
00:44:37,336 --> 00:44:39,037
I had thought to erase all our debts

566
00:44:39,037 --> 00:44:40,372
through them after tonight.

567
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:44,810
Spartacus offered terms to see it so.

568
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,378
What terms?

569
00:44:46,378 --> 00:44:48,013
His willing death to wager upon.

570
00:44:48,013 --> 00:44:50,883
Locating his wife the crux of the bargain.

571
00:44:50,883 --> 00:44:52,217
The thracian is dead?

572
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,954
No, he yet lives.

573
00:44:58,525 --> 00:45:00,893
And the wager is lost.

574
00:45:00,893 --> 00:45:03,295
How much?

575
00:45:03,295 --> 00:45:04,863
A substantial sum.

576
00:45:04,863 --> 00:45:06,231
We don't have it!

577
00:45:09,435 --> 00:45:10,736
That thracian...

578
00:45:10,736 --> 00:45:12,671
He brings nothing but shame on our house!

579
00:45:12,671 --> 00:45:15,040
Were it not for him,

580
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,176
you would be a widow.

581
00:45:17,176 --> 00:45:19,578
He saved my life in the pits this night.

582
00:45:19,578 --> 00:45:22,281
A place you would never have
been if it weren't for him.

583
00:45:23,616 --> 00:45:26,852
He is cursed, he is cursed by the gods.

584
00:45:26,852 --> 00:45:29,521
I would see his life ended,
as it should have been

585
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:32,424
when he stepped into the arena,
doomed for execution.

586
00:45:32,424 --> 00:45:34,927
Every day that the thracian yet lives,

587
00:45:34,927 --> 00:45:37,729
I fear that his curse becomes our own.

588
00:45:52,212 --> 00:45:53,312
Spartacus.

589
00:45:56,816 --> 00:45:58,383
Batiatus summons you.

590
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:18,837
My wife thinks you are cursed by the gods.

591
00:46:19,973 --> 00:46:22,641
I'm inclined to agree.

592
00:46:22,641 --> 00:46:24,676
You'll find no argument.

593
00:46:24,676 --> 00:46:26,979
The rational course would be
to end your miserable life

594
00:46:26,979 --> 00:46:29,014
before it further infects mine.

595
00:46:29,014 --> 00:46:31,450
A promise was made,

596
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:32,818
you would find Sura.

597
00:46:32,818 --> 00:46:35,220
If you died in the pits.

598
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,889
Yet here you stand, alive.

599
00:46:37,889 --> 00:46:39,057
As do you.

600
00:46:46,132 --> 00:46:48,267
Promise is kept.

601
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:50,602
I will continue the search for her.

602
00:46:54,274 --> 00:46:55,707
You saved my life.

603
00:46:55,707 --> 00:46:58,744
Gods or not, a debt demands repayment.

604
00:47:02,682 --> 00:47:05,484
He's to rejoin the gladiators
as soon as he is able.

605
00:47:23,080 --> 00:48:20,890

1
00:00:27,437 --> 00:00:29,005
Switch!

2
00:00:36,346 --> 00:00:37,780
Switch!

3
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,954
Switch!

4
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:49,892
Crixus!

5
00:00:51,194 --> 00:00:53,629
Did you not hear my instruction?

6
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:55,364
Apologies, Doctore.

7
00:00:55,364 --> 00:00:57,967
I did not mean to
scare the rabbit.

8
00:00:59,636 --> 00:01:02,805
<i>The games of the
magistrate approach.</i>

9
00:01:02,805 --> 00:01:06,142
Listen carefully
to my instruction,

10
00:01:06,142 --> 00:01:08,444
and every man chosen

11
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:10,146
will see victory in the arena.

12
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,384
Perhaps not every man.

13
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:16,852
Pietros.

14
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:19,288
Save the water for
men who deserve it.

15
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,533
Rain! By Jupiter's cock,

16
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:32,535
would you fucking rain!

17
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,472
What are you doing?

18
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:38,341
Praying.

19
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:39,942
Blaspheming.

20
00:01:39,942 --> 00:01:43,512
The two are narrowly separated
in these trying times.

21
00:01:43,512 --> 00:01:46,449
Perhaps the gap widens...

22
00:01:46,449 --> 00:01:48,117
More creditors, seeking action?

23
00:01:48,117 --> 00:01:49,118
Something of more cheerful note,

24
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:50,419
recently delivered...

25
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,459
From magistrate Calavius!

26
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,496
He is coming here to personally

27
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:02,231
select men for his games!

28
00:02:02,231 --> 00:02:04,600
Games to appease the
gods and end the drought!

29
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,968
The biggest games
since Theokoles

30
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:07,837
bested 100 men in the arena!

31
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:09,071
But why come himself? Unless...

32
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:13,476
The Primus.

33
00:02:13,476 --> 00:02:15,845
If we were to secure the
main event at these games...

34
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:17,079
He arrives within the hour.

35
00:02:19,282 --> 00:02:20,416
Prepare food.

36
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,151
And gather all the
water we have.

37
00:02:22,151 --> 00:02:23,219
Quintus, your robe...

38
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:24,954
Uh, it's nothing.

39
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:26,055
Fetch the Medicus.

40
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:27,990
Lucretia..

41
00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:32,661
I should talk to the
magistrate about it.

42
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:34,663
Those men tried to kill you,
an honest man.

43
00:02:34,663 --> 00:02:36,165
In a dishonest place.

44
00:02:36,165 --> 00:02:38,834
No, we won't concern the
magistrate with these things,

45
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:40,302
not with the Primus
in the balance.

46
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,941
I'll tend to the
matter myself, um.

47
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,914
That was the mark
of one of the slaves

48
00:02:51,914 --> 00:02:53,682
who tried to kill Batiatus.

49
00:02:57,988 --> 00:02:59,755
The mark is unknown to me.

50
00:02:59,755 --> 00:03:00,756
Perhaps a closer look...

51
00:03:04,428 --> 00:03:05,661
Details of such craftsmanship

52
00:03:05,661 --> 00:03:07,296
should not be viewed in haste.

53
00:03:10,934 --> 00:03:15,137
I may have seen a
similar mark...

54
00:03:15,137 --> 00:03:16,137
Ahh.

55
00:03:17,107 --> 00:03:20,142
So, what do you think?

56
00:03:20,142 --> 00:03:23,012
You adorn them like a god.

57
00:03:23,012 --> 00:03:24,280
I would be out of them...

58
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,715
And deep into you...

59
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:29,351
Apologies.

60
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:31,220
Magistrate Calavius arrives.

61
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,423
Our fortunes rise,
like your cock.

62
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:38,494
Stay wet and we'll make
it rain presently... ohhh.

63
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,166
Magistrate!

64
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,634
You do us honor with your...

65
00:03:48,038 --> 00:03:49,105
Presence!

66
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:50,406
Good Batiatus!
I was telling Solonius

67
00:03:50,406 --> 00:03:52,908
how I knew your father.

68
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:55,010
Now there was a true roman.

69
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,548
A great man,
none of his like to follow.

70
00:03:59,548 --> 00:04:01,584
I will attempt to fill your
needs as he would have.

71
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:03,352
To business then.

72
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:07,089
As you well know,
the drought has parched the city

73
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:09,091
to the point of madness.

74
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:11,660
We've tried everything to
tempted the skies into tears,

75
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,296
even to the point of hecatombe.

76
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,665
A hundred cattle sacrificed,
and yet not a drop.

77
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:18,067
Because the gods do not
want the blood of cattle.

78
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:19,502
They want the blood of men!

79
00:04:19,502 --> 00:04:20,870
Good Solonius has
been kind enough

80
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,938
to lend a hand in
organizing games

81
00:04:22,938 --> 00:04:24,673
to appease their appetite.

82
00:04:24,673 --> 00:04:26,809
It will be sine missione.

83
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:28,544
No draw. No mercy shown.

84
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:29,912
Only the finest gladiators

85
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:33,048
will be invited to participate.

86
00:04:33,048 --> 00:04:35,084
Only the finest are offered
in the House of Batiatus.

87
00:04:37,254 --> 00:04:38,587
Come, examine my wares.

88
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:47,696
An impressive selection,

89
00:04:47,696 --> 00:04:50,699
rivaling that of good
Solonius himself.

90
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,134
Yet I have the Primus.

91
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:54,103
Half.

92
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:56,105
Your opponent still
to be chosen.

93
00:04:56,105 --> 00:04:57,439
If you wish to appease the gods,

94
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,542
you must have one upon the sands

95
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:02,077
Crixus the Champion of Capua,

96
00:05:02,077 --> 00:05:05,014
will willing fight anyone
that Solonius has to offer.

97
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,549
Excellent!

98
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:09,752
It will truly be a
contest between legends!

99
00:05:11,454 --> 00:05:13,088
Legends?

100
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:14,390
Oh, did I fail to mention?

101
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:19,028
Good Solonius has secured
Theokoles for the Primus!

102
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,162
Theokoles?

103
00:05:20,162 --> 00:05:22,331
I managed to coax him
to our fair city,

104
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:23,999
at great expense.

105
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:25,801
With our gratitude.

106
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:27,870
If the gods fail to grant
us rain with such a tribute,

107
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,305
then we are surely cursed.

108
00:05:29,305 --> 00:05:31,173
I fear the gods
will be displeased.

109
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:32,908
The match is unbalanced.

110
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:35,177
Only one man Theokoles

111
00:05:35,177 --> 00:05:36,579
and lived.

112
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:41,584
What if Crixus were joined
by your man Spartacus?

113
00:05:41,584 --> 00:05:43,686
His death was fated
in execution,

114
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:46,222
yet he refuse to own it.

115
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:49,758
And cost me four men
in his defiance.

116
00:05:49,758 --> 00:05:52,828
Your debts are well known,
Batiatus.

117
00:05:52,828 --> 00:05:53,963
Even if you lose the men,

118
00:05:53,963 --> 00:05:56,232
the purse is enough to
hold off your creditors,

119
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:58,734
for a moment.

120
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,336
Unless of course
you would rather

121
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:01,403
sit out these games

122
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,805
or any others that follow,
which...

123
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:04,740
No. I will set my
men to the task.

124
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,384
My titans!

125
00:06:15,384 --> 00:06:17,019
Pause, and hear glorious news!

126
00:06:19,823 --> 00:06:22,858
Magistrate Titus Calavius
has invited our best men

127
00:06:22,858 --> 00:06:26,128
to fight in his Primus!

128
00:06:26,128 --> 00:06:27,296
Crixus!

129
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:28,297
Step forward!

130
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,569
Spartacus! Step forward.

131
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:42,444
You have been chosen
to fight as one...

132
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:45,447
Against Theokoles,
the shadow of death!

133
00:06:57,694 --> 00:06:58,894
Fuck! Ow! Ow!

134
00:06:58,894 --> 00:07:00,162
Fuck! Ow!

135
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:01,664
Shit! Fuck!

136
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:03,365
Ow! Ow! Shit!

137
00:07:03,365 --> 00:07:05,567
Fuck! Ow! Ow!

138
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:13,042
I think you two will
make a fine couple.

139
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:17,813
I'd rather fight without him.

140
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:18,814
And die the same.

141
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:21,850
This Theokoles.

142
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:25,354
The legends can't be true.

143
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:27,790
He's en cut a thousand
times in the arena,

144
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,691
he's never fallen.

145
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:32,628
I fear you would have
been safer in the pits.

146
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,564
If we were to win,

147
00:07:35,564 --> 00:07:38,734
how large would be the purse?

148
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:41,937
Large enough to wrest ten
wives from the syrian.

149
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,246
You send them to certain death.

150
00:07:51,246 --> 00:07:52,815
Let me fight in their stead.

151
00:07:52,815 --> 00:07:53,916
That's an excellent suggestion.

152
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,317
I owe Theokoles a debt of pain.

153
00:07:55,317 --> 00:07:56,819
You were not requested!

154
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:58,087
Look, no one has
forgotten how bravely

155
00:07:58,087 --> 00:07:59,822
you fought against Theokoles,
old friend.

156
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:01,590
Yet without victory.

157
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,592
You stand the only man to face
him in the arena and live.

158
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:05,127
That in itself is a victory.

159
00:08:07,097 --> 00:08:08,497
Set your purpose to
the task of training

160
00:08:08,497 --> 00:08:10,099
Crixus and Spartacus
for the match.

161
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:12,368
I fear no amount will save them

162
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:14,002
from the shadow's grasp.

163
00:08:14,002 --> 00:08:15,704
Then prepare them for
a glorious death.

164
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,280
The brand belonged to Remus,
a slave trader

165
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,282
plying wares north of the city.

166
00:08:27,282 --> 00:08:28,684
Remus? The name holds
no recognition.

167
00:08:28,684 --> 00:08:30,085
Nor to I. Yet,

168
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:33,622
if I were to purchase a slave,
intent on foul designs...

169
00:08:33,622 --> 00:08:35,557
Then it would be
from outside Capua,

170
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,993
to avoid simple discovery.

171
00:08:37,993 --> 00:08:40,295
Find Remus and bring him.

172
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:42,030
I would have conversation.

173
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,165
Dominus.

174
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,174
Water.

175
00:08:58,648 --> 00:08:59,681
From Domina.

176
00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:01,350
To help with your training.

177
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:12,728
Wait a moment.

178
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:18,133
To what purpose?

179
00:09:20,537 --> 00:09:21,937
Need there be one?

180
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,442
You shouldn't look
at me in that way.

181
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:32,314
I try with all my
strength not to.

182
00:09:32,314 --> 00:09:33,415
But I am weak.

183
00:09:40,356 --> 00:09:43,125
Sleep, then.

184
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,160
And regain your strength.

185
00:09:55,405 --> 00:09:56,672
I seek no quarrel.

186
00:09:56,672 --> 00:09:58,941
Your presence here
would state otherwise.

187
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:00,576
We've had our differences.

188
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:01,677
I own my part in them.

189
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:03,178
Yet if we are to
defeat Theokoles..

190
00:10:03,178 --> 00:10:03,928
We?

191
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:07,583
There is no such
thing in the arena.

192
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:12,187
You believe you can
slay the giant?

193
00:10:12,187 --> 00:10:13,388
Alone?

194
00:10:13,388 --> 00:10:15,257
As I always stand.

195
00:10:15,257 --> 00:10:16,592
This time you do not.

196
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:20,829
When Theokoles falls,
the glory will be mine.

197
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,598
And if we do not come
to common ground,

198
00:10:24,868 --> 00:10:26,835
the death shared will be ours.

199
00:10:41,117 --> 00:10:43,886
Oh. As if they stand
chance against Theokoles.

200
00:10:43,886 --> 00:10:45,921
Um. Perhaps the gods
will favor them.

201
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:47,956
Yes, and perhaps I
should sprout wings

202
00:10:47,956 --> 00:10:49,892
and flutter off.

203
00:10:49,892 --> 00:10:52,494
The odds lay a thousand
to one against them.

204
00:10:52,494 --> 00:10:55,197
No man has ever won
betting against Crixus.

205
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:58,734
I would lay coin
towards their victory.

206
00:11:00,837 --> 00:11:02,170
A fool's wager.

207
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,839
Happily received.

208
00:11:08,778 --> 00:11:09,745
You leave without words.

209
00:11:09,745 --> 00:11:10,946
None to give.

210
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:13,081
Each time you step
beyond these walls,

211
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:15,183
I fear for you and what...

212
00:11:15,183 --> 00:11:16,985
Grab hold of your
cock and be a man!

213
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,858
I do what I must, Pietros.

214
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:23,792
I'll return soon.

215
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:38,006
Mind the birds.

216
00:11:39,142 --> 00:11:40,509
Pietros!

217
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:42,611
Weapons!

218
00:11:51,854 --> 00:11:52,988
Ilithyia?

219
00:11:52,988 --> 00:11:54,856
She comes at my invitation.

220
00:11:54,856 --> 00:11:56,124
Now's not the time
to be entertaining

221
00:11:56,124 --> 00:11:57,593
that spoiled little bitch.

222
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:59,494
Her father Albinius holds
the magistrate's ear.

223
00:11:59,494 --> 00:12:00,729
If he were to place
a word in it,

224
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:02,931
then Crixus may be
replaced in the Primus.

225
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,367
He could place a thousand
and to no result.

226
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:07,269
Solonius maneuvered you.

227
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:08,870
With the aid of the magistrate!

228
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,639
Refuse and we would
quickly find ourselves

229
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,374
excluded from the
arena altogether.

230
00:12:12,374 --> 00:12:13,542
And if Crixus falls?

231
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:15,110
Who will be our champion?

232
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,379
Who will the crowds clamor to
see from the House of Batiatus?

233
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:19,481
Not Spartacus,
that thing from the pits?

234
00:12:22,552 --> 00:12:23,518
Your guest arrives.

235
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:24,953
Do not broach the
subject with her.

236
00:12:27,256 --> 00:12:28,290
Ilithyia!

237
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,926
You do us honor
with your presence.

238
00:12:30,926 --> 00:12:33,295
I would trade honor for water.

239
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,534
Ah, the heat is a thing living,
crawling down the throat.

240
00:12:39,534 --> 00:12:42,137
Well, let us quench that thirst.

241
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,605
I must to tend to
business of the games.

242
00:12:43,605 --> 00:12:45,207
I leave you in loving hands.

243
00:12:47,276 --> 00:12:49,411
Is it true, then? What?

244
00:12:49,411 --> 00:12:52,748
Crixus and Spartacus
face the shadow of death?

245
00:12:52,748 --> 00:12:53,749
They do.

246
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:57,352
Blood will surely
flow on the day.

247
00:12:57,352 --> 00:13:00,555
I long to see it pour
from the thracian.

248
00:13:14,537 --> 00:13:16,872
You attack as you would a man.

249
00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:20,008
Theokoles is beyond flesh.

250
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,477
Beyond blood and bone.

251
00:13:22,477 --> 00:13:25,814
He is the shadow
that precedes death.

252
00:13:25,814 --> 00:13:29,184
Allow him to fall
upon you alone...

253
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,620
And you are dead.

254
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,155
Now rise,

255
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:35,390
and come at me as one!

256
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:39,995
Give way, you fuck!

257
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:41,563
The advantage was mine!

258
00:13:56,713 --> 00:13:58,680
How Crixus moves.

259
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,718
The way his muscles
catch the sun...

260
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:08,857
Truly the Champion of Capua.

261
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,960
None to his equal.

262
00:14:15,031 --> 00:14:17,499
You jostle and trip over
the other like fools.

263
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:19,101
You face Theokoles
in the Primus!

264
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:23,972
Prove yourselves worthy!

265
00:14:42,492 --> 00:14:43,592
Pathetic.

266
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,195
I crave a closer look.

267
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:51,600
Can we go down among them?

268
00:14:55,872 --> 00:14:57,139
My husband would never allow it.

269
00:14:58,474 --> 00:14:59,841
The bowels of a
ludus are no place

270
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:02,077
for a senator's daughter.

271
00:15:02,077 --> 00:15:05,247
A private viewing then,
in the villa?

272
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:09,484
I would pay for it, of course.

273
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:12,888
A favor amongst friends.

274
00:15:12,888 --> 00:15:15,624
You must let me return it, then.

275
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,759
I've given thought
to your problem,

276
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,095
and have discovered solution.

277
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:21,329
Problem...?

278
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,767
Children.

279
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:27,035
Yes.

280
00:15:27,035 --> 00:15:30,071
I've heard of a woman,
a priestess of Juno,

281
00:15:30,071 --> 00:15:33,141
blessed with certain
gifts of fertility.

282
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,443
Many prominent
women speak of her.

283
00:15:35,443 --> 00:15:39,247
Servillia, Cornelia, Laelia..

284
00:15:39,247 --> 00:15:40,382
Ovidius' wife?

285
00:15:40,382 --> 00:15:41,750
You know her?

286
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,952
Oh, in passing.
She has a small boy.

287
00:15:43,952 --> 00:15:45,587
And would have none,
if not touched

288
00:15:45,587 --> 00:15:48,323
by the woman I speak of.

289
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,992
Will you let me
arrange it for you?

290
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,261
As a gift for your hospitality?

291
00:15:59,869 --> 00:16:01,703
We are friends, aren't we?

292
00:16:01,703 --> 00:16:02,971
The very best.

293
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:11,112
How are we to fare
against Theokoles,

294
00:16:11,112 --> 00:16:12,547
when we cannot
even best Doctore?

295
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,350
I could have bested
him a dozen times,

296
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,219
if you'd not gotten underfoot.

297
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:20,055
I take the sands beside
you in this fight, Crixus.

298
00:16:20,055 --> 00:16:21,122
Just because you stand beside me

299
00:16:21,122 --> 00:16:22,324
with sword and shield,

300
00:16:22,324 --> 00:16:24,860
do not mistake yourself
as a gladiator.

301
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,129
I fight to honor these walls,
you fight to leave them.

302
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:30,999
You fight...

303
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:33,969
Because you are a slave.

304
00:16:33,969 --> 00:16:35,036
Like me.

305
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,271
No.

306
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:37,606
Not like you.

307
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:39,808
I accept my place here.

308
00:16:39,808 --> 00:16:41,176
I embrace it.

309
00:16:41,176 --> 00:16:42,344
But you...

310
00:16:42,344 --> 00:16:45,080
You still dream of a
life beyond the arena.

311
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,982
Where that wife of yours
we've all heard about

312
00:16:46,982 --> 00:16:48,950
is still nestled by your side.

313
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,353
And that is all it is,
Spartacus.

314
00:16:51,353 --> 00:16:54,923
A dream and one day soon you
will awaken to the truth.

315
00:16:57,493 --> 00:17:00,528
You will never leave this place.

316
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:03,632
And your wife if she's
not dead already,

317
00:17:03,632 --> 00:17:06,601
has been fucked to madness
by a hundred roman cocks.

318
00:17:30,026 --> 00:17:32,160
Get yourselves cleaned up.

319
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,663
Domina requests your presence.

320
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:36,131
Both of you.

321
00:17:49,045 --> 00:17:51,413
Do you know who I am, thracian?

322
00:17:56,385 --> 00:17:57,105
Speak.

323
00:17:59,588 --> 00:18:02,223
I have seen you.

324
00:18:02,223 --> 00:18:05,460
With Legatus Glaber.

325
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,495
I am his wife.

326
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:13,635
He is regrettably abroad,

327
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:17,272
and will not be able to witness
your death against Theokoles.

328
00:18:21,444 --> 00:18:23,044
But...

329
00:18:26,615 --> 00:18:30,185
I shall whisper of it to him,

330
00:18:30,185 --> 00:18:34,422
replaying the moment

331
00:18:34,422 --> 00:18:36,891
when we are entwined in our bed.

332
00:18:43,632 --> 00:18:45,166
Apologies.

333
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,534
I require the
thracian for a moment.

334
00:18:47,603 --> 00:18:49,337
Extend it by a lifetime.

335
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:50,438
I am done with him.

336
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:53,108
My office.

337
00:18:56,846 --> 00:18:59,781
The Champion of Capua!

338
00:18:59,781 --> 00:19:02,217
A rare honor to receive
a private audience.

339
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:05,854
One I am most appreciative of.

340
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,455
Although,

341
00:19:07,455 --> 00:19:13,895
he does seem a touch
overdressed for the occasion.

342
00:19:13,895 --> 00:19:15,830
Your subligaria. Remove it.

343
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:31,613
Your champion is
bold to his purpose.

344
00:19:31,613 --> 00:19:32,647
I take my leave.

345
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,304
His flesh is so hard...

346
00:20:06,949 --> 00:20:08,216
Like marble.

347
00:20:15,357 --> 00:20:19,961
Would that every man
were carved so...

348
00:20:23,065 --> 00:20:24,766
We'd best not keep him.

349
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:28,236
His training resumes
at first light.

350
00:20:28,236 --> 00:20:30,738
Do you think he will survive,
against the shadow?

351
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:36,044
Only the gods know.

352
00:20:36,044 --> 00:20:40,215
It would be pity to
see such a man marred.

353
00:20:49,191 --> 00:20:52,627
Perhaps there is a way to
see such a tragedy averted.

354
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,832
If your father where to
speak to the magistrate.

355
00:20:57,832 --> 00:21:00,435
Perhaps... to what end?

356
00:21:02,104 --> 00:21:04,272
To seeing Crixus
replaced in the games.

357
00:21:07,376 --> 00:21:09,744
Is that what you want?

358
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:12,447
Do you fear entering the
arena with Theokoles?

359
00:21:18,187 --> 00:21:20,221
I long for it.

360
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:25,527
As I long to see it.

361
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:33,234
You survived being dragged
from your homeland

362
00:21:33,234 --> 00:21:34,134
by Legatus Glaber,

363
00:21:37,973 --> 00:21:40,508
you survived execution by
four gladiators in the arena.

364
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:43,278
You even survived the
horror of the pits.

365
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,088
Can you survive this?

366
00:21:54,088 --> 00:21:56,958
Crixus and I fight
at cross-purposes.

367
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,860
Then find a way to unite them.

368
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,231
You may have saved my life,

369
00:22:03,231 --> 00:22:04,866
but yours is yet worth
little in the arena.

370
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,301
But to loose Crixus
along with you

371
00:22:06,301 --> 00:22:08,236
that would be a blow
from which this ludus

372
00:22:08,236 --> 00:22:10,538
would not recover.

373
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:13,141
My concern is only for my wife.

374
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:14,876
And her fate is
tied to these walls.

375
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:16,377
If they collapse around me,

376
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:19,347
then I will be unable to help
her from beneath the rubble.

377
00:22:22,117 --> 00:22:24,252
I will not die
until she is safe.

378
00:22:24,252 --> 00:22:25,453
Well, prove it so.

379
00:22:25,453 --> 00:22:27,355
Fight as one with Crixus,
to best Theokoles.

380
00:22:27,355 --> 00:22:29,824
Or we are all fucked.

381
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,060
Yes.

382
00:22:37,633 --> 00:22:41,002
Barca has returned,
bearing gifts.

383
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,573
Remove him to the barracks.

384
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,521
Two slaves, broken by your hand,

385
00:23:00,521 --> 00:23:02,457
made attempt on my life.

386
00:23:02,457 --> 00:23:03,658
Who purchased them?

387
00:23:03,658 --> 00:23:05,793
I know not of what you speak...

388
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:08,529
I speak of being fucked.

389
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:10,164
By the gods, by the magistrate,

390
00:23:10,164 --> 00:23:14,369
by that cock suck Solonius
and his grinning schemes!

391
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:17,105
I'm of proud family!

392
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:20,908
A family of means and history,
you fucking cunt!

393
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:23,945
You sold the men!

394
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:27,148
Common slaves,

395
00:23:27,148 --> 00:23:30,918
who tried to kill me,
tried to fuck me like a whore!

396
00:23:30,918 --> 00:23:33,721
But I will not be fucked!

397
00:23:33,721 --> 00:23:34,722
I! Will! Not!

398
00:23:34,722 --> 00:23:36,090
Not! Be! Fucked!

399
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,960
You fuck you...

400
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,662
You fucking hemorrhoid

401
00:23:40,662 --> 00:23:44,032
sucking fuck, you fuck!

402
00:23:49,672 --> 00:23:51,339
Ovidius.

403
00:23:51,339 --> 00:23:52,707
What?

404
00:23:52,707 --> 00:23:54,509
Ovidius...

405
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:56,110
Sold...

406
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,446
To Ovidius...

407
00:24:02,318 --> 00:24:05,019
There was that so fucking hard?

408
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:07,255
Ovidius' cousin
is the magistrate.

409
00:24:07,255 --> 00:24:08,856
He could be cousin
to Jupiter himself,

410
00:24:08,856 --> 00:24:10,992
I don't give a shit.

411
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:12,727
I will have satisfaction.

412
00:24:15,331 --> 00:24:17,432
You dishonor me.

413
00:24:17,432 --> 00:24:19,567
The thracian impedes my attack.

414
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:20,935
I seek to strengthen it.

415
00:24:20,935 --> 00:24:22,236
I seek no aid.

416
00:24:22,236 --> 00:24:25,406
No, you need the gods to descend

417
00:24:25,406 --> 00:24:27,709
and fight by your side!

418
00:24:27,709 --> 00:24:29,877
Even then victory is doubtful.

419
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:35,850
Words, falling on deaf ears.

420
00:24:40,556 --> 00:24:42,757
Attend your eyes, then...

421
00:24:52,601 --> 00:24:54,602
My failure.

422
00:24:54,602 --> 00:24:56,337
Your lesson.

423
00:25:02,845 --> 00:25:04,178
His first cut...

424
00:25:06,448 --> 00:25:09,717
Dealt when I thought
him vulnerable.

425
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:12,186
And pressed my attack unwisely.

426
00:25:15,391 --> 00:25:17,291
His next assault..

427
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:20,094
Came as I fell back

428
00:25:20,094 --> 00:25:22,130
to regain position....

429
00:25:25,334 --> 00:25:27,402
Yet these wounds are nothing.

430
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:31,939
A game of blood,
to amuse the crowd.

431
00:25:31,939 --> 00:25:34,409
And when he tires of playing,

432
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:39,213
he will move to
separate your head..

433
00:25:39,213 --> 00:25:40,381
From your neck...

434
00:25:42,818 --> 00:25:45,420
I live because I survived
longer than any man

435
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,556
that stood against him.

436
00:25:48,556 --> 00:25:50,992
Some herald that as a victory.

437
00:25:52,294 --> 00:25:53,795
I am not among them.

438
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:58,433
You tell us the
shadow wounds both

439
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,301
when he is pressed and
when he is given ground.

440
00:26:00,301 --> 00:26:03,037
How will he to be defeated?

441
00:26:03,037 --> 00:26:06,207
By accomplishing both at once.

442
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:07,308
Press...

443
00:26:07,308 --> 00:26:08,943
And defend.

444
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,011
Distract...

445
00:26:10,011 --> 00:26:11,479
And strike.

446
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:12,547
Fight as one.

447
00:26:15,517 --> 00:26:17,251
Or die as two.

448
00:26:28,013 --> 00:26:32,183
Now, show me the way to honor.

449
00:26:35,921 --> 00:26:39,356
The games tomorrow,
and yet he presses them.

450
00:26:39,356 --> 00:26:40,758
To their benefit.

451
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:44,729
I have business in town.

452
00:26:46,098 --> 00:26:48,199
It'll take me until
late into the night.

453
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:51,068
Lucretia.

454
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:52,069
Um?

455
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:53,237
Business.

456
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:56,507
Yeah, business, I heard you.

457
00:26:56,507 --> 00:27:00,411
If you would prefer I delay..

458
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:02,980
No, I have diversion.

459
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,616
Ilithyia's coming
with her priestess.

460
00:27:10,956 --> 00:27:14,425
May the gods grant us miracle.

461
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,961
They fucking owe us something.

462
00:27:37,516 --> 00:27:39,016
A word of advice, Spartacus.

463
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:42,520
At what cost?

464
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,788
Freely given.

465
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:46,090
Do not think you can come
to terms with Crixus.

466
00:27:47,692 --> 00:27:50,528
I've trusted him
once in the arena

467
00:27:50,528 --> 00:27:52,563
and this was the result...

468
00:27:54,766 --> 00:27:57,434
He may as well have cut
the balls from my shaft.

469
00:28:00,505 --> 00:28:02,473
He'd turn a sword
against his ally?

470
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:05,576
Even Barca, if stood
between him and glory.

471
00:28:05,576 --> 00:28:08,646
The only way to survive
against Theokoles

472
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:13,017
is to consider Crixus
an equal enemy.

473
00:28:39,444 --> 00:28:43,647
How often do you
engage in intercourse?

474
00:28:43,647 --> 00:28:45,249
Several times a week.

475
00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:46,884
Sometimes more.

476
00:28:46,884 --> 00:28:49,119
Has seed ever taken hold?

477
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,221
Never.

478
00:28:53,391 --> 00:28:56,360
Have there been other men,
besides your husband?

479
00:29:00,198 --> 00:29:02,466
What bearing does that have?

480
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:06,337
Well it will inform the correct
combination of elements.

481
00:29:06,337 --> 00:29:07,771
The ritual is usually
a private matter.

482
00:29:07,771 --> 00:29:08,939
Perhaps..

483
00:29:08,939 --> 00:29:12,710
Oh please, can I stay?

484
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,411
I've never seen one of these.

485
00:29:14,411 --> 00:29:16,547
It's so intriguing.

486
00:29:20,418 --> 00:29:21,952
Other men?

487
00:29:21,952 --> 00:29:25,522
Have there been any?

488
00:29:25,522 --> 00:29:26,522
Yes.

489
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:29,660
How many?

490
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,429
One. But frequently.

491
00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:34,899
Then the difficulty
lies not with the seed,

492
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:36,533
but within the vessel.

493
00:29:41,206 --> 00:29:43,140
You mean there's
something wrong with her?

494
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,143
The gods have decided to
withhold the joy of children.

495
00:29:46,143 --> 00:29:48,212
But we will entreat
them to reconsider...

496
00:30:09,534 --> 00:30:10,701
Drink.

497
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:20,911
Juno has blessed you.

498
00:30:20,911 --> 00:30:23,480
You must copulate
within the hour.

499
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,949
So soon?

500
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:27,318
Before the flame
of life expires.

501
00:30:29,587 --> 00:30:31,155
Good fortune be with you.

502
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,933
Only an hour?

503
00:30:42,933 --> 00:30:45,135
You think she would have told
you that before she started,

504
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:46,904
considering her price.

505
00:30:46,904 --> 00:30:48,072
Gratitude for arranging this.

506
00:30:48,072 --> 00:30:51,275
Unnecessary words from a friend.

507
00:30:51,275 --> 00:30:56,513
And I being yours, I'll leave
you to complete the ritual.

508
00:30:56,513 --> 00:31:00,317
Although tales of this other man

509
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:05,189
will be most expected when
time is not at issue...

510
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:12,396
Why are the fucking
torches not lit?

511
00:31:12,396 --> 00:31:13,764
Laelia...?

512
00:31:33,151 --> 00:31:35,119
I owe you a debt, Ovidius.

513
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:36,587
I've come to repay.

514
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:43,060
Please.

515
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,629
The boy is unstained.

516
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,136
No child is unstained by
the deeds of his father.

517
00:31:52,136 --> 00:31:54,004
They are not my own.

518
00:31:54,004 --> 00:31:56,473
Two slaves, sent from
Remus to take my life.

519
00:31:56,473 --> 00:31:59,810
Do you deny giving
coin to the cause?

520
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,012
I hired the men, yes.

521
00:32:02,012 --> 00:32:03,847
But to another's purpose.

522
00:32:03,847 --> 00:32:05,049
Whose?

523
00:32:10,021 --> 00:32:11,355
Whose?

524
00:32:12,991 --> 00:32:14,124
Speak the name,
and I swear to the gods

525
00:32:14,124 --> 00:32:15,826
I will not kill you.

526
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:22,599
Solonius.

527
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:25,702
He paid the balance
of your debt to me.

528
00:32:25,702 --> 00:32:29,640
In exchange for me
arranging your death.

529
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:37,314
Gratitude for your honesty,
Ovidius.

530
00:32:37,314 --> 00:32:39,716
You're not going
to kill me, then?

531
00:32:39,716 --> 00:32:40,951
No.

532
00:32:43,721 --> 00:32:45,522
My slave is going to kill you.

533
00:33:03,975 --> 00:33:07,111
Burn this fucking
place to the ground.

534
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:09,279
But first...

535
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,781
Take care of the child.

536
00:33:19,757 --> 00:33:21,091
You were right.

537
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:24,862
I do not honor these walls.

538
00:33:26,898 --> 00:33:28,599
A fact well known.

539
00:33:30,902 --> 00:33:32,236
Has it always been so for you?

540
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:37,441
When you were brought
here for the first time,

541
00:33:37,441 --> 00:33:39,877
against your will?

542
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:43,614
Your life traded
for a few coins?

543
00:33:45,617 --> 00:33:48,552
More than a few.

544
00:33:48,552 --> 00:33:49,987
Is that your worth, then?

545
00:33:56,794 --> 00:33:57,728
Has it ever occurred to you

546
00:33:57,728 --> 00:33:59,163
why the great Theokoles

547
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:00,831
would grace us
with his presence?

548
00:34:03,234 --> 00:34:05,669
A promise of wealth.

549
00:34:08,106 --> 00:34:11,308
The shadow has earned
a thousand fortunes.

550
00:34:11,308 --> 00:34:14,211
He comes here not for coin,

551
00:34:14,211 --> 00:34:16,180
he comes here for the glory

552
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,148
of facing the Champion of Capua.

553
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:21,285
The Undefeated Gaul.

554
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:25,409
Glory.

555
00:34:26,858 --> 00:34:28,992
There is no greater thing,

556
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,928
than standing victorious arena.

557
00:34:33,898 --> 00:34:38,435
Is there no purpose
beyond the blood?

558
00:34:38,435 --> 00:34:42,873
No dream beyond the
cheering crowd?

559
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:45,475
Is there nothing
else you fight for?

560
00:34:47,845 --> 00:34:50,480
Crixus, you are summoned.

561
00:35:15,707 --> 00:35:16,807
Step into the light.

562
00:35:20,778 --> 00:35:22,946
Let me gaze upon the
Champion of Capua.

563
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:29,319
You are truly a wonder.

564
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:30,354
As are you, Domina.

565
00:35:34,158 --> 00:35:38,161
We don't have much time and
I would see it well used.

566
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,234
Do I not stir you to passion?

567
00:35:44,234 --> 00:35:45,569
Yes, Domina.

568
00:35:51,376 --> 00:35:53,443
Your cock would disagree.

569
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:55,746
Excuse my distraction Domina.

570
00:35:55,746 --> 00:35:56,780
I have thoughts of tomorrow.

571
00:36:00,051 --> 00:36:05,455
I would have you in the moment,
deep inside me.

572
00:36:07,925 --> 00:36:10,294
I've never faced an
opponent like Theokoles...

573
00:36:11,629 --> 00:36:15,165
And he has never meet
a man like you...

574
00:36:20,672 --> 00:36:23,040
I beg a favor Domina.

575
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,008
Love makes a man
weak before battle...

576
00:36:41,926 --> 00:36:44,027
I would have you strong.

577
00:36:46,631 --> 00:36:49,933
We will forgo the pleasures
of a single evening,

578
00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:52,102
and pray to the gods
for many more to come.

579
00:37:01,245 --> 00:37:02,085
Domina.

580
00:37:30,074 --> 00:37:32,309
You are going to die
tomorrow aren't you?

581
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:35,912
Only the gods divine the future.

582
00:37:38,683 --> 00:37:41,551
Why didn't you let
Ilithyia help you?

583
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,620
She could have spoken
to her father..

584
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,255
To what end?

585
00:37:47,759 --> 00:37:48,859
Humiliation?

586
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:55,332
Honor and glory.

587
00:37:55,332 --> 00:37:56,767
That's all you care about,
isn't it?

588
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,844
Not all.

589
00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:16,420
Still the fool.

590
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,324
Still.

591
00:38:30,034 --> 00:38:31,435
You said love drains a man.

592
00:38:33,704 --> 00:38:37,674
It can give him hope,
in the right arms...

593
00:38:57,094 --> 00:38:58,695
The odds do not favor you.

594
00:39:00,531 --> 00:39:01,631
They seldom do.

595
00:39:04,368 --> 00:39:05,602
I've heard Barca has laid

596
00:39:05,602 --> 00:39:07,604
a large amount of coin on you.

597
00:39:07,604 --> 00:39:10,407
More towards Crixus,
but still...

598
00:39:10,407 --> 00:39:11,708
And you?

599
00:39:15,012 --> 00:39:20,450
If I had the means,
I would wager all with Barca.

600
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:23,520
You're too fucking
stubborn to die.

601
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:28,592
Every man has his end.

602
00:39:30,628 --> 00:39:33,263
I pray to the gods you
have not yet reached yours.

603
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:39,436
If they do not answer,

604
00:39:42,139 --> 00:39:43,907
I would ask a thing of you.

605
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:46,943
I will do everything
I can to find her.

606
00:39:52,817 --> 00:39:54,684
Now sleep.

607
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:56,219
Tomorrow you face a legend.

608
00:39:58,089 --> 00:40:00,490
And may yet become one yourself.

609
00:40:22,513 --> 00:40:23,647
Did you see it?!

610
00:40:23,647 --> 00:40:26,650
Septimus the victor, as I said!

611
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:29,553
Valarius always drops his
shield when he attacks,

612
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:32,188
a disadvantage
against the spear.

613
00:40:32,188 --> 00:40:33,723
The boy has a keen eye.

614
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:34,891
Towards gladiators, yes.

615
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:36,626
His studies are another matter.

616
00:40:46,003 --> 00:40:48,638
My hour of glory is long past.

617
00:40:48,638 --> 00:40:52,275
Yours stands before you.

618
00:40:52,275 --> 00:40:53,710
Heel old wounds.

619
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,481
Kill that fucking
son of a whore.

620
00:41:05,456 --> 00:41:07,591
Finally, the Primus.

621
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:10,360
Another moment and my
tongue would turn to dust.

622
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,080
Water.

623
00:41:12,964 --> 00:41:14,097
Apologies, Domina.

624
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:16,466
We've used our last.

625
00:41:16,466 --> 00:41:19,035
Please. Share some of mine.

626
00:41:20,538 --> 00:41:21,838
You're too kind, good Solonius.

627
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:24,407
You'd do the same,
if you were able.

628
00:41:24,407 --> 00:41:25,842
No matter.

629
00:41:25,842 --> 00:41:29,479
Soon Theokoles will honor
the gods with blood,

630
00:41:29,479 --> 00:41:32,382
they turn will bless
us with endless rain.

631
00:41:32,382 --> 00:41:34,217
I pray for the truth in it.

632
00:41:34,217 --> 00:41:36,820
This drought is
driving the city mad!

633
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,355
Unfortunate word has reached us

634
00:41:38,355 --> 00:41:41,992
that our dearest cousin Ovidius
was murdered in his home.

635
00:41:45,863 --> 00:41:46,796
Ovidius?

636
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:47,546
<i>No.</i>

637
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:52,135
I mentioned his wife
not a night ago.

638
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,370
What of his son?

639
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:56,039
He was so young.

640
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:00,076
Their villa was burnt,
only a few bodies yet recovered.

641
00:42:00,076 --> 00:42:03,513
I fear the boy is
among the ruins.

642
00:42:03,513 --> 00:42:05,949
A tragedy.

643
00:42:05,949 --> 00:42:08,618
One cannot but wonder what
would prompt such an act.

644
00:42:13,157 --> 00:42:14,758
<i>Let us turn our minds to
thoughts of rain,</i>

645
00:42:14,758 --> 00:42:17,193
<i>to cool the fevered
brow of our city.</i>

646
00:42:20,431 --> 00:42:23,333
Citizens of Capua!

647
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:24,868
Brothers of Rome!

648
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:30,273
In the name of my forefathers,

649
00:42:30,273 --> 00:42:34,177
I, Titus Calavius,
present to you,

650
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:37,313
the final event!

651
00:42:37,313 --> 00:42:39,949
<i>Your woman, is she the reason a
spectacle of blood and death,</i>

652
00:42:39,949 --> 00:42:41,685
you refuse to die?

653
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:45,255
<i>A sacrifice to Ceres,
she is.</i>

654
00:42:45,255 --> 00:42:46,990
<i>The great goddess
of renewal!</i>

655
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:49,292
Then perhaps there is
something beyond glory.

656
00:42:49,292 --> 00:42:51,461
<i>... shower us with an
ocean of rain!</i>

657
00:42:53,264 --> 00:42:59,703
From the house of Quintus
Lentulus Batiatus.

658
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:03,673
Behold, Spartacus! Thraex!

659
00:43:10,581 --> 00:43:16,019
<i>Joined in battle today by
the Undefeated Gaul!</i>

660
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:18,455
The Champion of Capua!

661
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:23,159
<i>Behold, Crixus!</i>

662
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:24,561
<i>Murmillo!</i>

663
00:43:28,265 --> 00:43:29,466
<i>Crixus! Crixus!</i>

664
00:43:29,466 --> 00:43:31,134
<i>Crixus!</i>

665
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:36,573
Capua!

666
00:43:40,277 --> 00:43:41,811
Shall we begin?

667
00:43:54,158 --> 00:43:58,094
Together they stand
against a man

668
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,896
<i>who has never fallen.</i>

669
00:43:59,896 --> 00:44:03,666
<i>A beast that has never
been tamed.</i>

670
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:09,072
<i>A legend that has never
been tarnished.</i>

671
00:44:09,072 --> 00:44:15,178
By the grace of Marcus
Decius Solonius,

672
00:44:15,178 --> 00:44:21,317
behold! Theokoles!
The shadow of death!

673
00:45:20,211 --> 00:45:21,211
Ahh!

674
00:45:24,615 --> 00:45:25,782
Begin!

675
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:44,500
They draw blood!

676
00:46:42,126 --> 00:46:43,493
Yes!

677
00:46:43,493 --> 00:46:44,827
Yes!

678
00:47:34,311 --> 00:47:36,512
Yeah, Capua!

679
00:48:00,304 --> 00:48:01,671
Capua!

680
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:04,073
Shall I begin?!

681
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,488
Get out of the way.

682
00:48:25,629 --> 00:48:28,297
Give ground,
or I'll kill you myself!

683
00:50:03,026 --> 00:50:05,061
Theokoles!

684
00:51:08,158 --> 00:51:10,293
<i>Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

685
00:51:19,236 --> 00:51:20,603
Yes!

686
00:52:58,001 --> 00:52:59,735
Spar - ta - cus!!

687
00:52:59,735 --> 00:53:00,585
Spar - ta - cus!!

688
00:53:06,890 --> 00:57:04,460

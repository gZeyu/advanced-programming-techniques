1
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:21,991
<i>We have seen misfortune.</i>

2
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:25,327
<i>Felt the sting of defeat.</i>

3
00:00:25,327 --> 00:00:29,432
The humility of vacant
purse and empty stomach.

4
00:00:29,432 --> 00:00:31,517
Some believed the House of Batiatus

5
00:00:31,517 --> 00:00:34,086
would never reclaim
its former glory.

6
00:00:34,086 --> 00:00:38,257
<i>That we would fade from memory,
forsaken by history.</i>

7
00:00:38,257 --> 00:00:40,793
But we have proved them wrong.

8
00:00:40,793 --> 00:00:42,161
Yeah!

9
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:44,013
We have proved the name Batiatus

10
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:46,983
will live long after we
have gone to dust and bone.

11
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:48,518
Yeah!

12
00:00:48,518 --> 00:00:52,054
So stand proud before
the bringer of rain!

13
00:00:52,054 --> 00:00:55,057
The slayer of the shadow of death!

14
00:00:55,057 --> 00:00:57,727
The new Champion of Capua!

15
00:00:59,163 --> 00:01:00,329
Spartacus!

16
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,532
Yeah!

17
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:14,911
Spartacus! Spartacus!

18
00:02:00,357 --> 00:02:05,027
A titan, his victory
eclipsing all others!

19
00:02:05,027 --> 00:02:07,096
<i>Quenching our thirst!</i>

20
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:10,533
<i>Fulfilling our hopes and dreams!</i>

21
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:13,102
Behold the man,
as he becomes legend!

22
00:02:13,102 --> 00:02:14,637
Yeah!

23
00:02:20,844 --> 00:02:22,345
This is only the beginning!

24
00:02:22,345 --> 00:02:26,182
I will build an empire of blood
and glory upon your name!

25
00:02:26,182 --> 00:02:29,285
He did not stand against
Theokoles on his own.

26
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:31,253
Crixus is not forgotten.

27
00:02:31,253 --> 00:02:34,490
He will always have position,
if he survives.

28
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,559
But Spartacus is the name
on the crowd's tongue.

29
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:37,860
And I would see it spoken

30
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,895
with ever increasing amazement.

31
00:02:39,895 --> 00:02:42,531
I defeated a man who
could not be defeated.

32
00:02:42,531 --> 00:02:44,500
What more could they expect of me?

33
00:02:46,436 --> 00:02:48,137
Everything!

34
00:02:48,137 --> 00:02:49,705
Their appetite is a great beast.

35
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:51,841
It must constantly be
fed with new delights.

36
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:53,943
<i>We'll start by changing
your fighting style.</i>

37
00:02:53,943 --> 00:02:57,246
Two swords,
as Theokoles fought with.

38
00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:58,714
We'll see the crowds
pleasure double

39
00:02:58,714 --> 00:03:00,716
<i>with their new hero
twice as deadly!</i>

40
00:03:00,716 --> 00:03:03,719
<i>And new armor, worthy of a legend!</i>

41
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,821
Men will be made to
feel smaller by it!

42
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:07,923
Women will moisten
at the very sight.

43
00:03:11,194 --> 00:03:13,162
Ah, but I forget.

44
00:03:13,162 --> 00:03:16,298
He has no hard purpose for
just any wet thigh, does he?

45
00:03:16,298 --> 00:03:19,101
He and his purpose
are not my concern.

46
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:21,504
<i>Fortunately the gods
feel otherwise.</i>

47
00:03:21,504 --> 00:03:24,407
<i>They shower him with more than
rain and accolades...</i>

48
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:26,742
They bless him with
news to lift the heart

49
00:03:26,742 --> 00:03:28,511
higher than the clouds.

50
00:03:30,113 --> 00:03:31,447
Sura?

51
00:03:31,447 --> 00:03:32,948
Found!

52
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:33,949
In the dark corners of Syria.

53
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:34,950
Where...Where is she?

54
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,951
Is she well?

55
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:37,486
Peace!

56
00:03:37,486 --> 00:03:39,522
<i>All will be revealed when
a mouth closes!</i>

57
00:03:39,522 --> 00:03:41,757
The syrian Glaber spoke
of sold her to a merchant,

58
00:03:41,757 --> 00:03:43,025
<i>the sea his mistress.</i>

59
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:44,894
He has recently docked on
the shores of Neapolis.

60
00:03:44,894 --> 00:03:46,162
On roman soil?

61
00:03:46,162 --> 00:03:47,430
<i>Your wife among the slaves.</i>

62
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,865
Two days ride from where you stand,
barring incident.

63
00:03:49,865 --> 00:03:51,100
When do we leave?

64
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,768
Is it wise to allow such a thing?

65
00:03:52,768 --> 00:03:55,171
My man already spurs his horse,
rest at ease.

66
00:03:55,171 --> 00:03:57,173
She moves ever closer
even as we speak.

67
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:06,115
You are an honorable man.

68
00:04:06,115 --> 00:04:08,317
And will forever bear my gratitude.

69
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:09,518
As you bear mine.

70
00:04:10,754 --> 00:04:11,921
Being reunited with your wife

71
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:13,823
is but the first of many rewards.

72
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:17,326
Dominus.

73
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:25,901
Secrets.

74
00:04:27,404 --> 00:04:29,405
Secrets upon secrets.

75
00:04:29,405 --> 00:04:31,507
The news of her discovery
only just reached me.

76
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:34,510
And what of good
Ovidius and his family?

77
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:38,481
Why did you keep plans towards
their slaughter from me?

78
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,051
And all to clear a few debts.

79
00:04:42,051 --> 00:04:44,887
It had nothing to do with debt,
except one of blood.

80
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:47,189
His was the hand behind attempt
on my life in the pits.

81
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:49,258
Ovidius?

82
00:04:49,258 --> 00:04:50,860
Moved to purpose by Solonius.

83
00:04:55,132 --> 00:04:57,433
I keep from you not out of secrecy,
but from love.

84
00:04:57,433 --> 00:05:00,336
I would not have you
stained by such things.

85
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:03,139
We are the toast of
the fucking city.

86
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,007
Let us pause and enjoy it.

87
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:23,659
<i>Yours alone.</i>

88
00:05:24,694 --> 00:05:26,362
Not to be shared?

89
00:05:26,362 --> 00:05:28,864
Your achievement in
earning it profound.

90
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:31,033
Made possible by your instruction.

91
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:33,502
My actions only set
you to the task.

92
00:05:33,502 --> 00:05:35,471
<i>By depriving Theokoles
of his life,</i>

93
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:38,741
you put end to a battle
left unfinished by my sword.

94
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:41,477
An end to my shame.

95
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:47,249
I live to see my wife again,
because of you.

96
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:50,553
A debt not soon forgotten.

97
00:05:51,688 --> 00:05:53,322
There is no balance between us.

98
00:05:54,758 --> 00:05:56,325
Only the promise of future glory.

99
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:02,865
Are candles permitted?

100
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:06,168
Sura was always fond of them.

101
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:10,272
You misunderstand.

102
00:06:10,272 --> 00:06:12,508
This cell is for you alone.

103
00:06:12,508 --> 00:06:14,543
<i>Wives are not permitted
to live among us.</i>

104
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:16,312
Then where will she stay?

105
00:06:16,312 --> 00:06:17,846
In the villa.

106
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:19,148
<i>Kept safe and well in return</i>

107
00:06:19,148 --> 00:06:21,917
<i>for good service to the Domina.</i>

108
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:23,719
As a slave.

109
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:24,887
As are we all.

110
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:28,190
<i>But you rise quickly,</i>

111
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,359
<i>unlike any other I've
ever witnessed.</i>

112
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:32,561
<i>Continue your ascent,
and you will gain freedom.</i>

113
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,964
For both of you.

114
00:06:45,675 --> 00:06:46,775
<i>Ashur.</i>

115
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:51,447
Barca!

116
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:53,048
I was this very moment
coming to have words.

117
00:06:53,048 --> 00:06:54,049
Keep them.

118
00:06:54,049 --> 00:06:56,018
I would have coin instead.

119
00:06:56,018 --> 00:06:59,188
It is no small marvel,
the fall of Theokoles.

120
00:06:59,188 --> 00:07:01,624
Your wager in the favor
of the unexpected outcome,

121
00:07:01,624 --> 00:07:03,459
the size of the odds...

122
00:07:04,294 --> 00:07:05,261
It's not a simple matter,

123
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:06,829
to cover a win of such margin, eh?

124
00:07:08,798 --> 00:07:11,133
I give no shit for margins.

125
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:14,236
Beg, steal, or kill
to cover what is owed.

126
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:15,638
Or you will have
two worthless legs.

127
00:07:15,638 --> 00:07:17,973
And nothing in between
to prop yourself up.

128
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:41,463
I've had exchange with the cripple.

129
00:07:41,463 --> 00:07:43,265
He pays what is owed?

130
00:07:43,265 --> 00:07:44,667
Soon the coin will be in hand.

131
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:46,201
Enough to buy our freedom.

132
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:56,679
Freedom, err...The word
is foreign to the tongue.

133
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:58,747
It will learn to savor the taste.

134
00:07:58,747 --> 00:08:00,482
What of the birds?

135
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:02,584
They will fly this place as we do.

136
00:08:02,584 --> 00:08:04,219
I will see what clothes
we have packed and ready.

137
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,425
Which direction shall
we travel and how far?

138
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:11,026
As far as desire wills our feet.

139
00:08:14,297 --> 00:08:15,364
This cloak.

140
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,801
It was the one you
wore when you left.

141
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,302
When good Ovidius was murdered.

142
00:08:20,302 --> 00:08:21,770
There was nothing good about him.

143
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,639
Then it was you who killed him?

144
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,740
<i>All his slaves?</i>

145
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,841
His family...

146
00:08:25,841 --> 00:08:28,243
My hands did what
they were commanded.

147
00:08:28,243 --> 00:08:29,311
<i>What of the young boy.</i>

148
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:30,679
Ovidius' son.

149
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:32,514
Did they take his life too?

150
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:33,515
Such were my order

151
00:08:35,785 --> 00:08:36,719
but you know of my affection

152
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,153
for delicate things.

153
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:41,156
The boy was spared,

154
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:43,592
and set to wander
far from the deed.

155
00:08:43,592 --> 00:08:46,295
By the time he is discovered,
we will be free.

156
00:08:47,564 --> 00:08:49,064
And your hands?

157
00:08:49,064 --> 00:08:51,200
Clean forever more.

158
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,501
And yours to command...

159
00:09:28,371 --> 00:09:31,039
Spartacus' victory ignites
the imagination of the city!

160
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,241
Orders for my men

161
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:34,042
flood in from every
family with half a name

162
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:35,277
and a little coin!

163
00:09:35,277 --> 00:09:38,213
Prosperity beyond measure
is within our reach!

164
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:40,249
As are those who
would have you dead.

165
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:43,952
I will see Solonius
pay for the grievance.

166
00:09:43,952 --> 00:09:45,821
But these things
are not be hurried.

167
00:09:47,257 --> 00:09:49,792
I would savor every drop
of sweat from his brow

168
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:53,729
as my noose tightens upon his neck.

169
00:09:53,729 --> 00:09:55,631
I would prefer it tighten quickly.

170
00:09:55,631 --> 00:09:57,633
Eh, everything to its season.

171
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:59,735
Turning towards more
pressing matters.

172
00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:02,004
Reuniting the thracian
with his wife?

173
00:10:03,106 --> 00:10:05,040
Not the matter I was referring to.

174
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:10,979
Have the girl's ass a
bit and I'll watch.

175
00:10:10,979 --> 00:10:12,681
And I would give
pleasure to your eyes...

176
00:10:27,697 --> 00:10:29,932
The thracian woman concerns me.

177
00:10:32,335 --> 00:10:33,535
The promise of finding her

178
00:10:33,535 --> 00:10:35,003
was the only thing
that kept him in check.

179
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,974
What if her presence reverts
him to his thracian ways,

180
00:10:38,974 --> 00:10:41,877
and thoughts of defiance?

181
00:10:41,877 --> 00:10:43,178
It will not.

182
00:10:44,214 --> 00:10:45,647
How can you be so sure?

183
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:49,284
Did you see the tears of
gratitude in his eyes?

184
00:10:51,454 --> 00:10:53,255
<i>Gratitude falls short of loyalty.</i>

185
00:10:55,725 --> 00:10:58,160
He's not the man Crixus is.

186
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,761
And Crixus is not the man he was,

187
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:02,764
and may never be again.

188
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:06,768
Spartacus will be
reunited with his wife.

189
00:11:09,105 --> 00:11:11,340
And in the act...

190
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,443
I will bind him to
us and this ludus...

191
00:11:14,443 --> 00:11:17,946
<i>Until god comes to claim us all...</i>

192
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:45,807
<i>How will you save us?</i>

193
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:49,077
From the rain.

194
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:51,380
Your victory splits the skies.

195
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,815
How will you close them
before we all drown?

196
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:55,684
You believe the rest
of the fools, then?

197
00:11:55,684 --> 00:11:57,452
That I am blessed by the gods?

198
00:11:57,452 --> 00:11:59,888
Miracles do take habit of
shooting out of your ass.

199
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:05,694
I've heard whispers of yet
more divine providence.

200
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:07,763
Sura.

201
00:12:07,763 --> 00:12:08,897
Is it true?

202
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:11,967
She speeds to my
arms from Neapolis.

203
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:14,803
And still you doubt
the god's favor you.

204
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:17,739
If what Sura has
been forced to endure

205
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:18,907
is parcel of their favor,

206
00:12:18,907 --> 00:12:20,809
I would rather they
turn their back on me.

207
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:21,810
If they exist at all.

208
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:22,811
She comes.

209
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:24,479
That is all that matters now.

210
00:12:28,251 --> 00:12:29,785
You once lived free in these lands.

211
00:12:31,054 --> 00:12:32,354
From which way does she travel?

212
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,624
The port in Neapolis
lies in that direction.

213
00:12:38,027 --> 00:12:39,795
Are there roads to the
mountains that lead east?

214
00:12:39,795 --> 00:12:41,763
Several.

215
00:12:41,763 --> 00:12:43,365
Which ones are the
most sparsely traveled?

216
00:12:44,601 --> 00:12:46,602
An odd question,
removed from the subject.

217
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:48,937
Not so far astray.

218
00:12:51,908 --> 00:12:54,309
Yes, some are sparsely traveled.

219
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:56,078
But not to the point of the
new champion of fucking Capua

220
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:59,581
going unnoticed, if overcome
by questionable thoughts.

221
00:12:59,581 --> 00:13:00,849
How long do you think
before Batiatus

222
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:03,752
would allow me to buy our freedom?

223
00:13:03,752 --> 00:13:06,188
How many years will she be
condemned to bow and scrape?

224
00:13:06,188 --> 00:13:07,556
Death the alternative?

225
00:13:07,556 --> 00:13:08,890
You move to escape
beyond these walls,

226
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,325
and that is surely
what you'll find.

227
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:11,727
Has no one ever
attempted such a thing?

228
00:13:11,727 --> 00:13:12,728
And lived?

229
00:13:12,728 --> 00:13:13,795
No.

230
00:13:13,795 --> 00:13:16,164
It is a thing born
of the impossible.

231
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:17,766
The same was said of
defeating Theokoles.

232
00:13:19,135 --> 00:13:20,636
You have a plan, then?

233
00:13:20,636 --> 00:13:22,070
One begins to take shape...

234
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:09,768
That's your plan?

235
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,937
I fear it malformed.

236
00:14:11,937 --> 00:14:13,138
In what way?

237
00:14:13,138 --> 00:14:14,873
Weapons, to begin.

238
00:14:14,873 --> 00:14:16,341
In large supply at a ludus.

239
00:14:16,341 --> 00:14:18,610
Ah, but kept by lock and key.

240
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,011
Or do you believe the gods
will drop one from the sky

241
00:14:20,011 --> 00:14:21,880
along with the rain?

242
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,882
I believe in opportunity.

243
00:14:24,984 --> 00:14:26,918
And the power of reason
to seize upon it.

244
00:14:26,918 --> 00:14:28,420
Fair enough.

245
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,821
Say you somehow
"reason" up a weapon.

246
00:14:29,821 --> 00:14:31,156
What of a horse?

247
00:14:31,156 --> 00:14:32,591
You'll never reach the
mountains without one.

248
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:34,793
Dominus provides one.

249
00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:37,362
Sura arrives by cart...

250
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:52,177
Well it won't matter.

251
00:14:52,177 --> 00:14:54,512
Weapons, horses, they're
the least of your concerns.

252
00:14:54,512 --> 00:14:56,715
And the greatest?

253
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:58,550
The one man that could stop you...

254
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:43,361
I had not considered him.

255
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:45,297
You have not
considered many things.

256
00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:46,965
Take pause, I beg of you.

257
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:47,715
No.

258
00:15:48,901 --> 00:15:50,435
We will have our freedom.

259
00:15:51,737 --> 00:15:52,671
I will take her in my arms,

260
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:54,105
and hear her speak my name.

261
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,541
My name.

262
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,077
Not the one the romans
branded me with.

263
00:15:59,077 --> 00:16:00,211
I cannot help you in this.

264
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:01,313
I would not ask it.

265
00:16:01,313 --> 00:16:02,247
If it weren't for my own family...

266
00:16:02,247 --> 00:16:03,748
Give it no thought.

267
00:16:03,748 --> 00:16:05,417
Is there nothing I can say
to turn you from this path?

268
00:16:05,918 --> 00:16:07,185
Nothing.

269
00:16:09,689 --> 00:16:11,623
Then may the gods you don't
believe in favor you.

270
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:55,934
<i>A fine figure,
is he not?</i>

271
00:16:55,934 --> 00:16:58,470
A god among men.

272
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,138
I've never beheld such
magnificent armor.

273
00:17:03,909 --> 00:17:06,311
If you grant permission,

274
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:08,446
I would wear it upon
my wife's return.

275
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:09,681
A move to impress?

276
00:17:11,817 --> 00:17:13,651
She will marvel at the sight.

277
00:17:42,014 --> 00:17:44,449
A man must always appear his
best in the eyes of love.

278
00:17:44,449 --> 00:17:45,884
<i>You may wear it.</i>

279
00:17:45,884 --> 00:17:46,985
And I will even stand by your side

280
00:17:46,985 --> 00:17:49,354
while you welcome her
with your open arms.

281
00:17:49,354 --> 00:17:51,322
The swords, however...

282
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:52,557
What need would I have of them?

283
00:17:56,762 --> 00:17:58,196
Can it be?!

284
00:17:58,196 --> 00:18:01,299
The legend himself among us?!

285
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:02,634
Magistrate Calavius!

286
00:18:02,634 --> 00:18:03,968
Good fortune to see you.

287
00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:05,804
No, the good fortune is mine!

288
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:07,205
My son Numerius
cannot cease his talk

289
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:11,242
of Spartacus and his
victory over Theokoles.

290
00:18:11,242 --> 00:18:13,645
He demanded a trip to
market to obtain something

291
00:18:13,645 --> 00:18:16,081
of Thrace in your man's honor.

292
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:17,248
Show him.

293
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:21,653
The merchant said it
was a warrior's weapon.

294
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:28,159
As well it is.

295
00:18:30,629 --> 00:18:31,896
See these marks?

296
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,500
Thracians notch their hilts.

297
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,968
One for every kill.

298
00:18:39,305 --> 00:18:42,173
<i>How many made to yours after
slaying Theokoles?</i>

299
00:18:42,173 --> 00:18:44,375
<i>He must have been worth
ten at least!</i>

300
00:18:45,644 --> 00:18:47,779
If I could wield a sword
half as well you...

301
00:18:50,816 --> 00:18:52,183
Join us at my master's ludus

302
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:55,987
and I will teach you the blow

303
00:18:55,987 --> 00:18:58,623
that brought death to the shadow.

304
00:18:58,623 --> 00:18:59,824
<i>A splendid notion!</i>

305
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:02,961
<i>Father?</i>

306
00:19:03,963 --> 00:19:06,131
Perhaps a visit later this afternoon.

307
00:19:06,131 --> 00:19:08,066
<i>Why make the boy suffer
with anticipation?</i>

308
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:09,200
Join us presently.

309
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,070
Joy must be delayed
in favor of sorrow.

310
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,639
I attend to matters
relating my cousin's murder.

311
00:19:15,774 --> 00:19:17,175
<i>Good Ovidius.</i>

312
00:19:17,175 --> 00:19:19,844
The heart constricts
at the thought.

313
00:19:19,844 --> 00:19:21,913
But swells with
promise of vengeance.

314
00:19:23,716 --> 00:19:25,250
<i>Numerius!
Come!</i>

315
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,319
Your generous hospitality
will be appreciated shortly.

316
00:19:36,028 --> 00:19:38,496
An invitation to school
the magistrate's son?

317
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:42,066
Apologies,
if I offered out of turn.

318
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:44,335
Fuck apologies!

319
00:19:44,335 --> 00:19:45,904
Shrewd maneuvering,
if ever I saw it!

320
00:19:46,939 --> 00:19:48,173
I'll make a roman of you yet!

321
00:19:58,884 --> 00:20:02,453
Should his eyes not be open?

322
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:03,955
Calm is needed to heal the wound.

323
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:05,590
I keep him at rest with herb.

324
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,458
He will recover?

325
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,960
I've done what I can.

326
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,029
It rests in the hands of the gods.

327
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:12,263
No.

328
00:20:13,265 --> 00:20:16,401
His life now rests in your hands.

329
00:20:16,401 --> 00:20:17,669
And I will see them parted

330
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:20,071
from your fucking body if he dies.

331
00:20:24,743 --> 00:20:26,444
See how they all look at you?

332
00:20:27,913 --> 00:20:29,581
My father had many champions,

333
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:31,649
but none to rival
the great Spartacus!

334
00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:37,889
You can almost smell the coins
dropping into our purse.

335
00:20:39,158 --> 00:20:41,326
If I may, what remains
of my own coin,

336
00:20:41,326 --> 00:20:43,461
after Sura's transport?

337
00:20:43,461 --> 00:20:45,230
You wish to buy
something for your wife?

338
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,598
This market is for proper romans,

339
00:20:46,598 --> 00:20:48,833
it would not suit a slave.

340
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,602
I ask not for me, but for the men.

341
00:20:52,238 --> 00:20:56,241
Wine and women,
in celebration of my victory.

342
00:20:56,241 --> 00:20:59,010
A noble gesture,
to be much appreciated.

343
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:01,579
You pay with your own coin,

344
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:02,747
yet their happiness
is a benefit to me.

345
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,684
Very well, let it be done.

346
00:21:06,684 --> 00:21:09,354
Ah, Marcellus is of sound
choice towards the vice.

347
00:21:09,354 --> 00:21:10,588
Shall I make arrangement?

348
00:21:14,426 --> 00:21:16,094
See that there is ample remainder.

349
00:21:16,094 --> 00:21:17,295
Dominus.

350
00:21:18,797 --> 00:21:20,798
Come let us prepare for
the magistrate's arrival.

351
00:21:35,848 --> 00:21:37,448
More threats then, is it?

352
00:21:37,448 --> 00:21:38,583
No.

353
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:42,387
Coin, to the purpose
of wine and whores.

354
00:21:42,387 --> 00:21:44,656
Enough to wet tongue and
cock for my master's men.

355
00:21:48,193 --> 00:21:50,795
And a large matter of debt
to the gladiator Barca,

356
00:21:50,795 --> 00:21:53,364
that I would ask assistance with...

357
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:02,540
I have no hand for this.

358
00:22:06,812 --> 00:22:07,845
Your belt and adornments.

359
00:22:07,845 --> 00:22:10,048
<i>They hinder your purpose.</i>

360
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:12,283
Your armor is heavy and
yet you move swiftly.

361
00:22:12,283 --> 00:22:14,352
<i>In time, so will you.</i>

362
00:22:14,352 --> 00:22:16,587
But a true warrior
needs only a sword

363
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:18,323
to cleave his fate.

364
00:22:26,198 --> 00:22:27,432
<i>I see your meaning.</i>

365
00:22:27,432 --> 00:22:29,934
Let us go again.

366
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:33,104
Play Theokoles, and I will
attempt to bring the rains...

367
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,015
<i>Apologies
for our late arrival.</i>

368
00:22:44,015 --> 00:22:45,917
My inquiry at my
cousin's villa was...

369
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:47,085
Overwhelming.

370
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,054
How did you fare?

371
00:22:50,054 --> 00:22:52,690
As expected when walking
on dead relatives.

372
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:56,194
Your son is a quick
study with the sword.

373
00:22:56,194 --> 00:22:58,596
Born of a fascination
with gladiators.

374
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,700
<i>His fifteenth
birthday approaches,</i>

375
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,535
<i>my ears are assaulted with
request for a pair</i>

376
00:23:04,535 --> 00:23:06,371
<i>to show demonstration
at his party.</i>

377
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,808
<i>I had thought to engage
Solonius' men,</i>

378
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:12,243
but his wares have
fallen out of fashion

379
00:23:12,243 --> 00:23:14,679
since your victory over Theokoles.

380
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:16,848
It seems your son has a
taste for what is in favor.

381
00:23:16,848 --> 00:23:18,649
And I would see him well fed.

382
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:20,952
Come. Let us negotiate
a price for the meal.

383
00:23:20,952 --> 00:23:22,420
<i>Begging pardon,
Dominus.</i>

384
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,189
I bring word of great import
to magistrate Calavius.

385
00:23:25,189 --> 00:23:26,290
An important man,

386
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,025
seldom out of reach
of public matters!

387
00:23:31,563 --> 00:23:35,233
Ah, this message
strikes more personal.

388
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:37,368
Ovidius' boy yet lives!

389
00:23:39,104 --> 00:23:40,304
Well this is fantastic.

390
00:23:40,304 --> 00:23:41,572
How can it be?

391
00:23:42,408 --> 00:23:43,608
By Jupiter's blessing.

392
00:23:43,608 --> 00:23:44,742
<i>He was discovered miles
north of Capua,</i>

393
00:23:44,742 --> 00:23:46,911
<i>wandering the road!</i>

394
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:48,212
What of his words?

395
00:23:48,212 --> 00:23:49,280
Does he describe the horrors?

396
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,281
How he came to survive.

397
00:23:50,281 --> 00:23:51,582
Details not yet clear.

398
00:23:51,582 --> 00:23:53,084
Numerius, come!

399
00:23:55,854 --> 00:23:57,054
Do not forget your things.

400
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:02,093
Gratitude for the lesson.

401
00:24:02,093 --> 00:24:04,028
It was an honor.

402
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:05,530
<i>Numerius!</i>

403
00:24:20,012 --> 00:24:21,846
How can the boy still be alive?

404
00:24:21,846 --> 00:24:23,181
He could not.

405
00:24:23,181 --> 00:24:24,515
<i>Your eyes held his death?</i>

406
00:24:24,515 --> 00:24:25,265
<i>No.</i>

407
00:24:26,718 --> 00:24:28,686
I left the deed in Barca's hands.

408
00:24:28,686 --> 00:24:30,421
<i>And our lives as well.</i>

409
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,157
What are we going to do?

410
00:24:33,157 --> 00:24:34,258
Fuck. Think!

411
00:24:34,258 --> 00:24:36,294
<i>Pardon the intrusion.</i>

412
00:24:36,294 --> 00:24:38,062
Provision for the
celebration arrive.

413
00:24:38,764 --> 00:24:40,498
Cunt with celebration!

414
00:24:40,498 --> 00:24:42,700
We are betrayed by the
beast of fucking Carthage

415
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,336
and you bray about wine and whores!

416
00:24:46,104 --> 00:24:47,371
Barca?

417
00:24:47,371 --> 00:24:48,372
Yeah.

418
00:24:48,372 --> 00:24:50,341
The man has always been loyal.

419
00:24:50,341 --> 00:24:51,976
As a snake to the breast.

420
00:24:51,976 --> 00:24:54,312
The son of Ovidius lives.

421
00:24:54,312 --> 00:24:56,047
Unfortunate news.

422
00:24:57,616 --> 00:24:59,150
Would the boy know your face?

423
00:24:59,918 --> 00:25:01,853
No I was in shadow.

424
00:25:02,855 --> 00:25:03,821
But Barca was clearly revealed.

425
00:25:05,491 --> 00:25:07,391
I cannot believe Barca
would betray you.

426
00:25:10,562 --> 00:25:11,829
And yet...

427
00:25:13,866 --> 00:25:16,501
If you have knowledge,
bring it to light.

428
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,605
Barca placed a wager
against Theokoles,

429
00:25:20,605 --> 00:25:21,839
winning sizable coin.

430
00:25:22,841 --> 00:25:24,642
I overheard him whisper to Pietros

431
00:25:24,642 --> 00:25:27,745
intentions to buy
their freedom with it.

432
00:25:27,745 --> 00:25:30,248
Barca has never mentioned
desire to leave these walls.

433
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,551
He seeks to fly before discovery.

434
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,987
If the child is allowed
to look upon his face,

435
00:25:35,987 --> 00:25:38,155
he will be known as your man.

436
00:25:38,155 --> 00:25:39,557
Gather proper guard
and return with Barca.

437
00:25:39,557 --> 00:25:41,526
I would hear truth
spilled from his mouth.

438
00:25:41,526 --> 00:25:45,229
When a man is pressed,
lies flow with greater ease.

439
00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:47,298
End him and be done with it.

440
00:25:47,298 --> 00:25:48,866
Not before I look into his eyes,

441
00:25:48,866 --> 00:25:51,035
and see if treachery lurks there.

442
00:25:52,337 --> 00:25:54,305
Perhaps there is another
path to illumination.

443
00:25:56,341 --> 00:25:59,477
One traveled by more
delicate sensibilities....

444
00:26:27,801 --> 00:26:30,502
Tomorrow the men will
be slow from drink.

445
00:26:31,304 --> 00:26:33,372
And half the guards with them.

446
00:26:37,928 --> 00:26:39,862
There is one that does not partake

447
00:26:39,862 --> 00:26:41,697
<i>in your joyous offerings...</i>

448
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:46,002
<i>A man of higher principle,
not so easily distracted.</i>

449
00:26:48,472 --> 00:26:50,606
How does Crixus fare?

450
00:26:50,606 --> 00:26:53,376
Adrift in the land of dreams.

451
00:26:53,376 --> 00:26:56,079
Kept there yet by the Medicus,
in hope of recovery.

452
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:01,084
I would pay my respects.

453
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:10,126
You drown me!

454
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:12,562
In more than just wine...

455
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,266
Pietros.

456
00:27:17,266 --> 00:27:18,634
You are summoned.

457
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:37,286
<i>What are you doing?</i>

458
00:27:39,189 --> 00:27:43,025
I come to share drink with
my partner in victory!

459
00:27:43,025 --> 00:27:45,828
Well, pay your respects and be gone,
he needs rest.

460
00:27:47,164 --> 00:27:48,865
And keep that fucking
wine from his lips.

461
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:01,911
Without you, brother,

462
00:28:01,911 --> 00:28:03,846
my blood would have
fallen in the arena

463
00:28:03,846 --> 00:28:05,815
instead of the rain!

464
00:28:05,815 --> 00:28:10,286
May the gods forever honor Crixus,
the Undefeated Gaul!

465
00:28:18,028 --> 00:28:19,529
And forgive the pain I cause.

466
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,471
Move aside!

467
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,073
His wound has reopened.

468
00:28:31,073 --> 00:28:32,074
The brown jar!

469
00:28:32,074 --> 00:28:33,209
Quickly!

470
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:35,411
Will this heal him?

471
00:28:35,411 --> 00:28:36,161
No.

472
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,248
But it will calm him to sleep
so that I may seal the wound.

473
00:28:45,522 --> 00:28:47,290
Will he be all right?

474
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,858
Get the fuck out!

475
00:29:02,906 --> 00:29:04,073
I've had too much wine already...

476
00:29:04,073 --> 00:29:05,041
None of worth.

477
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:06,108
This is falernian,

478
00:29:06,108 --> 00:29:07,710
none of that swill
flowing below us.

479
00:29:11,181 --> 00:29:14,684
Um, it truly tastes of the gods.

480
00:29:14,684 --> 00:29:15,985
And brings us closer to them.

481
00:29:18,355 --> 00:29:19,922
How fares Barca?

482
00:29:19,922 --> 00:29:21,991
In fine spirits,
as are all the men.

483
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,427
Is your confidence to be trusted?

484
00:29:24,427 --> 00:29:26,929
Yes, of course Dominus.

485
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:28,998
Several days ago,

486
00:29:28,998 --> 00:29:30,933
I was forced to take
retribution against Ovidius,

487
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:32,134
the grain merchant.

488
00:29:32,134 --> 00:29:34,270
He had made attempt on
my life in the pits.

489
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,905
The man was a danger
and not to be trusted,

490
00:29:35,905 --> 00:29:37,139
he had to be handled accordingly.

491
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:39,475
You understand?

492
00:29:39,475 --> 00:29:40,710
Now rumors abounds
that more than Ovidius

493
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,711
gave up their lives.

494
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:43,412
His entire family, slain.

495
00:29:43,412 --> 00:29:44,580
There was even a child.

496
00:29:46,216 --> 00:29:47,717
The rest I can put from mind.

497
00:29:47,717 --> 00:29:50,753
But the boy,
he troubles my conscience.

498
00:29:50,753 --> 00:29:52,855
If Barca exceeded my orders and
laid hand to such an act...

499
00:29:52,855 --> 00:29:54,390
No, he didn't kill the boy.

500
00:29:56,827 --> 00:29:58,928
Perhaps you only tell
me what I wish to hear.

501
00:29:58,928 --> 00:29:59,695
No, no, no.

502
00:29:59,695 --> 00:30:00,863
He told me so himself.

503
00:30:00,863 --> 00:30:02,465
He swore he'd never harm a child.

504
00:30:05,502 --> 00:30:07,370
Well this gives reason to
put conscience to rest.

505
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:10,740
He'll be so pleased to know it.

506
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,875
We'll keep it from him yet a while.

507
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:13,943
I do not wish to
taint the celebration

508
00:30:13,943 --> 00:30:16,479
with such dark thoughts.

509
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:18,247
Yes, Dominus.

510
00:30:18,247 --> 00:30:19,849
Thank you for your honesty,
Pietros.

511
00:30:31,028 --> 00:30:33,029
The true nature of
the man is revealed.

512
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:36,332
I would not have thought it of him.

513
00:30:39,202 --> 00:30:41,037
Let Barca hoist his cup a while.

514
00:30:41,037 --> 00:30:42,204
When his wits are damp with wine

515
00:30:42,204 --> 00:30:45,174
then I will see him
rewarded for his loyalty.

516
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:47,476
Dominus.

517
00:31:21,578 --> 00:31:22,712
You smell of wine.

518
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,716
I bring cups, full of celebration.

519
00:31:27,584 --> 00:31:29,118
I honor your victory.

520
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,187
With prayer.

521
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,626
Your instruction made
possible reunion with my wife.

522
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:39,462
I would raise cups in gratitude.

523
00:31:40,464 --> 00:31:42,765
The sentiment is well received.

524
00:31:42,765 --> 00:31:45,201
But wine has not passed
my lips for many years.

525
00:31:46,637 --> 00:31:47,937
Your gods forbid it?

526
00:31:47,937 --> 00:31:49,171
No.

527
00:31:53,944 --> 00:31:55,277
It is a matter of discipline.

528
00:31:58,715 --> 00:32:00,716
Sura always cautioned
toward the same.

529
00:32:00,716 --> 00:32:02,018
A wise woman.

530
00:32:03,687 --> 00:32:05,388
Far beyond the station
of her husband.

531
00:32:07,257 --> 00:32:08,891
If she had not come into my life...

532
00:32:08,891 --> 00:32:10,626
And now she returns.

533
00:32:11,995 --> 00:32:13,162
The gods have truly blessed you.

534
00:32:14,297 --> 00:32:15,631
Sura would say the same.

535
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,734
And you?

536
00:32:18,734 --> 00:32:20,636
The gods and I do not
tread common ground.

537
00:32:21,705 --> 00:32:24,340
Although she made effort many times

538
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,709
to place us at even footing.

539
00:32:26,709 --> 00:32:28,678
<i>Wise and understanding.</i>

540
00:32:28,678 --> 00:32:31,213
To love a man despite
his shortcomings...

541
00:32:31,213 --> 00:32:33,916
She is the only reason my
heart beats within my chest.

542
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:35,418
To find love such as this...

543
00:32:38,055 --> 00:32:39,522
A rare and fortunate thing.

544
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:43,125
You speak from knowledge?

545
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:46,595
A wife of my own.

546
00:32:48,331 --> 00:32:50,232
The thought of her
ever upon my mind.

547
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,804
Does she live?

548
00:32:58,642 --> 00:32:59,975
In memory.

549
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,315
I would have desired to meet her.

550
00:33:06,315 --> 00:33:08,517
And tell her of her
husband's worth.

551
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,458
Apologies for
disturbing your prayers.

552
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,127
<i>Spartacus.</i>

553
00:33:25,168 --> 00:33:26,435
I cannot drink to victory.

554
00:33:28,672 --> 00:33:30,473
But to your wife,

555
00:33:31,441 --> 00:33:33,375
and her joyous return...

556
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,314
Discipline gives way to the moment.

557
00:33:40,016 --> 00:33:41,250
You honor us.

558
00:34:37,463 --> 00:34:39,298
Wow, what did the Dominus require?

559
00:34:39,298 --> 00:34:40,832
Nothing of import...

560
00:34:43,536 --> 00:34:45,437
You kiss with purpose.

561
00:34:45,437 --> 00:34:47,606
For the thought of freedom...

562
00:34:56,849 --> 00:34:58,583
A word, if I may.

563
00:34:58,583 --> 00:35:01,653
Fuck your words,
unless coupled with coin.

564
00:35:01,653 --> 00:35:03,722
The very matter I came to discuss.

565
00:35:03,722 --> 00:35:05,791
I've secured a sizable
loan from good Marcellus,

566
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:07,259
to cover your winnings.

567
00:35:07,259 --> 00:35:09,094
The terms of interest
were outrageous..

568
00:35:09,094 --> 00:35:10,362
Give it here.

569
00:35:10,362 --> 00:35:12,831
Marcellus will bring it
when he collects his whore,

570
00:35:12,831 --> 00:35:13,965
in the morning.

571
00:35:16,736 --> 00:35:19,137
You interrupt my cock
with empty hands?

572
00:35:19,137 --> 00:35:20,539
And intelligence.

573
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:22,407
Batiatus knows of your
desire for freedom,

574
00:35:22,407 --> 00:35:25,143
and makes noise for
discussing terms.

575
00:35:25,143 --> 00:35:27,779
Your skills, while
impressive in the arena,

576
00:35:27,779 --> 00:35:32,084
lack a certain gentle touch
in the art of negotiation.

577
00:35:32,084 --> 00:35:34,619
I can offer to bargain a
better price from Batiatus

578
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:35,987
for your release.

579
00:35:35,987 --> 00:35:38,890
Half the difference to be
subtracted from my debt to you.

580
00:35:40,727 --> 00:35:41,993
Batiatus is in agreeable spirits.

581
00:35:41,993 --> 00:35:43,562
If we move with haste...

582
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,964
Go.

583
00:35:47,266 --> 00:35:50,836
Lets go and call him Dominus,
for the final time.

584
00:36:13,326 --> 00:36:16,595
I hear whispers you seek freedom.

585
00:36:18,331 --> 00:36:21,466
Ashur represents me
in the discussion.

586
00:36:23,436 --> 00:36:24,469
Discussion?

587
00:36:25,605 --> 00:36:27,339
There's none to be
had in the matter.

588
00:36:27,339 --> 00:36:28,373
The bond between master and slave

589
00:36:28,373 --> 00:36:29,708
has already been dissolved...

590
00:36:35,047 --> 00:36:36,515
The moment you disobeyed me.

591
00:36:38,117 --> 00:36:39,184
Disobeyed?

592
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,888
The son of Ovidius lives.

593
00:36:49,796 --> 00:36:51,329
Impossible.

594
00:36:51,329 --> 00:36:53,265
The magistrate rides
to retrieve him.

595
00:36:53,265 --> 00:36:55,834
Yet breathing,
small fingers trembling

596
00:36:55,834 --> 00:36:58,670
to reveal the beast that
took away his family.

597
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,971
<i>This cannot be.</i>

598
00:36:59,971 --> 00:37:01,973
My hands upon his throat,

599
00:37:01,973 --> 00:37:03,975
I felt the life flee from his body.

600
00:37:07,346 --> 00:37:08,847
Your lover spoke otherwise.

601
00:37:11,284 --> 00:37:12,451
Pietros?

602
00:37:14,187 --> 00:37:15,120
You told him the boy lives.

603
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,254
Did you not?

604
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,924
I did.

605
00:37:18,924 --> 00:37:21,493
<i>But only to calm him.</i>

606
00:37:21,493 --> 00:37:24,095
If he knew the child's
blood stained my hands...

607
00:37:24,095 --> 00:37:26,097
So you lied to him?

608
00:37:29,001 --> 00:37:30,402
Or he lies to you now.

609
00:37:33,172 --> 00:37:36,541
Either way, we've a
serious issue of trust.

610
00:37:39,946 --> 00:37:42,047
Dominus, let me expl...

611
00:37:49,255 --> 00:37:50,589
Well, stop him!

612
00:39:21,314 --> 00:39:22,948
Now you're free.

613
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:43,210
Barca purchased his freedom.

614
00:40:44,545 --> 00:40:45,679
We wished him well

615
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:47,447
and escorted him through
the gates of the villa.

616
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:48,949
Do you understand?

617
00:40:50,385 --> 00:40:51,685
Yes, Domina.

618
00:40:51,685 --> 00:40:53,654
Do you understand?

619
00:40:53,654 --> 00:40:54,855
Yes!

620
00:40:54,855 --> 00:40:56,957
<i>Open up.</i>

621
00:40:58,993 --> 00:41:00,127
Juno's cunt!

622
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:01,328
What now?!

623
00:41:01,328 --> 00:41:03,597
<i>Make way for
the magistrate.</i>

624
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:04,898
Fuck!?

625
00:41:04,898 --> 00:41:06,300
Close the curtains!

626
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,301
Santos clean the blood up in there,

627
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:08,302
get it cleaned up!

628
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:09,536
Make way!

629
00:41:10,405 --> 00:41:11,805
Batiatus!

630
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:13,273
Magistrate.

631
00:41:13,273 --> 00:41:15,142
You call at unexpected hour.

632
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:17,611
Drawn by matters that
will not wait for dawn.

633
00:41:17,611 --> 00:41:21,281
What new offense is this?

634
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:22,316
Ah, nothing.

635
00:41:22,316 --> 00:41:24,918
A disobedient slave,
freshly corrected.

636
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:27,888
Not the only wretch deserving
of blood this night.

637
00:41:27,888 --> 00:41:30,457
I have just now returned
from the promised reunion

638
00:41:30,457 --> 00:41:32,559
with Ovidius' son,

639
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:35,295
and would have words with
a man seen in your house.

640
00:41:36,064 --> 00:41:37,631
Which man do you speak of?

641
00:41:37,631 --> 00:41:40,233
The messenger that filled
my heart with false hope.

642
00:41:41,703 --> 00:41:43,570
Messenger?

643
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:46,206
Ovidius' child was
not seen on any road.

644
00:41:46,206 --> 00:41:47,341
Returning to the city,

645
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:49,609
we had news that his
body was discovered

646
00:41:49,609 --> 00:41:51,411
among the ashes of
my cousin's villa.

647
00:41:53,247 --> 00:41:55,382
The messenger lied...

648
00:41:55,382 --> 00:41:56,817
I will have knowledge
of the reason,

649
00:41:56,817 --> 00:41:59,219
along with the fool's tongue.

650
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:01,855
Every effort will be exhausted
until the villain is discovered.

651
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:08,462
Coin.

652
00:42:08,462 --> 00:42:10,364
Paired with gratitude.

653
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:12,466
The messenger had the
desired effect, then?

654
00:42:12,466 --> 00:42:14,101
My concerns have been laid to rest,

655
00:42:14,101 --> 00:42:17,170
sharing grave with Barca and
his thirst for winnings.

656
00:42:21,776 --> 00:42:22,843
There's no chance the magistrate

657
00:42:22,843 --> 00:42:25,212
will deduce the source
of this message?

658
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:27,547
Not unless hades speaks
of it from the underworld.

659
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:28,297
Um.

660
00:42:28,983 --> 00:42:31,485
The messenger has
been put to grass.

661
00:42:31,485 --> 00:42:32,819
And you will follow,

662
00:42:32,819 --> 00:42:36,490
if a word of this transaction
parts your lips again.

663
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,201
I shit myself.

664
00:42:50,338 --> 00:42:51,838
<i>Ashur?</i>

665
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:53,306
Ashur.

666
00:42:53,306 --> 00:42:54,608
Young Pietros!

667
00:42:54,608 --> 00:42:56,109
How does the day find you?

668
00:42:56,109 --> 00:42:57,310
As the night, filled with worry.

669
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,311
Barca never returned.

670
00:42:58,311 --> 00:42:59,312
Nor will he.

671
00:42:59,312 --> 00:43:00,313
He has his freedom.

672
00:43:00,313 --> 00:43:01,314
Freedom?

673
00:43:01,314 --> 00:43:02,315
Yes.

674
00:43:02,315 --> 00:43:03,650
Purchased from our Dominus.

675
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:06,219
I could barely keep pace
as we saw him to the gates.

676
00:43:07,622 --> 00:43:10,323
He was to take me with him.

677
00:43:10,323 --> 00:43:13,126
The price of freedom was too
steep for the both of you.

678
00:43:13,126 --> 00:43:15,395
But do not worry.

679
00:43:15,395 --> 00:43:18,565
I'm sure Barca will find another
tight hole to sit on his cock.

680
00:43:18,565 --> 00:43:21,001
One he doesn't have to pay for.

681
00:43:43,424 --> 00:43:44,991
Jupiter's cock, my head.

682
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,195
I can barely stand
for want of vomit.

683
00:43:48,195 --> 00:43:49,629
You're in large company.

684
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:55,368
No one in condition to
halt a man of purpose.

685
00:43:55,368 --> 00:43:56,670
Such by design.

686
00:43:57,939 --> 00:44:00,507
Doctore's usually up before the sun,
whip in hand.

687
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:03,110
Will he ever rise again?

688
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,911
He will.

689
00:44:04,911 --> 00:44:06,279
But not for many hours.

690
00:44:06,279 --> 00:44:07,848
Oh, your chances improve, then.

691
00:44:09,317 --> 00:44:10,984
To the point of certainty.

692
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:12,552
Nothing is ever so.

693
00:44:13,688 --> 00:44:14,988
Look even if you ride
beyond the gates,

694
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:16,289
the guards will pursue.

695
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:18,258
They will be commanded
against such action.

696
00:44:19,961 --> 00:44:21,761
You actually expect
them to obey you?

697
00:44:21,761 --> 00:44:22,929
No.

698
00:44:22,929 --> 00:44:25,065
I expect them to
obey their master...

699
00:44:29,403 --> 00:44:32,405
Drop your fucking swords!

700
00:44:32,405 --> 00:44:33,807
Do it!

701
00:44:35,343 --> 00:44:37,777
I will release him when we are
in the cover of the mountains.

702
00:44:37,777 --> 00:44:40,280
<i>Spartacus!</i>

703
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,048
Your wife's cart
appears upon the road!

704
00:44:42,048 --> 00:44:44,151
I'll be with you presently!

705
00:44:45,186 --> 00:44:47,420
I urge you to
reconsider one last time.

706
00:44:48,523 --> 00:44:50,924
Sura will be free.

707
00:44:50,924 --> 00:44:53,460
In this life, or the one after,

708
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,396
with her husband by her side.

709
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:03,703
May the gods see you both
upon the plains of Thrace.

710
00:45:27,295 --> 00:45:28,461
The pool is clear.

711
00:45:28,461 --> 00:45:30,764
As if it never happened.

712
00:45:31,632 --> 00:45:32,933
A regrettable misunderstanding.

713
00:45:33,935 --> 00:45:35,402
The man was yet loyal.

714
00:45:37,171 --> 00:45:38,438
He wished for his freedom.

715
00:45:39,407 --> 00:45:41,174
A betrayal in itself.

716
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:45,011
Come.

717
00:45:45,011 --> 00:45:46,213
To happier thoughts.

718
00:45:46,213 --> 00:45:47,881
The thracian's wife approaches.

719
00:45:47,881 --> 00:45:50,483
How is that cause for cheer?

720
00:45:50,483 --> 00:45:52,586
Her arrival will only
remind him of his old life,

721
00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:53,954
and the ways of an animal.

722
00:45:53,954 --> 00:45:55,689
Why can't you see that?

723
00:45:55,689 --> 00:45:58,058
Our hopes and fortunes
are tied to Spartacus.

724
00:45:58,058 --> 00:45:59,993
I made a promise to
reunite him with his wife.

725
00:45:59,993 --> 00:46:02,729
In honor of the man,
I will keep my word.

726
00:49:15,189 --> 00:49:18,258
<i>They came out of nowhere...
On the road...</i>

727
00:49:18,258 --> 00:49:21,928
They attacked...
They attacked on the road.

728
00:51:08,302 --> 00:51:09,702
I'm here.

729
00:51:43,571 --> 00:51:44,837
My word is kept.

730
00:51:46,907 --> 00:51:48,408
They're reunited.

731
00:51:49,920 --> 00:52:48,420

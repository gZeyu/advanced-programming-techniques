1
00:00:53,318 --> 00:00:54,158
Ah, ah,

2
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,554
that was...

3
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:00,724
Vigorous.

4
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:03,594
You look like the sort of man

5
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:05,562
that could handle it.

6
00:01:05,562 --> 00:01:06,897
I am rather rugged...

7
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,471
Must go.

8
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:16,040
Father will be worried.

9
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,074
As well he should be...

10
00:01:19,344 --> 00:01:20,511
I have to go.

11
00:01:21,713 --> 00:01:24,949
If you do, my heart will break.

12
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:29,019
Ask me to stay.

13
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:30,821
Stay.

14
00:01:32,524 --> 00:01:34,525
Ask me.

15
00:01:34,525 --> 00:01:35,626
By my name.

16
00:01:39,764 --> 00:01:41,999
You do not even know it, do you?

17
00:01:43,702 --> 00:01:44,952
Sura.

18
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:48,739
My name is Sura.

19
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:49,907
Sura.

20
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,544
As beautiful as the woman herself.

21
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,879
My name is..

22
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:58,649
Every woman knows who you are.

23
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,651
And to avoid you.

24
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,854
That bad, am I?

25
00:02:03,854 --> 00:02:05,489
Huh, the worst.

26
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:11,762
Then why lay with a man
of such ill reputation?

27
00:02:11,762 --> 00:02:13,130
The gods led me to your bed.

28
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,901
The gods?

29
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:19,269
They come to me.

30
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:21,605
In my dreams.

31
00:02:21,605 --> 00:02:24,274
They showed me the
man you could become.

32
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:24,994
Could?

33
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:28,078
If set upon the right path.

34
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:30,814
And what else did the gods tell you

35
00:02:30,814 --> 00:02:32,316
about my future?

36
00:02:34,352 --> 00:02:36,620
That you will never
love another woman.

37
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,559
The heart weighs heavy.

38
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:58,095
So much hope in reunion.

39
00:04:58,095 --> 00:04:59,997
To come to such bitter end...

40
00:04:59,997 --> 00:05:00,998
How is it so?

41
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:04,434
The fault is mine.

42
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:08,972
The road from Neapolis is
known to be treacherous.

43
00:05:08,972 --> 00:05:10,407
I should have doubled the guard.

44
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:11,575
Tripled it.

45
00:05:11,575 --> 00:05:12,943
I should have delayed
giving Barca his freedom

46
00:05:12,943 --> 00:05:14,678
and sent him along as well.

47
00:05:18,316 --> 00:05:20,384
Pray the gods forgive my error.

48
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:21,134
No.

49
00:05:22,086 --> 00:05:23,921
You kept your word.

50
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:27,157
The fault lies with the
men who took her life.

51
00:05:27,157 --> 00:05:28,892
And with Claudius Glaber,

52
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:31,261
who condemned her to slavery.

53
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:34,898
There is nothing to be done

54
00:05:34,898 --> 00:05:36,400
to change what has passed.

55
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,069
We must look towards the future.

56
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:41,905
You are the bringer of rain.

57
00:05:41,905 --> 00:05:44,141
The slayer of death.

58
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:47,377
Together we will etch
the name Spartacus

59
00:05:47,377 --> 00:05:48,946
to the pillars of history.

60
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:55,385
Spartacus.

61
00:05:55,385 --> 00:05:58,322
That is not what she called me.

62
00:05:58,322 --> 00:06:00,824
That is not my name.

63
00:06:00,824 --> 00:06:02,726
It is now.

64
00:06:12,136 --> 00:06:13,670
Nearly a year you had me searching

65
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,040
for that thracian woman.

66
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,977
Why have me take her
life short of the mark?

67
00:06:19,977 --> 00:06:21,712
An unfortunate necessity.

68
00:06:21,712 --> 00:06:22,713
I trust the sum sufficient?

69
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:27,985
If other "necessities" arise,

70
00:06:27,985 --> 00:06:29,253
consider me your man.

71
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,694
So great an expense,
to have her delivered all but dead.

72
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:41,265
You could just as easily
have told Spartacus

73
00:06:41,265 --> 00:06:43,000
that she perished abroad.

74
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,868
She was his life.

75
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:46,703
The heart beating
beneath his chest.

76
00:06:46,703 --> 00:06:48,005
No.

77
00:06:48,005 --> 00:06:49,439
Such a man would not
believe she was gone,

78
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,409
unless his own eyes
told him it was so.

79
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:54,745
It was the only course.

80
00:06:54,745 --> 00:06:55,946
And one which you
could have told me

81
00:06:55,946 --> 00:06:57,648
you were undertaking.

82
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,218
I would keep such blood
from these hands,

83
00:07:01,218 --> 00:07:02,619
as I have said.

84
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:05,188
They hold yours.

85
00:07:05,188 --> 00:07:07,491
Are they not stained by the touch?

86
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:10,127
There has been too
much death of late.

87
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:11,795
I would turn towards more
respectable ventures.

88
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:15,932
With his wife removed from thought,

89
00:07:15,932 --> 00:07:17,668
I will mold Spartacus
into a gladiator

90
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:19,202
the likes of which the
world has never seen.

91
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:22,272
He has already defeated Theokoles.

92
00:07:22,272 --> 00:07:23,874
Imagine what he will
accomplish once his mind

93
00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:26,843
has been focused on
nothing but victory.

94
00:07:26,843 --> 00:07:28,812
You will be the greatest lanista

95
00:07:28,812 --> 00:07:30,380
in the Republic.

96
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,115
And on such a title we will climb

97
00:07:32,115 --> 00:07:33,450
beyond our station.

98
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,985
Beyond Capua.

99
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:40,691
Perhaps to the very steps
of the senate itself.

100
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:56,840
The fever still grips him?

101
00:08:00,211 --> 00:08:02,579
I would know if his
condition changes.

102
00:08:15,793 --> 00:08:17,627
A word, Doctore.

103
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:18,587
Pietros.

104
00:08:20,798 --> 00:08:22,432
The birds, left in Barca's cell.

105
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:24,401
What should I do with them?

106
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:25,736
Whatever you wish.

107
00:08:25,736 --> 00:08:26,970
He said we would release them.

108
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,238
Once he gained our freedom.

109
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:31,074
He intended yours as well?

110
00:08:31,074 --> 00:08:33,443
That was his purpose in
speaking with our Dominus.

111
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:37,314
Ashur said the price was
too steep for us both.

112
00:08:37,314 --> 00:08:38,749
Ashur?

113
00:08:38,749 --> 00:08:40,016
He helped negotiate the sum.

114
00:08:41,185 --> 00:08:43,220
Would it be ok if I kept them?

115
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,354
The birds?

116
00:08:46,891 --> 00:08:48,925
It would not cause notice.

117
00:08:48,925 --> 00:08:50,460
Thank you.

118
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:44,614
That is unwise.

119
00:09:48,986 --> 00:09:50,654
If the guards were
to see you with it...

120
00:09:52,557 --> 00:09:53,623
What could they do to me,

121
00:09:53,623 --> 00:09:55,058
that hasn't already been done?

122
00:09:57,128 --> 00:09:58,462
I never should have left her.

123
00:09:58,462 --> 00:10:00,630
You did not leave her.

124
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,632
She was taken from you.

125
00:10:02,632 --> 00:10:05,502
Before I left for war.

126
00:10:05,502 --> 00:10:07,337
She asked me not to go.

127
00:10:07,337 --> 00:10:09,840
You did what you thought was right.

128
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,907
To protect her.

129
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:14,778
You should toss
that over the cliff.

130
00:10:17,014 --> 00:10:18,915
Best to be done with such thoughts.

131
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:34,931
Careful with that,
it costs more than your worth.

132
00:10:34,931 --> 00:10:38,802
It won't be long until our
house is finally livable again.

133
00:10:38,802 --> 00:10:40,570
Tilt your bow higher!

134
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,771
We aim at the heavens!

135
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:43,573
The palace of Batiatus!

136
00:10:43,573 --> 00:10:44,608
Where dignitaries kneel

137
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:46,543
to suck the cock
of my good fortune!

138
00:10:46,543 --> 00:10:48,411
Well, they'll have
to get in line...

139
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:54,518
Crixus?

140
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,531
Lie still!

141
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:08,832
Best to heed the advice.

142
00:11:08,832 --> 00:11:11,067
For a while we thought
you for the afterlife.

143
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:13,336
When will I fight again.

144
00:11:13,336 --> 00:11:16,006
When will I fight again he says.

145
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:17,674
Worry of nothing but recovery,

146
00:11:17,674 --> 00:11:20,710
the crowd will once again
cheer the name Crixus.

147
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,045
A word.

148
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:29,052
It would be improper
for me to visit

149
00:11:29,052 --> 00:11:31,187
you in the ludus.

150
00:11:31,187 --> 00:11:34,457
But know that my
thoughts are with you.

151
00:11:34,457 --> 00:11:37,594
I'll send my slave Naevia
often to attend your needs.

152
00:11:37,594 --> 00:11:39,095
Rest now.

153
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:42,599
And worry for nothing.

154
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:14,331
Your swords for practice, champion.

155
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:27,544
The day's training begins.

156
00:12:27,544 --> 00:12:28,845
Pair up!

157
00:12:29,914 --> 00:12:31,848
Sword and shield!

158
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:33,249
Spartacus!

159
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:36,186
You face me.

160
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:49,466
Your wife's passing.

161
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:51,868
That was an unfortunate thing.

162
00:12:51,868 --> 00:12:53,303
As was your plan for escape.

163
00:12:55,906 --> 00:12:57,874
I have not tasted
wine for many years.

164
00:12:57,874 --> 00:13:00,577
Yet a single cup would
not rob me of my senses.

165
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:03,113
The choice was to see you sleep...

166
00:13:03,113 --> 00:13:05,315
Or never awaken.

167
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,698
Your victory over Theokoles...

168
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:22,966
Is the only reason Batiatus

169
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:24,834
does not know of your treachery.

170
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:28,605
Champion or no,
you would be crucified.

171
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:30,740
Then part your lips
and see it done!

172
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:38,248
Next time you seek escape...

173
00:13:38,248 --> 00:13:39,916
You'd best kill me.

174
00:13:55,032 --> 00:13:57,567
Make it half, yeah?

175
00:13:57,567 --> 00:13:59,335
Good Mercato!

176
00:13:59,335 --> 00:14:00,704
You must excuse the chaos!

177
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:01,838
I had hoped to see such affairs

178
00:14:01,838 --> 00:14:03,406
completed before your arrival.

179
00:14:03,406 --> 00:14:04,741
Fortune favors you.

180
00:14:04,741 --> 00:14:07,677
As it does all of Capua,
since the rains!

181
00:14:07,677 --> 00:14:08,845
My time is pressed.

182
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:10,113
Come, let us to business.

183
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:11,414
Ah, to the matter then.

184
00:14:11,414 --> 00:14:13,950
I secured six of your
men for my games,

185
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,553
honoring the storied
history of my family.

186
00:14:16,553 --> 00:14:19,189
Arrangements made before the
Vulcanalia, if you recall.

187
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:20,757
As if it were yesterday.

188
00:14:20,757 --> 00:14:22,258
Well, I've decided as highlight

189
00:14:22,258 --> 00:14:24,728
to reenact Rome's
victory over the Maedi,

190
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:27,530
the thracian tribe who
dared invade Macedonia.

191
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,698
They were slaughtered
for their insolence

192
00:14:28,698 --> 00:14:30,200
by my grandfather,

193
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,202
Marcus Minucius Rufus.

194
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:34,838
A name that carries weight,
long after it's passing!

195
00:14:34,838 --> 00:14:37,774
I'd planned for to play
the very man himself,

196
00:14:37,774 --> 00:14:38,908
leading the charge.

197
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:39,909
Apologies.

198
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:41,077
Crixus is yet recovering

199
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:42,445
from his battle with Theokoles.

200
00:14:42,445 --> 00:14:44,481
Ah. As I suspected.

201
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:46,149
Perhaps Gnaeus, then?

202
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:48,985
I turn thought towards Spartacus.

203
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:51,788
He is much in demand.

204
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:53,089
The cost of such a thing?

205
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:54,624
An additional forty percent.

206
00:14:54,624 --> 00:14:56,626
Prisoners to play the
thracians included?

207
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:58,161
Consider it done.

208
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:00,764
I will see it announced
all over Capua!

209
00:15:00,764 --> 00:15:04,300
Spartacus, Slayer of Theokoles!

210
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,770
To assume the mantle
of my grandfather!

211
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,105
A great day!

212
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:17,280
Pietros.

213
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,815
Bring more water.

214
00:15:21,218 --> 00:15:22,452
Now.

215
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:27,056
Fucking pig.

216
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:28,424
The way he paws at the boy...

217
00:15:28,424 --> 00:15:30,827
The fault lies with Barca.

218
00:15:30,827 --> 00:15:32,462
For leaving him.

219
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:35,398
Is it delivered?

220
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:36,432
As promised.

221
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:41,471
A letter to my wife.

222
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,774
Long overdue.

223
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:46,843
Yeah.

224
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:49,012
Did you bring reply?

225
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:51,014
She did not favor me with one.

226
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:53,583
She insisted on bringing
you message herself.

227
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:24,547
How did you gain entry?

228
00:16:24,547 --> 00:16:27,884
Your man Ashur spoke to
Batiatus on my behalf.

229
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:30,053
Did he ask coin for the service?

230
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:32,088
He said he would take
the matter up with you.

231
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:37,193
Who cares of coin
on such a day, eh?

232
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:42,265
The boy has grown monstrous!

233
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,738
And his mother ever
more beautiful...

234
00:16:53,911 --> 00:16:55,812
I miss the taste of your lips.

235
00:17:00,551 --> 00:17:01,951
The letter came as a surprise.

236
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,054
Every day I prayed for word.

237
00:17:05,054 --> 00:17:06,222
And that it would not be news

238
00:17:06,222 --> 00:17:07,991
of your death in the arena.

239
00:17:07,991 --> 00:17:09,626
We agreed no letters, Aurelia.

240
00:17:11,462 --> 00:17:13,930
To keep you and the
boy far from this.

241
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,766
And my mind on the task.

242
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:18,968
And what has changed?

243
00:17:18,968 --> 00:17:20,870
A friend.

244
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,139
His loss.

245
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:25,475
A friend.

246
00:17:25,475 --> 00:17:27,410
You are moved by a friend.

247
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,581
I am moved by the
need to see my wife.

248
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:32,982
To know she is still real,

249
00:17:32,982 --> 00:17:36,753
and not the dream
of a desperate man.

250
00:17:36,753 --> 00:17:40,089
After one more year
my debts will be paid.

251
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:41,257
We can start again.

252
00:17:41,257 --> 00:17:43,559
All of us, together.

253
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,994
We should have just left.

254
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:47,330
To Pompeii. Or Sicilia.

255
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,464
It would not have been honorable.

256
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:49,184
Honor?

257
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:54,570
Where is the honor in debts
of gambling and chance?

258
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,173
Where is the honor in
leaving your wife and child?

259
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:00,810
Every mistake I have made...

260
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,445
I will set right.

261
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:06,516
I will be the man you deserve.

262
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:08,117
From this moment on
my life is yours,

263
00:18:08,117 --> 00:18:10,320
and yours alone.

264
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:16,259
I am with child.

265
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:17,460
Child?

266
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:24,767
What is your meaning?

267
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:25,868
Varro..

268
00:18:25,868 --> 00:18:27,904
Your meaning.

269
00:18:27,904 --> 00:18:30,373
Your absence has been difficult.

270
00:18:30,373 --> 00:18:31,541
The money you send barely enough

271
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,544
to keep us fed and sheltered.

272
00:18:34,544 --> 00:18:37,313
Titus offered assistance.

273
00:18:37,313 --> 00:18:38,948
Titus?

274
00:18:38,948 --> 00:18:41,718
An acquaintance,
from the marketplace.

275
00:18:41,718 --> 00:18:44,220
And you repay him by
spreading your fucking legs?!

276
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,689
No. I thought of him
only as a friend.

277
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:48,391
He forced himself upon me.

278
00:18:48,391 --> 00:18:49,392
Why didn't you stop him?

279
00:18:49,392 --> 00:18:53,029
You think I wanted this?

280
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:55,298
Where were you, Varro?

281
00:18:55,298 --> 00:18:56,866
Where the fuck were you?

282
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,271
Fighting.

283
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,111
For us.

284
00:19:04,842 --> 00:19:06,109
As you should have been.

285
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,860
The House of Batiatus is
filled with champions.

286
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:27,764
Father's.

287
00:19:27,764 --> 00:19:29,832
Grandfather's.

288
00:19:29,832 --> 00:19:31,167
Soon you will stand among them.

289
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:32,869
I have commissioned you to
be immortalized in stone,

290
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:34,904
at great expense.

291
00:19:34,904 --> 00:19:36,239
You honor me, Dominus.

292
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:38,107
Well the laurels
do not cease there.

293
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:40,043
Good Mercato has insisted that

294
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:42,612
Spartacus be moved to the
forefront of his games!

295
00:19:42,612 --> 00:19:45,214
You will take the guise of
his storied grandfather,

296
00:19:45,214 --> 00:19:46,949
Marcus Minucius Rufus!

297
00:19:46,949 --> 00:19:48,084
Rufus?

298
00:19:48,084 --> 00:19:50,753
<i>You know of him?</i>

299
00:19:50,753 --> 00:19:52,822
I have heard the name,

300
00:19:52,822 --> 00:19:55,124
spoken by my father
when I was a boy.

301
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:57,593
You will be dressed
in his very armor,

302
00:19:57,593 --> 00:20:00,163
four of our gladiators
bedecked as roman legion.

303
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:01,264
Our enemy?

304
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:03,833
Six prisoners sentenced
to execution,

305
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,101
clad in the barbaric fashion

306
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:07,203
of the thracian
hordes of the Maedi!

307
00:20:07,203 --> 00:20:08,971
It will be a grand spectacle,

308
00:20:08,971 --> 00:20:10,706
with you its shining helm!

309
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:13,843
I will not fight.

310
00:20:13,843 --> 00:20:16,145
You misunderstand.

311
00:20:16,145 --> 00:20:17,713
I do not ask.

312
00:20:17,713 --> 00:20:19,282
I command.

313
00:20:19,282 --> 00:20:21,484
I will not dress as a roman

314
00:20:21,484 --> 00:20:23,953
and pretend to slaughter
my own people.

315
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:25,888
It is time for you to
release your hold upon past.

316
00:20:25,888 --> 00:20:27,590
You are no longer of Thrace.

317
00:20:30,094 --> 00:20:31,094
You are destined for great

318
00:20:31,094 --> 00:20:33,329
and wonderful things, Spartacus.

319
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:37,967
Embrace the path the
gods have set you upon.

320
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:42,038
Your mind is clouded by grief.

321
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:43,272
Pause to clear it.

322
00:20:54,952 --> 00:20:57,320
You bathe me as if a child.

323
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,456
You must rest.

324
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:02,925
Lay still.

325
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:04,494
You'll reopen your wounds.

326
00:21:07,898 --> 00:21:10,066
I can't even rise.

327
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:11,200
In time.

328
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,004
Always the enemy of a gladiator.

329
00:21:15,004 --> 00:21:17,807
Yet friend to us now.

330
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:20,543
Domina has given excuse
for us to be together.

331
00:21:21,745 --> 00:21:24,080
Let us pluck blessing
from misfortune.

332
00:21:28,418 --> 00:21:32,655
Crixus, you live.

333
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:35,491
My prayers, answered.

334
00:21:35,491 --> 00:21:36,826
I would have more prayers,

335
00:21:36,826 --> 00:21:38,661
to return me to the
sand to be by the men.

336
00:21:38,661 --> 00:21:41,230
You shall rejoin your
brothers soon enough.

337
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,232
Brothers?

338
00:21:43,232 --> 00:21:45,101
None have visited me.

339
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:47,170
Not even Barca.

340
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:50,473
Have you not told him?

341
00:21:50,473 --> 00:21:51,941
The moment has not arisen.

342
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:54,443
Has he fallen, in the arena?

343
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:56,245
Far the opposite.

344
00:21:56,245 --> 00:21:58,114
He has purchased his freedom.

345
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:02,118
The Beast of Carthage?

346
00:22:02,118 --> 00:22:04,187
What is Barca if not a gladiator?

347
00:22:04,187 --> 00:22:08,024
A man. Free to roam
outside these walls.

348
00:22:08,024 --> 00:22:10,092
The thought is foreign.

349
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:12,495
The giant fuck tending goats

350
00:22:12,495 --> 00:22:14,463
and picking vegetables?

351
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:17,633
With Pietros his ever doting wife?

352
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:19,535
He left the boy.

353
00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:22,171
He'd sooner part with his own cock!

354
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:25,274
The news found me surprised also.

355
00:22:25,274 --> 00:22:30,046
He did not wish it,
but had no choice.

356
00:22:30,046 --> 00:22:32,882
You shared words with him?

357
00:22:32,882 --> 00:22:36,652
No, but I saw it in his eyes,

358
00:22:36,652 --> 00:22:39,188
as he was escorted
through the gates.

359
00:22:40,757 --> 00:22:42,058
You were there?

360
00:22:48,098 --> 00:22:50,233
Regain your strength.

361
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:52,201
I would see you with
a sword in hand soon.

362
00:22:59,643 --> 00:23:01,944
Barca gone.

363
00:23:01,944 --> 00:23:03,679
Spartacus champion.

364
00:23:05,816 --> 00:23:08,317
I have awoken to a world of shit.

365
00:23:19,263 --> 00:23:21,297
You are a fool to refuse Batiatus.

366
00:23:22,866 --> 00:23:25,101
The man makes unreasonable demands.

367
00:23:25,101 --> 00:23:27,670
He is your master.

368
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,406
His demands your duty,
unreasonable or otherwise.

369
00:23:30,406 --> 00:23:32,475
I will not be forced to
slaughter my countrymen.

370
00:23:32,475 --> 00:23:33,709
Countrymen in dress only.

371
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:35,645
You share no kinship
with these prisoners.

372
00:23:35,645 --> 00:23:36,646
They are murderers.

373
00:23:36,646 --> 00:23:37,947
Rapists.

374
00:23:37,947 --> 00:23:39,682
Their death well deserved.

375
00:23:39,682 --> 00:23:42,618
Then let another
man's blade grant it.

376
00:23:42,618 --> 00:23:44,020
You act as if you have
free will in the matter.

377
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,288
You are a gladiator.

378
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:46,756
I am a thracian.

379
00:23:46,756 --> 00:23:48,024
You are a slave.

380
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,594
To cling to a life
beyond these walls

381
00:23:51,594 --> 00:23:54,163
is to see your heart
parted from your chest.

382
00:23:54,163 --> 00:23:55,531
You above all others
should know this.

383
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,007
I do not think before I speak.

384
00:24:08,478 --> 00:24:10,379
I will remove myself to
less deserving company.

385
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,368
Pietros.

386
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:40,076
Gnaeus' hand?

387
00:24:41,812 --> 00:24:42,878
I shall have a word.

388
00:24:42,878 --> 00:24:44,747
To what end?

389
00:24:44,747 --> 00:24:46,282
Will it see Barca return?

390
00:24:47,351 --> 00:24:49,051
Will it see us reunited,

391
00:24:49,051 --> 00:24:52,021
or free, as he promised?

392
00:24:52,021 --> 00:24:55,958
Fate often takes a man
far from his heart.

393
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:57,293
To his regret.

394
00:24:57,293 --> 00:24:59,729
Felt more keenly by
the one left behind.

395
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:04,266
Rome is positively aflutter

396
00:25:04,266 --> 00:25:06,402
with news of Theokoles' defeat.

397
00:25:06,402 --> 00:25:08,204
No one could believe such
a thing was possible.

398
00:25:08,204 --> 00:25:10,773
Especially at the
hands of a thracian.

399
00:25:10,773 --> 00:25:12,975
The gods truly bless
the House of Batiatus.

400
00:25:14,544 --> 00:25:16,512
We've even entertaining
thoughts of a patron,

401
00:25:16,512 --> 00:25:19,181
to share in our good fortune.

402
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:20,316
Hm.

403
00:25:20,316 --> 00:25:22,017
And does your good
fortune extend downward?

404
00:25:23,286 --> 00:25:25,121
I don't follow.

405
00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:26,555
The priestess.

406
00:25:26,555 --> 00:25:28,824
Has her fertility rite born any seed?

407
00:25:30,761 --> 00:25:32,361
I was unable to conclude the rite

408
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:33,796
in the allotted time.

409
00:25:33,796 --> 00:25:34,797
No!

410
00:25:34,797 --> 00:25:36,365
Well my husband was sadly absent.

411
00:25:36,365 --> 00:25:37,967
What of the other man?

412
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:41,470
Oh. You still have not
told me anything about him.

413
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,905
Is it Solonius?

414
00:25:42,905 --> 00:25:44,273
I would rather fuck an eel.

415
00:25:46,476 --> 00:25:50,746
No, no, a woman as beautiful
as you are deserves a man.

416
00:25:51,848 --> 00:25:54,350
Someone of position maybe...?

417
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,584
He's no one of note.

418
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:57,853
No one of note...

419
00:25:57,853 --> 00:26:00,089
Someone more physical, perhaps.

420
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:01,090
A slave?!

421
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,625
Oh, your cups empty.

422
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:04,260
Isn't it?

423
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,896
But not just any slave,
no not for you.

424
00:26:06,896 --> 00:26:09,765
He would have to be forged
by Jupiter himself...

425
00:26:09,765 --> 00:26:12,368
Let us move on from the subject.

426
00:26:12,368 --> 00:26:13,803
Of course. To other matters.

427
00:26:18,008 --> 00:26:18,858
How fares Crixus?

428
00:26:22,612 --> 00:26:23,979
Crixus?

429
00:26:23,979 --> 00:26:26,615
His injuries,
suffered against Theokoles.

430
00:26:26,615 --> 00:26:28,584
Is he expected to live?

431
00:26:28,584 --> 00:26:30,286
His strength returns.

432
00:26:30,286 --> 00:26:32,288
Joyous news.

433
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:35,090
It would be a great
tragedy to see such a man

434
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:39,295
pass from this world, would it not?

435
00:26:39,295 --> 00:26:40,930
It would.

436
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:44,300
Pity he will not take the
sand in good Mercato's games.

437
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,002
I long to see his
sword thrust home.

438
00:26:53,343 --> 00:26:54,310
How did you fare?

439
00:26:55,846 --> 00:26:57,746
The game of dice and bones.

440
00:26:59,883 --> 00:27:01,951
Poorly, as I often have.

441
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,187
I will balance the
loss at next chance..

442
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:11,861
It would seem Pietros has
lost control of his flock.

443
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,874
Pietros..

444
00:27:33,383 --> 00:27:35,351
The boy has freed himself.

445
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:54,877
Gnaeus!

446
00:28:05,282 --> 00:28:06,515
Enough!

447
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:12,621
What is this foolishness?

448
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:18,894
Pietros.

449
00:28:18,894 --> 00:28:20,396
The boy took his own life.

450
00:28:26,403 --> 00:28:29,705
He will be missed...

451
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:32,308
Especially his lips around my cock.

452
00:28:58,401 --> 00:29:02,171
This morning I boasted the top
retiarius in all of Capua!

453
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:04,540
Now I possess nothing
more than bones

454
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,009
and brains scattered
upon the rocks!

455
00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:08,210
Apologies.

456
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:11,847
Fuck your apologies!

457
00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:14,817
I will have return
of the value lost!

458
00:29:14,817 --> 00:29:16,919
The price of the man will be
subtracted from your winnings

459
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,654
until the remainder is balanced!

460
00:29:18,654 --> 00:29:20,456
As you see fit, Dominus.

461
00:29:20,456 --> 00:29:22,625
All of this for what?

462
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:23,726
Pietros?

463
00:29:23,726 --> 00:29:26,295
He was nothing. Shit from a whore.

464
00:29:26,295 --> 00:29:28,731
He was a man. His life had worth.

465
00:29:28,731 --> 00:29:30,265
Half a coin at most.

466
00:29:30,265 --> 00:29:33,535
Gnaeus was a gladiator!

467
00:29:33,535 --> 00:29:37,373
Years of training,
each mounting to exorbitant cost.

468
00:29:37,373 --> 00:29:40,075
That is true worth!

469
00:29:40,075 --> 00:29:41,877
He did not deserve to live.

470
00:29:44,014 --> 00:29:45,848
I alone decides who live!

471
00:29:45,848 --> 00:29:47,950
Not you! Not a fucking slave!

472
00:29:49,853 --> 00:29:51,553
Argh!

473
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:57,793
My generosity has been boundless,

474
00:29:57,793 --> 00:29:59,228
yet you defy me still.

475
00:30:01,631 --> 00:30:05,000
Mercato's games are upon us.

476
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,937
I expect you to fight
as a loyal roman.

477
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:11,740
Or die as a thracian.

478
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,246
See him to the Medicus.

479
00:30:33,563 --> 00:30:36,165
You shed tears for the boy?

480
00:30:36,165 --> 00:30:37,566
His passing saddens me.

481
00:30:37,566 --> 00:30:40,235
He was too weak for this place.

482
00:30:40,235 --> 00:30:44,006
Without Barca to protect him.

483
00:30:44,006 --> 00:30:46,241
Not all of us can be strong.

484
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:04,359
Have you been making friends again?

485
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:06,562
Gnaeus.

486
00:31:06,562 --> 00:31:07,963
A disagreement.

487
00:31:07,963 --> 00:31:10,599
And you emerged the battered cunt.

488
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:13,368
What, did his tiny net prove
too fierce an opponent?

489
00:31:13,368 --> 00:31:15,471
For the Slayer of Theokoles?

490
00:31:15,471 --> 00:31:17,406
Ask the man himself.

491
00:31:17,406 --> 00:31:20,209
If you can scrape enough of
him off the cliff for reply.

492
00:31:20,209 --> 00:31:22,878
Gnaeus is dead?

493
00:31:22,878 --> 00:31:27,216
What reason did you
have to take his life?

494
00:31:27,216 --> 00:31:29,017
My reasoning lies forever silent.

495
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,756
Your actions betray us all.

496
00:31:33,756 --> 00:31:35,724
Gnaeus was a gladiator!

497
00:31:35,724 --> 00:31:36,725
A brother.

498
00:31:36,725 --> 00:31:38,327
He was no brother of mine.

499
00:31:38,327 --> 00:31:39,461
<i>When you swore the oath.</i>

500
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:41,864
Every man in here
became your brother,

501
00:31:41,864 --> 00:31:45,601
deserving of an honorable
death in the arena.

502
00:31:45,601 --> 00:31:49,538
Your actions shame my
fighting beside you.

503
00:31:49,538 --> 00:31:52,107
You speak as if you had
choice in the matter.

504
00:31:52,107 --> 00:31:54,877
I did and I chose
not to end your life

505
00:31:54,877 --> 00:31:57,079
in the arena.

506
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:59,081
A decision I presently regret.

507
00:32:02,685 --> 00:32:03,919
As do I.

508
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:20,102
You knew Pietros well?

509
00:32:20,102 --> 00:32:21,236
Only in passing.

510
00:32:21,236 --> 00:32:24,139
Yet you tend to his pets.

511
00:32:24,139 --> 00:32:25,307
A duty not required.

512
00:32:25,307 --> 00:32:27,142
A foolish gesture.

513
00:32:27,142 --> 00:32:29,344
Born of a kind heart.

514
00:32:31,347 --> 00:32:36,451
It surprises, that Barca
would claim his freedom

515
00:32:36,451 --> 00:32:38,120
at yet leave the things
he loved in captivity.

516
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:43,525
Did he speak to you of his plans

517
00:32:43,525 --> 00:32:46,094
for life outside the ludus?

518
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:47,229
No.

519
00:32:50,366 --> 00:32:53,769
Did he exchange words with Ashur?

520
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:54,489
Ashur?

521
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:58,006
He was there, was he not?

522
00:32:58,006 --> 00:32:59,107
I do not recall.

523
00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:04,780
Surely if you set your
mind to the task...

524
00:33:06,382 --> 00:33:08,550
Apologies, but I must
return to the villa.

525
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,419
Domina awaits.

526
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:14,056
The fear in your eyes betray
the lie on your tongue.

527
00:33:15,491 --> 00:33:18,594
Your questions put
me in harm's way.

528
00:33:18,594 --> 00:33:20,762
Please. Let me pass.

529
00:33:31,007 --> 00:33:32,608
The day approaches

530
00:33:32,608 --> 00:33:34,610
when I'm finally free of this.

531
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,512
Perhaps you can fashion
a proper cock from it.

532
00:33:39,182 --> 00:33:40,415
Remove yourselves.

533
00:33:42,518 --> 00:33:43,886
Remain.

534
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:51,526
I seek information.

535
00:33:51,526 --> 00:33:52,561
On what subject?

536
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:53,929
Barca.

537
00:33:53,929 --> 00:33:57,132
I understand he made wager
upon the Theokoles fight.

538
00:33:57,132 --> 00:33:59,635
Yeah, and won a small fortune,

539
00:33:59,635 --> 00:34:01,136
applied towards his freedom.

540
00:34:01,136 --> 00:34:03,939
With no thought towards Pietros?

541
00:34:03,939 --> 00:34:05,607
Not enough coin remained
to liberate him.

542
00:34:05,607 --> 00:34:06,875
Hm.

543
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:08,610
Barca's eyes filled with tears,

544
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:09,978
though spurred by regret

545
00:34:09,978 --> 00:34:14,616
or impending freedom, I know not.

546
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:17,653
It is a stirring sight.

547
00:34:17,653 --> 00:34:19,454
To see the bonds of
servitude lifted.

548
00:34:19,454 --> 00:34:20,204
Hm.

549
00:34:21,257 --> 00:34:22,357
I confess my eyes swimming

550
00:34:22,357 --> 00:34:24,226
as Barca took leave of the villa.

551
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,932
Who else offered farewells?

552
00:34:29,932 --> 00:34:32,534
Ah, only our master and myself.

553
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,142
Naevia claims to have
escorted Barca to the gates.

554
00:34:41,644 --> 00:34:43,512
She made no mention
of your presents.

555
00:34:45,682 --> 00:34:46,782
Why, she's a simple thing,
her mind easily..

556
00:34:46,782 --> 00:34:51,520
Stories in conflict
give me concern.

557
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,055
If I find there is
more to the matter

558
00:34:53,055 --> 00:34:54,189
of Barca's departure...

559
00:34:57,827 --> 00:34:58,794
We shall have words.

560
00:35:22,118 --> 00:35:24,820
You still believe in them?

561
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,188
The gods?

562
00:35:28,124 --> 00:35:29,124
Yes.

563
00:35:30,026 --> 00:35:31,493
Why?

564
00:35:35,932 --> 00:35:39,001
Our entire village is gone.

565
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:40,869
Everyone we knew, dead.

566
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:46,541
If there are no gods...

567
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:48,310
There is nothing to shape
what happens in our lives...

568
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,080
There is no meaning to any of it.

569
00:36:00,623 --> 00:36:02,391
I cannot believe the gods
would lead me to you...

570
00:36:03,793 --> 00:36:07,996
To bless me with such love...

571
00:36:07,996 --> 00:36:10,599
Only to make me bare
witness to your suffering.

572
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:12,968
No.

573
00:36:14,337 --> 00:36:15,570
There is a deeper purpose

574
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,305
to the path you've been set upon.

575
00:36:18,408 --> 00:36:20,008
One that has yet to reveal itself.

576
00:36:22,612 --> 00:36:24,746
I will never see you
from my side again.

577
00:36:26,182 --> 00:36:29,484
Without you, there is
no reason for breath.

578
00:36:29,484 --> 00:36:31,686
There is always reason to live.

579
00:36:31,686 --> 00:36:33,288
I would be lost.

580
00:36:33,288 --> 00:36:34,489
No.

581
00:36:36,893 --> 00:36:38,693
The gods would set you
on the proper path.

582
00:36:41,064 --> 00:36:43,899
All you have to do
is close your eyes...

583
00:36:46,102 --> 00:36:47,869
And place yourself in their hands.

584
00:37:02,952 --> 00:37:04,719
We leave for the games.

585
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:06,388
Is your decision made?

586
00:37:07,723 --> 00:37:08,443
It is.

587
00:37:14,831 --> 00:37:18,700
What sort of answer is this?

588
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,202
A gesture.

589
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:27,442
I care not for its
means of delivery.

590
00:37:27,442 --> 00:37:29,578
Perhaps its meaning
will be more agreeable.

591
00:37:29,578 --> 00:37:31,213
Out with it, then.

592
00:37:35,618 --> 00:37:39,888
Sura spoke often to me of the gods.

593
00:37:39,888 --> 00:37:41,923
She believed in them.

594
00:37:41,923 --> 00:37:46,261
I never truly have.

595
00:37:46,261 --> 00:37:50,232
The cock on you,
daring to doubt the gods!

596
00:37:50,232 --> 00:37:53,001
And I have suffered much for it.

597
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:55,704
But no longer.

598
00:37:55,704 --> 00:37:58,673
From this point forward...

599
00:37:58,673 --> 00:38:00,509
I give myself over
to her beliefs...

600
00:38:02,812 --> 00:38:05,447
And embrace my fate.

601
00:38:05,447 --> 00:38:09,918
Your words give my heart great joy.

602
00:38:09,918 --> 00:38:11,386
Enough even to erase questions

603
00:38:11,386 --> 00:38:13,688
of how a blade belonging
to the magistrate's son

604
00:38:13,688 --> 00:38:15,624
came to your possession.

605
00:38:18,261 --> 00:38:22,097
Let us put the past
truly behind us.

606
00:38:22,097 --> 00:38:25,433
Come the games await you.

607
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:28,336
I have but one condition.

608
00:38:28,336 --> 00:38:30,639
Condition?

609
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:33,108
You kiss my cheek only
to finger my ass?!

610
00:38:33,108 --> 00:38:35,377
Uh! Speak!

611
00:38:35,377 --> 00:38:38,446
Before I carve out
your fucking tongue.

612
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:39,614
I will take to the sands

613
00:38:39,614 --> 00:38:42,817
against the specter
of my countrymen.

614
00:38:42,817 --> 00:38:44,553
But I will face them alone.

615
00:38:44,553 --> 00:38:47,589
Six to your one?

616
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:50,091
I will not risk the champion
of Capua to such absurdity.

617
00:38:50,091 --> 00:38:52,727
If this is my fate,

618
00:38:52,727 --> 00:38:55,130
if this is the path the gods

619
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,631
have truly set me upon...

620
00:38:56,631 --> 00:38:57,999
Then they will not see me fall.

621
00:38:57,999 --> 00:39:01,703
And if you are wrong?

622
00:39:01,703 --> 00:39:03,772
Then I will give your city

623
00:39:03,772 --> 00:39:07,042
a great spectacle of blood...

624
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:08,610
Before joining my wife.

625
00:39:15,518 --> 00:39:17,319
The gods have brought you this far.

626
00:39:19,522 --> 00:39:21,756
I believe they are not
done with you yet.

627
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,860
But I have a condition of my own.

628
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,063
When you have killed
the last of these shits

629
00:39:28,063 --> 00:39:29,831
garbed as your countrymen,

630
00:39:29,831 --> 00:39:34,569
what's left of the thracian
inside you dies with them

631
00:39:34,569 --> 00:39:36,438
and you will embrace this fate

632
00:39:36,438 --> 00:39:39,007
and your destiny as Spartacus,

633
00:39:40,243 --> 00:39:41,910
the Champion of Capua.

634
00:40:19,915 --> 00:40:20,915
Citizens of Capua!

635
00:40:24,587 --> 00:40:26,755
Today, we honor

636
00:40:26,755 --> 00:40:31,526
the noble Marcus Minucius Rufus.

637
00:40:31,526 --> 00:40:35,196
A roman consul and commander
unmatched in glory.

638
00:40:38,401 --> 00:40:42,270
As tribute, good Mercato
has seen fit to re-enact

639
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:45,874
his grandfather's
most famous victory

640
00:40:45,874 --> 00:40:47,542
against the thracian hordes!

641
00:40:56,952 --> 00:40:59,988
Gaze at the prisoners
standing before you.

642
00:40:59,988 --> 00:41:03,892
And imagine the thracian
Maedi that invaded Macedonia.

643
00:41:03,892 --> 00:41:06,461
Rape, pillaging its noble people.

644
00:41:06,461 --> 00:41:08,930
Murdering all in their path...

645
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,765
Even a roman governor!

646
00:41:18,941 --> 00:41:23,378
Violence and madness
swept the land.

647
00:41:23,378 --> 00:41:25,947
Echoing into the heavens,

648
00:41:25,947 --> 00:41:29,718
where the gods themselves
turned their backs.

649
00:41:29,718 --> 00:41:33,521
All seemed lost,
until Rome dispatched

650
00:41:33,521 --> 00:41:36,124
it's favored son...

651
00:41:36,124 --> 00:41:39,361
Enter Marcus Minucius Rufus!

652
00:41:45,234 --> 00:41:47,569
For the honorable role of Rufus,

653
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:50,572
there was but one choice.

654
00:41:50,572 --> 00:41:52,974
The bringer of rain!

655
00:41:52,974 --> 00:41:55,944
The Slayer of Theokoles!

656
00:41:55,944 --> 00:41:58,413
The Champion of Capua...

657
00:41:58,413 --> 00:42:00,014
Stand up!

658
00:42:00,014 --> 00:42:01,850
I present to you.

659
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:05,920
Spartacus!!!

660
00:42:12,695 --> 00:42:15,163
<i>Spartacus!</i>

661
00:42:18,434 --> 00:42:19,501
<i>Spartacus!</i>

662
00:42:19,501 --> 00:42:20,635
<i>Spartacus!</i>

663
00:42:20,635 --> 00:42:22,504
<i>Spartacus!</i>

664
00:42:26,142 --> 00:42:28,309
I thought it was your
grandfather we honor.

665
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:29,944
Yet the crowd chants "spartacus".

666
00:42:32,548 --> 00:42:34,916
Worry not of details, good Mercato.

667
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:36,818
The glory is your
grandfather's alone.

668
00:42:38,087 --> 00:42:39,721
Come!

669
00:42:39,721 --> 00:42:41,556
Give the signal to begin
the glorious victory!

670
00:42:43,692 --> 00:42:47,195
In honor of Marcus
Minucius Rufus...

671
00:42:47,195 --> 00:42:48,763
Let blood be shed!

672
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,755
<i>All you have to do is
close your eyes</i>

673
00:43:13,755 --> 00:43:16,524
<i>and place yourself in
their hands...</i>

674
00:44:11,113 --> 00:44:12,714
Yeah!

675
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:09,938
You do realize my
grandfather won this battle?

676
00:45:11,373 --> 00:45:14,409
Perhaps this day history
will not repeat itself.

677
00:45:42,471 --> 00:45:44,906
<i>There is always a reason to live.</i>

678
00:45:44,906 --> 00:45:48,343
<i>The gods would set you on
the proper path.</i>

679
00:45:48,343 --> 00:45:49,911
Yeah!

680
00:46:32,254 --> 00:46:34,756
He fights like a man possessed.

681
00:46:34,756 --> 00:46:36,724
By the gods themselves.

682
00:46:41,864 --> 00:46:43,631
<i>Kill!</i>

683
00:46:43,631 --> 00:46:44,666
<i>Kill!</i>

684
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:45,916
<i>Kill!</i>

685
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,634
Kill!

686
00:47:19,634 --> 00:47:21,002
Kill!

687
00:47:21,002 --> 00:47:23,004
Kill!

688
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:37,439
Don't.

689
00:48:30,072 --> 00:48:31,606
A marvelous show!

690
00:48:33,509 --> 00:48:34,609
An honor to be of service.

691
00:48:34,609 --> 00:48:36,477
<i>Spartacus!</i>

692
00:48:36,477 --> 00:48:38,679
<i>Spartacus!</i>

693
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:39,879
<i>Spartacus!</i>

694
00:48:52,294 --> 00:48:53,461
I...

695
00:48:53,461 --> 00:48:54,462
Am...

696
00:48:54,462 --> 00:48:56,130
Spartacus!!!

697
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:57,865
<i>Spartacus!</i>

698
00:48:57,865 --> 00:48:59,600
<i>Spartacus!</i>

699
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:59,200

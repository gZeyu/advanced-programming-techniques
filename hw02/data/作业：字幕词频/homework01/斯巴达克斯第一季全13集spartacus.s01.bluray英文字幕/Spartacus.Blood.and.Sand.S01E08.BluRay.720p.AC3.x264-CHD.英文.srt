1
00:01:52,984 --> 00:01:54,318
Yes!

2
00:02:01,226 --> 00:02:02,159
Spartacus,

3
00:02:03,962 --> 00:02:05,395
victor again!

4
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:16,473
It's a marvel good
Solonius has any men left!

5
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,511
Must the thracian
appear in every Primus?

6
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:23,413
Does the house of not
deem another gladiator

7
00:02:23,413 --> 00:02:24,815
worthy of spectacle?

8
00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:26,683
They have no one else of note.

9
00:02:26,683 --> 00:02:29,052
Crixus will return to glory,
presently.

10
00:02:29,052 --> 00:02:30,053
As you say.

11
00:02:30,053 --> 00:02:31,388
A welcome addition.

12
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:36,960
I grow tried of this
thracian and his victories.

13
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,030
Perhaps something of
note to erase the tedium.

14
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:45,068
I purchase a fresh batch of
slaves at auction tomorrow,

15
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:47,237
to be trained as gladiators.

16
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:49,006
We would be honored if you would

17
00:02:49,006 --> 00:02:51,341
grace us at the unveiling.

18
00:02:51,341 --> 00:02:54,845
What sort of beasts
shall you procure?

19
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:56,213
Only the most ferocious,

20
00:02:56,213 --> 00:02:59,016
to be displayed for your pleasure.

21
00:03:10,228 --> 00:03:12,663
<i>Our next auction is
about to begin.</i>

22
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,801
Fortune favors us!

23
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:20,804
A fine selection,
enough coin to take our pick.

24
00:03:20,804 --> 00:03:23,440
Your competitor approaches.

25
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,378
Solonius, my heart brims with joy!

26
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:29,680
I had hoped to see you here,

27
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,516
buying new men for
Spartacus to slaughter!

28
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:37,020
Batiatus, now purse-proud
and so potent with charm.

29
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,324
How quickly fortuna
shifts her blessings. Huh?

30
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:43,193
A fact that beloved Ovidius
was unexpectedly made aware.

31
00:03:43,193 --> 00:03:44,828
You speak truth.

32
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:46,029
His murder was a deep tragedy.

33
00:03:46,029 --> 00:03:47,397
<i>Indeed.</i>

34
00:03:47,397 --> 00:03:50,734
One can never know who is
plotting violence, can one?

35
00:03:50,734 --> 00:03:52,035
Or when they may commit the act.

36
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:54,104
<i>Good citizens of Capua.</i>

37
00:03:54,104 --> 00:03:55,238
The auction begins, Dominus.

38
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:57,040
To business, then.

39
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,675
<i>Behold the finest offering
of flesh and bone...</i>

40
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:02,112
The gaul Segovax
will demand expense.

41
00:04:02,112 --> 00:04:06,450
And perhaps the German brothers,
Duro and Agron.

42
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,085
The others?

43
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:09,853
Of little worth.

44
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:12,522
Let us begin with a Celtic gaul

45
00:04:12,522 --> 00:04:15,692
of imposing virtues!

46
00:04:15,692 --> 00:04:17,127
I give you!

47
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:18,528
Segovax, an imposing gaul,
is pulled forward.

48
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:20,864
Skin, his armor!

49
00:04:20,864 --> 00:04:23,433
Hands, his steel!

50
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:26,169
Who would claim such a man?!

51
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:27,169
Bid!

52
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,106
Five denarii!

53
00:04:29,106 --> 00:04:31,208
Five denarii from good Vibius!

54
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,275
Ten denarii!

55
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:33,276
Twelve!

56
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:34,236
Fifteen!

57
00:04:36,314 --> 00:04:37,614
Twenty!

58
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:42,753
Twenty-five denarii!

59
00:04:42,753 --> 00:04:45,322
I grow tired of bidding.

60
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:46,723
A hundred denarii!!

61
00:04:49,894 --> 00:04:50,994
A hundred?

62
00:04:50,994 --> 00:04:52,295
For the entire lot.

63
00:04:52,295 --> 00:04:53,330
Sold!

64
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,631
To Batiatus!

65
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:56,199
Savior of Capua!

66
00:04:59,504 --> 00:05:01,238
With respect Dominus,

67
00:05:01,238 --> 00:05:04,708
your coin far exceeds their value.

68
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,176
Fuck value!

69
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:07,511
None can be placed on seeing

70
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:10,247
that cock eater's pride
ground beneath my heel.

71
00:05:11,382 --> 00:05:14,284
Solonius, consider the whores!

72
00:05:15,553 --> 00:05:16,720
Perhaps you will
have better fortune

73
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,955
fighting women in the arena!

74
00:05:51,556 --> 00:05:53,023
Have I not pleased you, Domina?

75
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,060
Does your cock stand dry?

76
00:06:00,698 --> 00:06:04,167
I fear you have not quaked.

77
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:05,535
Apologies.

78
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:10,841
My wounds have yet to fully heal.

79
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:13,176
Well you will recover and
all will be as it was.

80
00:06:16,447 --> 00:06:18,348
<i>Forgive me.</i>

81
00:06:18,348 --> 00:06:20,417
Dominus returns from the market.

82
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,187
Get out.

83
00:06:29,727 --> 00:06:31,995
What would you have me do?

84
00:06:31,995 --> 00:06:35,699
If I refuse, Domina
will grow suspicious.

85
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,200
I know.

86
00:06:40,805 --> 00:06:43,607
I perform as weakly as I can,

87
00:06:43,607 --> 00:06:45,175
hoping she will lose interest.

88
00:06:47,278 --> 00:06:48,512
I am not angry with you.

89
00:06:50,548 --> 00:06:53,150
It's only...

90
00:06:54,585 --> 00:06:55,952
I find it difficult

91
00:06:55,952 --> 00:06:59,823
that you and Domina
share what we have not.

92
00:06:59,823 --> 00:07:02,125
For some time.

93
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:10,066
You alone occupy my thoughts.

94
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:29,786
You're gonna die!

95
00:07:29,786 --> 00:07:30,987
You're gonna die!

96
00:07:30,987 --> 00:07:32,489
You're gonna die!

97
00:07:32,489 --> 00:07:34,157
I'm gonna kill you.

98
00:07:34,157 --> 00:07:35,392
You're dead.

99
00:07:35,392 --> 00:07:36,593
I'm gonna kill you!

100
00:07:36,593 --> 00:07:38,728
<i>You're dead, you're dead,</i>

101
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:40,297
<i>now you're dead, you're all dead.</i>

102
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:02,819
What is beneath your feet?

103
00:08:06,357 --> 00:08:07,524
Sand?

104
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:11,561
Fucking idiot.

105
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:13,463
Spartacus.

106
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:19,069
Sacred ground, Doctore!

107
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:21,938
Watered with tears of blood!

108
00:08:21,938 --> 00:08:22,939
Your tears.

109
00:08:24,475 --> 00:08:26,009
Your blood.

110
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:27,143
Your pathetic lives,

111
00:08:27,143 --> 00:08:28,278
forged into something of worth...

112
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:29,879
Five denarii on the fool who spoke.

113
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,014
Listen. Learn.

114
00:08:32,516 --> 00:08:33,850
And perhaps, live.

115
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,919
As gladiators.

116
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,123
Now, attend your master!

117
00:08:40,123 --> 00:08:42,092
<i>You have been blessed!</i>

118
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:45,028
<i>Each and every one of you,</i>

119
00:08:45,028 --> 00:08:47,430
<i>to find yourselves here,</i>

120
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,667
at the ludus of Quintus Lentulus

121
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:53,336
purveyor of the finest
in all of the Republic!

122
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,109
<i>Prove yourselves,
in the hard days to follow.</i>

123
00:08:59,109 --> 00:09:02,345
Prove yourselves more
than a common slave.

124
00:09:02,345 --> 00:09:04,114
More than a man. Fail, and die.

125
00:09:04,114 --> 00:09:05,615
Your husband speaks
as my father would

126
00:09:05,615 --> 00:09:06,950
before the senate.

127
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,285
He's quite the orator.

128
00:09:08,285 --> 00:09:09,953
The tongue of Apollo.

129
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:15,225
<i>Succeed, and stand proud
among my titans!</i>

130
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:19,262
Batiatus, Batiatus, Batiatus!

131
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,935
A gladiator does not fear death.

132
00:09:27,505 --> 00:09:29,172
He embraces it.

133
00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:30,674
Caresses it.

134
00:09:30,674 --> 00:09:33,243
Fucks it..

135
00:09:33,243 --> 00:09:34,778
What make you of the new men?

136
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:40,150
They are spectacles!

137
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,186
I find myself growing
quite fond of this

138
00:09:43,186 --> 00:09:45,989
sordid business of gladiators.

139
00:09:45,989 --> 00:09:47,257
Perhaps you should
consider purchasing

140
00:09:47,257 --> 00:09:48,491
one of your own.

141
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:50,260
A gladiator?

142
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,695
I could never.

143
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:57,834
Could I?

144
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:59,636
Choose a recruit, and he is yours,

145
00:09:59,636 --> 00:10:01,071
for a nominal fee, of course.

146
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:02,138
Such funds to cover the expense

147
00:10:02,138 --> 00:10:05,608
of his upkeep and his training.

148
00:10:05,608 --> 00:10:07,277
Every victory in the arena,

149
00:10:07,277 --> 00:10:09,245
is an honor to his Domina.

150
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:17,821
Who should I choose?!

151
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:19,789
May I offer a suggestion
to aid your dilemma?

152
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:22,258
Doctore!

153
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:28,565
Our honored guest wishes to
access the recruits' virtues.

154
00:10:33,137 --> 00:10:34,604
Remove your cloths!

155
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,201
I wish to alter my bet.

156
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:08,071
Everything on the one
with the horse cock.

157
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,374
The one on the left...

158
00:11:11,374 --> 00:11:14,010
Segovax, gaul.

159
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:18,381
He has truly been blessed
by the God Priapus.

160
00:11:18,381 --> 00:11:21,284
A fine specimen!

161
00:11:21,284 --> 00:11:22,986
We must celebrate!

162
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:26,589
See to the wine.

163
00:11:27,992 --> 00:11:29,492
Has a man ever had such a wife?

164
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:30,760
She but loves her husband,

165
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,195
and would see him elevated.

166
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:38,001
A gladiator of my own,

167
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:40,370
mined from the same
lands as Crixus!

168
00:11:41,705 --> 00:11:44,741
The envy of my friends
shall spread like locusts,

169
00:11:44,741 --> 00:11:45,942
their hearts devoured.

170
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:49,078
Who would you torture so?

171
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:51,247
No one of my acquaintance, I hope.

172
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:52,549
Doubtful.

173
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:55,985
Caecila, Aemilia...

174
00:11:55,985 --> 00:11:58,254
Licinia.

175
00:11:58,254 --> 00:12:00,190
Licinia, cousin to Marcus Crassus?

176
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,791
The wealthiest man in Rome,

177
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,660
according to him, at least.

178
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,930
Licinia, in particular
enjoys the games.

179
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,165
More so the beasts who
do battle in them.

180
00:12:09,165 --> 00:12:10,200
You must make
invitation for private

181
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,901
introduction to your man Segovax.

182
00:12:11,901 --> 00:12:13,269
Here at the villa.

183
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:15,405
Uh, these are proper roman women.

184
00:12:15,405 --> 00:12:17,373
They only mingle with
families of equal standing.

185
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,578
Oh, perhaps it's for the best.

186
00:12:21,578 --> 00:12:22,979
Seeing your man in the flesh

187
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:24,914
would only inflame their envy.

188
00:12:32,323 --> 00:12:33,490
I will arrange it

189
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,959
and I shall even help
you with your hair.

190
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:38,795
We must make you look suitable
for such elevated company.

191
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:47,337
Shit baking in the sun.

192
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,307
Seems only yesterday we
were of a similar position.

193
00:12:51,307 --> 00:12:52,976
Much has changed.

194
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:57,480
You became the fucking
Champion of Capua.

195
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,483
Your myth to echo for
a thousand years.

196
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:02,886
And I... became a good friend.

197
00:13:02,886 --> 00:13:04,687
<i>Varro.</i>

198
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:06,155
The die call your name!

199
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:11,461
And Varro answers.

200
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:14,430
You continue to gamble.

201
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,100
A few coins to pass the time.

202
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,473
You fucking wait until gladiators

203
00:13:23,473 --> 00:13:25,542
have filled their bellies.

204
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:27,209
Crixus.

205
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,800
Let them eat.

206
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,200
They must embrace pain and
suffering to become gladiators.

207
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
This is how it is done.

208
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Not by you.

209
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,190
Let them eat.

210
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:57,536
Spartacus... the kind and gentle one.

211
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:07,216
Do not mistake me, Crixus.

212
00:14:07,216 --> 00:14:09,519
I give no shit about these men.

213
00:14:12,356 --> 00:14:15,892
But you are no longer
the Champion of Capua.

214
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:21,464
You do not take lead here.

215
00:14:21,464 --> 00:14:22,999
You follow.

216
00:14:40,384 --> 00:14:44,821
The man who follows is
forever at your back.

217
00:14:44,821 --> 00:14:47,256
Something to consider champion.

218
00:14:54,598 --> 00:14:56,432
Fucking gauls.

219
00:14:58,335 --> 00:15:00,470
Much gratitude.

220
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,705
Men should not die
with empty stomachs.

221
00:15:15,219 --> 00:15:16,953
Rhaskos.

222
00:15:16,953 --> 00:15:19,088
Um, end of the month
already, is it?

223
00:15:19,088 --> 00:15:21,090
According to the
calendar you cannot read.

224
00:15:22,326 --> 00:15:24,060
Your winnings amount to
three and a half denarii.

225
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,495
Preserve coin, or indulge yourself?

226
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:27,330
When do I ever take coin over gash?

227
00:15:28,632 --> 00:15:30,867
I expect her ass to be
returned free of blood.

228
00:15:40,444 --> 00:15:43,980
Ashur, you pass my cell by mistake.

229
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,481
Where is my coin?

230
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:53,356
The mistake is yours.

231
00:15:53,356 --> 00:15:56,893
You do not fight,
you are entitled to neither coin

232
00:15:56,893 --> 00:15:58,194
nor cunt.

233
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,931
The Dominus shall hear about this.

234
00:16:01,931 --> 00:16:06,369
Oh his very hand set the names.

235
00:16:06,369 --> 00:16:07,603
Perhaps next month you
should find yourself

236
00:16:07,603 --> 00:16:09,539
again among them,

237
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:11,574
should your wounds ever heal.

238
00:16:14,878 --> 00:16:16,345
Varro, a moment.

239
00:16:17,648 --> 00:16:21,017
Your victories amass much coin.

240
00:16:21,017 --> 00:16:23,519
Shall I see it transferred
to your wife as usual?

241
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,121
Or...

242
00:16:26,924 --> 00:16:29,025
Would you prefer a small portion

243
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:32,962
applied towards more
pressing concerns?

244
00:16:55,185 --> 00:16:58,087
That tiny man is the
fucking Champion of Capua?

245
00:16:58,087 --> 00:16:59,122
Fucking romans swell his legend

246
00:16:59,122 --> 00:17:00,490
to their advantage.

247
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,924
We could easily
best the man, Agron.

248
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:04,093
Spartacus defeated Theokoles.

249
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:07,630
And the skies wept to
honor of his victory.

250
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,898
The two of you would
present challenge

251
00:17:08,898 --> 00:17:10,767
equal to piss and shit.

252
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,040
You find my words amusing?

253
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,776
Your words, no.

254
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:21,944
The stupid fuck that speaks them,

255
00:17:21,944 --> 00:17:23,780
very fucking amusing.

256
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,716
<i>Spartacus is a man to be
held as an example.</i>

257
00:17:26,716 --> 00:17:28,918
The slave ignites the arena.

258
00:17:28,918 --> 00:17:31,120
One day the flames
shall set him free.

259
00:17:32,689 --> 00:17:34,724
I've witnessed such a thing.

260
00:17:34,724 --> 00:17:37,560
The roar of the crowd,
demanding a gladiator

261
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,929
be granted freedom for
his showing in the arena.

262
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:40,930
You haven't even earned the mark

263
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:41,964
of the fucking brotherhood

264
00:17:41,964 --> 00:17:43,699
and you cluck about freedom.

265
00:17:43,699 --> 00:17:45,468
<i>Segovax is right.</i>

266
00:17:45,468 --> 00:17:47,403
Spartacus shows us the way.

267
00:17:48,505 --> 00:17:50,740
<i>I will train as he trains,</i>

268
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,875
<i>every thrust and counter
committed to memory.</i>

269
00:17:53,944 --> 00:17:56,379
<i>And one day...</i>

270
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:59,749
<i>I too will become legend
in the arena.</i>

271
00:18:01,985 --> 00:18:03,252
Raaa!

272
00:18:36,053 --> 00:18:38,688
His wounds need yet more time.

273
00:18:38,688 --> 00:18:40,089
How much longer?

274
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:41,557
A fortnight or two.

275
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:43,359
Perhaps three.

276
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:45,127
Uhh... Jupiter's cock!

277
00:18:45,127 --> 00:18:48,364
His recovery may be
aided by certain herbs

278
00:18:48,364 --> 00:18:50,032
absent the apothecary.

279
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:57,740
Dominus, I've been without
sword for too long.

280
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,342
Let me resume training.

281
00:19:02,346 --> 00:19:04,213
I will see all on
the list procured.

282
00:19:04,213 --> 00:19:06,382
Heed Medicus' warning.

283
00:19:06,382 --> 00:19:07,884
Your sword will return
to your hand soon enough.

284
00:19:09,152 --> 00:19:10,486
Mandragora... henbane..

285
00:19:10,486 --> 00:19:12,154
Lye... thorn apple...

286
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:15,291
Hemlock... belladonna...
Half a dozen more.

287
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,627
Substantial lists,
requiring substantial coin.

288
00:19:17,627 --> 00:19:19,328
Procure the highest quality.

289
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:21,364
A justified expense,
should remedy result.

290
00:19:21,364 --> 00:19:22,865
May the gods see it fucking so.

291
00:19:22,865 --> 00:19:25,067
Too many days pass
without progress.

292
00:19:25,067 --> 00:19:28,204
When Doctore suffered
wounds from Theokoles...

293
00:19:28,204 --> 00:19:30,373
Did they require equal
time in the healing?

294
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:32,842
Considerably less.

295
00:19:32,842 --> 00:19:33,943
There might be a blessing

296
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:36,612
hidden among such a curse.

297
00:19:36,612 --> 00:19:37,813
Talk of Crixus' true condition

298
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:41,384
surely has not escaped
beyond these walls. Yet.

299
00:19:42,552 --> 00:19:43,753
Your meaning?

300
00:19:43,753 --> 00:19:45,154
Inquiries for his
purchase could be made

301
00:19:45,154 --> 00:19:46,522
in a delicate fashion.

302
00:19:46,522 --> 00:19:48,424
My visit to the market
could serve dual purposes.

303
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,961
Remove the thought.

304
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:53,062
There'll be no talk
of selling Crixus.

305
00:19:55,132 --> 00:19:56,332
I only fear for the future,
Dominus.

306
00:19:56,332 --> 00:19:59,568
One that does not see
Spartacus erased from it.

307
00:19:59,568 --> 00:20:00,603
Straighten your fucking tongue

308
00:20:00,603 --> 00:20:02,238
and speak plainly.

309
00:20:02,238 --> 00:20:04,373
Yesterday I witnessed
the hatred cultivates

310
00:20:04,373 --> 00:20:07,076
towards Spartacus,
grow beyond measure.

311
00:20:07,076 --> 00:20:08,611
If in his mad passion

312
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:10,880
Crixus, were to make
attempt on his life...

313
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,982
Solicit numbers from Sextus, alone.

314
00:20:12,982 --> 00:20:15,918
Word of Crixus' stunted
recovery must not to spread.

315
00:20:15,918 --> 00:20:19,221
I wish only to discover
his current value.

316
00:20:19,221 --> 00:20:20,656
You would sell Crixus?

317
00:20:25,162 --> 00:20:26,929
I would explore all
avenues of reason.

318
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:30,132
Which has flown if you
consider such a thing.

319
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:31,934
Crixus will fight again.

320
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:34,570
But will he ever be the man he was?

321
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,706
Give him time to heal, Quintus.

322
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:38,574
He bleeds when pierced,
as does any man.

323
00:20:38,574 --> 00:20:39,875
The crowds do not see a man.

324
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,578
They see him a God,
and we present him as such.

325
00:20:42,578 --> 00:20:45,781
Should that myth evaporate,
so goes his worth.

326
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:48,784
Then we'll find worth
in another role.

327
00:20:48,784 --> 00:20:50,119
Well surely his knowledge
would aid instruction

328
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,187
to the lower men?

329
00:20:51,187 --> 00:20:52,355
We already have a Doctore.

330
00:20:52,355 --> 00:20:53,723
The finest in any ludus.

331
00:20:55,158 --> 00:20:56,726
He could work beside you, then.

332
00:20:56,726 --> 00:20:57,860
Crixus has no head for numbers.

333
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,729
The sword is his only purpose.

334
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:02,198
He's part of the family, Quintus!

335
00:21:02,198 --> 00:21:05,134
He is a fucking slave!

336
00:21:05,134 --> 00:21:08,204
This house, this family,
is a business, Lucretia.

337
00:21:08,204 --> 00:21:11,007
As much regret results from
selling a gladiator like Crixus,

338
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:14,110
when the time arrives,
and it fucking will for them all,

339
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,945
it's a necessity that
must be swallowed.

340
00:21:18,682 --> 00:21:19,949
No decision has yet to be made.

341
00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:22,718
He may still prove himself fit.

342
00:21:22,718 --> 00:21:25,388
Turn your mind towards
and her friends.

343
00:21:25,388 --> 00:21:28,924
Win their favor, and see
this family rise ever higher.

344
00:21:51,248 --> 00:21:52,915
Good.

345
00:21:52,915 --> 00:21:55,384
But you lower your
shield when you thrust.

346
00:21:55,384 --> 00:21:57,453
It leaves you open
from shoulder to neck.

347
00:21:57,453 --> 00:21:58,721
Again.

348
00:22:00,524 --> 00:22:01,590
<i>Crixus.</i>

349
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,194
What are you doing?

350
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:07,696
Doctore's gaze misses nothing.

351
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:10,299
A risk made necessary
by unfortunate events.

352
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,837
Has something happened to you?

353
00:22:14,837 --> 00:22:16,539
I am ever safe.

354
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:18,340
But Dominus...

355
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,242
He considers selling
you to another master.

356
00:22:22,412 --> 00:22:23,512
You're mistaken.

357
00:22:23,512 --> 00:22:25,581
Ashur has been sent
to market for herb...

358
00:22:30,353 --> 00:22:32,421
And to question Vibius on
his interest towards you.

359
00:22:34,758 --> 00:22:39,795
Vibius? Lanista of
shits and mongrels!

360
00:22:39,795 --> 00:22:42,364
The glory I have earned this ludus,

361
00:22:42,364 --> 00:22:43,966
this is my fucking reward!

362
00:22:43,966 --> 00:22:46,368
Crixus, you must prove to Dominus

363
00:22:46,368 --> 00:22:47,803
that your time has not passed.

364
00:23:00,283 --> 00:23:03,119
To step onto the
sand as a gladiator

365
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,423
is the highest position
a slave can pray for.

366
00:23:07,423 --> 00:23:08,757
Prove yourselves.

367
00:23:10,393 --> 00:23:12,461
Earn the mark of the brotherhood.

368
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:18,534
You strike a solid blow.

369
00:23:18,534 --> 00:23:19,702
Against an ill-trained fool

370
00:23:19,702 --> 00:23:21,403
who taints the name of gaul.

371
00:23:23,907 --> 00:23:26,542
He may be a fool.

372
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:28,511
But he is one who is fit to train.

373
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:31,180
Again.

374
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,815
You doubt that I am fully healed?

375
00:23:34,084 --> 00:23:36,152
Cause I will show you otherwise.

376
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,524
Doctore, Crixus offers
a demonstration,

377
00:23:41,524 --> 00:23:42,791
to the benefit of the recruits!

378
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,227
Shall I indulge?

379
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:49,365
He believes himself ready.

380
00:23:49,365 --> 00:23:50,633
As do I.

381
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,438
Segovax, your sword and shield.

382
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,181
Attend!

383
00:24:14,424 --> 00:24:15,491
<i>Show then whose champion, Crixus!</i>

384
00:24:18,695 --> 00:24:21,030
Show me.

385
00:24:37,347 --> 00:24:39,381
He attacks boldly

386
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:41,617
to hasten victory.

387
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:47,723
Counter to proper training.

388
00:25:02,572 --> 00:25:05,941
Defeat is delivered
not only by the sword,

389
00:25:05,941 --> 00:25:08,644
but also the crowd.

390
00:25:10,947 --> 00:25:13,682
Fall from their grace,

391
00:25:13,682 --> 00:25:16,185
and you may never rise
to former glories.

392
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:33,168
A true gladiator is
taught to embrace

393
00:25:33,168 --> 00:25:35,337
pain and suffering.

394
00:25:38,608 --> 00:25:41,243
To fight until life flees
from his worthless body.

395
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,107
Learn from this man.

396
00:26:14,911 --> 00:26:16,512
Or share his fate.

397
00:26:17,914 --> 00:26:18,847
<i>Spartacus!</i>

398
00:26:20,617 --> 00:26:22,718
Return to training.

399
00:26:22,718 --> 00:26:24,019
Dominus.

400
00:26:31,094 --> 00:26:34,830
<i>Rhaskos, Hamilcar.</i>

401
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,332
See him to the Medicus.

402
00:26:48,478 --> 00:26:49,712
A fine offer, good Vibius.

403
00:26:49,712 --> 00:26:51,547
I shall hasten to
present it to my master.

404
00:26:53,149 --> 00:26:54,116
A moment, slave.

405
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:00,122
You frequent the
market absent Batiatus?

406
00:27:00,122 --> 00:27:02,791
I conduct important
business on his behalf.

407
00:27:04,127 --> 00:27:05,828
Regarding the former
Champion of Capua?

408
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,998
I discuss no business of the like.

409
00:27:09,998 --> 00:27:12,167
I would, if found in your position.

410
00:27:14,404 --> 00:27:17,239
Crixus is champion in name only.

411
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:19,708
He is but limbs,
dangling from a skewered trunk.

412
00:27:20,877 --> 00:27:22,044
Your master would be well served

413
00:27:22,044 --> 00:27:25,948
pawning him off on
a toad like Vibius.

414
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:28,751
Your concern for my
master is well received.

415
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,655
My concern is not for him,
but about him.

416
00:27:35,325 --> 00:27:36,959
Are your ears receptive?

417
00:27:43,032 --> 00:27:45,501
I cannot stop a free
man from speech.

418
00:27:45,501 --> 00:27:47,736
Were Batiatus, were to
seek reprisal for offenses

419
00:27:47,736 --> 00:27:49,972
he believes I have made,

420
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:52,141
I would wish warning in advance.

421
00:27:57,714 --> 00:27:59,314
I am a villain.

422
00:28:02,318 --> 00:28:04,019
But I'm not your villain.

423
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:05,654
Seek another slave.

424
00:28:05,654 --> 00:28:08,857
Loyalty can become
a crushing weight,

425
00:28:08,857 --> 00:28:11,026
if not braced by proper support.

426
00:28:12,729 --> 00:28:16,799
When your back begins to break,

427
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,103
you'll find my shoulders
broad and welcoming.

428
00:28:26,976 --> 00:28:29,278
You overreach.

429
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:31,547
And here is the result.

430
00:28:31,547 --> 00:28:35,050
Do not address me as
you would a recruit.

431
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,785
Then do not act like one.

432
00:28:36,785 --> 00:28:41,056
Words of import from
the mighty Spartacus,

433
00:28:41,056 --> 00:28:42,925
bringer of rain!

434
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:45,761
Slayer of Theokoles!

435
00:28:45,761 --> 00:28:49,064
As if you stood against
him on your own.

436
00:28:49,064 --> 00:28:53,902
Without my aid,
you would have nothing.

437
00:28:53,902 --> 00:28:57,039
Not even your miserable life.

438
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,107
True.

439
00:28:59,107 --> 00:29:01,043
But here I stand.

440
00:29:01,043 --> 00:29:03,045
And there you sit.

441
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:07,149
You know shit about being champion,

442
00:29:07,149 --> 00:29:10,385
of being a true brother.

443
00:29:10,385 --> 00:29:12,120
You are only playing
at your own part.

444
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,557
And one day the game will end.

445
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:25,434
Death comes to us all.

446
00:29:27,804 --> 00:29:32,140
Press me again,
and you shall find yours.

447
00:29:38,047 --> 00:29:39,948
Gratitude for joining
us this evening,

448
00:29:39,948 --> 00:29:42,417
at the House of Batiatus.

449
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:45,487
Indeed has spoken so
very highly of you that,

450
00:29:45,487 --> 00:29:48,524
I feels if I'm with old friends.

451
00:29:48,524 --> 00:29:50,459
Oh, that's a disadvantage.

452
00:29:50,459 --> 00:29:51,960
Ilithyia neglected to
mention she was acquainted

453
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,229
with the wife of good Batiatus.

454
00:29:54,229 --> 00:29:55,964
I am sure I must have.

455
00:29:55,964 --> 00:29:58,600
She is quite the bitch,
if you have not noticed.

456
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,469
Which is why we love her so.

457
00:30:00,469 --> 00:30:02,404
I grow rather fond of her myself.

458
00:30:02,404 --> 00:30:04,640
Mmm, I could use a cup of
wine to wet the tongue.

459
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,742
You could be drowning,
and gurgle the same.

460
00:30:06,742 --> 00:30:08,043
Oh!

461
00:30:08,043 --> 00:30:09,811
Mmm. Is this sestian?

462
00:30:09,811 --> 00:30:11,079
Falernian.

463
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:13,682
Mmm, she is trying hard,
is she not?

464
00:30:13,682 --> 00:30:16,318
Only because I have told her
how important you are to me.

465
00:30:16,318 --> 00:30:17,686
Yes, we all love each other

466
00:30:17,686 --> 00:30:19,221
and have orgies under the new moon.

467
00:30:19,221 --> 00:30:21,123
Now tell us stories!

468
00:30:21,123 --> 00:30:24,359
Yes, tell us everything
about this horrid place!

469
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:26,495
She means the ludus below.

470
00:30:26,495 --> 00:30:28,130
Do I need an interpreter?

471
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,131
Apparently.

472
00:30:29,131 --> 00:30:31,233
Do be quiet, let her speak!

473
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:33,669
How do you live among such beasts?

474
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:35,904
My husband sees them well tamed.

475
00:30:35,904 --> 00:30:37,606
I pray not fully.

476
00:30:39,108 --> 00:30:40,909
Some instinct remains.

477
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:44,379
So that they may yet unleash
their savagery in the arena.

478
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:45,781
I would go insane here!

479
00:30:45,781 --> 00:30:49,618
Surrounded by all these animals,
high atop this mountain.

480
00:30:49,618 --> 00:30:51,053
Would you not prefer
to live in the city,

481
00:30:51,053 --> 00:30:52,854
surrounded by real people?

482
00:30:56,392 --> 00:30:59,328
I find that we are
perfectly located.

483
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,096
I need only step
out onto my balcony

484
00:31:01,096 --> 00:31:03,765
and all of Capua kneels at my feet.

485
00:31:03,765 --> 00:31:06,101
Well stated.

486
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:07,703
But are you not bored?

487
00:31:07,703 --> 00:31:09,137
Up here, all alone?

488
00:31:09,137 --> 00:31:11,773
Nothing but slaves and beasts,

489
00:31:11,773 --> 00:31:13,208
not even children to occupy..

490
00:31:15,612 --> 00:31:17,412
Boredom?

491
00:31:17,412 --> 00:31:20,215
Impossible with so
many distractions!

492
00:31:21,718 --> 00:31:23,518
I stay quite occupied.

493
00:31:23,518 --> 00:31:26,788
Each day brings
with it opportunity.

494
00:31:26,788 --> 00:31:28,890
Yesterday, in fact,
six new recruits

495
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,726
began their training.

496
00:31:30,726 --> 00:31:33,095
One of whom fights under
Ilithyia's patronage.

497
00:31:35,164 --> 00:31:36,531
Ilithyia?

498
00:31:36,531 --> 00:31:38,233
Claudius gave you approval?

499
00:31:38,233 --> 00:31:39,334
He does not know.

500
00:31:43,506 --> 00:31:45,874
A few coins,
parceled from my allowance.

501
00:31:45,874 --> 00:31:47,909
He will kill you when he finds out!

502
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:50,846
And I will kill the first
who tells, caecilia!

503
00:31:50,846 --> 00:31:53,615
Mmm, a gladiator of your own!

504
00:31:53,615 --> 00:31:55,417
May we see him?

505
00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:58,020
Course, he's not yet a gladiator.

506
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,121
He must pass the final test

507
00:31:59,121 --> 00:32:01,490
before he earns the
mark of Batiatus.

508
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,393
Oh. So he is only a slave, then?

509
00:32:06,596 --> 00:32:08,330
Oh, for the time being but..

510
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,532
I would lay eyes upon
a real gladiator.

511
00:32:12,068 --> 00:32:13,068
Yes!

512
00:32:13,936 --> 00:32:14,870
A champion!

513
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,805
Bring Spartacus up!

514
00:32:16,805 --> 00:32:20,208
Spartacus, oh yes!

515
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:21,209
You must!

516
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,415
Bring the champion.

517
00:32:26,415 --> 00:32:29,718
Let us all revel in his presence.

518
00:32:40,095 --> 00:32:42,530
Gratitude.

519
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,664
For your aid in my training today.

520
00:32:48,437 --> 00:32:51,572
I would be eager
to hear any advice,

521
00:32:51,572 --> 00:32:54,075
to further my cause.

522
00:32:54,075 --> 00:32:57,011
Your cause?

523
00:32:57,011 --> 00:33:00,848
Victories in the arena,
and freedom.

524
00:33:04,219 --> 00:33:08,122
Forsake any thoughts of freedom,

525
00:33:08,122 --> 00:33:12,059
and the life you once
had beyond these walls.

526
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:15,229
Accept your fate...

527
00:33:15,229 --> 00:33:17,865
Or be destroyed by specters
of a past never to return.

528
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:21,535
Spartacus, you are summoned.

529
00:33:26,508 --> 00:33:30,077
Mmm, he stands as mars,
ready for war.

530
00:33:36,485 --> 00:33:37,785
Is there truth to the legends?

531
00:33:37,785 --> 00:33:40,488
Gladiators share the
blood of the gods?

532
00:33:40,488 --> 00:33:42,890
The mighty Crixus, most certainly.

533
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,358
Now there was a man!

534
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:46,393
Truly blessed by the gods!

535
00:33:46,393 --> 00:33:48,829
When will we see him
in the arena again?

536
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:49,930
Soon.

537
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,233
What of you, Spartacus?

538
00:33:52,233 --> 00:33:54,401
Are you a blessing to us?

539
00:33:54,401 --> 00:33:55,361
To some.

540
00:33:57,339 --> 00:34:00,141
To others, a curse.

541
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:02,409
A duality of his kind.

542
00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:04,945
Admired as a gladiator.

543
00:34:04,945 --> 00:34:07,381
Yet despised as a slave.

544
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:09,483
He is much more
than a common slave.

545
00:34:09,483 --> 00:34:11,986
You can feel it radiating
from his flesh...

546
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:14,655
I have heard tale of
a champion's blood

547
00:34:14,655 --> 00:34:17,024
possessing many restorative powers.

548
00:34:17,024 --> 00:34:19,293
A few drops in a
glass of wine is said

549
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:22,129
to make a man hard for days!

550
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:24,465
Such are the legends.

551
00:34:24,465 --> 00:34:27,334
Well I would test them
for myself, if I could?

552
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:28,769
Certainly.

553
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:29,837
I'll send a messenger with a vial..

554
00:34:29,837 --> 00:34:31,038
I would have it now.

555
00:34:39,114 --> 00:34:40,147
May I have the honor?

556
00:34:46,588 --> 00:34:50,090
Take care not to cut too deeply.

557
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:53,060
The legend does call for the
blood of a dead gladiator,

558
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,196
does it not?

559
00:34:55,196 --> 00:34:58,465
But such details
should not concern us.

560
00:34:58,465 --> 00:35:00,501
Spartacus will die soon enough...

561
00:35:03,738 --> 00:35:06,173
To the roar of the crowd.

562
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:16,817
I do not believe he will
ever fall in the arena.

563
00:35:16,817 --> 00:35:18,652
He is a God among men.

564
00:35:18,652 --> 00:35:20,688
He's nothing but a thracian dog.

565
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:22,623
His treachery dishonored Rome.

566
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:24,258
It is your husband who
bears the dishonor.

567
00:35:24,258 --> 00:35:25,492
Guards!

568
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:28,362
He abandoned defenseless
women and children.

569
00:35:28,362 --> 00:35:29,930
Left to be raped and murdered.

570
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,265
Get him out of here!

571
00:35:32,601 --> 00:35:33,634
What a bold tongue!

572
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:34,969
Apologies.

573
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:36,871
Were he my slave,
I would have him crucified!

574
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:41,041
For what?

575
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:42,877
Speaking the truth?

576
00:35:42,877 --> 00:35:45,045
We've all heard the
rumors about your husband.

577
00:35:49,885 --> 00:35:51,552
The hour grows late,
and I'm expected.

578
00:35:53,755 --> 00:35:57,691
Gratitude for a most
interesting evening.

579
00:35:57,691 --> 00:35:59,860
One that begs a repeat soon.

580
00:36:09,104 --> 00:36:10,804
Apologies.

581
00:36:10,804 --> 00:36:13,240
None required.

582
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,009
You will soon learn
that women of note

583
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:16,677
have a rabid taste

584
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:18,913
for the embarrassment
of their friends.

585
00:36:18,913 --> 00:36:20,981
Well I would not see
mine treated so.

586
00:36:24,252 --> 00:36:28,255
May I have words with Segovax,
before I take my leave?

587
00:36:28,255 --> 00:36:31,392
I wish to bid my man good
fortune in the days to follow.

588
00:36:33,161 --> 00:36:34,161
Ahh!

589
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:39,500
Ah, my fortune returns!

590
00:36:43,605 --> 00:36:44,325
Varro.

591
00:36:45,874 --> 00:36:46,941
I'm of a winning mind.

592
00:36:46,941 --> 00:36:49,176
Save your words of caution.

593
00:36:49,176 --> 00:36:51,011
I'm not here for words.

594
00:36:51,011 --> 00:36:52,780
I'm here for dice.

595
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,315
You and dice?

596
00:36:54,315 --> 00:36:55,849
I am of a mood tonight.

597
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:57,785
I would have distraction.

598
00:36:57,785 --> 00:36:59,019
And coin.

599
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,924
The rules, then.

600
00:37:03,924 --> 00:37:06,894
Should I need instruction,
I shall ask.

601
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,981
Leave us.

602
00:37:29,951 --> 00:37:33,287
Do you know who I am, slave?

603
00:37:33,287 --> 00:37:36,190
Apologies.

604
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,458
I do not.

605
00:37:39,027 --> 00:37:42,096
I am your Domina.

606
00:37:42,096 --> 00:37:43,897
My coin pays for your training.

607
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,600
Water.

608
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,102
Food.

609
00:37:48,102 --> 00:37:50,137
The very air you breathe.

610
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,009
Survive to receive the mark,

611
00:37:55,009 --> 00:37:57,911
and you will become my gladiator.

612
00:37:59,147 --> 00:38:00,481
My champion.

613
00:38:03,918 --> 00:38:04,852
Domina.

614
00:38:09,124 --> 00:38:11,525
Please me,

615
00:38:11,525 --> 00:38:14,361
and the rewards
will be substantial.

616
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,231
Wine...

617
00:38:17,231 --> 00:38:19,366
Women...

618
00:38:19,366 --> 00:38:20,801
Even freedom, perhaps.

619
00:38:23,638 --> 00:38:26,273
You desire such a thing?

620
00:38:26,273 --> 00:38:28,242
Freedom?

621
00:38:28,242 --> 00:38:29,510
Yes, Domina.

622
00:38:33,715 --> 00:38:36,717
There is something I desire.

623
00:38:36,717 --> 00:38:37,985
See it attended to,

624
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:41,622
and your freedom will be secured...

625
00:38:44,893 --> 00:38:47,261
Should never have been summoned!

626
00:38:47,261 --> 00:38:49,029
I had little choice.

627
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:50,798
Ilithyia, and the man
should be kept separate.

628
00:38:50,798 --> 00:38:54,101
Throwing them together
invites calamity.

629
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:57,471
The risk bore fruit.

630
00:38:57,471 --> 00:38:59,807
Lincinia, intimates another visit.

631
00:39:00,775 --> 00:39:02,076
Spartacus her purpose?

632
00:39:02,076 --> 00:39:03,143
Undoubtedly.

633
00:39:04,446 --> 00:39:08,215
Then we shall accommodate.

634
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:12,219
Her cousin good Crassus
owns the fucking heavens,

635
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:13,754
even if he is not
currently favored by

636
00:39:13,754 --> 00:39:15,689
his fellows in the senate.

637
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:19,226
Your efforts raise us ever higher.

638
00:39:21,262 --> 00:39:24,098
And how do yours fare?

639
00:39:24,098 --> 00:39:26,133
Have you received
offers for Crixus?

640
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:28,202
I meet Vibius tomorrow.

641
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:29,870
Vibius?

642
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,505
His ludus is in Damascus!

643
00:39:31,505 --> 00:39:33,107
Crixus will fare better
in the smaller venues,

644
00:39:33,107 --> 00:39:34,608
until he is healed.

645
00:39:38,513 --> 00:39:39,480
Well, tomorrow, then?

646
00:39:41,316 --> 00:39:43,317
His glory fades.

647
00:39:43,317 --> 00:39:45,652
I would not have it
extinguish beneath our roof.

648
00:39:48,823 --> 00:39:51,592
Damascus?

649
00:39:51,592 --> 00:39:54,962
Dominus meets with tomorrow.

650
00:39:54,962 --> 00:39:57,965
I've never seen Damascus.

651
00:39:57,965 --> 00:39:59,766
Do you think I'll like it?

652
00:40:03,404 --> 00:40:06,473
You cannot go.

653
00:40:06,473 --> 00:40:09,843
The decision is made.

654
00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:12,312
Even Domina doubts me.

655
00:40:12,312 --> 00:40:13,614
I see it in her eyes.

656
00:40:18,486 --> 00:40:20,187
Then convince her otherwise.

657
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:25,859
My words carry no weight.

658
00:40:29,531 --> 00:40:31,165
I do not speak of words.

659
00:40:38,806 --> 00:40:39,907
You would have me do this?

660
00:40:43,178 --> 00:40:44,578
I would have you stay.

661
00:41:03,531 --> 00:41:04,464
The coin you lost to me.

662
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:07,801
Which makes it yours.

663
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:08,802
You are a fool.

664
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:10,537
You have thrown dice before.

665
00:41:10,537 --> 00:41:14,241
I turned from such
things years ago.

666
00:41:14,241 --> 00:41:16,944
For my wife.

667
00:41:16,944 --> 00:41:18,812
You are a better man than I.

668
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:20,814
Do not forget why
you are here, Varro.

669
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:23,083
Remove your hand.
You dishonor your family.

670
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:24,418
You dishonor your own wife.

671
00:41:24,418 --> 00:41:25,852
My wife is a whore!

672
00:41:33,161 --> 00:41:34,962
She carries another man's child.

673
00:41:49,143 --> 00:41:50,611
How did this come to be?

674
00:41:50,611 --> 00:41:51,878
A friend, from the marketplace.

675
00:41:53,448 --> 00:41:55,515
She claims he forced
his way onto her, but..

676
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:56,550
And you find fault with her?

677
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,684
She did not fight.

678
00:41:57,684 --> 00:41:59,453
Had you not left to pay your debts,

679
00:41:59,453 --> 00:42:00,854
she would not have had to.

680
00:42:05,193 --> 00:42:08,328
She lives, Varro.

681
00:42:08,328 --> 00:42:10,731
She lives.

682
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:12,366
You may yet hold her in your arms.

683
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:19,373
A thought a decent
man would cherish.

684
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,162
My husband is at market on
business concerning you.

685
00:42:43,364 --> 00:42:45,399
He believes your day
may have passed.

686
00:42:48,136 --> 00:42:49,096
And you?

687
00:42:50,938 --> 00:42:52,139
I pray he is mistaken.

688
00:42:56,444 --> 00:42:59,813
And your gods?

689
00:42:59,813 --> 00:43:02,149
Do they answer your prayers?

690
00:43:02,149 --> 00:43:04,651
They're silent.

691
00:43:14,796 --> 00:43:19,066
Then let us crack
open the heavens...

692
00:43:19,066 --> 00:43:21,768
And gain their attention...

693
00:43:26,741 --> 00:43:29,009
Remove any doubt...

694
00:43:29,009 --> 00:43:31,378
That my day has passed...

695
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:33,831
Ah!

696
00:43:34,716 --> 00:43:35,466
Ah!

697
00:43:36,718 --> 00:43:37,468
Oh!

698
00:43:52,066 --> 00:43:53,433
She seemed... pleased.

699
00:43:53,433 --> 00:43:54,601
Naevia.

700
00:43:54,601 --> 00:43:57,337
You did what you had to.

701
00:43:57,337 --> 00:43:59,106
What I asked of you.

702
00:44:03,978 --> 00:44:06,847
Dominus is already at market.

703
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:09,750
Speaking with Vibius.

704
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,552
There is nothing that
cannot be undone.

705
00:44:12,552 --> 00:44:15,155
You are a good man, Crixus.

706
00:44:15,155 --> 00:44:16,523
The gods will not
see you treated so.

707
00:44:17,592 --> 00:44:19,659
They now favor Spartacus.

708
00:44:22,063 --> 00:44:23,196
They give no shit for me.

709
00:45:29,297 --> 00:45:31,465
Forgive me, champion...

710
00:46:10,338 --> 00:46:15,542
You'd kill a fellow gaul...

711
00:46:15,542 --> 00:46:18,745
To save a man you hate?

712
00:46:18,745 --> 00:46:19,946
I do not save Spartacus.

713
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:25,385
I saved a brother
who shares the mark.

714
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:38,698
You have earned a glorious death...

715
00:46:38,698 --> 00:46:41,801
And will die at the
hands of a gladiator.

716
00:46:46,274 --> 00:46:49,276
I leave these walls
for a fucking moment

717
00:46:49,276 --> 00:46:51,144
and a recruit tries
to kill Spartacus,

718
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:53,179
Ilithyia's own fucking man?!

719
00:46:53,179 --> 00:46:55,715
And he would have succeeded,
if it weren't for Crixus.

720
00:46:57,351 --> 00:46:59,286
His days not passed.

721
00:46:59,286 --> 00:47:01,388
Oh fuck!

722
00:47:01,388 --> 00:47:02,455
Send note to Vibius.

723
00:47:02,455 --> 00:47:04,758
Crixus is no longer for sale.

724
00:47:04,758 --> 00:47:06,893
Oh, I feared terms were
already agreed upon.

725
00:47:06,893 --> 00:47:08,695
Well fuck the terms!

726
00:47:08,695 --> 00:47:10,897
Should he have issue,
he can reason to my cock.

727
00:47:14,602 --> 00:47:18,038
Ahh, the snake arrives,
walking as if human.

728
00:47:19,307 --> 00:47:21,641
I pray I have not missed the test?

729
00:47:21,641 --> 00:47:24,344
Delayed, due to most
unfortunate events.

730
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:26,313
Spartacus, the Champion of Capua,

731
00:47:26,313 --> 00:47:29,549
was attacked unawares in the baths.

732
00:47:29,549 --> 00:47:31,518
Attacked?

733
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:34,521
By your recruit, Segovax.

734
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:37,724
How unfortunate.

735
00:47:37,724 --> 00:47:40,794
For your man, yes.

736
00:47:40,794 --> 00:47:42,529
He had to be punished, of course.

737
00:48:01,515 --> 00:48:03,149
Spartacus yet lives.

738
00:48:03,149 --> 00:48:04,417
Yet.

739
00:48:11,258 --> 00:48:13,059
Your man would not
speak as to his reason,

740
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:15,495
even when parted from his cock.

741
00:48:27,408 --> 00:48:28,908
He gave you no sign of cause

742
00:48:28,908 --> 00:48:31,077
when you met with him
last night did he?

743
00:48:31,077 --> 00:48:33,647
No. It is a mystery.

744
00:48:45,793 --> 00:48:48,328
I will regain my position,
champion.

745
00:48:49,764 --> 00:48:52,832
I welcome the attempt.

746
00:48:55,050 --> 00:59:58,120

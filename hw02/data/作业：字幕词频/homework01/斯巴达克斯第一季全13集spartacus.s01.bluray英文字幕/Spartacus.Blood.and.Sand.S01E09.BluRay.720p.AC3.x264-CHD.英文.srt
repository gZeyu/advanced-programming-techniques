1
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,060
Ah, fuck.

2
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,300
Two weeks and the mark's
still raw as a whore's cunt.

3
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,630
Argh, I bear the same mark, brother.

4
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,660
Without pissing about it.

5
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,500
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

6
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,100
You lower your guard after each assault.

7
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,760
I shall see it raised then.

8
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,900
Your head is mine.

9
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,600
How shall I mount it?

10
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,230
You move well today.

11
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,330
You do not.

12
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,560
What distracts you?

13
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,700
I had Ashur send a letter to Aurelia.

14
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,500
A week past now, and no reply.

15
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,300
You expect different?

16
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,830
A woman seldom rushes
back to the husband

17
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,830
who calls her whore.

18
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,260
I said no such thing.

19
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,400
Not in words.

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,460
The letter was contrite.

21
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,700
I admitted I reacted poorly

22
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,130
to the news of her being with child.

23
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,530
And now she makes you wait.

24
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,660
The way women punish us for being fools.

25
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,800
Strike it from your mind.

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,700
Or find your brains upon the sand.

27
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,030
These are exquisite.

28
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,130
Yes, they've been in the
family for generations.

29
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,900
So this sort of
arrangement happens often?

30
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,560
- No.
- Um.

31
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,360
But when such a request is made,

32
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,000
one must be prepared to
offer only the finest quality.

33
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,500
The House of Batiatus does
not fall short in that regard.

34
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,530
This one, I think.

35
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,300
Ah, Diana, the goddess of the hunt.

36
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,330
A fine choice.

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,700
Do you think she would approve?

38
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,960
When actaeon saw her bathing,

39
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,660
she turned the poor bastard into a stag

40
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,500
and set his own dogs upon him.

41
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,860
Oh, how fitting then,
that you should have

42
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,100
a stag of your own to play with.

43
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,900
Have you decided?

44
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,630
There is only one man I would invite

45
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,130
such peril to know.

46
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,660
I will have Spartacus.

47
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,700
The champion,

48
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,760
of course.

49
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,060
Is that a problem?

50
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,230
If more coin is required.

51
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,200
No, no, no, no, no.

52
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,660
No the cousin to Marcus Crassus deserves

53
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,760
the Slayer of Theokoles himself,

54
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,430
at fair price.

55
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,800
Oh, it is not the price that concerns.

56
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,520
Psssh.

57
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,700
If ever my husband were to hear of this.

58
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,160
The gods themselves would have to

59
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,230
whisper it in his ear.

60
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,130
We take the utmost
care with the delicate

61
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,400
nature of these arrangements.

62
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,400
The mask ensures anonymity,

63
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,500
but you must also do your part.

64
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,130
Tell no one.

65
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,730
Arrive exactly at the appointed time,

66
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,500
unencumbered.

67
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,200
Absent slaves or attendants?

68
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,960
Who would hold your husband's
loyalty truer to value.

69
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,000
I would err, avoid complications,

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,630
for you and this ludus.

71
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,860
Ilithyia.

72
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,610
Oh.

73
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,730
Apologies.

74
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,130
Am I early?

75
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,330
For what purpose?

76
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,460
You invited me to midday meal.

77
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,530
Did you?

78
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,530
Yes. For tomorrow.

79
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,700
Oh, was it?

80
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,000
I pray I have not interrupted
important proceedings.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,330
Oh, no, on the contrary.

82
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,400
We were only just speaking about you

83
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,360
and your gladiator.

84
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,830
What was his name?

85
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,860
The celt...

86
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,860
Segovax.

87
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,800
Yes, Segovax.

88
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,930
Pity.

89
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,460
Perhaps you should
buy several next time.

90
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,960
Until you get the hang of it.

91
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,830
It's a difficult process.

92
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,060
Very few make it to the final
test, still few the arena.

93
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,330
My husband demands only the finest.

94
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,000
As do we all.

95
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,930
Forgive my haste, but my
own husband expects me.

96
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,330
I look forward to our next encounter.

97
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,330
She favors you.

98
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,360
And I her.

99
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,600
It warms the heart, to know my hands

100
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,730
are responsible.

101
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,460
Then let me take them in gratitude.

102
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,030
You should be more careful.

103
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,300
With Licinia.

104
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,800
She's of a strata above your station,

105
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,130
and will not hesitate
to remind you of it

106
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,800
the minute her mood shifts.

107
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,730
And it shifts frequently.

108
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,730
I am well versed in
dealing with such people.

109
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,730
Of course you are.

110
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,130
So, am I to be invited?

111
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,000
Invited?

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,630
To what?

113
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,060
To the masquerade.

114
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,230
You think I did not notice the mask

115
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,160
she was attempting to conceal?

116
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,930
You're mistaken.

117
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,200
There is no masquerade.

118
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,930
She merely wanted to
borrow the visage of Diana.

119
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,700
To avoid "complications"?

120
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,900
A wealthy woman of
status visiting a ludus.

121
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,800
Concealing masks and
whispering of complications.

122
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,900
If I did not know better,

123
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,900
I would suspect intent

124
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,900
- to fuck one of your gladiators.
- Ilithyia.

125
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,800
She is, isn't she?

126
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,160
Oh, that little whore!

127
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,500
How positively depraved!

128
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,100
I promised discretion,

129
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,100
you must not breathe a
word of this to anyone.

130
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,200
I would never think it.

131
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,630
You have been a most valued friend.

132
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:47,830
And this will be our little secret.

133
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,130
I can control her.

134
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,730
Ilithyia?

135
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,030
Like you did with her and Segovax?

136
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,830
She had her own man make
attempt on Spartacus,

137
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,860
under our very roof.

138
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,700
And you yet speak of control.

139
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,160
Spartacus inflames her beyond reason.

140
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,030
Licinia is a different matter.

141
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,400
Even Ilithyia has sense enough

142
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,400
to fear reprisal from the
cousin of Marcus Crassus.

143
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,330
Humph, as she should.

144
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,000
That man shits gold!

145
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,430
To have the favor of
such an ally in Rome

146
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,960
could pave my way to
a seat in the curia...

147
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,330
There is one small obstacle.

148
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,460
Licinia favors the
touch of our champion.

149
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,500
Ha, Spartacus?

150
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,860
That will not be difficult.

151
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,600
Oh, he's always difficult.

152
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,960
In a past that no longer exists.

153
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,330
I shall command...

154
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,400
And it shall be done.

155
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,000
Argh.

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,900
The Champion of Capua arrives!

157
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,200
A man who so terrifies Jupiter

158
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,230
the clouds burst and the heavens weep!

159
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,400
My glory is but a
reflection of my Dominus.

160
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,500
You flatter!

161
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,700
I return in kind.

162
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,430
And the gods take notice.

163
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,260
Just when I thought we'd
accrued every accolade,

164
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,630
yet another falls in our
laps from the heavens.

165
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,800
Fair Licinia, cousin to
Marcus Crassus himself,

166
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,430
has personally requested you.

167
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,600
Crassus?

168
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,400
Richest man in the Republic.

169
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,000
A great honor.

170
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,560
Who's to be my opponent?

171
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,530
Opponent?!

172
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,560
Licinia has no interest
in watching you fight.

173
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,230
Her desires are of a more...

174
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,360
Intimate nature.

175
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,630
I am to lie with her?

176
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,160
And shame all men who follow.

177
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,430
Such things are asked of a champion?

178
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,700
They are.

179
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,030
You have concern?

180
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,430
No.

181
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,330
I am the Champion of Capua.

182
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,490
I shall perform all
duties required of me.

183
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,300
Bring her to satisfaction.

184
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,160
And see our fortunes
rise along with your cock.

185
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,200
Is there discomfort?

186
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,450
None.

187
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,330
When can I return to training?

188
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,600
The fact that you yet
walk among the living

189
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,360
is a marvel in itself.

190
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,660
How long?

191
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,360
A week.

192
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,600
Maybe two...

193
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,960
Tomorrow.

194
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,160
No. It is much too soon.

195
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,740
Tomorrow.

196
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,360
Tomorrow, then.

197
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,700
A glorious day, long in coming!

198
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,260
Crixus!

199
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,460
Risen from the dead!

200
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,660
And Ashur, finally
freed of his shackles,

201
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,530
to take up sword again!

202
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,900
You would resume training?

203
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,100
As a gladiator?

204
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,800
I yet bear the mark.

205
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,700
And long to stand with my brothers,

206
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,430
once more upon the sands of the arena.

207
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,860
Perhaps this time you
will have the sense

208
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,360
to stay out of my way.

209
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,960
Take this fucking thing off me.

210
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,460
Now.

211
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,400
He gave you no pause?

212
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,530
None.

213
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,860
Our dog...

214
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,700
Is finally house broken...

215
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,230
You were wise...

216
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,500
To put down his bitch...

217
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,900
Ohhh, oh, uh.

218
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:55,360
Leave... and send in some wine.

219
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,960
Everything comes to plan.

220
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,500
We shall have Licinia's wet gratitude,

221
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,600
and with it the ear of Marcus Crassus.

222
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,400
If Spartacus performs as promised.

223
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,300
Every breath he takes is in service to

224
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,630
the glory of this house.

225
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,730
I know he's willing.

226
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,230
But its been many months
since he last lay with a woman.

227
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,900
After such a time,
his passion might be...

228
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,860
All too brief.

229
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,200
Well, that would prove unfortunate.

230
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,700
Yet easily avoidable,

231
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,760
if Spartacus is presented opportunity

232
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,430
to hone his skills beforehand...

233
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,460
You have wandered to the wrong cell.

234
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,800
Are you not Spartacus?

235
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,330
Bringer of rain?

236
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,830
I am Mira.

237
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,860
I have been sent to please you.

238
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,230
To what end?

239
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,500
Is your pleasure not an end to itself?

240
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,160
I do not care for games.

241
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,000
Give your true purpose.

242
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,460
Find your tongue!

243
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,500
Domina fears that you've been too long

244
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,100
without a women.

245
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,730
That you will be unable
to withhold your seed

246
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,730
long enough to please the roman woman.

247
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,660
The notion offends me.

248
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,060
As does your presence.

249
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,060
You do not desire me?

250
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,900
I desire only sleep.

251
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,060
And the absence of dreams.

252
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,100
The gods grant me strength

253
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,130
to rip these fucking
bars from their moorings.

254
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,860
We were fools to think they favor us.

255
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,000
We yet share a roof.

256
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,460
It would not have happened
if Dominus had sold me.

257
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,700
Is that not proof that
our union is favored?

258
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,630
To have you, but not have you.

259
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,830
It is a wound beyond healing.

260
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,700
All wounds heal.

261
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,230
Even the deepest.

262
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,560
Would that they had
never been inflicted.

263
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,660
You would wish never
to have known my heart?

264
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,060
The Undefeated Gaul returns.

265
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,000
Perhaps it is time he chose a new name.

266
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,340
Crixus.

267
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,600
My spirit soars to see
you again upon the sands.

268
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,200
The underworld would not have me.

269
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,330
Take note!

270
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,930
A true champion rejoins the brotherhood!

271
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,900
Champion of ass and balls.

272
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,130
Has there ever been
such a man as Crixus?

273
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,430
No, Domina.

274
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,300
There has not.

275
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,230
Praise the gods for his return.

276
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,330
May they guide him to
many more victories.

277
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,700
And our purse filled by such.

278
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,260
Yes.

279
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,930
Filled to bursting.

280
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,430
You will spar with Duro.

281
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,300
The german?

282
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,100
He has yet to step in the arena.

283
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,660
And you have been long absent.

284
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,530
Prove yourself against the
man and see advancement.

285
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,600
And who shall face Ashur?

286
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:45,660
Choose carefully, for I long for blood.

287
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,900
- You train?
- I do.

288
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,560
By whose word?

289
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,030
The Dominus himself promised

290
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,530
that I would rejoin the brotherhood

291
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:56,000
once I was freed from
that fucking brace...

292
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,200
Ashur.

293
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,660
A word.

294
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,800
The master calls his dog.

295
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,700
What of my victory over Hasdrubal?

296
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,800
How the crowd roared when
I cloved his head in two?

297
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
A minor victory, long forgotten.

298
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,830
Kleitos, then!

299
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,460
- Or... or Lysimachos...
- All long ago.

300
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,300
Your days as a gladiator are past.

301
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,460
Dominus.

302
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,560
I beg of you.

303
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,100
Let me prove myself yet worthy.

304
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,830
You already have.

305
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,030
Outside of the arena.

306
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,100
Your cunning is sharper
than any gladiator's sword.

307
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,560
I would not risk it on
errands of foolish pride.

308
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,460
We in agreement?

309
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,660
Your will, Dominus.

310
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,160
To business, then.

311
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,600
I have had thoughts toward Solonius.

312
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,300
I would discuss on the way to market.

313
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,060
Did you note any signs of discomfort

314
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,360
as Crixus took the sand?

315
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,200
- No, Domina.
- Uh.

316
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,830
He's anxious to regain his place.

317
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,830
But I would not see him overreach,

318
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:19,160
nor hide pain from his recovery.

319
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,830
If you notice Crixus attempting
to conceal anything from me,

320
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,930
you tell me immediately.

321
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,760
Yes, Domina.

322
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,000
The opposite sex has no sense whatever

323
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,600
when it comes to their limits.

324
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,100
They must be constantly watched,

325
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,060
least they harm themselves in
the simple act of being men.

326
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,430
Wait.

327
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,830
Domina.

328
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,060
How did you fare with
Spartacus last night?

329
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,230
Was his cock of impressive
size when engorged?

330
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,260
How many times did he have you?

331
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,730
Huh?

332
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,180
Speak.

333
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,430
He would not have me.

334
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,260
He would not?

335
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,830
No, Domina.

336
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,560
And yet you wait until now to tell me?

337
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,330
I was afraid you would be displeased.

338
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,930
Take your dress off.

339
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,400
Tits, ass and cunt.

340
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,930
All appear to be without
disease or deformity.

341
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,660
Which tells me the fault
is not in the flesh,

342
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,530
but in the bitch.

343
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,360
Apologies, Domina.

344
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,860
Return to his cell tonight
and I expect his cock in you.

345
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,260
Or you'll find a sword in its place.

346
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,700
Ahhh.

347
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,860
This isn't the arena.

348
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,360
The world is my arena, pup.

349
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,700
Send me a man.

350
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,630
Stand down!

351
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,320
Agron!

352
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,250
Duro!

353
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,300
Enough.

354
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,230
Half rations for the
remainder of the week.

355
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,930
Test my patience again and
I'll see you both to the mines!

356
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,460
Crixus continues making friends.

357
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,630
Yet no word from your wife?

358
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,800
None forthcoming,

359
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,330
and no more coin to pay Ashur
for the service of letters.

360
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,430
You will dishonor us,

361
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,360
if your mind is not on the games.

362
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,030
Tell the jackal I will cover the cost.

363
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,000
I will repay you.

364
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,630
Quickly.

365
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,700
Before he departs.

366
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,420
Ashur.

367
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,560
Your man has run afoot.

368
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,700
Perhaps you'd care for a real opponent.

369
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,460
Are you so eager to
return to the Medicus?

370
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,530
Crixus.

371
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,800
You are summoned.

372
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,300
Soon.

373
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,400
Uhh, get off...

374
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,530
Ahhh,

375
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,600
tarry a while.

376
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,430
Your masters yet at market, and

377
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,900
Ilithyia's not expected
for several hours.

378
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,800
Uh, is my skin not soft?

379
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,900
Yes, Domina.

380
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,460
I had the slaves draw a milk bath,

381
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,330
recalling a time when it pleased you

382
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,200
that we could afford such things...

383
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,100
Oh, does it yet cause you pain?

384
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,400
No, Domina.

385
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,960
I wish I could say the same.

386
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,860
It was torture to see such perfection

387
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,300
marred by Theokoles.

388
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,730
When you fell to your knees...

389
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,160
And the giant was at your back...

390
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,360
My heart seized in my chest,

391
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:56,530
then you looked up to the pulvinus.

392
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,060
To me.

393
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,230
What was of your mind,

394
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,760
in that frozen moment
between life and death?

395
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,330
That I welcomed the afterlife,

396
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:11,530
having know the love of a goddess.

397
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,660
You will always be mine, Crixus.

398
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,900
Mine alone.

399
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,130
Five sacks, for the price of ten.

400
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,300
And see to it they are
dryer this time, shit whore.

401
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,160
The last ones stank of mold.

402
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,200
Do not churn, good Solonius.

403
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,100
The thief will suffer

404
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,730
when prices plummet
with the next harvest.

405
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,930
I pray his cock follows the decline.

406
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,330
You are left off leash?

407
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,160
My master is at his villa.

408
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:05,600
I yet have business to attend.

409
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,860
And words, searching for receptive ears.

410
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,060
My situation has shifted.

411
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,560
And with it, your loyalties?

412
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,800
Batiatus proves himself
unworthy, as you had divined.

413
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,560
Such base character seldom weighs

414
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,300
the true worth of a man.

415
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,700
I take it your scales
are more in balance.

416
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,860
I hold valuable news.

417
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,760
Beyond the meager recompense you offered

418
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,030
when last we spoke.

419
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,630
I am surrounded by jackals...

420
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,860
It concerns your life.

421
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,830
If that is no cause for you
to loosen your purse... um.

422
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,260
Wait.

423
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,430
You have picked my bones clean.

424
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,560
Speak, before I reclaim the meat.

425
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,560
You fuck the whore Despoina

426
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,530
on this night every week, do you not?

427
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,260
You voice what is
already well known to me.

428
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,300
Um.

429
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,300
Send another cock in your place.

430
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,160
Or see it removed along with your head.

431
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,030
Batiatus moves against me?

432
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,830
I am to pay his agent,
and see the order given.

433
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,260
You've been warned.

434
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,400
I really cannot believe the difference.

435
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,830
When I first visited your home,

436
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,060
I felt great sorrow for the woman forced

437
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,560
to live in such conditions.

438
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,760
Now look at you.

439
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,060
Surrounded by opulence

440
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,960
rivaling families of proper heritage.

441
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,830
Trinkets merely,

442
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,860
not nearly so valuable
as your friendship.

443
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,200
You have many new friends of late.

444
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,800
You and Licinia seem quite at ease

445
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,060
with one another.

446
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,860
Gratitude for the introduction.

447
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,700
Would you care for some wine or...

448
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,460
Wine will not still my thoughts.

449
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:10,200
I prattle on with pleasantries,

450
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,700
but I cannot pretend indifference

451
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,200
to what you revealed about Licinia.

452
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,460
I revealed nothing.

453
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,100
You jumped to conclusions.

454
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,960
And landed on proper footing.

455
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:29,930
Ever since, I can think of nothing else.

456
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,660
With respect,

457
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:39,160
Licinia's passions are her own concern.

458
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,400
My mind falls not to Licinia.

459
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,960
It is filled with baser thoughts.

460
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,460
The vision of brutish hands

461
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,560
being laid upon me.

462
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,730
In a manner quite lacking
in my husband's touch.

463
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,160
I should not speak of such things.

464
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,560
I dishonor myself.

465
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,460
Your desires should not shame you.

466
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,230
You are a woman.

467
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,760
Our needs are vast.

468
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,930
I must put my mind from it.

469
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,600
To the purpose of distraction?

470
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,660
Preferred to discovery.

471
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,100
Such a thing would ruin my husband,

472
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,100
and taint my father's name.

473
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,800
Such concerns are voiced by
all those who sample our wares.

474
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:36,330
Can you name any, save Licinia?

475
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,660
I have heard of none.

476
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,000
No. You have not.

477
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,600
Shall I make the arrangements?

478
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,060
Yes!

479
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,930
You will not be disappointed.

480
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,000
May I suggest Varro?

481
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,720
Varro?

482
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,800
Uh, far too common.

483
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,930
The man must equal the risk.

484
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:21,430
A fact well known by your own desires.

485
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:25,630
Ones that I admittedly share...

486
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,000
Domina..

487
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,500
Get out you filthy slave!

488
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,560
Argh!

489
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,360
My ears suggest a tempest,

490
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,030
but eyes reveal a wife gone fucking mad!

491
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,930
Yes, well look to Ilithyia as the cause.

492
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,030
What new slights have prompted

493
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,800
this costly eruption?

494
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,560
Her cunt overflows at the thought

495
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,100
of Licinia bedding a gladiator.

496
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,130
She demands equal treatment,

497
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,500
so she set her lust on Crixus!

498
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,000
And her choice droves you into rage?

499
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,900
It's not her choice,

500
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,160
it is her manner that offends.

501
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,460
Honey drips from her tongue,

502
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,960
to conceal the bite of piss

503
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,200
that she showers upon us.

504
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,960
The acrid taste is well familiar,

505
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,260
but we must learn swallow
it, along with our pride

506
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,260
until we have secured
her husband's patronage.

507
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,660
What need have we of Glaber,

508
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,130
Licinia delivers us Marcus Crassus?

509
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,530
Crassus' wealth is undeniable,

510
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,900
yet he but holds the rank of senator.

511
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,430
Glaber outweighs with that of Legatus.

512
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,830
The favor of both coin and title

513
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,400
would speed our ambitions.

514
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:51,160
To rise you would have me kneel?

515
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,460
One day soon we will give Ilithyia

516
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,700
a lesson in manners.

517
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:00,230
But for now, necessity
dictates we give her Crixus.

518
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,630
Make the arrangements.

519
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,230
Fucking gaul...

520
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,960
Turn your thoughts.

521
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,630
I'll have at him soon enough.

522
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,130
You wish your brother dead?

523
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,600
Who speaks such a thing?

524
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,260
Your actions.

525
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,060
I only wish to protect him.

526
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,800
And who will do so in the arena,

527
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,700
where every man must stand alone?

528
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,300
You do him no favors.

529
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,160
You lie!

530
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,600
Varro.

531
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,700
Varro.

532
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,060
Hey. Tell him you lie!

533
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,260
I did what you paid me to do.

534
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,300
I sought out his wife,
but she was not there.

535
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,600
The boy?

536
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,900
I found no one.

537
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,600
But there were traces of
blood on the floor and...

538
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,030
Gain your senses!

539
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,760
Kill him.

540
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,860
Come on.

541
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,000
Guards!

542
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,630
They will not break.

543
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,660
I have tried.

544
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,300
Speak to Batiatus.

545
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,530
Towards what purpose?

546
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:55,960
You have his ear.

547
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,760
If he would let me leave these
walls for but a day or two.

548
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,030
He would not allow it.

549
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,360
You will not even make attempt?

550
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,660
You are fortunate only to be chained.

551
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,430
To petition Dominus with such insanity

552
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,500
would only provoke further punishment.

553
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,360
How would that help your cause?

554
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,800
My cause is lost.

555
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,660
Ashur found only blood.

556
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,300
No bodies.

557
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,930
Which means your wife and child may

558
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,400
yet be living.

559
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,960
The gods punish me, for failing them.

560
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,700
The gods rarely take note of fools.

561
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,130
Now, pull head from
ass and use it for once!

562
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,130
Where would your wife
and boy flee, if set upon?

563
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,600
Think.

564
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,260
Naevia?

565
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,960
The hour is late.

566
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,600
You should be in your cell.

567
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,230
I could not sleep.

568
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:01,230
My mind is full of
thoughts of the arena.

569
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,030
Embrace the sands of time.

570
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:09,300
As they flow, I harbor no doubt

571
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,430
you will again be a champion.

572
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,830
Capua already has its champion.

573
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:17,760
Spartacus bears the title,

574
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,000
but I look towards a man
of honor to regain it.

575
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,230
If you value your life...

576
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:39,730
Never awaken a gladiator.

577
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,600
Please...

578
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,830
Domina sent me...

579
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,230
Return the way you came.

580
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,730
Why do you refuse me?

581
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,930
Am I not pleasing...

582
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:05,260
I have no desire to lie with a woman

583
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:09,000
who has been commanded to do so.

584
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And what do you think will happen

585
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,730
if I fail such a command?

586
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,400
Stay then.

587
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,060
On the floor.

588
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,100
Is there nothing I can do

589
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,430
for the Champion of Capua?

590
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,930
There is one desire
I would have serviced.

591
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,630
If you are able...

592
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,130
Spartacus breathes fire this morning.

593
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:22,130
I wonder to the cause.

594
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,380
Mira.

595
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,760
How did your evening
pass with our champion?

596
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,530
He made...

597
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,630
Many demands of me.

598
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,900
Many demands, eh?

599
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,700
Our thracian is ready to stud.

600
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,530
I shall make arrangements
for this very night.

601
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,530
And when the sun rises,

602
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:47,100
we will have road to Marcus Crassus.

603
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,000
What of Ilithyia, and
her desire for Crixus?

604
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,700
I've already set plans in motion.

605
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,100
The pup bares his teeth.

606
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:27,600
Sleep did not come?

607
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,060
Nor is it deserved.

608
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,860
Embrace dreams when the sun falls.

609
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,200
I have news.

610
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,200
Aurelia...

611
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,200
Not yet.

612
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,960
But I have dispatched Mira,

613
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,930
one of the house
slaves, to look for her.

614
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:45,030
And your son.

615
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,260
How do you manage such a thing?

616
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,030
She was sent by Domina.

617
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:56,430
To prepare me for certain...

618
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,560
Duties required of a champion.

619
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,300
So the gods throw women at you, now!

620
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,000
Ahh! Ahh!

621
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,860
Your form returns.

622
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:33,060
Pair with Hamilcar.

623
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,000
It appears Duro has lost his brother.

624
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,330
Better that than his head.

625
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,830
It's done?

626
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,760
The whore Despoina fucks no more.

627
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,060
Nor the man inside her
when I slit her throat.

628
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,260
It was not Solonius.

629
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,800
Phew.

630
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,760
Whose face do I look upon?

631
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,500
Kastor.

632
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,200
One of Solonius' men.

633
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,860
Send it to Solonius.

634
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,200
Let him savor the
relief of escaping death.

635
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,660
For the moment.

636
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,630
You will be bedding
a proper roman woman.

637
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,160
One far above your station.

638
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,900
Heed my words, that you not offend her.

639
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,260
Yes, Domina.

640
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,900
Speak not a word, nor make a sound,

641
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,900
save one of pleasure.

642
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,460
Follow her lead,

643
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,560
anticipate her desires then
fulfill them. Vigorously.

644
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,060
Yes, Domina.

645
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,930
In the arena, you are Champion of Capua.

646
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,730
But tonight, you a common slave.

647
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,630
To do as commanded.

648
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,800
Are we clear?

649
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,560
We are clear, Domina.

650
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,360
They will prepare you
for the festivities.

651
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,730
Wait until summoned.

652
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,560
Fetch the best wine.

653
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,830
I want our guest well
plied when she arrives.

654
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,360
Domina.

655
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,600
Where were you last night?

656
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,000
I waited almost to
the point of detection.

657
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,300
I could not break away.

658
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,830
I was tending to Domina.

659
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,960
Domina?

660
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,660
Or maybe that guard
I saw you with today.

661
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,030
You are mistaken...

662
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,300
I am not blind.

663
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,800
You were touching his arm

664
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,560
and laughing and the
way he gazed at you...

665
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,100
If you are not blind,
then you surely see

666
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,130
that Hector gazes at all
women in the same fashion.

667
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,700
I give no shit about other women.

668
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,900
You shame me.

669
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,830
You shame yourself, with
thoughts of imaginary slights.

670
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,530
I know what I saw.

671
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,430
No. You do not!

672
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,130
And nor did Hector.

673
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,030
His key?

674
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:47,230
The purpose of my smile and touch.

675
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,630
The only one he received.

676
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,200
I have but a moment

677
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,500
before I must return with Domina's wine.

678
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,260
Use it to apologize for ever thinking...

679
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,860
You are my heart...

680
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,600
I will never doubt the
beating of it again.

681
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,430
Oh, apologies, Licinia.

682
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,930
We appear to have
arrived before Ilithyia's

683
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:36,260
finished with Spartacus.

684
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:47,880
No!

685
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,430
Guards!

686
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,710
Oh,

687
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:11,030
would this not set every
tongue in Rome wagging.

688
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:16,430
The wife of Legatus Claudius Glaber!

689
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:18,060
Fucking Spartacus,

690
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,430
the man that nearly ruined him!

691
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:22,760
It is a scandal, is it not?

692
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,100
The most splendid I have ever heard.

693
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:29,200
Stop laughing!

694
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,860
Stop laughing!

695
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,560
Stop laughing!

696
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,630
Ilithyia!

697
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,930
What were you thinking?

698
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:10,060
She slights me at every turn.

699
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,860
I wished only to teach her a lesson.

700
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,830
By pairing her with Spartacus?

701
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:15,600
If my husband will not defend my honor,

702
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,830
I am forced to do so myself.

703
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:18,430
Honor?

704
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:20,260
Is that why the cousin to
Marcus Crassus lays dead

705
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,600
in our fucking house?

706
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,300
Was not my intent.

707
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:26,360
Your intent matters for nothing.

708
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,260
Oh fuck!

709
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,930
We are undone!

710
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:35,000
No.

711
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,330
Licinia came alone.

712
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:39,430
She told no one of her purpose.

713
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:40,600
No one?

714
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,600
Not even her slaves.

715
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,660
There is nothing to connect her

716
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:45,860
with the House of Batiatus...

717
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,900
Once the body is disposed of.

718
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,800
What of Ilithyia?

719
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,630
Oh, I'll take care of her.

720
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:10,700
Apologies, it was an
unfortunate mistake,

721
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,000
coupling you with Glaber's wife.

722
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,260
Know that it was not my
intent, nor of my knowledge.

723
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,560
It is I that owes apology.

724
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,360
For a moment my hands were not my own,

725
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,230
but those of a man who no longer exists.

726
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,860
Let us not speak of this night again.

727
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,000
Spartacus.

728
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,130
Your loyalty.

729
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:40,900
It honors this ludus.

730
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,830
I did not mean...

731
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:55,630
No, course you didn't.

732
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:58,530
The way she laughed at me....

733
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:00,560
You said I was to lie with Crixus.

734
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:05,500
Why did you give me Spartacus?

735
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,760
Why would you do such a thing?

736
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,860
You ask what you already know answer to.

737
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,960
My husband will see me dead for this...

738
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,930
You have killed me...

739
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:25,680
No.

740
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:29,230
I have brought us closer.

741
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,330
No one will ever know
what happened here tonight.

742
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:36,360
Licinia's body will never be found.

743
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,160
You're protected.

744
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:39,910
No.

745
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:42,860
They will know.

746
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,730
They will see the deed in my eyes.

747
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:48,360
Then you'll stay here with me.

748
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:52,230
Until your eyes are clear.

749
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:55,200
We've had our differences,
however veiled.

750
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,730
But I've come to see what
a valuable friend you are.

751
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,060
This will be our little secret.

752
00:48:13,670 --> 00:49:42,830

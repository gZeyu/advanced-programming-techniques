1
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:26,136
<i>Spar - ta - cus!</i>

2
00:00:26,136 --> 00:00:28,672
<i>Spar - ta - cus!</i>

3
00:00:35,313 --> 00:00:36,847
They roar your name.

4
00:00:39,651 --> 00:00:41,819
Soon they shall roar yours as well.

5
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:44,788
Or mourn it, if your
mind is absent the task.

6
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:48,525
I'm yet to have word
on my wife and son..

7
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:50,027
I will not fight alongside a man

8
00:00:50,027 --> 00:00:51,562
who is not clear to his purpose.

9
00:00:54,132 --> 00:00:56,200
I am clear.

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,768
My purpose is blood.

11
00:01:31,169 --> 00:01:32,202
Shield!!

12
00:01:51,056 --> 00:01:52,523
Oh yes!

13
00:01:52,523 --> 00:01:54,124
Even chained to an
inferior gladiator,

14
00:01:54,124 --> 00:01:55,959
Spartacus prevails!

15
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,729
One would expect no less
from the Champion of Capua!

16
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:01,698
See how he ignites the crowd!

17
00:02:01,698 --> 00:02:03,133
His presence at your son's birthday

18
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:04,501
will be the talk of the Republic.

19
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:05,602
Ha!

20
00:02:05,602 --> 00:02:08,372
A far cry from my
own fifteenth year.

21
00:02:08,372 --> 00:02:10,674
When I put on the toga virilis
and passed into manhood,

22
00:02:10,674 --> 00:02:12,276
it was a stuffy, formal ceremony

23
00:02:12,276 --> 00:02:14,678
ridden with corpses and hags.

24
00:02:15,747 --> 00:02:17,514
My father deemed himself an orator.

25
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:20,084
Lulled our guests to slumber,
some never to awaken!

26
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,587
We would not have
it so for Numerius.

27
00:02:23,587 --> 00:02:25,022
He's been clamoring for
a pair of your finest,

28
00:02:25,022 --> 00:02:26,190
to battle in exhibition

29
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,758
at his celebration.

30
00:02:27,758 --> 00:02:30,060
Well, we would see
him well satisfied.

31
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,963
And by extension his noble father.

32
00:02:32,963 --> 00:02:34,665
Though thought strikes if
you hold the celebration

33
00:02:34,665 --> 00:02:36,400
beneath my humble roof,

34
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,670
then your boy can bear close
witness to all my gladiators.

35
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,805
Could we, father? Please?!

36
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:47,211
And the extra cost
for such generosity?

37
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:49,346
A favor between friends.

38
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:50,681
Received with much gratitude!

39
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:51,682
Uh!

40
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:56,053
You're next Spartacus.

41
00:02:59,757 --> 00:03:01,191
Come here.

42
00:03:13,905 --> 00:03:16,039
Are you certain it
won't cause imposition?

43
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:18,242
Place it from your thoughts.

44
00:03:18,242 --> 00:03:20,811
A boy becomes a man
but once in his life.

45
00:03:20,811 --> 00:03:23,647
He should be richly
indulged in his interests.

46
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:26,917
He never ceases to
tire of the games.

47
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:28,785
He's of the same
obsessive ilk as Ilithyia

48
00:03:28,785 --> 00:03:31,555
regarding blood and sport.

49
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:34,658
Her absence comes as surprise.

50
00:03:34,658 --> 00:03:37,961
Has she returned to Rome,
absent farewells?

51
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:38,711
No.

52
00:03:39,564 --> 00:03:41,165
She has been feeling... unwell.

53
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,401
Nothing serious, I hope?

54
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:47,137
It will pass, as all things
born of a weak stomach.

55
00:04:10,094 --> 00:04:11,428
His armor gives pause.

56
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:14,698
Then we shall aim higher.

57
00:04:28,213 --> 00:04:30,047
Pull!

58
00:04:48,466 --> 00:04:49,700
Oh!

59
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,069
Oh yeah!

60
00:05:12,724 --> 00:05:13,957
I've never seen anything like it!

61
00:05:30,575 --> 00:05:31,908
Yeah!!

62
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,517
Get up.

63
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:45,088
Spartacus!

64
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:49,760
<i>Live to fight another day.</i>

65
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:57,267
It pains me to watch
others claim your laurels.

66
00:05:57,267 --> 00:05:59,836
Your pain shall increase if you
continue to stand beside me.

67
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:05,942
Yeah, well done brother.

68
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:08,312
Well done.

69
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:13,150
You fought well today.

70
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,086
The gods favored me,
to count you as ally.

71
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:18,388
Their favor extends
beyond the arena.

72
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:24,261
Aurelia...

73
00:06:35,106 --> 00:06:37,874
Ah, I feared I would
never hold you again.

74
00:06:37,874 --> 00:06:39,242
Ashur said he found only blood

75
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:41,044
when I sent him to
you with message.

76
00:06:41,044 --> 00:06:42,045
Titus had returned.

77
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:43,914
Did he hurt you?

78
00:06:43,914 --> 00:06:45,916
I will see his heart
from his fucking chest..

79
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,418
The blood was not mine.

80
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:52,022
I cut him, deep and low.

81
00:06:52,022 --> 00:06:55,058
He will never force
himself on a woman again.

82
00:06:56,794 --> 00:06:58,261
Afterwards I sought refuge

83
00:06:58,261 --> 00:07:00,931
with my brother's family,
in the hills.

84
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:03,066
The slave girl found me there,

85
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:05,001
by Spartacus' direction.

86
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:06,203
Thank the gods you're safe.

87
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:14,344
Where were they when Titus
first laid hands on me?

88
00:07:16,614 --> 00:07:18,582
I still carry his child.

89
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,356
Nothings changed, Varro.

90
00:07:26,356 --> 00:07:29,259
The entire world has changed.

91
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:32,396
And I along with it.

92
00:07:32,396 --> 00:07:34,264
The child.

93
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:38,402
It springs from your belly,
a part of you.

94
00:07:38,402 --> 00:07:40,404
I would love it as such...

95
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:41,671
If you would have it so.

96
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,803
Your absence was noticed.

97
00:08:12,803 --> 00:08:14,438
Absence...?

98
00:08:14,438 --> 00:08:16,573
The games.

99
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:18,442
You were supposed to join us.

100
00:08:18,442 --> 00:08:21,378
I could not face prying eyes.

101
00:08:21,378 --> 00:08:24,414
One look into mine and they
would have full knowledge.

102
00:08:24,414 --> 00:08:27,617
Licinia's blood...

103
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:30,420
Her skull steeped
between my fingers...

104
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,691
Jupiter's cock,
would you come to grips!

105
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:37,661
Licinia's murder and
your part in it,

106
00:08:37,661 --> 00:08:39,863
have been concealed.

107
00:08:39,863 --> 00:08:42,632
The truth will only unfold if,

108
00:08:42,632 --> 00:08:46,203
if your jaw splits and your
tongue unfurls in song.

109
00:08:46,203 --> 00:08:47,504
Would you have me do?

110
00:08:47,504 --> 00:08:50,373
Appear yourself,

111
00:08:50,373 --> 00:08:52,776
absent conscience of deeds unknown.

112
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,545
The magistrate's celebration

113
00:08:55,545 --> 00:08:57,681
provides a perfect opportunity.

114
00:08:57,681 --> 00:09:00,183
The venue turns to
my husband as host.

115
00:09:00,183 --> 00:09:01,852
You won't even have to
move from under this roof,

116
00:09:01,852 --> 00:09:04,387
my hand ever present
to steady your resolve.

117
00:09:06,524 --> 00:09:09,926
You will guide me through this?

118
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:13,330
As trusted friend.

119
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,565
And as such, I require favor.

120
00:09:16,734 --> 00:09:19,035
We would swell the
ranks of celebration

121
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:21,471
with these noble citizens.

122
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,708
Ones I am certain
would accept invite

123
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,544
from the daughter
of senator Albinius.

124
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:35,185
Gather yourself,

125
00:09:35,185 --> 00:09:36,553
and see it done.

126
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,885
I owe you more than
I can ever repay.

127
00:10:08,885 --> 00:10:10,754
If you had not sent
Mira to find my wife...

128
00:10:10,754 --> 00:10:12,289
She has taken you back, then?

129
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:15,692
And I will yet be the
man she deserves.

130
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:19,062
If not, I shall remind
you of your shortcomings.

131
00:10:19,062 --> 00:10:22,165
Oh. It lifts the heart.

132
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:25,635
To see a man reunited
with his woman.

133
00:10:25,635 --> 00:10:27,571
Now you'll have someone
to weep for you

134
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:29,205
when you die.

135
00:10:29,205 --> 00:10:31,308
If I fall, it will be in the arena,

136
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:33,209
as a gladiator.

137
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:35,745
You remember what that is like,
do you not?

138
00:10:38,316 --> 00:10:39,950
Spartacus, Crixus...

139
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,251
You are summoned.

140
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:45,088
We are to fight each other?

141
00:10:45,088 --> 00:10:47,090
Numerius has chosen.

142
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,825
He insisted on drinking
in the spectacle

143
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:52,295
of present glories
pitted against the past.

144
00:10:52,295 --> 00:10:54,931
And his thirst shall
be satisfied, Dominus.

145
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:56,766
Keep to mind this is an exhibition.

146
00:10:56,766 --> 00:10:58,768
Blood may be spilled,
but only for show.

147
00:10:58,768 --> 00:11:00,270
Serious punishment
will be meted out

148
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,505
to the man who caused them.

149
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:04,541
We shall serve you
with honor, Dominus.

150
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,110
I expect no less.

151
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,311
Return to quarters.

152
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:13,617
Spartacus, remain.

153
00:11:13,617 --> 00:11:15,151
What make you of Crixus?

154
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:16,219
Numerius insisted upon him,

155
00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:18,088
yet with his wounds
barely sealed...

156
00:11:18,088 --> 00:11:19,889
He believes himself ready.

157
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:21,358
To a fault.

158
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:23,259
The ego bruises
deeper than the flesh.

159
00:11:26,097 --> 00:11:28,932
He brought this house
great honor, not long ago.

160
00:11:28,932 --> 00:11:30,567
Do not overly embarrass the man.

161
00:11:32,637 --> 00:11:34,571
I will give Numerius a show,

162
00:11:34,571 --> 00:11:37,240
nothing more.

163
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,644
When I put on the toga virilis,
it was in this very room,

164
00:11:40,644 --> 00:11:43,580
surrounded by my
father's champions.

165
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,115
Even then I knew

166
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:50,387
that one day my own titans
would eclipse them all.

167
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:54,758
None more so than Spartacus,
the bringer of rain.

168
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,460
Ugh?

169
00:12:01,332 --> 00:12:02,699
You honor me.

170
00:12:04,702 --> 00:12:06,736
You stand above all others.

171
00:12:06,736 --> 00:12:10,106
Continue on this path,
and we will have the world...

172
00:12:10,106 --> 00:12:11,841
Grrrr!

173
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:32,429
You have been avoiding me.

174
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:35,098
I have been tending my duties.

175
00:12:35,098 --> 00:12:37,367
Your manner hardens.

176
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:40,036
I prefer it soft, as the moment
we shared not so long ago...

177
00:12:41,372 --> 00:12:43,773
You mistake smile and
friendly touch beyond intent.

178
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:47,310
And the key that went
missing from my clasp,

179
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,714
after your "friendly" touch?

180
00:12:50,714 --> 00:12:54,918
It did not by "mistake"
draw into your palm, did it?

181
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,755
It did not.

182
00:12:58,755 --> 00:13:02,058
And yet you tense from question.

183
00:13:02,058 --> 00:13:05,328
Such reaction warrants
fair search...

184
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:07,363
My hands service Domina alone.

185
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:08,698
She would not be
pleased to have yours

186
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:10,600
laid upon me without her consent.

187
00:13:14,238 --> 00:13:16,539
Or to learn a guard
has misplaced his key.

188
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,010
I would not have it so.

189
00:13:24,315 --> 00:13:27,016
You have reputation for
your handling of women.

190
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:31,221
Seek your loss among them,

191
00:13:31,221 --> 00:13:33,289
and do not press me
again with accusation.

192
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:46,736
You trust Ilithyia not
to come unhinged..

193
00:13:46,736 --> 00:13:48,605
In front of the magistrate?

194
00:13:48,605 --> 00:13:50,573
I shall keep watchful
eyes upon her.

195
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:52,642
More watchful than
the last, I pray.

196
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:56,246
Everything worked to our advantage.

197
00:13:56,246 --> 00:13:57,847
Ilithyia's in our debt,
and through collection

198
00:13:57,847 --> 00:14:00,550
we gained access to the
most noble of families.

199
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,652
She attends to the list?

200
00:14:02,652 --> 00:14:06,289
She will draw all to the
magistrate's celebration,

201
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:08,591
so artfully placed
within our walls.

202
00:14:10,261 --> 00:14:12,428
There must be no cause
for disappointment.

203
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:16,933
After the exhibition between
Spartacus and Crixus

204
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:19,836
has ignited his son,

205
00:14:19,836 --> 00:14:22,238
I will broach the magistrate
on subject of political office.

206
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:24,474
And be well received.

207
00:14:24,474 --> 00:14:25,775
Ha!

208
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:29,345
To behold Solonius's
face when he sees me

209
00:14:29,345 --> 00:14:33,116
consort with the
highest echelon of Capua.

210
00:14:33,116 --> 00:14:34,484
Solonius?

211
00:14:34,484 --> 00:14:35,852
Well, how should he
witness such a thing?

212
00:14:35,852 --> 00:14:37,453
By invitation.

213
00:14:37,453 --> 00:14:38,588
I desire his eyes upon me

214
00:14:38,588 --> 00:14:41,758
when I am anointed
by the magistrate.

215
00:14:41,758 --> 00:14:44,060
I want him to see that
as my fortunes rise,

216
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,962
his plummet.

217
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:50,366
You taunt an injured snake,

218
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:52,402
one that may yet turn and strike.

219
00:14:52,402 --> 00:14:54,304
Ease your mind.

220
00:14:54,304 --> 00:14:55,605
The serpent's head will
be struck from its body

221
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:58,208
in due course.

222
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,911
Ha, and Solonius will
never see it coming.

223
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:34,244
So, you and Crixus battling
as entertainment, eh?

224
00:15:34,244 --> 00:15:35,612
Something the boy
will never forget.

225
00:15:35,612 --> 00:15:37,080
It is only exhibition.

226
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,583
Dominus gave strict instructions
to avoid grievous injury.

227
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:09,212
Do not believe he was listening.

228
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:18,788
Your gaul is restored.

229
00:16:20,925 --> 00:16:23,092
He is not alone.

230
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:25,862
The sun has revived what
the night had withered.

231
00:16:25,862 --> 00:16:29,165
Due to kindness of a dear friend.

232
00:16:29,165 --> 00:16:31,601
And is that kindness returned?

233
00:16:31,601 --> 00:16:33,002
The magistrate's
celebration will swell

234
00:16:33,002 --> 00:16:34,470
with all names provided.

235
00:16:37,408 --> 00:16:40,043
Gratitude.

236
00:16:40,043 --> 00:16:42,512
Would that I had words to
multiply it in response.

237
00:16:51,555 --> 00:16:53,656
Yet the value of a friend

238
00:16:53,656 --> 00:16:56,492
cannot be expressed by the
clever grouping of letters.

239
00:16:58,729 --> 00:17:02,265
It is blood and flesh,

240
00:17:02,265 --> 00:17:04,334
granting life to the world.

241
00:17:14,011 --> 00:17:15,478
You submit like a fucking girl,

242
00:17:15,478 --> 00:17:17,080
begging for a cock
to split her open.

243
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,681
I was bested.
What would you have me do?

244
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:20,616
Rise and fight 'till
your final breath

245
00:17:20,616 --> 00:17:22,518
or prove the name "brother" false.

246
00:17:26,156 --> 00:17:29,459
Heard of opportunities in Sicilia.

247
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:30,560
Had I been wise,
we would have moved there

248
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,961
to escape my debts.

249
00:17:31,961 --> 00:17:34,297
Yet the advice of my wife
fell short of its mark.

250
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:37,100
It is a distance to travel,

251
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,968
from a woman's mouth
to a man's ears.

252
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:45,742
I shall close the gap,
from this point forward.

253
00:17:45,742 --> 00:17:49,812
Aurelia tells me Sicilia is
an island blessed by the gods.

254
00:17:49,812 --> 00:17:51,247
You must visit us there,
when you gain freedom.

255
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,319
I no longer concern myself with
thoughts beyond these walls.

256
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:58,354
And nor should you.

257
00:17:58,354 --> 00:18:00,857
A true champion dreams
only of the arena.

258
00:18:04,361 --> 00:18:07,397
And what does one dream of
when he's no longer champion?

259
00:18:11,969 --> 00:18:14,137
Regaining the title from the thief

260
00:18:14,137 --> 00:18:16,105
who stole it from me.

261
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:17,673
He stole nothing.

262
00:18:17,673 --> 00:18:22,211
If I am a thief, the crime was
witnessed by all of Capua.

263
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:23,679
And is still
celebrated to this day.

264
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,783
<i>Spartacus!</i>

265
00:18:28,652 --> 00:18:30,486
You are summoned.

266
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:44,200
The magistrate will arrive tomorrow,

267
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,369
well in advance of his guests,

268
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:49,072
to ensure that preparations
are to his standards.

269
00:18:49,072 --> 00:18:53,376
While I reassure him,
I would have you tend the boy,

270
00:18:53,376 --> 00:18:55,778
it's imperative that
he is well satisfied,

271
00:18:55,778 --> 00:18:58,748
and by proximity his noble father.

272
00:18:58,748 --> 00:19:01,584
The name Batiatus will be honored.

273
00:19:01,584 --> 00:19:03,286
And envied throughout the Republic.

274
00:19:09,526 --> 00:19:11,227
You move unwisely.

275
00:19:12,996 --> 00:19:14,430
You play?

276
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,199
I've had occasion,

277
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:17,800
during my time with the auxiliary.

278
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,037
By all means, grace us
with your knowledge.

279
00:19:23,774 --> 00:19:24,841
Mm.

280
00:19:34,318 --> 00:19:35,518
It appears our champion has no head

281
00:19:35,518 --> 00:19:37,320
for games of strategy.

282
00:19:43,193 --> 00:19:45,394
Mm, battles maybe lost...

283
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:48,531
And yet the war
concludes in victory.

284
00:19:51,468 --> 00:19:54,237
Ahh! Treacherous fuck.

285
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,708
Played like a true roman.

286
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,176
Fall from your chair
and bring us wine.

287
00:20:11,622 --> 00:20:14,190
The syrian could swindle
the scales from a snake,

288
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,725
but never command a charge.

289
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:16,926
Come!

290
00:20:16,926 --> 00:20:18,461
Let us have contest between men...

291
00:20:33,844 --> 00:20:36,112
Oh, your touch has been missed.

292
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:39,048
And thoughts of yours consume me.

293
00:20:39,048 --> 00:20:42,385
Soon you will feel the
hands of a champion

294
00:20:42,385 --> 00:20:45,021
once again upon you.

295
00:20:45,021 --> 00:20:47,190
The match with Spartacus
is but exhibition.

296
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,225
I know the crowd as my heart.

297
00:20:50,694 --> 00:20:54,096
They will yearn for blood,
and I shall give it to them.

298
00:20:56,767 --> 00:20:58,634
Dominus forbids injury.

299
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:01,938
To make attempt on
Spartacus' life is to...

300
00:21:01,938 --> 00:21:03,306
Is to risk your own.

301
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:04,473
This is my life.

302
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:09,645
If not champion, I am nothing.

303
00:21:12,883 --> 00:21:15,151
Then I must be without my mind,

304
00:21:15,151 --> 00:21:17,453
to love only the man.

305
00:21:17,453 --> 00:21:18,988
Yes.

306
00:21:21,124 --> 00:21:23,159
And I relish your madness.

307
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,337
Ah! Fuck the heavens!

308
00:22:10,274 --> 00:22:12,708
How can you keep besting a man
so far above your station?

309
00:22:14,811 --> 00:22:18,447
I sprung from my mother
with sword in hand.

310
00:22:18,447 --> 00:22:20,850
The ways of battle
are second nature,

311
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,485
passed down from father to son.

312
00:22:25,756 --> 00:22:27,590
I regret my own father
never saw the advantage

313
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,891
of military glory.

314
00:22:30,494 --> 00:22:32,728
Never saw the spoils
that could be won,

315
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:35,197
the patronage, the alliances
forged had he taken up arms.

316
00:22:38,535 --> 00:22:41,070
He aspired to be no
further than what he was.

317
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:46,475
A simple lanista, far from Rome.

318
00:22:46,475 --> 00:22:49,145
You and I, however...

319
00:22:49,145 --> 00:22:51,514
We have fashioned wings,
to raise us higher

320
00:22:51,514 --> 00:22:53,749
than the muck and mire of heritage.

321
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:56,319
Higher than our fathers
could never imagine.

322
00:22:59,256 --> 00:23:01,257
Quintus?

323
00:23:01,257 --> 00:23:03,359
What stirs such a
vision from her dreams?

324
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:05,594
My husband not beside me.

325
00:23:07,297 --> 00:23:09,765
Spartacus was helping
me hone my game.

326
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:13,736
Over a cup of wine? Hmm!

327
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:18,974
Gratitude for the instruction.

328
00:23:24,815 --> 00:23:27,983
Have your senses flown?

329
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:29,719
To share drink with a slave...

330
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:32,288
I drink with the Champion of Capua.

331
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:33,289
Crixus was champion,

332
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:35,057
yet no cup was ever
raised with him.

333
00:23:35,057 --> 00:23:36,392
Argh!

334
00:23:36,392 --> 00:23:39,161
Crixus is a brute.

335
00:23:39,161 --> 00:23:41,163
Spartacus is different.

336
00:23:41,163 --> 00:23:44,633
We owe our good fortune to the man.

337
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:47,370
He's beneath you

338
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,406
and tomorrow we play
host to Capua's finest.

339
00:23:50,406 --> 00:23:52,608
Such behavior would be spat upon.

340
00:23:52,608 --> 00:23:56,112
They spit only to
stroke their own cocks.

341
00:23:56,112 --> 00:23:59,215
Spartacus is the reason the
magistrate graces our house,

342
00:23:59,215 --> 00:24:01,384
along with all the
shits that follow.

343
00:24:01,384 --> 00:24:05,888
They come to see you.

344
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,991
A man ascended to the heavens.

345
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:12,061
And Spartacus is merely the
beast that you ride upon.

346
00:24:15,632 --> 00:24:18,033
You and Varro fought
as if brothers.

347
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:19,535
Your victory was a glorious sight.

348
00:24:19,535 --> 00:24:21,570
<i>Did you see the key, huh?</i>

349
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,905
Huh?

350
00:24:22,905 --> 00:24:24,039
Don't suppose you know
anything about that? Huh?

351
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:25,040
Spartacus.

352
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,442
Still your tongue.

353
00:24:26,442 --> 00:24:28,511
What grievance has the woman given?

354
00:24:28,511 --> 00:24:29,812
None which concerns you.

355
00:24:29,812 --> 00:24:31,647
She is known to me.

356
00:24:31,647 --> 00:24:33,949
This one is known to
every cock in the villa.

357
00:24:33,949 --> 00:24:35,117
Move off.

358
00:24:35,117 --> 00:24:37,153
Tell me her grievance.

359
00:24:37,153 --> 00:24:40,489
I gave you command.

360
00:24:40,489 --> 00:24:41,657
Stop!

361
00:24:44,661 --> 00:24:46,662
What is the fucking
meaning of this?

362
00:24:46,662 --> 00:24:48,497
Speak!

363
00:24:48,497 --> 00:24:51,066
Your man attacks
Mira without cause.

364
00:24:51,066 --> 00:24:52,268
What reason have you
for laying hands

365
00:24:52,268 --> 00:24:55,404
on one of my slaves?

366
00:24:55,404 --> 00:24:56,739
The girl is a thief.

367
00:24:56,739 --> 00:24:58,908
I stole nothing!

368
00:24:58,908 --> 00:25:00,543
What exactly do you
believe she has stolen?

369
00:25:05,148 --> 00:25:06,449
Nothing of worth.

370
00:25:11,455 --> 00:25:12,688
Go.

371
00:25:12,688 --> 00:25:14,423
You overstep.

372
00:25:14,423 --> 00:25:16,058
A month's wages, forfeited.

373
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:19,995
Press further and coin
will be replaced by blood.

374
00:25:19,995 --> 00:25:21,230
Remove yourself.

375
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,765
Dominus.

376
00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:26,769
Apologies.

377
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:29,472
Do not fucking speak!

378
00:25:29,472 --> 00:25:30,873
I defend your worth to my wife,

379
00:25:30,873 --> 00:25:34,343
only to turn and find you
shitting in my fucking house.

380
00:25:34,343 --> 00:25:36,712
If the toga virilis
were not tomorrow,

381
00:25:36,712 --> 00:25:39,148
I would have you lashed
until the flesh peeled

382
00:25:39,148 --> 00:25:41,050
from your back.

383
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,552
Lay hands on one
of my guards again,

384
00:25:43,552 --> 00:25:45,754
and you will receive far worse.

385
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:49,992
Dominus.

386
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,571
You attack a guard yet
escape punishment?

387
00:26:04,608 --> 00:26:07,643
Being champion is not
without advantage.

388
00:26:07,643 --> 00:26:09,745
I must remember to stay
close to your side.

389
00:26:13,316 --> 00:26:15,417
Perhaps a swath of your good
fortune will rub off upon me.

390
00:26:17,888 --> 00:26:19,321
Your efforts would
be better focused

391
00:26:19,321 --> 00:26:21,223
protecting your flank.

392
00:26:21,223 --> 00:26:23,926
Oh, fuck!

393
00:26:28,298 --> 00:26:30,099
Magistrate Calavius!

394
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:31,700
The House of Batiatus welcomes you,

395
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,136
on this glorious day!

396
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:36,739
A young boy enters my doors,
but leaves a man!

397
00:26:36,739 --> 00:26:37,973
Gratitude for your hospitalities.

398
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:39,275
We are in your debt.

399
00:26:39,275 --> 00:26:40,776
As are we all.

400
00:26:40,776 --> 00:26:42,177
Ilithyia!

401
00:26:44,114 --> 00:26:45,281
I'd begun to fear for your health.

402
00:26:45,281 --> 00:26:46,849
A momentary lapse.

403
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:48,651
I've been tended to with
most compassionate care

404
00:26:48,651 --> 00:26:51,654
within these walls.

405
00:26:51,654 --> 00:26:52,988
<i>Where are the gladiators?</i>

406
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:54,857
Numerius.

407
00:26:54,857 --> 00:26:56,592
He couldn't sleep last night,
for excitement.

408
00:26:56,592 --> 00:26:57,660
Who can blame him?!

409
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,495
To stand among the greatest titans

410
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:01,397
of the Republic, his to command.

411
00:27:01,397 --> 00:27:03,232
Mine? Really?

412
00:27:03,232 --> 00:27:05,401
Each of my proud warriors
has been instructed

413
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:07,903
to regard your orders
as if from my own lips.

414
00:27:07,903 --> 00:27:09,939
Flavius will be filled
with great envy.

415
00:27:09,939 --> 00:27:11,507
As he should!

416
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:15,611
Even more so when he hears
the Champion of Capua himself

417
00:27:15,611 --> 00:27:17,279
has given you a tour of the ludus.

418
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,714
Spartacus?!

419
00:27:18,714 --> 00:27:20,482
He awaits your presence,
with permission of your father...

420
00:27:20,482 --> 00:27:23,786
I would have better fortune
reigning Apollo's horses.

421
00:27:25,055 --> 00:27:26,922
Guards! Escort young Numerius

422
00:27:26,922 --> 00:27:28,290
to the training square.

423
00:27:30,694 --> 00:27:32,261
I've never seen him
in higher spirits.

424
00:27:32,261 --> 00:27:35,497
The House of Batiatus
has such an effect.

425
00:27:35,497 --> 00:27:38,067
Have you ever witnessed a
view from their balcony?

426
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:40,369
It simply overwhelms the senses.

427
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:41,503
Come.

428
00:27:41,503 --> 00:27:44,473
Let us gaze upon
Capua's perfection.

429
00:27:44,473 --> 00:27:45,908
And give the men private moment

430
00:27:45,908 --> 00:27:48,510
to discuss how ravishing
their women are.

431
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:55,117
Ilithyia resides with you?

432
00:27:55,117 --> 00:27:56,285
For the moment.

433
00:27:56,285 --> 00:27:58,153
A valued friend.

434
00:27:58,153 --> 00:28:00,522
With connection to the senate
in both husband and father.

435
00:28:00,522 --> 00:28:02,057
Value indeed.

436
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:05,027
One must choose one's
company with exceeding care.

437
00:28:05,027 --> 00:28:07,796
Or else be dragged down by them.

438
00:28:07,796 --> 00:28:10,432
Preparations are in order?

439
00:28:10,432 --> 00:28:11,567
Set as if the boy was my own.

440
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:12,935
Ease all concern.

441
00:28:12,935 --> 00:28:15,371
This night will be
etched in the memories of

442
00:28:15,371 --> 00:28:16,672
all in attendance.

443
00:28:20,076 --> 00:28:21,677
What is it like,
having the life of another

444
00:28:21,677 --> 00:28:23,812
resting in your hands?

445
00:28:23,812 --> 00:28:25,381
My sword may deliver
the final blow,

446
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,418
but a gladiator's
fate is for the crowd

447
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:32,087
and the editor to decide.

448
00:28:36,459 --> 00:28:37,793
You have no wall over by the cliff!

449
00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:42,431
The very reason I find it
best not to train there.

450
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:44,800
Has anyone ever fallen below?

451
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,468
I've witnessed but one.

452
00:28:46,468 --> 00:28:47,718
Come.

453
00:28:48,805 --> 00:28:50,773
It's been a long time
since last we trained.

454
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:53,208
Let us see what you remember.

455
00:29:07,757 --> 00:29:11,560
The magistrate's son
graces our sands...

456
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,795
And this is what greets him?

457
00:29:15,899 --> 00:29:18,967
Would that I had an opponent
worthy of his interest.

458
00:29:22,472 --> 00:29:24,406
I would spar with you.

459
00:29:24,406 --> 00:29:26,742
I meant a real gladiator.

460
00:29:37,387 --> 00:29:39,588
Crixus shows impeccable form.

461
00:29:39,588 --> 00:29:43,559
Mm, I shall prove otherwise
at your ceremony tonight.

462
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,894
Anyone else dare challenge?

463
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:53,435
Our fight is not yet finished.

464
00:29:53,435 --> 00:29:54,937
Stand down, pup,

465
00:29:54,937 --> 00:29:57,106
before your shriveling
cock wets the sand.

466
00:30:07,817 --> 00:30:09,184
The man is beaten.

467
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,787
In body, perhaps.

468
00:30:13,656 --> 00:30:14,890
Yet confrontation

469
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:19,061
is often not won by force,

470
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:20,129
but by will.

471
00:30:50,126 --> 00:30:52,628
Stay down, you ignorant shit.

472
00:31:03,606 --> 00:31:05,841
Enough!

473
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,068
The man is soundly defeated,
yet treated as victor?

474
00:31:34,804 --> 00:31:37,306
A sign of respect,

475
00:31:37,306 --> 00:31:39,041
for his courage.

476
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:40,342
<i>See him to the Medicus.</i>

477
00:31:48,918 --> 00:31:50,552
Is everyday like this?

478
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,263
I was unaware you possessed

479
00:32:01,263 --> 00:32:03,732
such a skilled hand at latrunculi.

480
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:06,735
Well, I consider myself a
student of military strategy.

481
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:10,973
To win, one must maneuver to
catch ones opponent unawares.

482
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:15,777
As it is in war,
so it is in politics.

483
00:32:15,777 --> 00:32:18,513
Hm, another subject of my interest.

484
00:32:18,513 --> 00:32:19,681
Perhaps..

485
00:32:19,681 --> 00:32:21,717
<i>Father!</i>

486
00:32:21,717 --> 00:32:23,919
Spartacus gave me his sword,
so I could practice!

487
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,654
Numerius, you are filthy!

488
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:27,956
I fear he will form a crust
if not sent to water.

489
00:32:27,956 --> 00:32:29,191
No, we shall see him well prepared

490
00:32:29,191 --> 00:32:31,059
before the guests arrive.

491
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:33,662
Naevia, escort
Numerius to the bath.

492
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:35,497
<i>Yes, Domina.</i>

493
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:36,247
Ah!

494
00:32:39,636 --> 00:32:42,004
Just through here.

495
00:32:42,906 --> 00:32:45,140
There is yet much the boy in him.

496
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,576
For but a moment longer.

497
00:32:47,576 --> 00:32:49,678
Tonight Numerius becomes a man.

498
00:33:02,392 --> 00:33:03,558
Clean?

499
00:33:05,295 --> 00:33:07,529
Or do you yet require
a hard scrubbing...

500
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:10,365
No, I am...

501
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:12,334
I am...

502
00:33:12,334 --> 00:33:13,402
Yes, you are.

503
00:33:16,572 --> 00:33:19,041
Nothing more sensual
than a warm bath.

504
00:33:21,878 --> 00:33:25,047
Mm, the water caressing your skin.

505
00:33:27,984 --> 00:33:30,986
Your eyes seem rather... fixed.

506
00:33:30,986 --> 00:33:33,021
Apologies.

507
00:33:33,021 --> 00:33:34,356
None required.

508
00:33:34,356 --> 00:33:36,358
This is your night, Numerius.

509
00:33:37,694 --> 00:33:40,062
One that occurs but once
in a man's lifetime.

510
00:33:41,331 --> 00:33:43,098
I am filled with much excitement.

511
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:44,833
Of course you are.

512
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:48,303
Your life unfolds before you.

513
00:33:48,303 --> 00:33:49,538
Many glories.

514
00:33:49,538 --> 00:33:52,174
Many honors.

515
00:33:52,174 --> 00:33:55,610
Many pleasures...

516
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,479
The choices you make tonight

517
00:33:57,479 --> 00:33:59,548
will ripple through time,

518
00:33:59,548 --> 00:34:01,917
altering fates and destinies.

519
00:34:03,886 --> 00:34:06,021
So much rests in your hands.

520
00:34:07,857 --> 00:34:09,925
And I would see them
properly filled...

521
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,077
Um, very nice.

522
00:35:04,047 --> 00:35:06,181
Then he'd jump up and
stab him down like that..

523
00:35:06,181 --> 00:35:07,516
Yeah!

524
00:35:07,516 --> 00:35:08,650
He'd block that back...

525
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,218
A fine celebration, Batiatus!

526
00:35:10,218 --> 00:35:13,355
I've never seen the boy so happy.

527
00:35:13,355 --> 00:35:16,024
Let us call him boy no longer.

528
00:35:16,024 --> 00:35:17,926
Uh, does he not
appear to you a man?

529
00:35:21,697 --> 00:35:24,366
He does seem to stand taller,
does he not?

530
00:35:24,366 --> 00:35:25,967
By quite some measure.

531
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:28,470
Soon he will rival the stature
of his honored father.

532
00:35:29,605 --> 00:35:31,106
It gives great pride, to know

533
00:35:31,106 --> 00:35:33,508
I have such an heir to
carry the name Calavius.

534
00:35:34,644 --> 00:35:36,645
Every house should be so blessed.

535
00:35:36,645 --> 00:35:40,015
I believe your son will
do extraordinary things.

536
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:43,151
I for one cannot wait to see them.

537
00:35:43,151 --> 00:35:44,986
Give me a go, come on..

538
00:35:54,097 --> 00:35:55,630
It appears the wife of the Legatus

539
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,766
yet harbors grudge.

540
00:35:57,766 --> 00:36:01,536
She is a cat absent claws.

541
00:36:01,536 --> 00:36:03,238
Yet fangs remain.

542
00:36:06,776 --> 00:36:09,044
Gratitude for last night.

543
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:12,314
The man overstepped.

544
00:36:12,314 --> 00:36:13,381
I merely made correction.

545
00:36:15,284 --> 00:36:18,386
Still, the heart swells
at such kindness.

546
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:20,388
Then see it deflate.

547
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:23,859
I would have done the
same for any woman.

548
00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:25,594
You are an ass.

549
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:31,733
Uh, the Champion of Capua...

550
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:33,268
Always making friends.

551
00:36:33,268 --> 00:36:35,637
I need but one.

552
00:36:35,637 --> 00:36:36,905
Fortunate.

553
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:38,640
Since it appears one
is all you have.

554
00:36:45,882 --> 00:36:48,383
Her husband is mad with worry!

555
00:36:48,383 --> 00:36:50,285
Licinia has completely vanished!

556
00:36:50,285 --> 00:36:51,553
She slipped away in the night

557
00:36:51,553 --> 00:36:54,322
absent slaves and not seen since.

558
00:36:54,322 --> 00:36:56,958
A proper woman should never
travel without escort.

559
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:58,560
Her cousin good Crassus has offered

560
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,229
substantial reward
for her discovery,

561
00:37:01,229 --> 00:37:02,397
larger still towards punishment

562
00:37:02,397 --> 00:37:03,798
if harm's been done.

563
00:37:03,798 --> 00:37:04,866
But who would wish such a thing

564
00:37:04,866 --> 00:37:07,335
upon a relation of Crassus?

565
00:37:07,335 --> 00:37:10,071
Why that would be madness.

566
00:37:10,071 --> 00:37:11,673
It is revelation what
we are capable of,

567
00:37:11,673 --> 00:37:12,841
when pushed to brink.

568
00:37:12,841 --> 00:37:14,276
Or pulled.

569
00:37:16,913 --> 00:37:18,647
Well, there can only be one cause

570
00:37:18,647 --> 00:37:19,681
to slip out in the night,

571
00:37:19,681 --> 00:37:22,484
absent slaves or husbands.

572
00:37:22,484 --> 00:37:23,234
Oh!

573
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,321
She is married to a fat little man,

574
00:37:26,321 --> 00:37:28,623
who sprouts hair as if beast.

575
00:37:30,726 --> 00:37:32,561
Who could blame her?

576
00:37:32,561 --> 00:37:36,565
Flown to the arms of another,
as Helen to Paris!

577
00:37:36,565 --> 00:37:37,315
Ha!

578
00:37:38,234 --> 00:37:40,802
<i>I fear Rome must be
absent her beauty...</i>

579
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:42,604
For tonight the
jewels of the Republic

580
00:37:42,604 --> 00:37:46,274
stand glittering
before me in Capua.

581
00:37:46,274 --> 00:37:48,510
Good Solonius.

582
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,844
You decided to attend.

583
00:37:49,844 --> 00:37:52,380
Who could resist
such divine company?

584
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,749
Do my eyes deceive!

585
00:37:54,749 --> 00:37:56,918
Solonius, come from
the shadow to the light?

586
00:37:56,918 --> 00:37:58,220
Embrace me as brother!

587
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,521
Would that blood were our bond.

588
00:38:02,158 --> 00:38:04,426
I almost did not recognize you,

589
00:38:04,426 --> 00:38:05,460
so gaunt of cheek.

590
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,062
Are you quite well?

591
00:38:07,062 --> 00:38:08,730
My health has never been better.

592
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:09,664
Sadly the same can't be said

593
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,033
for your fortunes
in the arena, huh?

594
00:38:12,033 --> 00:38:14,069
Have you had opportunity
to greet the magistrate?

595
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:16,805
He was deep in conference with
the consularis when I arrived.

596
00:38:16,805 --> 00:38:19,140
As the evening wears,
I am certain he will find time

597
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,843
for the less significant guests.

598
00:38:21,843 --> 00:38:23,378
Gratitude for the invitation.

599
00:38:23,378 --> 00:38:25,180
I hope soon to return the favor.

600
00:38:28,117 --> 00:38:30,885
Did you see the look upon his face?

601
00:38:30,885 --> 00:38:32,454
He's the rictus of a man dying,

602
00:38:32,454 --> 00:38:34,589
a slice at a time.

603
00:38:34,589 --> 00:38:37,158
I would have the fatal
cut in a single stroke.

604
00:38:37,158 --> 00:38:39,628
Oh, I prefer as many
strokes as possible,

605
00:38:39,628 --> 00:38:41,162
to maximize the pleasure.

606
00:38:52,608 --> 00:38:55,944
I was unaware you had taste
for such exotic treats.

607
00:38:58,114 --> 00:39:00,949
We cannot be seen together.

608
00:39:00,949 --> 00:39:02,584
I find it curious
that Batiatus would

609
00:39:02,584 --> 00:39:04,419
extend me invitation.

610
00:39:04,419 --> 00:39:05,754
What is he planning?

611
00:39:08,391 --> 00:39:12,193
To humiliate you
before the magistrate.

612
00:39:12,193 --> 00:39:14,529
Your master swims in deep waters.

613
00:39:14,529 --> 00:39:16,998
Some day soon he shall
disappear beneath the waves.

614
00:39:20,169 --> 00:39:21,603
Come! Gather,

615
00:39:21,603 --> 00:39:23,872
esteemed guests,

616
00:39:23,872 --> 00:39:26,007
and those of questionable repute.

617
00:39:28,077 --> 00:39:30,645
Tonight the house of
Batiatus is humbled

618
00:39:30,645 --> 00:39:34,416
to help celebrate a
most glorious occasion.

619
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:37,018
The son of magistrate Calavius,

620
00:39:37,018 --> 00:39:39,854
casts off the robes of a boy

621
00:39:39,854 --> 00:39:42,023
and becomes a proper roman man!

622
00:39:48,097 --> 00:39:51,766
Yet before he dons
the toga virilis,

623
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:56,604
let us honor him
with sport and blood!

624
00:39:56,604 --> 00:39:59,774
A contest between the
present and the past.

625
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:04,012
Spartacus, Champion of Capua!

626
00:40:04,012 --> 00:40:05,513
Step forward!

627
00:40:09,752 --> 00:40:10,819
And Crixus!

628
00:40:10,819 --> 00:40:12,087
Former champion, step...

629
00:40:12,087 --> 00:40:13,337
Wait.

630
00:40:14,657 --> 00:40:16,991
I fear Crixus has seen
his best day past.

631
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:22,297
I would have Varro
fight in his place.

632
00:40:29,004 --> 00:40:30,672
You are the editor, young master!

633
00:40:30,672 --> 00:40:34,809
Your will, our hands!

634
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:36,378
Varro! Step forward!

635
00:40:42,284 --> 00:40:44,652
Did you have hand in my elevation?

636
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:46,588
The boy's change comes as surprise.

637
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:52,560
It seems the gods
favor us both now.

638
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,765
Honor the boy.

639
00:40:56,765 --> 00:40:58,400
Honor the ludus.

640
00:41:01,137 --> 00:41:03,204
Numerius insults Crixus
in our own house!

641
00:41:03,204 --> 00:41:05,774
Let it pass.

642
00:41:05,774 --> 00:41:09,377
The magistrate's happiness
is our only concern. Hm!

643
00:41:09,377 --> 00:41:10,545
Come Numerius!

644
00:41:10,545 --> 00:41:12,180
These men, these
titans of the arena,

645
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,615
await your command!

646
00:41:13,615 --> 00:41:14,816
Let us give them a show.

647
00:41:16,952 --> 00:41:18,052
Begin!

648
00:41:25,261 --> 00:41:26,011
Oh!

649
00:42:24,253 --> 00:42:26,688
My fucking flank!

650
00:42:26,688 --> 00:42:27,856
Protect it,

651
00:42:27,856 --> 00:42:30,058
and next time it may be
you who stands victorious.

652
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,699
Spartacus, still the
Champion of Capua!

653
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:40,201
And Varro, formidable opponent,

654
00:42:40,201 --> 00:42:42,670
one to watch closely in the arena!

655
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,905
Come Numerius!

656
00:42:43,905 --> 00:42:45,840
Pass judgment on
our fallen warrior!

657
00:43:09,398 --> 00:43:10,465
Apologies, magistrate,

658
00:43:10,465 --> 00:43:12,867
it was agreed this was
an exhibition only.

659
00:43:12,867 --> 00:43:16,037
Not a fight to the death.

660
00:43:16,037 --> 00:43:17,117
Father...

661
00:43:19,275 --> 00:43:20,842
Numerius has made his decision.

662
00:43:22,177 --> 00:43:24,445
I will reimburse you
the cost of the man.

663
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:36,958
Proceed.

664
00:43:48,704 --> 00:43:51,205
Do we have a problem, Batiatus?

665
00:44:01,016 --> 00:44:02,684
I said proceed.

666
00:44:20,436 --> 00:44:21,502
Don't...

667
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:27,095
Don't.

668
00:44:29,278 --> 00:44:33,548
They will kill us both.

669
00:44:33,548 --> 00:44:37,218
There is no choice.

670
00:44:37,218 --> 00:44:38,786
There is always a choice.

671
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:43,725
Not this time.

672
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:50,865
Spartacus!

673
00:45:08,717 --> 00:45:10,818
Live...

674
00:45:10,818 --> 00:45:14,856
And see my family provided for.

675
00:45:14,856 --> 00:45:16,624
And know...

676
00:45:16,624 --> 00:45:18,893
I would have done the same...

677
00:46:35,704 --> 00:46:39,273
I am forever indebted to
your hospitality, Batiatus.

678
00:46:39,273 --> 00:46:40,274
Think nothing of it.

679
00:46:40,274 --> 00:46:42,677
A favor for a dear friend.

680
00:46:42,677 --> 00:46:44,612
He calls for blood
without hesitation!

681
00:46:44,612 --> 00:46:47,081
Such boldness will one day
lead him to the senate.

682
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:51,252
The noblest of ambitions.

683
00:46:51,252 --> 00:46:54,489
I myself have designs
towards political office.

684
00:46:54,489 --> 00:46:55,823
Is that so?

685
00:46:55,823 --> 00:46:56,958
Well, not the senate, not so soon,

686
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:58,226
but something local.

687
00:46:58,226 --> 00:47:00,495
I would speak to you of support,
perhaps tomorrow..

688
00:47:00,495 --> 00:47:02,830
I leave for the coast on business.

689
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:04,565
Well, when you return then.

690
00:47:06,668 --> 00:47:09,871
Politics is too dull for
a man of your persuasion!

691
00:47:09,871 --> 00:47:12,907
You would ache for the sights
and sounds of the arena.

692
00:47:12,907 --> 00:47:15,109
A sacrifice I would gladly make

693
00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:17,145
in the service to Rome.

694
00:47:19,414 --> 00:47:21,883
Batiatus, you are a fine lanista.

695
00:47:21,883 --> 00:47:24,218
Perhaps the finest
in all the Republic.

696
00:47:24,218 --> 00:47:25,953
But politics...

697
00:47:25,953 --> 00:47:28,156
It requires a different sort.

698
00:47:28,156 --> 00:47:32,226
Citizens of status,
with the proper heritage.

699
00:47:32,226 --> 00:47:34,428
Just so.

700
00:47:34,428 --> 00:47:36,430
Relish what you know best.

701
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:39,934
Leave politics to the men
with breeding for it.

702
00:47:39,934 --> 00:47:41,369
Come, good Solonius!

703
00:47:41,369 --> 00:47:44,038
We have not had occasion
to speak this evening.

704
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,878
The magistrate's response?

705
00:47:50,878 --> 00:47:53,047
To be answered in blood.

706
00:47:55,090 --> 00:48:53,190

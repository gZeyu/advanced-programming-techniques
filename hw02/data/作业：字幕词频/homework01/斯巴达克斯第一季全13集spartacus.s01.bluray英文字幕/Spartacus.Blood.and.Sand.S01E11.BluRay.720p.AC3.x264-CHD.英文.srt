1
00:00:45,981 --> 00:00:48,015
<i>It is never
an easy thing to see</i>

2
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:50,117
<i>a friend once loved</i>

3
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,053
now absent breath.

4
00:00:55,957 --> 00:00:57,258
He should yet walk.

5
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:01,462
<i>That foolish grin,</i>

6
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:04,632
and dreams of a life
beyond these walls.

7
00:01:09,838 --> 00:01:12,573
Every night breaks.

8
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,175
And we must all wake.

9
00:01:23,985 --> 00:01:27,588
I would the gods
turn back the sun...

10
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,056
And set me in his place.

11
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:31,625
<i>He fought with honor.</i>

12
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:34,261
As did you both.

13
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,465
His art was stilled
for a boy's amusement.

14
00:01:39,835 --> 00:01:41,702
Where is the honor in that?

15
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,542
Varro left this world
a gladiator.

16
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,044
And shall be
remembered as such.

17
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:51,829
No.

18
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:57,985
He will be remembered
as a husband.

19
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:03,491
A father.

20
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:08,395
And a friend amongst enemies.

21
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:00,014
Aurelia...

22
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:04,618
Is it true?

23
00:03:06,121 --> 00:03:07,955
That he perished by your sword?

24
00:03:14,563 --> 00:03:16,764
He loved you as a brother.

25
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:32,446
He's not going
to take this loss well.

26
00:03:33,415 --> 00:03:35,182
And who can fucking blame him?

27
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:44,959
Calavius slaughters my stock
at the whim of his maggot,

28
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,061
shits upon my ambitions,

29
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,262
mocking me in my own house.

30
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:51,632
No, not a loss to be
taken fucking well.

31
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:55,703
But one that will be
answered in kind.

32
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:56,904
Out.

33
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,708
He is a magistrate.

34
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,709
To move against him...

35
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:02,910
He is but a man.

36
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,911
And all men fall,

37
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,179
beneath the heel
of their hubris.

38
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:06,247
Quintus..

39
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:08,382
Turn thoughts
toward other matters.

40
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:09,783
What of Ilithyia?

41
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,819
Does she move to secure us
her husband's patronage?

42
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,754
She has departed
for Rome to meet Glaber.

43
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,155
Welcome news.

44
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:16,490
The support of a Legatus

45
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,193
should be more than enough
to gain political office.

46
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:20,661
I only regret Calavius

47
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,563
will not live to see
the "unworthy" name

48
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:26,433
of Batiatus so elevated.

49
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,502
The very thought
of discovery...

50
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:29,803
It turns the stomach.

51
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:32,573
Make it a thing of iron,
and see it settled.

52
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,677
What news?

53
00:04:39,681 --> 00:04:43,484
Speak, caress
my ear with words.

54
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:46,287
You will find them
soft and pleasing.

55
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:47,955
We set upon the magistrate

56
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,224
on the road leaving the city.

57
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:51,358
The guards and wagon?

58
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,060
Attended to as instructed.

59
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,129
The man himself removed

60
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,297
to the appointed place.

61
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:57,298
Ashur?

62
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:58,999
Standing watch.

63
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,268
I will relieve him
by cover of night.

64
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,437
I shall accompany.

65
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:04,505
I would gaze
into the man's eyes,

66
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,774
and see the power
of my reflection in them.

67
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:09,076
Until such time, avail
yourself of my hospitality.

68
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:10,077
Wine, women...

69
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:11,078
Both would suit me.

70
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:12,880
And so deserved.

71
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,248
Dominus.

72
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:19,787
It's done, then?

73
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:20,955
No.

74
00:05:22,223 --> 00:05:23,490
It's only just begun.

75
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:49,717
Behold, the glorious
Champion of Capua.

76
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:54,555
A heavy heart weighs
a man's sword.

77
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:58,025
The loss of a brother is
heartfelt by every gladiator.

78
00:05:59,094 --> 00:06:01,228
We honor him not with tears,

79
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,330
but with blood
spilled in the arena.

80
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,332
Spoken as a true champion.

81
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:09,903
The games against
Pompeii approach.

82
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,539
Years I have been
robbed of the Primus

83
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,109
by Solonius and his bribes.

84
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:17,344
Finally it is secured
by our Dominus,

85
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:18,479
and who fights?

86
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:21,849
Spartacus.

87
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:23,784
The woman who Grieves.

88
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:29,790
Spartacus.

89
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:32,493
You are summoned.

90
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:49,543
Is this truly my likeness?

91
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:52,312
Have so many years passed,

92
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:54,481
that marble must be
etched with such lines?

93
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:59,053
Would that every man lived
to see his face so marred.

94
00:07:00,188 --> 00:07:02,222
And the wretched
pass smooth of skin.

95
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:08,429
Varro's death has been
foremost in my thoughts.

96
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:09,563
It seizes the breast

97
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:12,299
to lose a gladiator
of such standing.

98
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:15,002
The comparison is false,

99
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:17,137
to a son losing his father.

100
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,039
A wife, her husband.

101
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,040
A burden, to be sure.

102
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,141
Yet he was aware of risk

103
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,209
and took them of his free will.

104
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,744
As a gladiator.

105
00:07:25,814 --> 00:07:27,247
Not a child's plaything.

106
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:33,620
The magistrate and his whelp
have caused us both pain.

107
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,856
It will not go unanswered,
I promise you.

108
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:40,060
I would be of service
towards the deed.

109
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:44,431
Take comfort from
knowing its intent.

110
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:45,833
I would have your focus
turned towards

111
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,267
the games of Pompeii.

112
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:50,604
That perfumed shit Solonius

113
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:54,341
always secured the Primus
by inserting tongue in ass,

114
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:58,245
only to be crushed
by our city's hated rival.

115
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:00,481
But this year

116
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,149
he falls out of favor.

117
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,684
This year the House of Batiatus

118
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,919
secures the honor!

119
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,255
Spartacus,

120
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,757
bringer of rain,
to face Pericles,

121
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,793
titan of Pompeii!

122
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,962
It is to be sine missione?

123
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:17,164
No quarter given,
no mercy shown.

124
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,166
And the purse?

125
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,369
To be on a footing
with the match itself.

126
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:24,071
I would see it paid
to Varro's wife.

127
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:27,741
A substantial sum.

128
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:30,010
You would see it all
past from your fingers?

129
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,212
Along with future winnings
that I claim in the arena.

130
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,750
A noble gesture.

131
00:08:38,353 --> 00:08:39,820
One I shall see matched.

132
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:42,956
You would do this?

133
00:08:44,993 --> 00:08:46,593
For Varro?

134
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:47,628
I would do it for you,
Spartacus.

135
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:48,629
That you have peace of mind,

136
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,631
knowing his family
is attended to.

137
00:08:56,104 --> 00:08:58,172
These sad events have
obviously taken their toll.

138
00:08:59,307 --> 00:09:02,576
Rest, and be reassured
that those responsible

139
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:07,214
for our pain will soon
drink deep of their own.

140
00:09:16,424 --> 00:09:18,559
It is regretful,
what happened to Varro.

141
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:22,663
I saw in your eyes
how you craved to

142
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,398
defy order of his death.

143
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:28,035
A shame you did not attempt it.

144
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:02,236
Goat-fuck!

145
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:03,670
I knew it!

146
00:10:05,173 --> 00:10:06,840
Why do you fucking bleat?

147
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,075
You fight by my side, brother!

148
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:09,076
Like a suckling babe.

149
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,844
I would prove myself alone.

150
00:10:14,082 --> 00:10:15,682
And die the same.

151
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,324
Our champion
does not look to form.

152
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,226
Hm, the gods punish him.

153
00:10:27,996 --> 00:10:29,129
<i>For what offense?</i>

154
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,197
<i>You fucking jest.</i>

155
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:31,131
Varro's blood,

156
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,599
still wet upon his hands?

157
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,768
<i>His hands were
removed from choice.</i>

158
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:37,504
I would die before
I would kill my own brother..

159
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,373
And who would see
to your brother's family?

160
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:48,482
What answer do you give, Duro?

161
00:10:51,286 --> 00:10:52,786
<i>With both of you dead,</i>

162
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:54,788
who would see to his wife?!

163
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:55,989
His child?!

164
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,125
My brother has
no wife or child.

165
00:11:02,664 --> 00:11:04,264
Wait!

166
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,233
Fucking thracians.

167
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:37,497
Apologies.

168
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,533
I called your name...

169
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:40,867
I did not hear.

170
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:44,738
You do not appear yourself.

171
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,740
Did Dominus send you?

172
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,576
He would see
your spirits raised.

173
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,411
They do not deserve it.

174
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,246
Spartacus..

175
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,681
Your wound...

176
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:57,751
It's a scratch.

177
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,286
Varro suffered worse.

178
00:12:00,655 --> 00:12:01,588
I will help you to your cell.

179
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,090
You are not needed.

180
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:09,129
Apologies.

181
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:12,299
Mira.

182
00:12:17,472 --> 00:12:19,940
The man I saw you with...

183
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,442
I was ordered
to tend to his needs.

184
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,177
He means nothing to me.

185
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:27,047
Such is not my concern.

186
00:12:29,117 --> 00:12:31,051
<i>The man was wounded
trying to protect my wife.</i>

187
00:12:33,321 --> 00:12:36,123
Next you lay with him,

188
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,325
I would have you
offer my gratitude.

189
00:12:57,478 --> 00:12:58,545
Batiatus...

190
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,580
Apologies for the accommodation,
magistrate.

191
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,782
Take comfort knowing
that you will not

192
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,317
have to endure for long.

193
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:05,552
What is this madness?

194
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,387
Madness?

195
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,555
No.

196
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:09,990
It's only reason,

197
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,059
born of a clear mind
and wounded heart.

198
00:13:13,995 --> 00:13:15,295
Wounded?

199
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,830
I have done you no injury.

200
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,567
The man's crimes
escape his lofty notice.

201
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:23,870
Release me!

202
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,039
Oh, I intend to.

203
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:28,575
From this fucking world.

204
00:13:31,846 --> 00:13:34,648
Whatever your disagreement,

205
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,551
let us discuss it
as civilized men.

206
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:39,052
No, you mistake me.

207
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,054
I am but a base animal.

208
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,857
A beast to be ridden
and disregarded.

209
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,258
Batiatus..

210
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,028
You accept my hospitality.

211
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,396
Enter my home.

212
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:52,199
Break bread, drink my wine.

213
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,768
Only to spit in my face.

214
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:00,640
"Leave politics to the men
who have the breeding for it."

215
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:07,514
Offense was not my intent.

216
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:12,919
I sought only to spare you
further humiliation...

217
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,188
Spare me?!

218
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,556
You don't have power
to spare shit,

219
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,191
you pathetic cunt!

220
00:14:19,894 --> 00:14:20,644
Uh!

221
00:14:22,497 --> 00:14:24,564
Now speak the words!

222
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:25,599
Tell me my heritage!

223
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,200
Tell me my family name
bears no weight

224
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,936
among you and your noble
cock eaters!

225
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,071
Huh?

226
00:14:32,073 --> 00:14:33,106
Speak!

227
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,975
Apologies, Dominus.

228
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:37,377
Perhaps if you move
your foot...

229
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:46,086
Lift him up.

230
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,554
Dominus.

231
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,732
You wish words from me?

232
00:15:00,935 --> 00:15:03,537
May you listen to them well.

233
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:05,138
You are a jest.

234
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:07,641
A man tolerated,

235
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:10,143
because of his ownership
of Spartacus,

236
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,312
the savior of Capua.

237
00:15:14,015 --> 00:15:15,682
When he falls,

238
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:17,884
you will quickly follow.

239
00:15:19,287 --> 00:15:21,187
Tied to a fucking chair
in the filth and mire,

240
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,223
and yet the man provokes!

241
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:29,563
You still do not see it,
do you, good Batiatus?

242
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:34,034
You are beneath me.

243
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,769
And you always will be,

244
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,938
in this life or the next.

245
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:42,142
Do what you must
to balm your wounded pride.

246
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,611
I will not beg.

247
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,947
Beg?

248
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:50,116
No, the time for begging
is long past.

249
00:15:52,353 --> 00:15:55,388
Plans have been set in motion.

250
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:58,992
For you...
And young Numerius.

251
00:16:00,695 --> 00:16:02,295
What does my boy to do with it?

252
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,064
He is a man now.

253
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,433
He too has a part to play
in our little drama.

254
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:12,272
Batiatus, you..

255
00:16:16,444 --> 00:16:18,044
Attend he does
not injure himself.

256
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:21,047
I would see him fresh
for the appointed time.

257
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,851
Is this wise, Dominus?

258
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:25,952
Perhaps if we err..

259
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,153
Argh!

260
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:31,858
Take hold of your cock
and follow the plan, uh.

261
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:36,997
We are committed,

262
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:37,998
we are committed.

263
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,599
Dominus.

264
00:16:48,376 --> 00:16:50,243
The games approach!

265
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:51,911
<i>Prove yourselves
against Pompeii,</i>

266
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,913
and honor
the House of Batiatus!

267
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:06,026
My brother meant
nothing by his remarks.

268
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,293
He spoke his mind.

269
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,561
Thoughts shared by many.

270
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:12,298
You wish to rest?

271
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:16,236
If I do, I shall tell you.

272
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,411
Did I hurt you...

273
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:26,513
Champion?

274
00:17:42,797 --> 00:17:44,597
Tend to the wound.

275
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,032
Spartacus!

276
00:17:50,171 --> 00:17:51,604
Spartacus...

277
00:18:11,225 --> 00:18:12,559
The man is half dead!

278
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,427
You didn't notice
he needed fucking attention?!

279
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,463
I thought him only
distracted by Varro's death.

280
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,865
Will he be able
to fight against Pompeii?

281
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,300
He burns with fever.

282
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,402
A miracle if he lives
to the games.

283
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:25,071
Provide a list
of all that is needed.

284
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:26,473
Ashur heads to market,
he will see it filled.

285
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:28,408
Let not a moment pass
with him unattended.

286
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,276
Fetch Mira from the villa

287
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,378
if you need assistance.

288
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:33,847
He has some feelings
towards the girl.

289
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:35,281
Her touch may aid recovery.

290
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,018
Our champion cannot fall.

291
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,620
<i>Dominus.</i>

292
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,393
The Primus against
Pompeii finally mine

293
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,529
and the gods jam cock in ass!

294
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:51,765
The crowd will turn
upon me when they

295
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:53,800
learn Spartacus does not fight!

296
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,002
Perhaps they will be appeased
with suitable replacement.

297
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:58,471
Who but Spartacus could
best their fucking champion?

298
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,672
There is but one...

299
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:02,876
The Primus?

300
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:04,110
Mine!

301
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,412
At last Batiatus
remembers my worth

302
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,214
and I shall take
the sand again.

303
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:11,885
And see it turn red
with the blood of Pericles!

304
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,453
Soften your words.

305
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:14,687
We will be discovered.

306
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,256
Will let them hear us.

307
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,358
Tonight, I am a god!

308
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:22,695
And I will reclaim my title,

309
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,097
Champion of Capua...

310
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:30,403
The news does not please you.

311
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,505
It fills my heart with joy,
to see you so alive.

312
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:37,043
And would have you remain so.

313
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:38,178
Naevia...

314
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,313
The Primus is a fight
to the death, Crixus.

315
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:45,919
You have been absent
the arena many months.

316
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:47,821
If Pericles were...

317
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:48,822
Shh.

318
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:50,056
He will not.

319
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:51,991
How can you be certain?

320
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:56,196
Because I will never
leave your side.

321
00:19:57,464 --> 00:20:00,099
Death will tremble
if it tries to part us.

322
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:04,404
Tomorrow when I take victory,

323
00:20:06,307 --> 00:20:08,474
I will look to you
in the pulvinus.

324
00:20:09,844 --> 00:20:12,478
We will share the moment alone.

325
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,470
Your hand is weighted.

326
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,738
Now float your tongue.

327
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:42,942
You are safe.

328
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,244
My master has greater concerns

329
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,613
<i>requiring
his attentions.</i>

330
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:49,649
What plagues good Batiatus
to such distraction?

331
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,384
Matters beyond your worries.

332
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:54,988
Yet they clearly trouble you.

333
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:57,457
Confide, lift your burden.

334
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:59,859
He has grown reckless.

335
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,261
His thirst for power

336
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,396
and vengeance clouds judgment.

337
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,236
How so?

338
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:08,868
I have taken too great a risk
meeting with you this night.

339
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:11,070
I must to the apothecary,

340
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,238
before I am overdue.

341
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:15,341
One day, very soon,
the House of Batiatus

342
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:16,843
will come crashing down.

343
00:21:18,145 --> 00:21:20,446
Do not find yourself
buried in the rubble.

344
00:21:34,762 --> 00:21:36,362
Fucking hold him down!

345
00:21:48,142 --> 00:21:50,944
That's right.

346
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:52,194
Easy.

347
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:04,891
<i>Well, lick my hole.</i>

348
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:06,993
The pig-fucker's
still alive.

349
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:37,824
This is what you are to him.

350
00:22:39,093 --> 00:22:42,128
Gold, mined
from blood and meat.

351
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:08,221
All hail Spartacus.

352
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:16,796
Slayer of the shadow.

353
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,736
Bringer of the rain.

354
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:29,242
Champion of the romans...

355
00:24:34,074 --> 00:24:35,341
Die!

356
00:24:44,852 --> 00:24:46,219
Fuck!

357
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:53,359
Is that the best the great
Pompeii has to offer?

358
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:55,394
I fear the games will be
a disappointment this year.

359
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:59,165
These early skirmishes
count for nothing.

360
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,600
It is the Primus
that decides the Victor.

361
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,868
Um hum.

362
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,936
Absent your man Spartacus,

363
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:07,173
Capua shall once again find
itself in Pompeii's shadow.

364
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:09,775
Perhaps Crixus will bring
light to the matter.

365
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:12,178
<i>Crixus, yes.</i>

366
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,080
<i>The crowd will be amazed...</i>

367
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,816
That the gaul is still alive.

368
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:19,018
Batiatus assures us he's
recovered from his injuries.

369
00:25:20,154 --> 00:25:22,555
That he survived
at all is impressive.

370
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:25,458
No gladiator from Pompeii
ever lived against Theokoles.

371
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:28,194
Young Numerius
cuts to the truth.

372
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,962
A talent he learned
from his father.

373
00:25:31,265 --> 00:25:32,698
Does good Calavius
intend to grace us

374
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,467
with his presence?

375
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:36,369
<i>The day grows short.</i>

376
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:39,238
Critical matters
of trade in Picentia.

377
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,374
<i>He must have been
delayed upon his return.</i>

378
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:43,676
I am certain he will
join us presently.

379
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,266
Aulus!

380
00:26:08,268 --> 00:26:10,069
Up, you fucking goat!

381
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:12,405
Dominus does not pay you
to dream of tits

382
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,073
and cunts.

383
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,074
Place foot on me again,

384
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,043
and find yourself
once more a cripple.

385
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:19,645
You know the stakes we deal.

386
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:20,947
If Calavius were to escape...

387
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:23,049
Fuck your mouth shut.

388
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:24,850
The man has not stirred.

389
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:34,827
Nor does he breathe!

390
00:26:38,365 --> 00:26:41,100
Batiatus commanded
he not expire

391
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,636
until the appointed hour!

392
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:46,138
He's still alive,
you fucking woman.

393
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,540
Raise yourself, peacock!

394
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:53,980
Shit...

395
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,314
This is on you.

396
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:56,315
I will share no...

397
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:57,450
Quiet!

398
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:02,321
He breathes.

399
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:03,623
The man is still alive.

400
00:27:05,892 --> 00:27:07,393
Aulus!

401
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,798
I will have you both crucified!

402
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,166
And your master..

403
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,670
Aulus, enough!

404
00:27:19,273 --> 00:27:20,506
Aulus!

405
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:22,475
<i>Let me see.</i>

406
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,277
Let me see.

407
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:30,216
Ugly as a whore's gash,
but you will live.

408
00:27:31,518 --> 00:27:33,586
Return to the ludus
and have Medicus attend to it.

409
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:37,290
Do you have the balls
to see this through alone?

410
00:27:38,258 --> 00:27:39,191
Two of them.

411
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:40,593
Very large.

412
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:41,794
Go.

413
00:28:05,118 --> 00:28:07,119
We wait an eternity.

414
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,888
Why don't I begin our Primus?

415
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:21,167
The crowd threatens riot.

416
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:22,802
We can await
Calavius no longer.

417
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:26,505
Good Batiatus.

418
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:28,974
Would you present the Primus
on my husband's behalf?

419
00:28:29,943 --> 00:28:31,110
Well, if you think it proper...

420
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,545
Please.

421
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:34,146
<i>Boo!</i>

422
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:35,314
<i>Where's the fucking magistrate!</i>

423
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:37,416
<i>We want some action!</i>

424
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:41,187
Capua!

425
00:28:46,593 --> 00:28:49,862
In honor of magistrate Calavius,

426
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:53,599
who is absent attending
vital business on your behalf,

427
00:28:54,701 --> 00:28:57,636
I present the Primus
against Pompeii!

428
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:00,639
Spartacus!
Spartacus!

429
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:02,742
Spartacus!
Spartacus!

430
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,444
Spartacus!
Spartacus!

431
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:06,444
Yes!

432
00:29:07,347 --> 00:29:10,483
Yes, we all desire
to see Spartacus,

433
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:12,051
take to the sands!

434
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:13,452
But sadly

435
00:29:14,621 --> 00:29:17,923
this day shall not see
him with sword in hand!

436
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:23,662
Yet there is cause to rejoice!

437
00:29:25,298 --> 00:29:28,701
This is a glorious moment,

438
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:31,003
much anticipated!

439
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:34,173
For it marks the return
to the arena

440
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:36,776
of one of Capua's
favored sons...

441
00:29:38,678 --> 00:29:40,179
Crixus!

442
00:29:41,014 --> 00:29:42,782
<i>Murmillo!</i>

443
00:29:54,828 --> 00:29:57,329
They have forgotten the honor
that I have brought them.

444
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:00,800
Then it is time
you reminded them

445
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,802
who their true champion is.

446
00:30:22,355 --> 00:30:25,157
It appears Capua does
not care for your selection.

447
00:30:27,627 --> 00:30:31,330
<i>He faces a most
vile opponent,</i>

448
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:35,401
belched from
the bowels of Pompeii.

449
00:30:37,103 --> 00:30:38,103
Hum!

450
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:40,473
I give you Pericles!

451
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:43,075
Thraex!

452
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:56,689
<i>Pericles!</i>

453
00:31:08,468 --> 00:31:10,302
I pray the match
is overly brief!

454
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:11,052
<i>Hm!</i>

455
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,545
I would see
his fat smirk removed.

456
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:20,946
Give the command.

457
00:31:24,751 --> 00:31:26,585
Begin!

458
00:32:22,676 --> 00:32:24,009
Oh!

459
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:28,080
What was the fucking cause?

460
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,716
A dog, soon to be put down.

461
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:35,688
Drink.

462
00:32:37,324 --> 00:32:39,191
Smells like piss.

463
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:40,359
Henbane.

464
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,594
It's to make you rest.

465
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:50,769
I need food
and a few hours sleep.

466
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:53,072
Come for me
if his condition changes.

467
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,867
Pompeii!

468
00:33:25,939 --> 00:33:28,807
Another year, another
"favored son" of Capua

469
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:30,809
gone to grass.

470
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:32,711
<i>The match
is not yet concluded.</i>

471
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,313
<i>Formalities of blood.</i>

472
00:33:34,313 --> 00:33:36,148
<i>Your man is finished.</i>

473
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:38,884
Crixus has the heart of a lion.

474
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:47,259
Look!

475
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:48,794
He yet rises...

476
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:49,862
Oh!

477
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,597
Lucretia!

478
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:52,898
Domina.

479
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:54,333
Give her water.

480
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,268
Your wife does not
fare well at the sight

481
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:58,270
<i>of your man about
to be slaughtered.</i>

482
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:02,775
Apologies.

483
00:34:02,775 --> 00:34:04,009
Its the heat...

484
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:06,745
See her back to the villa.

485
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:07,846
It will pass.

486
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:08,981
No arguments.

487
00:34:10,116 --> 00:34:11,850
<i>I will join you
afterwards.</i>

488
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,152
Dominus.

489
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:26,071
<i>Crixus!</i>

490
00:35:48,348 --> 00:35:49,681
Kill!
Kill!

491
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:50,816
Kill!

492
00:36:21,281 --> 00:36:22,981
Crixus!
Crixus!

493
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:25,250
Crixus!
Crixus!

494
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:31,290
Crixus!

495
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:35,093
Returned to form as promised!

496
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:36,995
Your prayers
have been answered.

497
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,764
The match was overly brief.

498
00:36:42,335 --> 00:36:46,138
Good fortune to Capua,
and all its deserving citizens.

499
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:48,807
Oh, linger a moment!

500
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:49,908
Let us have a drink

501
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:52,845
and relive this glorious day...

502
00:36:52,845 --> 00:36:54,079
Dominus...

503
00:36:58,017 --> 00:36:59,718
What news so important
it interrupts

504
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,187
the gloating of good Batiatus?

505
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:03,422
The magistrate's caravan
has been discovered

506
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:05,324
<i>on the edge of town.</i>

507
00:37:05,324 --> 00:37:06,925
His guards murdered.

508
00:37:08,494 --> 00:37:09,862
What of my father?

509
00:37:09,862 --> 00:37:11,096
He was not among them,
but there are tracks,

510
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:12,197
leading back to the city.

511
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,032
Back to Capua?

512
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:15,801
Why would anyone
commit such treachery?

513
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:17,236
Ransom.

514
00:37:18,771 --> 00:37:20,472
This burden saddens me.

515
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:22,374
If I may be
of any assistance...

516
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:24,176
Gratitude.

517
00:37:24,176 --> 00:37:25,978
We can handle it.

518
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,684
I will gather my men
to aid in the search.

519
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:34,119
Numerius, your presence
is welcome.

520
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,454
No. I will have
him by my side.

521
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:36,655
Mother.

522
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:37,723
<i>I will never let him
out of my sight.</i>

523
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:38,957
You have my oath on it.

524
00:37:39,726 --> 00:37:40,659
Ok.

525
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:41,660
Come.

526
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,128
Let us to your father.

527
00:37:59,312 --> 00:38:01,380
You send message,
yet I wait as a common slave.

528
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,381
Apologies.

529
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:04,316
It was difficult
to move without notice.

530
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:05,651
The alarm is up
across the city.

531
00:38:05,651 --> 00:38:07,185
Speak quickly.

532
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,054
I join the search
for good Calavius.

533
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:10,055
He's gone missing.

534
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:11,890
I am aware of his absence.

535
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,293
The very matter
I wish to broach.

536
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:21,400
Calavius' ring!

537
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,401
Shhh!

538
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:23,502
Softly!
Softly!

539
00:38:24,504 --> 00:38:25,604
How did you come by this?

540
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:27,539
Through means pressing
upon your desires.

541
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:31,643
Batiatus holds him captive,
with intent of murder.

542
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,014
Madness, even for Batiatus.

543
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:37,516
Magistrate Calavius
insults him,

544
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:39,251
obstructs his ambitions.

545
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:41,453
I've never seen
Batiatus so unhinged.

546
00:38:42,188 --> 00:38:43,355
I would sever bonds,

547
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:45,524
least I find myself
upon the cross beside him.

548
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:46,992
Calavius.

549
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,460
Yet lives?

550
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,395
For the briefest of moments.

551
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:52,998
Where is he held?

552
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:55,968
Oh, you speak of severing bonds,
but remain firmly tethered!

553
00:38:55,968 --> 00:38:57,836
I hold no love
for old loyalties,

554
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:00,272
yet Calavius has seen my face!

555
00:39:00,272 --> 00:39:01,840
I must flee this city,

556
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,309
and would have proper
means to do so.

557
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:06,178
Take it.

558
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:07,713
And more, when Batiatus

559
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:09,214
and his treachery
are laid to rest.

560
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:10,415
Come, we must gather men.

561
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:12,150
Calavius would be
dead before you do.

562
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,319
Batiatus already
moves towards his plan.

563
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:16,955
Are you armed?

564
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:18,256
A simple dagger...

565
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:19,558
Enough to cut ropes.

566
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,526
Quickly!

567
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,128
Or see opportunity fade!

568
00:40:00,266 --> 00:40:02,000
Medicus?

569
00:40:06,339 --> 00:40:07,606
Mira?

570
00:41:20,446 --> 00:41:22,547
<i>Why did you kill him?</i>

571
00:41:28,688 --> 00:41:30,522
I had no choice.

572
00:41:33,893 --> 00:41:35,994
A man must accept his fate...

573
00:41:47,206 --> 00:41:48,607
Or be destroyed by it.

574
00:41:50,376 --> 00:41:52,410
Is this my path?

575
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:55,113
Blood and death?

576
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:56,948
You have always been destined

577
00:41:56,948 --> 00:41:59,217
for unfortunate things...

578
00:42:12,464 --> 00:42:13,898
Please...

579
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:16,634
Do not leave me again...

580
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,236
It was you...

581
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:21,138
It was you, who left...

582
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:28,713
You must tend to the wound.

583
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,008
Attacked...

584
00:42:59,278 --> 00:43:01,312
On the road...

585
00:43:04,283 --> 00:43:05,883
Came out of nowhere.

586
00:43:24,002 --> 00:43:26,070
Tend to the wound.

587
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:39,750
I'm here.
I'm here.

588
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:42,820
Be still...

589
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:50,328
Your fevers broken.

590
00:43:51,697 --> 00:43:53,130
The gods have blessed you...

591
00:43:59,371 --> 00:44:01,138
Yes.

592
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:04,508
They have.

593
00:44:12,918 --> 00:44:14,185
I will fetch Medicus.

594
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:15,319
Wait.

595
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:18,089
Release the straps.

596
00:44:19,992 --> 00:44:21,425
I would speak
to this man, alone.

597
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:24,195
Towards what purpose?

598
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:25,429
Wait in the corridor.

599
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,264
Sound warning
if anyone approaches.

600
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:34,171
Do this for me, Mira.

601
00:44:37,609 --> 00:44:39,310
I will be in your debt.

602
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:49,120
There is no sign of him.

603
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,421
My father could be
held anywhere.

604
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:54,025
He is a man of much esteem,
and easily recognized.

605
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,560
How could he be moved through
the streets without notice?

606
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,262
I do not know.

607
00:44:59,431 --> 00:45:00,765
Think.

608
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:02,133
There must be a way...

609
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:08,939
The cisterns!

610
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:11,809
They run beneath
the city and beyond!

611
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:12,810
The gates!

612
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,145
Torches!

613
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:15,846
You will be with your father,
soon enough Numerius.

614
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:17,815
You have my word.

615
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,950
Your part in this
shall not be forgotten.

616
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,153
No, it shall not.

617
00:45:28,427 --> 00:45:29,360
Calavius...

618
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,795
Wait.

619
00:45:30,795 --> 00:45:31,796
They approach!

620
00:45:31,796 --> 00:45:32,797
We must hurry.

621
00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:34,365
No, it is too late.

622
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:35,966
Steel your fucking nerve!

623
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:38,269
I will not end murder
by you or any man!

624
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:39,537
Consider Ashur a spirit,

625
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:41,572
and Capua the world
he left behind!

626
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,907
Ashur!

627
00:45:47,045 --> 00:45:48,746
They are upon us!

628
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,214
We must get you free...

629
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:14,638
Solonius!

630
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:20,478
<i>No, no...</i>

631
00:46:27,686 --> 00:46:29,186
Seize him!

632
00:46:34,693 --> 00:46:36,594
Your father shall be avenged.

633
00:46:38,663 --> 00:46:41,732
Solonius will suffer
for what he has done.

634
00:46:49,007 --> 00:46:52,176
And all of Capua will know
you for the shit you are.

635
00:46:57,816 --> 00:46:59,917
What are you doing?!

636
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,085
What are you doing?!

637
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:06,156
Tell me what happened.

638
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,858
Tell!

639
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:09,893
Take your hands off me.

640
00:47:10,211 --> 00:47:11,778
My wife.

641
00:47:11,778 --> 00:47:13,028
Sura.

642
00:47:14,148 --> 00:47:16,950
The slave you were
transporting from Neapolis.

643
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:19,252
Tell me what happened to her.

644
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:23,990
We were attacked, on the road.

645
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,563
They tried to get to her,
but argh...

646
00:47:29,563 --> 00:47:31,798
Where is your wound?

647
00:47:31,798 --> 00:47:32,799
Where is the wound

648
00:47:32,799 --> 00:47:34,968
you earned trying
to save my wife?

649
00:47:37,071 --> 00:47:38,438
Guard...

650
00:47:40,374 --> 00:47:42,509
Tell me, tell me!

651
00:47:45,913 --> 00:47:47,581
I only did...

652
00:47:47,581 --> 00:47:49,616
As commanded...

653
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:51,952
Who spoke the words
that took her life?

654
00:47:56,758 --> 00:47:58,425
Who?!

655
00:48:01,095 --> 00:48:03,230
Bat.. ia.. tus...

656
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,150
What have you done?

657
00:48:25,153 --> 00:48:27,120
Help me restore him.

658
00:48:29,524 --> 00:48:33,260
<i>You will secure my straps...</i>

659
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:37,564
And never speak of this.

660
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:44,938
<i>The wound did not
appear fatal.</i>

661
00:48:48,376 --> 00:48:51,312
The damage was deeper
than the eye could perceive.

662
00:48:51,312 --> 00:48:53,314
Medicus tells he
drowned in his own blood.

663
00:48:53,314 --> 00:48:54,064
Oh.

664
00:48:54,949 --> 00:48:55,916
A loose end.

665
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:58,152
No longer needing to be tied.

666
00:48:58,152 --> 00:48:58,902
Hm.

667
00:49:00,822 --> 00:49:02,790
You have played
your part well, Ashur.

668
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:04,692
Was greater hand than mine
that conceived it.

669
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:05,959
Solonius was easily
deceived into believing

670
00:49:05,959 --> 00:49:06,960
you would betray me.

671
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,228
As I knew he would.

672
00:49:08,228 --> 00:49:10,631
He never suspected my loyalty
always lay with you.

673
00:49:10,631 --> 00:49:11,899
A man who has no honor
cannot imagine

674
00:49:11,899 --> 00:49:13,167
that trait in anyone else,

675
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:16,236
and you, you have
that quality above all others.

676
00:49:16,236 --> 00:49:18,072
And shall be rewarded in kind.

677
00:49:18,072 --> 00:49:19,640
Your will, Dominus.

678
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,742
Oh, oh.

679
00:49:21,742 --> 00:49:23,777
The gods truly favor
the House of Batiatus!

680
00:49:23,777 --> 00:49:25,512
<i>Behold!</i>

681
00:49:25,512 --> 00:49:27,381
<i>Spartacus risen
from the dead!</i>

682
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,216
Spartacus!

683
00:49:33,288 --> 00:49:34,621
You are well?

684
00:49:37,492 --> 00:49:39,259
Yes, Dominus.

685
00:49:40,395 --> 00:49:42,262
I am myself again.

686
00:49:44,310 --> 00:50:42,180

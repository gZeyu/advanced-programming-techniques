1
00:01:00,055 --> 00:01:05,671
It wounds my heart to see a man
once so elevated plummet to such depths.

2
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,881
Your dog, Ashur.

3
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:11,494
Was he always upon your leash?

4
00:01:12,034 --> 00:01:15,488
- Even when licking my ass...
- His loyalty never wavered.

5
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,082
The man is most skilled in deceit.

6
00:01:18,082 --> 00:01:20,941
But perhaps you were too blinded
by envy to pursue the truth.

7
00:01:21,199 --> 00:01:22,904
Don't you flatter yourself.

8
00:01:22,904 --> 00:01:26,874
Did you not have eyes towards my ludus?
My champions?

9
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:28,603
My wife?

10
00:01:32,518 --> 00:01:34,968
You would steal glory from
the House of Batiatus.

11
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,740
Yet here you are.

12
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,414
With nothing but blood
and sand for your efforts.

13
00:01:39,825 --> 00:01:42,443
Capua will see you for what you are.

14
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:48,761
The man who brought the magistrate's
murderer to justice, a hero of the people.

15
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,446
May the gods protect me
from their wrath.

16
00:01:57,077 --> 00:01:59,179
Crixus makes quick work of his opponent.

17
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:02,218
I must return to the pulvinus.

18
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:05,160
To announce your execution.

19
00:02:07,893 --> 00:02:09,839
Well played, Batiatus.

20
00:02:11,016 --> 00:02:12,350
I underestimated you.

21
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:14,908
You're not the first to die

22
00:02:15,473 --> 00:02:16,554
for that mistake.

23
00:02:45,827 --> 00:02:48,295
Crixus honors the memory
of your husband.

24
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:49,630
As do we all.

25
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:53,968
We should put these
dark times behind us...

26
00:02:57,138 --> 00:02:58,506
And with Solonius' blood...

27
00:03:00,308 --> 00:03:01,408
Amend our grief.

28
00:03:03,278 --> 00:03:05,579
<i>Crixus! Crixus!</i>

29
00:03:07,249 --> 00:03:08,349
<i>Crixus! Crixus! Crixus!</i>

30
00:03:20,462 --> 00:03:22,263
I request words with Batiatus,

31
00:03:22,263 --> 00:03:23,764
yet you return absent the man.

32
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,501
Other matters occupy
his attention.

33
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:29,436
I've pressed for
audience all week.

34
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:32,973
Dominus forgets who
his champion is.

35
00:03:32,973 --> 00:03:35,309
It is you who forgets title,

36
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:37,678
master and slave.

37
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:45,686
Apologies.

38
00:03:45,686 --> 00:03:48,055
I have made many mistakes
since becoming champion.

39
00:03:49,491 --> 00:03:51,458
Know that I intend
to rectify them shortly.

40
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:02,436
Good citizens of Capua!

41
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:09,343
I stand before you,

42
00:04:09,343 --> 00:04:12,313
the sting of tears
yet hot upon my cheek,

43
00:04:12,313 --> 00:04:15,316
to redress a most vile crime

44
00:04:15,316 --> 00:04:17,384
against our city
and our hearts.

45
00:04:19,688 --> 00:04:22,923
The murder of magistrate
Titus Calavius!

46
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:29,763
His life stolen

47
00:04:29,763 --> 00:04:32,833
for lust of profit
and advancement.

48
00:04:34,369 --> 00:04:37,204
His warmth and guidance

49
00:04:37,204 --> 00:04:38,939
torn from our hands...

50
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:45,212
And those of loving wife
and noble son!

51
00:04:47,582 --> 00:04:50,050
Yet today we shall
witness justice!

52
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,255
The base criminal
that has so wounded us

53
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:59,426
shall be executed ad gladium!

54
00:05:04,065 --> 00:05:05,666
Enter Solonius!

55
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:08,535
Enemy of the people!

56
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,510
<i>Fucking pig!</i>

57
00:05:17,812 --> 00:05:18,912
<i>Traitor!</i>

58
00:05:23,284 --> 00:05:26,020
<i>Slice his
traitor tongue off!</i>

59
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,187
<i>You fucking pig!</i>

60
00:05:48,843 --> 00:05:50,944
And who shall
balance the scales?

61
00:05:50,944 --> 00:05:54,581
Who shall restore
honor to our city?

62
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:57,918
<i>Spartacus!
Spartacus! Spartacus!</i>

63
00:05:59,854 --> 00:06:02,322
There is but one man!

64
00:06:02,322 --> 00:06:04,358
The Slayer of Theokoles!

65
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:05,693
The bringer of rain!

66
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:09,496
Spartacus...

67
00:06:09,496 --> 00:06:11,965
<i>Champion of Capua!</i>

68
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:36,156
You survived your
execution, thracian.

69
00:06:36,156 --> 00:06:37,791
Upon these very sands.

70
00:06:39,294 --> 00:06:41,562
Perhaps good Solonius
will fare as well.

71
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:44,732
I would not expect it.

72
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,710
Begin!

73
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:00,948
Fight me, damn it!

74
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:09,156
Why does Spartacus
not strike in return?

75
00:07:09,156 --> 00:07:12,559
He but extends the moment,
to the favor of the crowd.

76
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:14,661
<i>The villain's blood
will flow soon enough.</i>

77
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:17,598
Your husband has been
a gift from the gods.

78
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:20,434
Numerius would be lost
without his support.

79
00:07:20,434 --> 00:07:23,270
He gains great comfort
in the act.

80
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,805
The comfort is ours.

81
00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:28,408
He will make a fine father,
when the day comes.

82
00:07:29,744 --> 00:07:31,411
Look, Spartacus draws blood.

83
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:52,666
You are not absent skill.

84
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,801
Nor desire to live.

85
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:06,346
You see?

86
00:08:06,346 --> 00:08:08,448
Solonius comes to his end.

87
00:08:08,448 --> 00:08:09,683
And who would not wish it?

88
00:08:11,286 --> 00:08:14,288
The streets of Rome are wet
with tears of your loss.

89
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:19,827
<i>We have not received word
from you, Ilithyia.</i>

90
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:24,031
Did you speak to your husband?

91
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:26,333
About patronage
for the House of Batiatus?

92
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,101
At length.

93
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:30,237
He comes to Capua a day hence,

94
00:08:30,237 --> 00:08:31,805
to discuss the matter
personally.

95
00:08:54,495 --> 00:08:57,064
The roar of the crowd.

96
00:08:57,064 --> 00:08:58,732
There is no sound
more glorious.

97
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:02,336
The last you shall hear.

98
00:09:03,938 --> 00:09:05,973
You take the wrong life.

99
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:09,009
Your master Batiatus,
is the villain.

100
00:09:13,581 --> 00:09:14,948
And shall join you presently.

101
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:23,056
<i>
kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

102
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:12,673
<i>Spartacus!
Spartacus! Spartacus!</i>

103
00:10:24,686 --> 00:10:26,520
<i>I would not have
Agron risk himself</i>

104
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,155
<i>on behalf of
brotherly bond.</i>

105
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:30,357
See him separated from
Duro in future games.

106
00:10:30,357 --> 00:10:31,658
And, what of Spartacus?

107
00:10:31,658 --> 00:10:33,694
He grows restless at
not receiving audience.

108
00:10:33,694 --> 00:10:36,563
The proceedings with Solonius
have filled my attentions.

109
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:38,665
Send Mira to occupy
his thoughts.

110
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:40,367
I will summon him
in the morning.

111
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:41,535
Dominus.

112
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:50,877
Robes, fit for a man of
breeding and intelligence!

113
00:10:50,877 --> 00:10:52,212
You wear them well.

114
00:10:53,548 --> 00:10:55,315
Today day beheld
the end of Solonius.

115
00:10:55,315 --> 00:10:57,751
A welcomed spectacle,
given purchase

116
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:59,619
by your loyalty and cunning.

117
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:02,289
You shall be removed from
the ludus immediately.

118
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,125
Removed?

119
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,060
You'll reside in the villa.

120
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,363
Elevated far above
the common men,

121
00:11:09,363 --> 00:11:12,265
your devious fucking mind
close to elbow.

122
00:11:18,906 --> 00:11:20,540
Gratitude seizes the tongue.

123
00:11:21,943 --> 00:11:24,144
Well perhaps a woman will aid
in the untangling of it.

124
00:11:25,313 --> 00:11:26,980
Name any slave,
and the wet joys

125
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,648
<i>of her body are yours.</i>

126
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,255
I confess to certain longings.

127
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:40,894
For one not yet soiled
by the other men.

128
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,498
Give name to your desire,
and see it fulfilled.

129
00:11:57,512 --> 00:11:58,612
Apologies.

130
00:11:59,881 --> 00:12:01,148
My presence was commanded.

131
00:12:04,152 --> 00:12:06,053
By Batiatus?

132
00:12:06,053 --> 00:12:08,722
His words set me to purpose.

133
00:12:08,722 --> 00:12:10,390
But they were
gladly received...

134
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,434
I tend your wound.

135
00:12:21,602 --> 00:12:23,070
<i>Stand guard at your
request while you</i>

136
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,404
<i>stain hands with blood.</i>

137
00:12:26,374 --> 00:12:28,308
<i>And you discard
a simple touch?</i>

138
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,350
My mind is taken
with other thoughts.

139
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,198
Then break open head
and share them.

140
00:12:55,002 --> 00:12:58,071
I fear Batiatus suspects
my hand in Aulus' death.

141
00:12:58,071 --> 00:13:00,073
He appears absent the weight
of pressing concern.

142
00:13:00,073 --> 00:13:01,708
Then why does he not
grant me audience?

143
00:13:06,547 --> 00:13:08,882
What secrets did Aulus
reveal in dying breath,

144
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:10,050
that so inflamed?

145
00:13:15,756 --> 00:13:18,024
That his hand
robbed Sura of life.

146
00:13:21,963 --> 00:13:23,363
By command of Batiatus.

147
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,437
You plan vengeance!

148
00:13:36,744 --> 00:13:38,512
You cannot do this!

149
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:42,883
Spartacus...
That is not what she called me!

150
00:13:44,352 --> 00:13:47,020
Never again will I hear her
whisper my true name.

151
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,855
Or taste the joy
of it on her lips.

152
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:53,560
I will see the light
fade from his eyes,

153
00:13:55,229 --> 00:13:56,696
or join her in the attempt.

154
00:13:56,696 --> 00:13:58,532
At expense of my life?

155
00:14:01,903 --> 00:14:03,937
The thracian does not
know roman law!

156
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:10,443
If one slave spills
the blood of his master...

157
00:14:11,746 --> 00:14:13,213
All are put to death.

158
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:19,953
Each to his own fate.

159
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:23,256
And I to mine.

160
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:54,454
You move with strong purpose...

161
00:14:56,123 --> 00:14:57,857
Spurred, by your victory.

162
00:15:03,297 --> 00:15:05,632
When I defeated Pericles,

163
00:15:05,632 --> 00:15:07,300
and you were not
in the pulvinus...

164
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,841
There is no meaning to glory,

165
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:16,443
without your eyes to witness.

166
00:15:21,382 --> 00:15:24,150
They will never
again be absent.

167
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:32,626
<i>Naevia?</i>

168
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:34,681
Hurry!

169
00:15:35,963 --> 00:15:37,063
Quickly!

170
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:44,771
<i>Naevia!</i>

171
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:48,275
Domina.

172
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:50,477
What business do you attend,
that you do not answer?

173
00:15:50,477 --> 00:15:52,479
Fetching wine, Domina.

174
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:53,613
Apologies, I did not hear..

175
00:15:53,613 --> 00:15:55,548
Leave it.

176
00:15:55,548 --> 00:15:57,717
There is a service required
of you by Dominus.

177
00:16:21,442 --> 00:16:23,710
<i>My heart quickens
at such a vision.</i>

178
00:16:25,112 --> 00:16:26,212
<i>Please...</i>

179
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:29,949
Set mind to ease.

180
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:33,253
I cling to no grudge
for past transgressions.

181
00:16:34,855 --> 00:16:36,589
I do not understand.

182
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:38,692
You spoke with Doctore,

183
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:42,395
after it was said Barca
secured his freedom.

184
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:44,364
I told him nothing.

185
00:16:44,364 --> 00:16:46,032
A thing of no consequence.

186
00:16:47,468 --> 00:16:48,668
Turn it from your thoughts.

187
00:16:48,668 --> 00:16:51,004
As I have
turned it from mine...

188
00:16:52,606 --> 00:16:55,675
In favor of more...

189
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:57,444
Intimate concerns...

190
00:16:59,947 --> 00:17:02,749
I have admired your
beauty for many years.

191
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:06,720
Were you aware
of my affections?

192
00:17:08,456 --> 00:17:11,424
I have felt your gaze
linger of late.

193
00:17:13,294 --> 00:17:16,529
A gaze is all I could dare....

194
00:17:18,632 --> 00:17:21,735
Your position placing you
forever beyond my grasp.

195
00:17:23,671 --> 00:17:24,771
Delicate, ripe Naevia.

196
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:33,680
Always the forbidden fruit.

197
00:17:35,216 --> 00:17:36,316
Until now...

198
00:17:41,655 --> 00:17:42,789
You tremble.

199
00:17:45,426 --> 00:17:47,360
Has a man never kissed you...

200
00:17:48,763 --> 00:17:52,132
<i>Caressed the soft curves
of your hips...</i>

201
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,638
Slipped inside of you...

202
00:18:00,474 --> 00:18:02,776
Domina has seen me
remain untouched.

203
00:18:06,347 --> 00:18:08,548
Then we are both...

204
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:11,751
In her debt.

205
00:18:33,908 --> 00:18:36,543
<i>You give her away
as if a common whore!</i>

206
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:38,945
<i>I've preserved her chastity
since she was a child,</i>

207
00:18:38,945 --> 00:18:40,513
towards presenting it as gift!

208
00:18:40,513 --> 00:18:43,183
The only gift of chastity
is in its removal.

209
00:18:43,183 --> 00:18:44,984
<i>By a man of worth!</i>

210
00:18:44,984 --> 00:18:47,554
Not fucking Ashur!

211
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:53,326
Naevia has been
my most trusted slave.

212
00:18:53,326 --> 00:18:56,563
The thought of that
fucking syrian

213
00:18:56,563 --> 00:18:59,466
shoving his devious
cock inside her...

214
00:18:59,466 --> 00:19:01,134
It's a betrayal, Quintus.

215
00:19:01,134 --> 00:19:02,836
It is a necessity.

216
00:19:02,836 --> 00:19:05,071
Set details of it aside,
and shift mind

217
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:07,140
to Glaber's arrival.

218
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,642
His patronage brings to climax

219
00:19:09,642 --> 00:19:11,010
all our labors.

220
00:19:12,713 --> 00:19:15,248
When the sun rises
on the House of Batiatus...

221
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:18,651
Everything will change.

222
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,276
<i>Your wooden man gives
almost as much fight as Solonius.</i>

223
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,314
With each victory,

224
00:20:21,314 --> 00:20:23,883
I draw closer to facing
you again in the arena.

225
00:20:24,952 --> 00:20:27,020
And reclaiming stolen glories.

226
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,155
There is no glory.

227
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:31,057
<i>Only blood.</i>

228
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:33,326
Spilled for the pleasure
of the romans.

229
00:20:33,326 --> 00:20:35,361
And how they shall roar,

230
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:37,797
when I spill your blood
upon the sands.

231
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,201
<i>Spartacus!</i>

232
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:43,369
You are summoned.

233
00:20:50,311 --> 00:20:51,844
I fear you will never
have the chance.

234
00:20:58,819 --> 00:21:00,687
<i>Watch what
you're fucking doing!</i>

235
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:03,289
<i>Fuck.</i>

236
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:04,557
<i>Be careful with that!</i>

237
00:21:04,557 --> 00:21:05,725
Dominus.

238
00:21:06,827 --> 00:21:08,161
Where are the flowers?

239
00:21:08,161 --> 00:21:11,664
Go find the new girl
and bring fucking flowers!

240
00:21:11,664 --> 00:21:14,400
A house full of slaves, have to
do fucking everything myself.

241
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,737
Ah! The champion of
Capua graces us

242
00:21:17,737 --> 00:21:19,839
<i>with his presence!</i>

243
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,841
Apologies for not
receiving you sooner.

244
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,279
I have been consumed with
the tumult of recent events.

245
00:21:28,716 --> 00:21:29,816
Much has changed.

246
00:21:31,185 --> 00:21:34,220
The world reforms at our feet,

247
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,822
the very earth thrusting us

248
00:21:35,822 --> 00:21:36,990
to unimaginable heights!

249
00:21:42,229 --> 00:21:43,663
At great cost.

250
00:21:43,663 --> 00:21:44,864
<i>Easily paid!</i>

251
00:21:44,864 --> 00:21:48,001
At this very moment
Legatus Glaber

252
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:50,269
thunders towards us
to bestow patronage.

253
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:53,106
I know your feelings
towards the man.

254
00:21:54,508 --> 00:21:56,175
<i>I would ask that
they be put aside,</i>

255
00:21:56,175 --> 00:21:59,545
<i>in favor of more
noble pursuits.</i>

256
00:22:01,815 --> 00:22:04,117
Glaber took Sura from my arms.

257
00:22:05,986 --> 00:22:08,721
But he is not the man
that took her life.

258
00:22:14,862 --> 00:22:15,962
<i>Aurelia?</i>

259
00:22:20,701 --> 00:22:21,668
Would that be all?

260
00:22:21,668 --> 00:22:23,670
Yep, fine, leave.

261
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,738
What is she doing here?

262
00:22:25,738 --> 00:22:28,608
Working beneath my employ,
to pay off Varro's debts.

263
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,510
I pledged my winnings
to such a cause.

264
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,379
<i>You did not tell her this?
Of course.</i>

265
00:22:33,379 --> 00:22:35,081
She would have
no coin from your purse,

266
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:37,383
<i>nor mine, unless
it was obtained</i>

267
00:22:37,383 --> 00:22:39,919
<i>by means of fair labor.</i>

268
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,721
<i>She wishes to serve
the House of Batiatus,</i>

269
00:22:41,721 --> 00:22:43,523
<i>until all his debts
are balanced.</i>

270
00:22:45,426 --> 00:22:47,593
She is a good woman.

271
00:22:47,593 --> 00:22:49,595
<i>And worthy of consideration.</i>

272
00:22:49,595 --> 00:22:51,497
<i>And she shall receive
it in abundance.</i>

273
00:22:51,497 --> 00:22:53,599
Now tell me, what
matter were you so eager

274
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,934
to discuss with me?

275
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:59,605
I merely sought word
towards Varro's wife,

276
00:22:59,605 --> 00:23:01,207
<i>and that she had
been provided for.</i>

277
00:23:04,945 --> 00:23:05,878
Excellent!

278
00:23:05,878 --> 00:23:08,915
<i>So all is well
between us.</i>

279
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:20,359
I require words with Spartacus.

280
00:23:21,962 --> 00:23:24,530
Why the fuck
would I allow that?

281
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,099
Because my tongue
remains silent

282
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:28,167
towards the gate key you lost.

283
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:30,169
You would have it remain so?

284
00:23:31,438 --> 00:23:32,538
Be quick.

285
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,781
Opportunity presents itself,
yet Batiatus lives.

286
00:23:41,781 --> 00:23:43,516
For the moment.

287
00:23:43,516 --> 00:23:46,052
Last night the lives
of every slave

288
00:23:46,052 --> 00:23:48,654
under this roof
meant nothing to you.

289
00:23:48,654 --> 00:23:50,923
Then Aurelia appears,
and you grow a conscience!

290
00:23:50,923 --> 00:23:52,592
Varro was as a brother.

291
00:23:54,094 --> 00:23:56,229
I will not see his
wife put at risk.

292
00:23:56,229 --> 00:23:58,598
You put the woman at risk
when you killed her husband.

293
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,750
<i>Crixus!</i>

294
00:24:23,423 --> 00:24:24,524
A parting gift.

295
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,827
What is this shit?

296
00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:32,331
A memento of your
battle with Theokoles.

297
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:34,333
<i>The city was filled
with such novelties</i>

298
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,536
<i>after Spartacus
brought the rains.</i>

299
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:39,705
The craftsmanship
was rather poor.

300
00:24:39,705 --> 00:24:41,841
Dominus finally
decides to remove you

301
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:43,342
from the company of men?

302
00:24:43,342 --> 00:24:44,844
Far removed.

303
00:24:47,414 --> 00:24:49,849
I have been given favored
quarters within the villa.

304
00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:52,418
To serve as our
master's right hand.

305
00:24:53,854 --> 00:24:55,855
The one he wipes his ass with.

306
00:24:55,855 --> 00:24:58,558
Ah, a witty turn of phrase.

307
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:00,359
One of many splendors
I shall miss.

308
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:02,428
Of being a gladiator.

309
00:25:02,428 --> 00:25:04,096
You were never a gladiator.

310
00:25:08,068 --> 00:25:08,818
No.

311
00:25:09,903 --> 00:25:12,205
Not after your blade
found itself in my leg.

312
00:25:13,473 --> 00:25:15,775
My gift to you.

313
00:25:16,977 --> 00:25:18,778
One that has
given great reward.

314
00:25:25,352 --> 00:25:26,485
Everything I am,

315
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:30,256
everything I now possess,
I owe to you.

316
00:25:40,601 --> 00:25:43,302
No, that goes to the balcony.

317
00:25:43,302 --> 00:25:45,471
Quickly, the Legatus arrives.

318
00:25:45,471 --> 00:25:47,473
The new girl is slow
to the task.

319
00:25:47,473 --> 00:25:49,342
An act of charity.

320
00:25:49,342 --> 00:25:52,011
We shall yet find
proper use for her.

321
00:25:53,113 --> 00:25:54,413
A great day, Dominus.

322
00:25:54,413 --> 00:25:56,082
One that shall be remembered.

323
00:26:03,223 --> 00:26:04,156
Where is the Legatus?

324
00:26:04,156 --> 00:26:06,692
Apologies.
My husband is delayed.

325
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:09,061
But you made promise.

326
00:26:09,061 --> 00:26:10,630
Which will be well kept.

327
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,165
He yet intends proper visit,

328
00:26:13,165 --> 00:26:15,768
but requests good
Batiatus give greeting

329
00:26:15,768 --> 00:26:17,904
upon entering the city.

330
00:26:17,904 --> 00:26:19,338
A great honor!

331
00:26:19,338 --> 00:26:20,840
When does he arrive?

332
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,008
Now.

333
00:26:24,378 --> 00:26:25,478
We must hurry!

334
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:30,750
<i>Come.</i>

335
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,085
Let us retire to
the balcony to feast.

336
00:26:33,085 --> 00:26:35,454
And review your
sense of timing.

337
00:26:35,454 --> 00:26:37,757
I would love nothing more,

338
00:26:37,757 --> 00:26:40,493
but I must return to the villa

339
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:41,827
<i>to gather
my belongings.</i>

340
00:26:42,963 --> 00:26:44,330
To what end?

341
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,132
I'm moving back to Rome!

342
00:26:48,502 --> 00:26:51,404
But your stay in Capua
has been so brief.

343
00:26:51,404 --> 00:26:53,139
Painfully.

344
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:55,641
Yet now that my husband
campaigns for praetor,

345
00:26:55,641 --> 00:26:58,144
he insists I remain
at his side.

346
00:27:00,547 --> 00:27:01,714
Are you well?

347
00:27:01,714 --> 00:27:03,716
The blood drains
from your cheeks.

348
00:27:04,851 --> 00:27:07,820
My heart but flutters at the...

349
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,288
The thought of losing you.

350
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:13,359
Memories of our
time together will

351
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:16,062
fade only with difficulty.

352
00:27:17,731 --> 00:27:20,333
Your friendship, Lucretia,

353
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,335
has forever altered my life.

354
00:27:47,728 --> 00:27:49,662
Spartacus.

355
00:27:49,662 --> 00:27:50,997
I would make request.

356
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:54,767
Ask another,
if you seek it granted.

357
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:57,436
It is not for me,
but for my brother.

358
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,078
Batiatus orders us parted.

359
00:28:06,078 --> 00:28:08,414
Duro greets the news
with laugh and fucking smile.

360
00:28:08,414 --> 00:28:11,984
Yet I fear he shall not
survive the arena on his own.

361
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:14,153
You are not alone
in the thought.

362
00:28:14,153 --> 00:28:17,356
Batiatus shows you much favor.

363
00:28:17,356 --> 00:28:19,725
A word from your lips could
see the decision undone.

364
00:28:21,328 --> 00:28:23,629
Batiatus favors
no one but himself.

365
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:52,792
<i>Yeah!
The Legatus!</i>

366
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:05,037
Legatus Glaber!

367
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:07,640
Your arrival honors
the fair city of Capua!

368
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,544
An honor I expected matched
by greeting at the gate.

369
00:29:11,544 --> 00:29:12,978
Well apologies.
I had thought that..

370
00:29:12,978 --> 00:29:15,514
Let us move past it.

371
00:29:15,514 --> 00:29:17,850
My ears burn with
reports of lawlessness

372
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,485
<i>since last I visited.</i>

373
00:29:19,485 --> 00:29:21,687
The magistrate's murder
was unfortunate...

374
00:29:21,687 --> 00:29:23,956
As was that of Ovidius
and his family.

375
00:29:23,956 --> 00:29:26,592
<i>And now the cousin
of senator Crassus</i>

376
00:29:26,592 --> 00:29:28,561
<i>goes missing.</i>

377
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:30,396
Let us retire to my villa,
and we can discuss these

378
00:29:30,396 --> 00:29:31,797
and other matters at length.

379
00:29:31,797 --> 00:29:34,233
I prefer to speak with
someone in authority.

380
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:35,701
<i>Good Mercato awaits.</i>

381
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:37,069
I shall accompany you?

382
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:38,504
That won't be necessary.

383
00:29:38,504 --> 00:29:40,272
Await me at your villa.

384
00:29:40,272 --> 00:29:41,407
When shall I expect you?

385
00:29:41,407 --> 00:29:42,575
When I arrive.

386
00:29:48,148 --> 00:29:49,682
<i>Crixus!
You are summoned.</i>

387
00:29:51,952 --> 00:29:53,953
I long for the night,
to continue

388
00:29:53,953 --> 00:29:56,088
what was last interrupted.

389
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:57,423
I cannot meet you.

390
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:00,960
Tis but one night.

391
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,561
There's no cause for this.

392
00:30:03,697 --> 00:30:05,364
Yes, cause.

393
00:30:05,364 --> 00:30:07,700
<i>Enough to drown us
both in tears.</i>

394
00:30:12,272 --> 00:30:14,039
Dominus has given me
to another.

395
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,879
Who? Tell me his name!

396
00:30:21,781 --> 00:30:22,815
What does it matter?

397
00:30:22,815 --> 00:30:24,316
We have lived in a dream.

398
00:30:24,316 --> 00:30:25,985
And now we must awaken.

399
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:34,860
<i>Do not be troubled,
mighty Crixus.</i>

400
00:30:37,631 --> 00:30:39,565
Capua cheers your
name once more.

401
00:30:41,067 --> 00:30:43,536
<i>Soon you will seize
the mantle of champion</i>

402
00:30:43,536 --> 00:30:45,171
<i>from that
fucking thracian.</i>

403
00:30:45,171 --> 00:30:48,240
And everything
shall be as it was

404
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,276
before you fell to Theokoles.

405
00:30:51,811 --> 00:30:54,079
I long for it to be so.

406
00:30:55,615 --> 00:30:56,715
As do I.

407
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,893
Something's wrong...

408
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,330
Apologies, Domina.

409
00:31:16,636 --> 00:31:17,736
Naevia!

410
00:31:24,911 --> 00:31:27,246
The shit fuck beckons
me to the city,

411
00:31:27,246 --> 00:31:29,348
only to spurn me
like a thin wasted whore!

412
00:31:29,348 --> 00:31:32,084
Once again the gods
spread the cheeks

413
00:31:32,084 --> 00:31:35,187
to ram cock in fucking ass!

414
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:37,923
Perhaps a gentle nudge,
to remind the Legatus

415
00:31:37,923 --> 00:31:39,058
of your importance...?

416
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:40,826
Hmm, make the arrangements.

417
00:31:40,826 --> 00:31:43,862
Glaber will bend
to my fucking will.

418
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:45,931
Or break in the denying of it.

419
00:31:45,931 --> 00:31:47,099
Lucretia!

420
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:49,134
You need to have fucking
words with Ilithyia...

421
00:31:52,105 --> 00:31:53,105
What's happened?

422
00:31:54,908 --> 00:31:56,508
I am with child.

423
00:31:59,512 --> 00:32:00,813
You're to be a father, Quintus.

424
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:06,752
Well, wine!

425
00:32:06,752 --> 00:32:08,153
Wine for the fucking house, eh!

426
00:32:08,153 --> 00:32:09,321
We must celebrate!

427
00:32:12,058 --> 00:32:13,158
<i>We must celebrate.</i>

428
00:32:19,933 --> 00:32:21,433
<i>This fucking village.</i>

429
00:32:24,004 --> 00:32:25,571
Finally.

430
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:27,640
I had feared you
absorbed for the night.

431
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,342
The curse of Mercato's
incompetence.

432
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:33,412
Cousin of Crassus vanishes,

433
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:36,782
and no theory rattles around
in his empty head.

434
00:32:36,782 --> 00:32:38,651
Theories pale
against the obvious.

435
00:32:39,886 --> 00:32:41,887
Licinia's tongue was
suspected of lounging

436
00:32:41,887 --> 00:32:43,656
in less esteemed places than

437
00:32:43,656 --> 00:32:45,324
<i>around her
husband's cock...</i>

438
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,128
Whereas mine has made
do with naught

439
00:32:49,128 --> 00:32:51,430
but idle conversation.

440
00:32:52,966 --> 00:32:55,868
I fear it may not
have been as idle

441
00:32:55,868 --> 00:32:57,569
as you would have me believe.

442
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:01,940
What promises have
you made Batiatus

443
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,208
and his faded bitch?

444
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:06,278
The flesh monger looks
to me with rheumy eyes,

445
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:08,647
brimming with expectation.

446
00:33:08,647 --> 00:33:12,985
I promise nothing,
save word on their behalf

447
00:33:12,985 --> 00:33:17,489
to my dearly missed husband...

448
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:21,427
Batiatus is little better

449
00:33:21,427 --> 00:33:23,996
than the beasts
that bear his mark.

450
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:29,368
True, but they do provide
a certain amusement.

451
00:33:34,307 --> 00:33:35,674
Humor their intent.

452
00:33:37,077 --> 00:33:39,244
No more can be asked from
a man of your station.

453
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:46,919
My promise discharged,
and we shall return to Rome.

454
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:49,621
And more civilized company.

455
00:34:11,077 --> 00:34:12,144
Fetch another.

456
00:34:13,246 --> 00:34:14,380
<i>And hold
onto it this time.</i>

457
00:34:19,753 --> 00:34:20,853
<i>Aurelia.</i>

458
00:34:21,955 --> 00:34:23,222
I beg a moment.

459
00:34:25,692 --> 00:34:26,792
Alone.

460
00:34:32,265 --> 00:34:34,032
You cannot be under
the care of Batiatus.

461
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:35,334
The deed is done.

462
00:34:35,334 --> 00:34:37,603
Then I shall see it undone.

463
00:34:37,603 --> 00:34:38,837
My winnings in the arena...

464
00:34:38,837 --> 00:34:40,172
Are not fucking wanted.

465
00:34:42,108 --> 00:34:44,209
Varro asked that
I see you taken care of.

466
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:45,878
Then return him to me.

467
00:34:52,352 --> 00:34:53,385
Varro's son.

468
00:34:55,388 --> 00:34:56,889
<i>He is safe?</i>

469
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:59,158
He stays with my brother.

470
00:34:59,158 --> 00:35:01,427
To be raised free
of his father's debt.

471
00:35:01,427 --> 00:35:02,594
Absent his mother.

472
00:35:05,298 --> 00:35:07,232
What of the child in carry?

473
00:35:10,136 --> 00:35:11,937
It was not fathered by Varro.

474
00:35:14,941 --> 00:35:16,275
Without him I...

475
00:35:21,281 --> 00:35:23,315
I had it removed
from my concerns.

476
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:26,118
As I would be from yours.

477
00:35:28,555 --> 00:35:30,355
Batiatus is not to be trusted.

478
00:35:32,225 --> 00:35:33,525
Do not lay faith in him.

479
00:35:33,525 --> 00:35:36,328
My husband is dead.

480
00:35:36,328 --> 00:35:38,597
And with him all faith.

481
00:35:47,474 --> 00:35:49,975
<i>As your eyes witness,
no coin has been spared</i>

482
00:35:49,975 --> 00:35:51,243
<i>in restoring the villa!</i>

483
00:35:51,243 --> 00:35:54,179
All will marvel upon
privileged entry,

484
00:35:54,179 --> 00:35:56,281
and be humbled by
the storied history

485
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:57,716
of the House of Batiatus!

486
00:35:57,716 --> 00:35:59,485
It is a vast improvement.

487
00:35:59,485 --> 00:36:02,654
Hm, the gods have
truly blessed them.

488
00:36:02,654 --> 00:36:04,656
And continue to do so.

489
00:36:04,656 --> 00:36:07,292
If fortune so favors,
why do you continue

490
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:09,661
to press so brazenly
for my support?

491
00:36:09,661 --> 00:36:11,497
True fortune extends
no further than

492
00:36:11,497 --> 00:36:12,898
a man's ambitions.

493
00:36:12,898 --> 00:36:15,567
Mine stretch well beyond
the sands of the arena.

494
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,136
How far beyond?

495
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:20,472
To the very doors
of political office.

496
00:36:22,976 --> 00:36:24,776
In a minor capacity.
At first.

497
00:36:26,279 --> 00:36:29,581
Well, let us entertain
it for a moment.

498
00:36:29,581 --> 00:36:32,351
What men of status
lend you their confidence?

499
00:36:32,351 --> 00:36:35,454
Magistrate Calavius had
voiced his endorsement.

500
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:38,824
Before the coward Solonius
forever stilled his tongue.

501
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:40,092
<i>Base villain.</i>

502
00:36:40,092 --> 00:36:42,828
The way he would
stare with his teeth.

503
00:36:44,597 --> 00:36:47,666
<i>My heart is moved
by the tragedy.</i>

504
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,601
Yet my head remains fixed.

505
00:36:51,137 --> 00:36:53,505
What advantage would
I gain by association.

506
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:55,874
With a lanista?

507
00:36:55,874 --> 00:36:58,644
My gladiators ignite
the passion of the crowd.

508
00:36:58,644 --> 00:37:02,314
Lend name to my cause,
and see their deafening cheers

509
00:37:02,314 --> 00:37:05,884
transformed into demands
for Claudius Glaber,

510
00:37:05,884 --> 00:37:09,821
and his desired
position of praetor.

511
00:37:15,028 --> 00:37:17,563
They do favor Batiatus'
men like no others.

512
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,332
Especially Spartacus.

513
00:37:23,736 --> 00:37:24,836
The thracian.

514
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:28,473
And what does it say that
your finest gladiator

515
00:37:28,473 --> 00:37:29,808
was my worst soldier?

516
00:37:31,611 --> 00:37:34,046
That I am the greatest
lanista in the Republic.

517
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:35,447
<i>For I have taken
a wild beast,</i>

518
00:37:35,447 --> 00:37:37,316
<i>and forged him
into a god.</i>

519
00:37:37,316 --> 00:37:38,650
Its a bold claim.

520
00:37:39,953 --> 00:37:42,187
Built on a foundation
of fucking granite.

521
00:37:43,456 --> 00:37:45,123
I would see your
words made flesh.

522
00:37:45,123 --> 00:37:46,592
Easily conjured.

523
00:37:46,592 --> 00:37:48,460
Spartacus trains in the square
with the other men.

524
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,828
<i>I have descended
into the bowels</i>

525
00:37:49,828 --> 00:37:52,664
of your ludus once before,
and did not care for the stench.

526
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,300
Summon the thracian
to the villa,

527
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,635
along with the rest
of your men.

528
00:37:58,605 --> 00:38:00,205
All of them?

529
00:38:00,205 --> 00:38:01,373
All of them.

530
00:38:22,629 --> 00:38:24,696
<i>The Champion of Capua.</i>

531
00:38:26,399 --> 00:38:29,301
A sad day when an honored
city elevates a cur

532
00:38:29,301 --> 00:38:31,236
to such position.

533
00:38:36,175 --> 00:38:39,111
I see you've taught the animal
not to speak out of turn.

534
00:38:41,848 --> 00:38:44,016
And I would have demonstration
of other tricks.

535
00:38:44,016 --> 00:38:45,350
The thracian has learned.

536
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,420
Unchain him.

537
00:38:58,865 --> 00:39:00,832
Which of my men would
you have oppose him?

538
00:39:00,832 --> 00:39:02,000
None.

539
00:39:03,469 --> 00:39:04,569
Formation.

540
00:39:15,381 --> 00:39:17,749
Spartacus
wields practice swords.

541
00:39:17,749 --> 00:39:20,318
I fear he's at a disadvantage.

542
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:23,088
I but give him chance
to prove his legend.

543
00:39:24,724 --> 00:39:25,824
Iovis.

544
00:39:36,969 --> 00:39:38,336
How exciting.

545
00:39:40,273 --> 00:39:41,373
Begin!

546
00:40:03,896 --> 00:40:05,564
Vesper! Linus!

547
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,433
Legatus...

548
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:09,668
You opened this door, lanista.

549
00:40:09,668 --> 00:40:11,169
And we shall pass through it.

550
00:42:27,139 --> 00:42:28,740
Behold.

551
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,308
The legend is proved.

552
00:42:32,912 --> 00:42:34,012
Dominus.

553
00:42:36,515 --> 00:42:38,450
This savage caused
Rome great offense!

554
00:42:39,952 --> 00:42:43,088
Yet it would appear that
you have broken the man.

555
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:47,525
The way he bows
his head in deference.

556
00:42:49,395 --> 00:42:51,763
<i>Would I be afforded such
courtesies, I wonder,</i>

557
00:42:51,763 --> 00:42:55,066
<i>if patronage
were awarded?</i>

558
00:42:55,066 --> 00:42:58,103
He would be yours to command,
as would all my men.

559
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,108
Kneel.

560
00:43:03,108 --> 00:43:04,409
<i>And it shall be so.</i>

561
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:20,558
Legatus.

562
00:44:00,967 --> 00:44:02,934
Crixus!

563
00:44:02,934 --> 00:44:04,569
You fucking cunt!

564
00:44:09,075 --> 00:44:10,809
Calm yourself!

565
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:12,077
Slaves running wild!

566
00:44:12,077 --> 00:44:13,845
This is what you would
have me give name towards?

567
00:44:13,845 --> 00:44:17,749
What seizes your
fucking wits? Speak!

568
00:44:17,749 --> 00:44:21,119
I yet but touch my gift,
and Crixus goes mad.

569
00:44:22,488 --> 00:44:25,690
I felt her maidenhood long
absent when we lay together.

570
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:28,526
<i>Now I know whose cock
was in her first.</i>

571
00:44:35,034 --> 00:44:36,868
<i>You whore!</i>

572
00:44:36,868 --> 00:44:37,869
<i>How long?</i>

573
00:44:37,869 --> 00:44:39,704
How fucking long?

574
00:44:41,007 --> 00:44:42,107
How long have you
hidden laughter

575
00:44:42,107 --> 00:44:43,441
behind a polite smile!

576
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:46,911
How long have you
been luring him

577
00:44:46,911 --> 00:44:49,414
to your filthy slave cunt?

578
00:44:55,287 --> 00:44:57,756
What is it?
What is it?

579
00:44:57,756 --> 00:44:59,958
Give it to me.
Give it to me!

580
00:45:03,963 --> 00:45:05,597
How did you come by it?

581
00:45:05,597 --> 00:45:06,765
I took it.

582
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,268
To open the gate.
So you could lie with Crixus.

583
00:45:12,238 --> 00:45:15,006
You alone knew
of my feelings for him.

584
00:45:15,006 --> 00:45:17,275
And yet you betray me.

585
00:45:23,182 --> 00:45:25,417
Crixus never loved you.

586
00:45:25,417 --> 00:45:26,851
He did only as commanded.

587
00:45:36,462 --> 00:45:37,562
Mira!

588
00:45:39,331 --> 00:45:40,432
Domina.

589
00:45:44,737 --> 00:45:45,837
Bring me a knife.

590
00:45:50,976 --> 00:45:53,511
You have assurance
Crixus will be punished.

591
00:45:53,511 --> 00:45:55,814
I fear your hands
too soft for the task.

592
00:45:55,814 --> 00:45:59,284
You are mistaken.
They are as steel,

593
00:45:59,284 --> 00:46:01,352
hardened to their purpose.

594
00:46:01,352 --> 00:46:03,154
<i>As I to mine.</i>

595
00:46:03,154 --> 00:46:04,722
<i>We return
to Rome, absent</i>

596
00:46:04,722 --> 00:46:06,024
unworthy entanglements.

597
00:46:06,024 --> 00:46:08,059
Do not turn from me!

598
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:10,095
You forget your place, lanista!

599
00:46:10,095 --> 00:46:11,429
No. I secure it.

600
00:46:12,731 --> 00:46:14,065
Clear the fucking room!

601
00:46:14,065 --> 00:46:16,868
Tell Ashur to bring our
gift for the Legatus!

602
00:46:18,537 --> 00:46:19,637
Forget your gifts.

603
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,208
I would part as from
a troubling dream,

604
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:24,809
untethered by the memory of it.

605
00:46:24,809 --> 00:46:26,010
Oh you will remember this day.

606
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:29,247
Until you lay to
slumber, never to awaken.

607
00:46:29,247 --> 00:46:32,217
I fear we have let
events run the best of us.

608
00:46:32,217 --> 00:46:34,886
Perhaps a cup of wine
to er, cool the head.

609
00:46:34,886 --> 00:46:38,156
We are long past
civilized recourse.

610
00:46:38,156 --> 00:46:40,892
Your husband presses issue.
I would see it closed.

611
00:46:40,892 --> 00:46:42,060
As would I.

612
00:46:44,363 --> 00:46:46,998
Can I believe this will
make a difference?

613
00:46:46,998 --> 00:46:48,333
Open it and see.

614
00:46:56,408 --> 00:46:58,510
What is this abomination?

615
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:01,012
But a piece of the whole.

616
00:47:01,012 --> 00:47:02,313
Licinia.

617
00:47:02,313 --> 00:47:03,481
<i>Cousin of Crassus.</i>

618
00:47:05,184 --> 00:47:07,252
You murdered Licinia?

619
00:47:07,252 --> 00:47:09,988
No. Your wife did.

620
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:12,123
He lies.

621
00:47:12,123 --> 00:47:13,725
<i>A most heinous act.</i>

622
00:47:13,725 --> 00:47:15,460
One I was content
to help obscure,

623
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:18,563
under promise of her aid
in obtaining your favor.

624
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:22,267
<i>Now I fear Licinia's
body may resurface.</i>

625
00:47:23,669 --> 00:47:25,537
On the grounds
of your villa, perhaps?

626
00:47:26,872 --> 00:47:29,207
I will see the tongue ripped
from your fucking mouth!

627
00:47:29,207 --> 00:47:31,609
Even so ruined, it would
yet speak the truth.

628
00:47:33,012 --> 00:47:34,779
<i>Cladius.</i>

629
00:47:34,779 --> 00:47:36,981
You cannot believe me
capable of such a thing.

630
00:47:55,434 --> 00:47:57,669
Patronage is granted.

631
00:47:57,669 --> 00:47:59,837
<i>A portion of my men
will remain stationed</i>

632
00:47:59,837 --> 00:48:03,608
against further embarrassments.

633
00:48:06,412 --> 00:48:08,947
Make all other arrangements
with Ilithyia.

634
00:48:08,947 --> 00:48:11,216
<i>She will be remaining
here in Capua.</i>

635
00:48:11,216 --> 00:48:12,383
No!

636
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,375
No man is above retribution

637
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,610
for offenses committed

638
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:41,212
against the House of Batiatus.

639
00:48:41,212 --> 00:48:42,914
<i>No gladiator.</i>

640
00:48:42,914 --> 00:48:44,082
<i>No champion.</i>

641
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:46,784
Even the men that guard you,

642
00:48:46,784 --> 00:48:51,489
should they be guilty
of deceit or incompetence.

643
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:54,225
<i>Hector found
his key removed.</i>

644
00:48:54,225 --> 00:48:55,426
His head follows.

645
00:48:57,896 --> 00:48:59,931
<i>The fault lies
in my own breast,</i>

646
00:48:59,931 --> 00:49:02,033
with heart grown too large.

647
00:49:03,369 --> 00:49:05,169
<i>This cannot stand.</i>

648
00:49:05,169 --> 00:49:07,739
Legatus Claudius Glaber

649
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:09,841
<i>is now our honored patron.</i>

650
00:49:09,841 --> 00:49:13,711
And he has opened my eyes
to the error of my generosity.

651
00:49:15,648 --> 00:49:17,148
<i>One that demands
correction.</i>

652
00:49:23,822 --> 00:49:25,823
Embrace the pain.

653
00:49:25,823 --> 00:49:27,492
It is the only way.

654
00:50:22,815 --> 00:50:25,416
I expect your meetings
with Crixus to end.

655
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,687
Quintus...

656
00:50:29,687 --> 00:50:31,622
Do not fucking speak.

657
00:50:34,393 --> 00:50:37,328
That you would think
me a fool is insult enough.

658
00:50:41,266 --> 00:50:43,067
I have always known.

659
00:50:43,067 --> 00:50:45,236
<i>And turned eye away only
because it made you happy,</i>

660
00:50:45,236 --> 00:50:46,904
and caused me no thought.

661
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,108
Those days have ended.

662
00:50:52,611 --> 00:50:54,946
Set your attentions
towards our child.

663
00:50:56,148 --> 00:50:57,782
And do not see them stray.

664
00:50:57,782 --> 00:50:58,950
Enough!

665
00:51:17,903 --> 00:51:19,003
<i>Crixus!</i>

666
00:51:20,672 --> 00:51:21,773
<i>Crixus!</i>

667
00:51:23,776 --> 00:51:25,243
Grant them a moment.

668
00:51:25,243 --> 00:51:27,245
He was our champion once.

669
00:51:27,245 --> 00:51:28,579
Allow him such respect.

670
00:51:42,294 --> 00:51:44,295
I have destroyed us.

671
00:51:46,865 --> 00:51:47,965
We yet live.

672
00:51:49,368 --> 00:51:50,735
Where do they take you?

673
00:51:50,735 --> 00:51:52,570
I do not know.

674
00:51:55,974 --> 00:51:58,443
I will win my freedom.

675
00:51:58,443 --> 00:52:00,812
I will not rest
until I find you.

676
00:52:01,947 --> 00:52:03,047
It is time.

677
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:14,125
He speaks of freedom,
as did Barca.

678
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:16,828
I give you my word, that I shall
aid him in the seeking of it.

679
00:52:16,828 --> 00:52:19,730
No. You must not let
him broach the subject.

680
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,367
Barca was not freed.

681
00:52:24,803 --> 00:52:26,237
Batiatus took his life.

682
00:52:37,249 --> 00:52:39,150
Fuck ass, you roman cock.

683
00:52:42,387 --> 00:52:43,654
Shut your fucking mouth.

684
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:46,691
I would caution softer words.

685
00:52:48,126 --> 00:52:50,661
The shit keeps rising higher
in this fucking hole.

686
00:52:51,964 --> 00:52:53,831
Perhaps it best
not to be present,

687
00:52:53,831 --> 00:52:55,800
when it fills the mouth.

688
00:52:59,338 --> 00:53:01,005
What do you speak of?

689
00:53:01,005 --> 00:53:02,340
I speak of nothing.

690
00:53:04,209 --> 00:53:06,344
Nothing sounds
much like escape.

691
00:53:08,313 --> 00:53:10,781
<i>And how would "nothing"
find way past Batiatus</i>

692
00:53:10,781 --> 00:53:12,149
<i>and all his fucking romans?</i>

693
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:16,587
There is but one path.

694
00:53:18,824 --> 00:53:20,091
We kill them all.

695
00:53:22,900 --> 00:54:20,900

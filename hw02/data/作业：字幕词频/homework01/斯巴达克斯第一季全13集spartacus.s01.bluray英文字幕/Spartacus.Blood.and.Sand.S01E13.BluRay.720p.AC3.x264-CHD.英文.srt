1
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:09,636
The noble House of Batiatus
stands humbled!

2
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:12,973
Humbled by the blessings

3
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:15,509
the gods have seen fit
to shower upon us.

4
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:22,249
And by the presence
of the most revered citizens

5
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,017
in all of Capua,

6
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,019
come to join in celebrating
the patronage

7
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:29,089
<i>of Legatus Claudius Glaber!</i>

8
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:31,324
<i>The man himself regrets
the duties of the senate</i>

9
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:32,893
<i>prevent his attendance,</i>

10
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,295
<i>but he would see us
properly addressed,</i>

11
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,396
<i>his words delivered</i>

12
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,632
by pleasing tongue
of trusted wife.

13
00:01:42,737 --> 00:01:45,439
Good citizens
of Rome's favored sister.

14
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,541
<i>It is with great
pleasure that</i>

15
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,677
I, Legatus Claudius Glaber,
bestow upon

16
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,979
Quintus Lentulus Batiatus

17
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,648
<i>my patronage,</i>

18
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,516
<i>and all encompassing benefits.</i>

19
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,252
<i>No man in all of Capua
is more deserving</i>

20
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,455
of such esteemed privilege.

21
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,356
<i>Good Batiatus
should be held as example</i>

22
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:06,159
<i>to a city mired in shadows
and treachery.</i>

23
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,128
<i>The guiding light
of his virtuous heart</i>

24
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,199
<i>providing illumination in
these dark and troubling times.</i>

25
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,101
<i>For this reason and too many
others to give voice...</i>

26
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,369
Still yourself.

27
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:19,139
<i>I lend my full
and unconditional support</i>

28
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,942
to the honored position
of aedile.

29
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,979
Aemilia failed to mention
you had mind towards office.

30
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,681
Oh, I admit to none,
good Sextus.

31
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,749
Until the Legatus
broached the subject.

32
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:34,321
Aedile is but a breath
below magistrate.

33
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,071
Um.

34
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,191
We should dine, and discuss
the matter further.

35
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:44,231
My heart to Legatus Glaber
and his support.

36
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:47,767
In the hopes that you will
share it in the coming days,

37
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,103
I present a gift of blood!

38
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:52,973
Two legends of the arena,

39
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,609
<i>to face each other
sine missione!</i>

40
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:56,843
<i>No quarter given!</i>

41
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,411
No mercy shown!

42
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,082
Behold, Crixus!

43
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:04,518
<i>The savage Gaul!</i>

44
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,957
And who shall attempt
to tame him?

45
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,095
<i>There can be but one man.</i>

46
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,030
Spartacus!

47
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,065
<i>Slayer of the shadow of death!</i>

48
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:28,208
He is of a form, is he not?

49
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,279
He stands a god.

50
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,849
Crixus...

51
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,184
I have given my answer.

52
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,853
Let us finish this.

53
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:51,865
Begin!

54
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:29,302
You speak of dangerous things.

55
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,477
We live in dangerous times.

56
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,318
Many yet hold Crixus
our true champion.

57
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,987
Count me among them.

58
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:53,627
Doctore.

59
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,228
I would work the palus.

60
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,332
Permission for Spartacus.

61
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:12,746
Have you traded words
with Hamilcar?

62
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:13,913
He is with us.

63
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,917
But Castus and the other Gauls

64
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,552
refuse to grab cock without

65
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,821
Crixus holding their balls.

66
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,257
Where does Rhaskos stand?

67
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,825
The same.

68
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,762
Our numbers are yet shallow.

69
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:31,731
We must gain Crixus' support

70
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:32,899
and see them rise.

71
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,235
The fucking mad mans
still under lock and key.

72
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,071
How will you turn him to cause

73
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,139
<i>if you cannot
break words with him?</i>

74
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,074
Being champion
yet affords privilege.

75
00:05:42,243 --> 00:05:43,943
A way shall present itself.

76
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:44,944
<i>Answer!</i>

77
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,047
It best "present" fucking soon.

78
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,581
Did I tell you to stand?

79
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:57,090
Glaber falls to patronage,

80
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,091
and the men
of influence greet me

81
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,726
as a fucking brother!

82
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,529
A day of shining glory.

83
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,330
Marred by darkening cloud.

84
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,400
I beg a word, Dominus.

85
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,135
In private.

86
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:12,906
Doctore,

87
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:15,241
well spill sour thoughts,

88
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,077
and hear them sweetened.

89
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:20,613
Glaber's mercenaries
punish absent cause.

90
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,382
The men suffer at their hand.

91
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,717
It is a burden
that must be endured

92
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,086
I have no time
for such petty concerns.

93
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:29,456
With respect,
every ludus requires

94
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,791
the attention of its lanista.

95
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,995
I seek a loftier title,
one far removed from the arena.

96
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,498
You would see your family's
heritage a thing of memory?

97
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:39,248
No.

98
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:42,402
Yet I tire of the dust
and drudgery,

99
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,071
and I would have my interests
in blood and sand

100
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:49,476
overseen by someone
with more attentive eyes.

101
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,678
Someone who has forever
proven loyal.

102
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,850
You would entrust
the ludus to a slave?

103
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,352
A slave, never.

104
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:04,624
I had thought to make
announcement at the celebration,

105
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,593
<i>but you force my hand.</i>

106
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:10,130
My advocate is drawing up
papers granting your freedom.

107
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,531
Freedom?

108
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:12,832
No longer shall you
be my Doctore.

109
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,168
You will assume
the mantle of lanista,

110
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,870
and be warmly greeted
by your name,

111
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,371
Oenomaus.

112
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:22,842
I had thought
the news to please.

113
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:23,977
Apologies,

114
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,914
I have heard rumor.

115
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,115
One that has vexed sleep.

116
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,317
Well give voice,
and dream again.

117
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,356
Barca was not granted freedom.

118
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,725
Instead he met his end,
at your hands.

119
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,475
The rumor is true.

120
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,644
Yet absent reasoning.

121
00:07:58,679 --> 00:07:59,712
<i>Barca was dispatched
to deliver</i>

122
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,981
a simple message to Ovidius.

123
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,184
Instead he slaughtered the man
and his entire fucking family,

124
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,785
against command.

125
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:08,988
I had no choice
but to take his life,

126
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,690
before the magistrate
discovered the deed

127
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,892
and pulled us all to ruin.

128
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:13,927
And Ashur?

129
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,763
Did he aid in this "choice"?

130
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,936
When you are lanista,

131
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,237
you shall also be faced
with decisions

132
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,371
grave of consequence.

133
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,741
And know your measure
by how your blade falls.

134
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:39,619
Can you yet feel him move,

135
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,855
eager to make entrance
into the world?

136
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,057
How do you divine a boy?

137
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:47,060
Because the gods
fucking favor us.

138
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,127
Glaber's patronage,

139
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,829
<i>access to the upper
strata of Capua,</i>

140
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,965
<i>the promise
of political office.</i>

141
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,666
Everything we have bled for,

142
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,135
finally within our grasp.

143
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,705
We are truly blessed.

144
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,375
I deliver but
glorious news this day,

145
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,411
to be met with
tempered response!

146
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,948
Joy is restrained to lend
clear mind to celebration.

147
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,952
Glaber's patronage may
have paved road to the elite,

148
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,754
but they are
of ravenous appetite.

149
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:15,922
And what meal would you suggest

150
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,624
to see them sated?

151
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:20,793
One that only the house
of Batiatus can prepare.

152
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,730
Spartacus, Slayer of Theokoles,

153
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,531
in a contest to the death.

154
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:29,435
<i>We have already
presented such diversion</i>

155
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,237
at Numerius' toga virilis.

156
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,307
Varro was no match
for the Champion of Capua.

157
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,876
We must give them
what was denied that night.

158
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,544
<i>What all of Capua
longs to see,</i>

159
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,647
<i>but only a privileged
few under our roof</i>

160
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,148
<i>may bear witness to.</i>

161
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,250
The Champion of Capua,

162
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,986
Spartacus in a fight
for his life

163
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:50,123
against the only man
who has ever defeated him.

164
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:53,826
Is this your fucking hope?

165
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,361
That the fallen Gaul
is granted opportunity

166
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,696
to regain position?

167
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,731
Out.

168
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:04,404
You mistake intent.

169
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:05,905
I would see Crixus dead,

170
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:06,906
for offenses committed

171
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,508
against the House of Batiatus.

172
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:10,176
Then we stand as one
in such regard.

173
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:14,414
Oh your tongue
named cause of doubt.

174
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,983
Crixus is the only gladiator
to pose threat to Spartacus.

175
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,253
And there is yet
political advantage

176
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:22,221
<i>to parading
the bringer of rain</i>

177
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,791
<i>as I campaign for office.</i>

178
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,761
Then we must ensure
Spartacus victorious.

179
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,465
And Crixus fades from memory.

180
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,478
That will be all.

181
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,883
Patronage comes
with unfortunate attachment.

182
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,619
A fact I am well aware of.

183
00:10:55,356 --> 00:10:56,956
I am reminded of the first time
you stood before me

184
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,326
in this office,
a savage in chains.

185
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,329
Now you stand as death,
made meat and bone.

186
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,231
It was your hand
that forged my purpose.

187
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,400
Yet it is upon your shoulders

188
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,435
the House of Batiatus
has been so elevated,

189
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:13,039
and continues to rise.

190
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,677
Two days hence we play host to
the most influential in Capua,

191
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,480
in celebration of patronage.

192
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,582
Although a closer look
at the Slayer of Theokoles

193
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,617
be the true draw.

194
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,052
A great honor.

195
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,254
Will the men be displayed
in the villa?

196
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,357
The Legatus would frown
upon such storied tradition.

197
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,292
<i>You and the others will
be confined to the square.</i>

198
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:36,763
And how will
our guests have view?

199
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,097
<i>From purchase
of the balcony.</i>

200
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,632
No eye will be denied

201
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,234
the Champion of Capua!

202
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:44,137
As he faces his arch enemy
in a match to the death!

203
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,041
I am to fight Crixus?

204
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:50,743
This concerns you?

205
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,079
It is long overdue.

206
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:56,849
Yet there is no honor

207
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,152
in taking the life
of a caged lion.

208
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,420
<i>I would see him return
to training,</i>

209
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,756
so he may better thrill
the crowd before his end.

210
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,493
You truly have
fucking mind for this.

211
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:12,198
Crixus shall be freed
from bond yet only for training.

212
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,267
<i>I would not have
the animal run free,</i>

213
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,302
<i>lest he again bares teeth.</i>

214
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,303
Remove yourself to slumber,

215
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,605
and dreams /c of extracting th.

216
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,477
Apologies, Dominus.

217
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:28,247
There is something
I crave more than sleep...

218
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:45,064
You ask the impossible.

219
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,432
The gates to the villa
must stand open

220
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,568
before I make a move
on Batiatus.

221
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:51,170
You would have me risk all.

222
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,972
And for what?

223
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:57,009
So that Spartacus
may have his revenge?

224
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:57,759
No.

225
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:01,948
So that his heart
might find a measure of peace.

226
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,888
Was she such a woman,

227
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:12,258
your wife.

228
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,361
She was the sun.

229
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,165
Never to rise again.

230
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,567
A heavy thing,

231
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,238
to be denied its warmth.

232
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,075
I will see the gate opened.

233
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:33,479
But I would have exchange...

234
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,949
This is my price.

235
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,684
To feel you inside me.

236
00:13:41,722 --> 00:13:44,757
To know pale shadow of the love
that you felt for her...

237
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,258
I would not have
wagered the Gaul

238
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,160
such a challenge to Spartacus!

239
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,561
You underestimate
the man, Aemilia.

240
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,898
Crixus was once champion,
was he not?

241
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,267
The match is but newly born.

242
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,136
<i>Much may yet happen
as it matures.</i>

243
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,441
Apologies, Domina.

244
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,076
I must gather more
wine from the stores.

245
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,978
Send another.

246
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,879
I would keep you close,
to attend the guests.

247
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,529
You must listen to me...

248
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:49,148
Dominus has ordered my release?

249
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,584
It was Spartacus
that moved his hand.

250
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,519
Spartacus?

251
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,255
He desires you at your best...

252
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,258
When you stand before him
sine missione.

253
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:03,095
The gods finally
answer my prayers.

254
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,731
Had they but answered sooner.

255
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:06,999
You stand before him tomorrow,

256
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,834
<i>as the sun fades.</i>

257
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,737
If it were this very moment,

258
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,206
the outcome would not change.

259
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,208
I have made promise to Naevia.

260
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:24,684
I will not die until
I have gained my freedom,

261
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,253
and she is in my arms again.

262
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:28,487
Delay talk of freedom,

263
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,823
until there are ears
that would welcome the sound.

264
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:35,261
I fear Dominus shall
forever be deaf to it.

265
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:40,666
Place your faith
to closer quarters.

266
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,969
Dominus releases me
from the bonds of servitude,

267
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,639
to assume mantle as lanista.

268
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:53,079
It is a title well deserved.

269
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,882
Together we will restore
honor to this ludus...

270
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:00,286
And Naevia to your arms.

271
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,154
<i>Spartacus but stands
in your way.</i>

272
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:05,658
Then he shall fall.

273
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,033
A celebration?

274
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,601
Filled with the elite.

275
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,636
<i>Their deaths will shatter
Capua to chaos.</i>

276
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,105
It'll be days before
they regain senses

277
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,373
to pursue us.

278
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,941
Our plan takes form.

279
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:23,142
What of Crixus?

280
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,310
You still must find
way to broach subject

281
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,845
with the fucking Gaul.

282
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:28,948
It presents itself,
as promised.

283
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,384
<i>Yeah!</i>

284
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,752
<i>Crixus.</i>

285
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,520
<i>Crixus.</i>

286
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,455
<i>Yeah!</i>

287
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,128
Fuck my ass.

288
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:44,096
Now all that remains
is convincing

289
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,132
a man that hates you
to join your cause.

290
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:53,639
<i>You have seen
task to completion?</i>

291
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:54,974
My husband's patronage
has lifted

292
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:57,543
your celebration
beyond the heavens,

293
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,879
clouds bursting
with honored guests.

294
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,514
Altius and his cousin Gaius?

295
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:02,848
They are a necessity...

296
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,117
And are delivered,
as commanded.

297
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,921
Aemilia's husband, Sextus?

298
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,456
He's a former magistrate,

299
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,557
yet beloved by many.

300
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,193
His support would
all but secure office.

301
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:16,829
Pressing affairs
draw him to Rome.

302
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,299
That does not bring
comfort Ilithyia.

303
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:24,370
Then perhaps
his attendance shall.

304
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,571
He will delay travel,

305
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,507
with mind towards
your celebration.

306
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,309
How did you turn
his attentions?

307
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,677
He favors me.

308
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:34,113
Most husbands do.

309
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:43,222
Your services have been
deeply appreciated.

310
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,790
Yet more is needed.

311
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,792
In the absence of your
honored husband,

312
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,227
we would have you address

313
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,062
our most noble guests.

314
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:54,300
Just a few words
as if fallen from his mouth,

315
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,836
extolling the virtues
of the House of Batiatus.

316
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:00,539
I shall compose
something appropriate

317
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,540
for the occasion.

318
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,541
No need.

319
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,043
I've already seen to it.

320
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,183
My hands are no longer my own

321
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:14,253
and now you seize
my fucking tongue?

322
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,056
I would not have it flap about,
absent direction.

323
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,659
How much longer must
I suffer your indignities?

324
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,896
While breath gives life
to my command.

325
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:31,971
As you wish, then.

326
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,008
I know there have been
tensions between us.

327
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:40,012
Yet I see no cause
for our current arrangement

328
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,214
<i>to fall into
unpleasantness.</i>

329
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:46,185
We were such dear friends once.

330
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:48,954
Would you not see it so again?

331
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,526
Would that I had power
to reverse the sun,

332
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,428
and restore the world
to its proper place.

333
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:22,021
Rest.

334
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,289
Eat.

335
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,659
We resume after
midday sun has past.

336
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:49,415
You move well.

337
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,451
As if lash had never struck.

338
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,154
Pain is erased,
when inflicted upon others.

339
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:56,555
I would have you at your best

340
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,690
when we face each other.

341
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,191
Is that all you'd have from me?

342
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,427
Rhasko speaks of your desires.

343
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,695
What fever grips brain,

344
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:05,497
that Spartacus would
think me to band with him?

345
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,333
To risk the lives of my men?

346
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,801
My life?

347
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,336
Is there one?

348
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:12,371
Without the woman
you love within it?

349
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:17,977
I've never had stronger
reason to live.

350
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:20,212
I know your heart, Crixus.

351
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,448
I felt the beating of it
within my chest once.

352
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:26,085
Then you know
I'll fucking survive.

353
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,153
And see Naevia returned to me.

354
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,555
<i>As my wife was returned?</i>

355
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:33,525
Batiatus ordered her death.

356
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:40,432
How did you come upon this?

357
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,167
By tongue of his man Aulus,

358
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,003
before silencing it forever.

359
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:48,140
I will see
the House of Batiatus fall,

360
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,309
and with it the villain's
blood upon the earth.

361
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:53,379
As would I, in your position.

362
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:55,114
But I am far removed.

363
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:57,182
My escape would not aid Naevia.

364
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,484
How would I purchase
her freedom,

365
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,985
or even find her,

366
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,754
while being hunted
like a dog by the romans?

367
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:02,888
Join me,

368
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,725
and we will find her together.

369
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:13,999
You know that in another life,

370
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,934
you and I may
have been as brothers.

371
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,407
But not in this one.

372
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:25,411
I must win my freedom
in the arena.

373
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,347
Then we stand in the way
of each other's cause.

374
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,982
And both are just.

375
00:22:32,886 --> 00:22:34,453
But if I fall,

376
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,755
I'd have you swear
to find Naevia

377
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,258
and see her freed.

378
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:42,261
And I would have word
that if you are victorious,

379
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:45,264
one day you will
have Batiatus' life.

380
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:53,539
Tomorrow, then.

381
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:56,275
One of us dies.

382
00:22:57,644 --> 00:22:59,878
I fear it was always fated so.

383
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:14,526
Dominus.

384
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,998
Were you able to procure
what we need for tomorrow?

385
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:22,434
<i>Good Marcellus
was ever helpful.</i>

386
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,604
Leave us.

387
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,242
Varro possessed a fine eye.

388
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,211
Turn yours towards business.

389
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:34,213
What has coin extracted
from Marcellus?

390
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:37,549
A solution to most
vexing problem.

391
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:38,884
A few drops in his cup,

392
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,519
and fate is sealed.

393
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,720
It must not kill him.

394
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,088
Our guests need to believe
the match balanced,

395
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,691
lest goodwill
turn to accusation.

396
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:47,326
It will but weaken Crixus,

397
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:49,128
allowing Spartacus advantage.

398
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,397
It is a marvel.

399
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:56,835
That something so slight
could topple a legend.

400
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:58,904
All men fall.

401
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,807
It is but time
and method that differ.

402
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:05,778
See it done.

403
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,747
And in the act,
the end of that fucking Gaul.

404
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:27,099
Crixus moves
with deadly purpose.

405
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,634
He gives much better
showing against Spartacus

406
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:29,868
than the fool Varro.

407
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,570
<i>Poor Varro.</i>

408
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,039
He never stood
proper chance, did he?

409
00:24:38,378 --> 00:24:40,579
Crixus, however,
threatens to strip the champion

410
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,614
<i>of life and title.</i>

411
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,416
Indeed.

412
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,518
The Gaul yet surprises.

413
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,754
To the very end.

414
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:10,375
Apologies.

415
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:47,546
The noble House of Batiatus
stands humbled...

416
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:51,250
Humbled by the fortunes
the gods have seen fit

417
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,651
to shower upon us...

418
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,987
I should use
"blessings" instead.

419
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:57,389
"Fortune" has but
connotation of coin.

420
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,157
Blessings, then.

421
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:06,732
Oh, Quintus, has this city
yet beheld such a man?

422
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:10,035
Your father would be so proud.

423
00:26:11,271 --> 00:26:12,838
The old bastard would have
cracked with jealously,

424
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:15,107
to be so eclipsed
by unworthy son.

425
00:26:16,276 --> 00:26:17,676
He loved you, Quintus.

426
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:20,045
Yet he never believed in me.

427
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,813
Would that he were alive
to see the House of Batiatus

428
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,182
soaring beneath
the flapping of my wings!

429
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:28,553
Our son shall inherit
a fucking empire!

430
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,155
An empire now, is it?

431
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,790
Eh, the foundations
already laid.

432
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,125
Today we build upon it!

433
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:35,193
Spartacus and Crixus!

434
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,863
<i>Hated foes,
facing each other in death!</i>

435
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,233
The whole of the Republic
shall whisper with envy

436
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,769
what so privileged
few bore witness.

437
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:47,739
It will be a thing
not soon forgotten.

438
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:53,645
I fear your resolve grows soft.

439
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:55,080
Stone.

440
00:26:56,716 --> 00:26:58,317
I but wish an end
to the matter.

441
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,085
And to the man himself.

442
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,621
Ashur already attends to it.

443
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,290
Turn thoughts
from unfortunate past,

444
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,326
and fix on glorious future.

445
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:27,079
These celebrations
can cause hands to tremble.

446
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:31,149
Even most practiced ones.

447
00:27:31,584 --> 00:27:32,784
Gratitude.

448
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,286
See nerves calmed.

449
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,254
You'll do well here.

450
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,990
I have a feeling of it.

451
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:42,527
You are allowed to eat
from your master's table?

452
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:45,630
I prepare this as a tribute
to the mighty Crixus,

453
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,599
before his match
against the champion.

454
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,434
May the gods bless it, then.

455
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,570
And give him strength
to kill Spartacus.

456
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,872
I would save prayer.

457
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:59,011
I do not believe
Spartacus will fall this day.

458
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:04,216
I have heard Crixus
bested him once in the arena,

459
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:06,351
at the Vulcanalia.

460
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,452
What leads you to certainty

461
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,987
<i>against similar outcome?</i>

462
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,055
I am certain of many things

463
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,623
within these walls.

464
00:28:14,093 --> 00:28:16,762
Your beauty among them.

465
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:17,963
<i>Aurelia.</i>

466
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:19,531
You are needed in the square.

467
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:00,539
<i>Stay to my side</i>

468
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:01,640
<i>do not stray from it,</i>

469
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,808
<i>and I will see you
beyond these walls.</i>

470
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:04,443
I do not need you to hold hand.

471
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:07,112
<i>I only wish your life
protected, you fucking cock!</i>

472
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,081
Speak louder,
and see us all undone.

473
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:14,419
Ha, I would have
his fucking whip removed,

474
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,555
along with the arm
that wields it.

475
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,657
Doctore is an honorable man.

476
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:20,959
I would not have him dead.

477
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:22,894
Nor any slave.

478
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,629
You fret of shit and piss.

479
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:25,797
Rhaskos and the others

480
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:27,899
still will not fall
to purpose without Crixus.

481
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,101
They will seize the moment.

482
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:31,970
Crixus is dead,

483
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,672
and there stands
but one champion.

484
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:44,649
Doctore.

485
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:46,751
Water?

486
00:30:05,338 --> 00:30:08,373
These celebrations have habit
of turning from control.

487
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,542
Should they again,

488
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:13,778
remove to a safe place.

489
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:15,247
None exist.

490
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:18,116
Not since Varro was taken
from me by your hand.

491
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:20,519
And I shall forever
despise it for the deed.

492
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:24,156
In company with the voice
that commanded it.

493
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,724
You blame Batiatus.

494
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:26,825
<i>For many things.</i>

495
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,426
But not this.

496
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:33,064
It was the boy
Numerius who demanded

497
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,333
<i>simple sport end in death.</i>

498
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:42,207
And I should believe a man
that would do anything to win?

499
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:50,582
Do not take me a fool.

500
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,018
Ashur prepares meal for Crixus,

501
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,787
and speaks of the certainty
of your fucking victory.

502
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,989
They corrupt his food?

503
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,958
Was it the same for Varro?

504
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,826
Is that how you bested him?

505
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:06,698
I have no hand in this.

506
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:13,004
Were that true,
I would still pray Crixus

507
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,507
takes your life
before he falls.

508
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:36,661
<i>You betrayed me.</i>

509
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:41,733
Yet I've come to see
that the fault

510
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,168
is not your own.

511
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,538
You cannot be blamed
for being weak.

512
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:51,376
All men are, when faced
with wet opportunity.

513
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,814
I would put it behind us.

514
00:31:57,683 --> 00:31:59,584
All I ask in return
is the truth.

515
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:07,459
Tell me Naevia
held no meaning for you.

516
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:12,831
You ask me to speak
with false tongue.

517
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:17,435
What would it conjure
for our child?

518
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,837
Child?

519
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:21,172
Seed has at last taken hold.

520
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:24,909
The gods bless us.

521
00:32:25,845 --> 00:32:27,912
You would divine me as father?

522
00:32:29,482 --> 00:32:30,749
Not Dominus?

523
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:33,752
I feel the blood of a champion,

524
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:35,553
swelling inside me.

525
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,355
I feel you, Crixus.

526
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:41,926
I have often dreamt,

527
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:45,163
in quiet moments
of having a child.

528
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,668
With Naevia.

529
00:32:52,705 --> 00:32:54,939
There is nothing
left between us.

530
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,518
Crixus...

531
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:12,290
I didn't intend
for it to end this way.

532
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,719
Crixus begins to fade.

533
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,554
As all memories do.

534
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:53,064
You're weakened because
they have poisoned you!

535
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:54,466
<i>Finish him!</i>

536
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:56,000
They wish you dead.

537
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:13,385
I would not have this.

538
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,827
Join me, brother.

539
00:34:24,864 --> 00:34:27,098
And we shall see
the House of Batiatus fall.

540
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:33,204
<i>Kill the dog!</i>

541
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,293
Spartacus.

542
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:02,066
Argh!

543
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,838
Kill them!

544
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:41,139
Kill them all!

545
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:49,481
Do not be alarmed people.

546
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,383
Everything is under control.

547
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:53,618
Please.

548
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:54,752
He tried to kill you.

549
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,987
That fucking animal.

550
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,489
We must calm this!

551
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,857
Where are the fucking guards?!

552
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:01,626
Why do you stand there?

553
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,061
Gather your men!

554
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:08,399
I shall see you
properly attended.

555
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,483
Argh!

556
00:36:39,732 --> 00:36:41,499
Hamilcar!

557
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:55,480
Crixus!

558
00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:00,418
What is this madness?!

559
00:37:01,153 --> 00:37:02,620
Spartacus shows us the way.

560
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,222
He is a dog without honor!

561
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,491
This house is without honor!

562
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:08,760
Batiatus ordered his wife dead!

563
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,161
<i>And Domina...</i>

564
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,162
She has tainted me,

565
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,298
because I spur
her fucking heart.

566
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,801
I have given my life
to this ludus!

567
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,469
No, they stole it from you.

568
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,471
From all of us.

569
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,307
You asked me
to put faith in you.

570
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:24,008
I ask the same.

571
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:27,145
Honor us all,

572
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:29,113
and see an end
of this fucking house.

573
00:37:39,325 --> 00:37:40,075
Go.

574
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:21,282
No!

575
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:39,350
I save you this time,
brother...

576
00:39:06,745 --> 00:39:08,346
Ahhh!

577
00:39:10,282 --> 00:39:11,716
Friends.

578
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,018
We are perfectly safe
inside the villa.

579
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,553
<i>The situation
is being attended!</i>

580
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:16,788
<i>Still your hearts.</i>

581
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:19,390
<i>This very moment my guards
are no doubt</i>

582
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,625
<i>dealing with these...</i>

583
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:22,827
They've lost mind!

584
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:53,157
Where the fuck is Ilithyia?

585
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:55,626
Come! Let us away!

586
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,298
Seal the doors.

587
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:01,299
Let no one beyond them.

588
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:02,300
What of the guests?

589
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,102
I am the wife of the Legatus.

590
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:06,471
Seal the fucking doors!

591
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:15,179
<i>Ilithyia!</i>

592
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:26,390
Open the doors!

593
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:48,446
Do you recall what I said?

594
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,981
In this very room?

595
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,785
That if there was
more to Barca's departure,

596
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,587
you and I would share words.

597
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:01,692
Doctore...

598
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:05,062
Do not fucking speak.

599
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:07,265
I have seen you ply
tongue upon ear,

600
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:09,267
whispering poison.

601
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:11,969
Infecting the honor
of this house.

602
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,772
You would kill
a defenseless man?

603
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:17,108
Where is the fucking
honor in that?

604
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:19,310
<i>Let's see if you recall
what I taught you.</i>

605
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,945
When you were yet a man.

606
00:41:27,419 --> 00:41:29,153
The doors...

607
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,955
The doors...

608
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,724
Glaber's men...

609
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:35,092
Sealed the doors...

610
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:36,260
Ilithyia.

611
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,495
Why would she do such a thing?

612
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,830
Mother!

613
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:53,477
Quintus...
Go!

614
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:54,227
Go!

615
00:41:55,314 --> 00:41:56,614
Come.

616
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:02,620
<i>Come here you roman pussies.</i>

617
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:05,523
We are all of us dead.

618
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,425
No. We will
regain this house.

619
00:42:09,461 --> 00:42:11,128
Take Numerius,
conceal yourselves.

620
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:12,129
Come.

621
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:13,431
I know a place.

622
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:15,733
Where do you go?

623
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:17,435
To my husband.

624
00:42:20,172 --> 00:42:21,873
And the death of Spartacus.

625
00:42:30,282 --> 00:42:31,716
Pathetic.

626
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:34,552
You think this
will cause difference?

627
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:38,823
<i>Even if life fades,</i>

628
00:42:38,823 --> 00:42:41,592
my hand shall yet be felt.

629
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:45,329
It plotted the death of Barca.

630
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,598
Saw the magistrate's end.

631
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:51,369
<i>It even helped force
Glaber to patronage.</i>

632
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:56,307
Every beam, every stone
in this fucking house

633
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:59,210
bears the mark of Ashur!

634
00:43:00,112 --> 00:43:02,179
It bears only your treachery.

635
00:43:05,117 --> 00:43:08,686
My fucking treachery?

636
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:13,291
When did you
stand forth for Ashur?

637
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:18,029
When did any of you greet me

638
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:20,298
short of mockery and scorn,

639
00:43:22,401 --> 00:43:24,101
fucking cunts!

640
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:30,308
You received what you deserved!

641
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:32,810
For Barca and all the others
that you have betrayed,

642
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,912
<i>your time is done.</i>

643
00:43:45,557 --> 00:43:48,192
Would that this were the arena.

644
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,962
Your blood would
dishonor the sand.

645
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:54,532
Send me on my way, then.

646
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:57,702
As you would a gladiator.

647
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:02,506
Please, Doctore.

648
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:06,110
A parting kindness...

649
00:44:29,768 --> 00:44:31,235
Ashur!

650
00:44:33,105 --> 00:44:34,638
Ashur!

651
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:12,176
Quintus...

652
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:15,046
Quintus?

653
00:45:15,981 --> 00:45:17,681
You were right.

654
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:24,989
There is still something
between you and I.

655
00:45:27,793 --> 00:45:28,893
<i>Where is Naevia?</i>

656
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:33,164
Where?!

657
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:37,768
See me and the Dominus
out of the villa

658
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:39,336
and I will tell you.

659
00:45:43,475 --> 00:45:44,909
I do not believe you.

660
00:45:46,278 --> 00:45:48,446
Please...

661
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:49,680
Crixus...

662
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:55,019
Our child...

663
00:46:00,025 --> 00:46:01,959
I would rather see it dead,

664
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:06,497
than suckle your breast.

665
00:46:36,695 --> 00:46:38,229
We must conceal ourselves...

666
00:46:48,974 --> 00:46:51,175
Was it yours?

667
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:53,511
That small, little voice.

668
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:58,082
Did it form the words
that robbed Varro

669
00:46:58,082 --> 00:46:59,083
of his life?

670
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:00,484
Varro?!

671
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,822
He deserved to die!

672
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,056
He was nothing!

673
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:12,763
What did you know of the man?

674
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:16,467
That he would
sing to his child,

675
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:21,071
sleeping in his arms?

676
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:23,340
Or kiss the tears
from my cheek,

677
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,742
when I was of a mood?

678
00:47:26,778 --> 00:47:28,279
Did you know the father?

679
00:47:29,881 --> 00:47:31,549
The husband?

680
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:40,558
He was not a perfect man.

681
00:47:44,663 --> 00:47:46,363
But he was mine.

682
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,100
He was mine!

683
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,535
He was mine!

684
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,536
Yaaa!

685
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,537
He was mine!

686
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,473
Mine!
Mine!

687
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:57,608
Ahhh!

688
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:03,047
He was mine.

689
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:04,415
Yaaa!

690
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:06,283
Mine...

691
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:07,651
Aurelia...

692
00:48:09,521 --> 00:48:11,155
Be still.

693
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:13,691
It's done.

694
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:28,572
Look to the girl.

695
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,941
Is this not enough?

696
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,910
How many more must die?

697
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,345
I would see but one.

698
00:48:38,216 --> 00:48:40,217
I am your Dominus!

699
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:42,186
I will have your
fucking hearts!

700
00:48:45,123 --> 00:48:47,057
Quintus...

701
00:48:53,465 --> 00:48:55,099
Lucretia!

702
00:48:57,102 --> 00:48:59,603
What would you do?

703
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,605
To hold your wife again?

704
00:49:03,975 --> 00:49:05,376
<i>To feel the warmth
of her skin?</i>

705
00:49:07,145 --> 00:49:08,612
The taste of her lips?

706
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:11,582
<i>How many men
would you kill?</i>

707
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,517
A hundred?

708
00:49:14,686 --> 00:49:16,287
<i>A thousand?</i>

709
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,454
Here stands but one,

710
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,657
between you and her.

711
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:30,768
Go to her.

712
00:49:33,405 --> 00:49:36,740
Tell her the gods themselves

713
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,342
would not keep you apart.

714
00:49:39,044 --> 00:49:40,344
Lie!

715
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:44,948
As you lied to me of my wife.

716
00:49:48,086 --> 00:49:49,353
Oenemaus...

717
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:02,533
You were nothing before me!

718
00:50:03,702 --> 00:50:05,969
I gave you everything!

719
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:08,839
I gave you the means
to accept your fate!

720
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:16,246
And now you
are destroyed by it.

721
00:50:57,322 --> 00:50:58,422
<i>I have done this thing</i>

722
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,290
<i>because it is just.</i>

723
00:51:01,626 --> 00:51:03,794
<i>Blood demands blood.</i>

724
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:11,435
We have lived and lost,

725
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:13,837
at the whims of our masters
for too long.

726
00:51:16,174 --> 00:51:17,941
I would not have it so.

727
00:51:21,613 --> 00:51:24,648
I would not see
the passing of a brother

728
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:26,850
for the purpose of sport.

729
00:51:28,353 --> 00:51:32,022
<i>I would not see another
heart ripped from chest,</i>

730
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:34,324
<i>or breath forfeit for no cause.</i>

731
00:51:36,661 --> 00:51:38,495
I know not all of you
wished this.

732
00:51:40,632 --> 00:51:42,399
<i>Yet it is done.</i>

733
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:45,969
It is done.

734
00:51:47,472 --> 00:51:49,273
<i>Your lives are your own.</i>

735
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:51,575
<i>Forge your own path...</i>

736
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:54,344
<i>Or join with us,</i>

737
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:58,081
and together we shall
see Rome tremble.

738
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:59,060

6
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:49,980
Give report!

7
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,890
Spartacus' cavalry has broken our western flank.

8
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,560
That fucking savage.

9
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,710
Give signal to re-form to the south.

10
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,550
Kill him!

11
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,730
We must go!

12
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,040
Spartacus!

13
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,700
The Romans have sounded retreat.

14
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,100
We have won the day.

15
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,280
We have won nothing.

16
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,210
Cossinius and Furius again slip from grasp.

17
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,220
The same cannot be said for many that stood with them.

18
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,930
The field is thick with the dead.

19
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:22,300
Deserved fate for all who would see us again to shackle and whip.

20
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,060
Another standard lost?

21
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,130
It is a grave wound inflicted upon the Republic, Cossinius.

22
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,520
A deeper one would have been suffered,

23
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,540
had we not withdrawn from battle.

24
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,260
It confounds the fucking senses.

25
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,520
How could a handful of errant slaves continue to vex us?

26
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,910
I fear their numbers have been sorely underestimated within the Senate.

27
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,330
Spartacus' mongrel horde

28
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,300
has swelled with each passing victory,

29
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,690
since Glaber's defeat at Vesuvius.

30
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,880
They added thousands to rank liberating the mines of Lucania.

31
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,320
Slaves across the Republic,

32
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,120
humble and grateful to their masters

33
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,060
for so many years, have broken to treachery

34
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,020
in the wake of ever expanding legend of Spartacus.

35
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,480
Untold numbers joined his cause

36
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,970
after Scrofa fell to him on the banks of the Calor.

37
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,090
His standards and fasces falling to the enemy,

38
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,840
as the man himself.

39
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,080
Such chaos and death at the hands of a fucking slave.

40
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,700
You will discover this fucking slave

41
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,360
at the very gates of Rome itself,

42
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,660
if reinforcements are not dispatched.

43
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,850
Lucullus battles Mithridates near the Black Sea.

44
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,380
Antonius sails against the pirates plaguing Crete.

45
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,020
Pompey yet struggles with the renegade Sertorius in Espainia.

46
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,710
The resources of the Senate are drained by these conflicts.

47
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,390
We have not the men nor the coin to procure them.

48
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,580
There is one among us who could fund endeavor from his own purse.

49
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,170
And never feel sting of its cost.

50
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,180
I had hoped to avoid involving the man.

51
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,860
We would not be beholden to him any more than you, Metellus.

52
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,260
Produce alternative, and we shall seize upon it.

53
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,520
Very well.

54
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,760
I shall return to Rome and entreat Crassus

55
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,700
to aid in crushing Spartacus and his rebellion.

56
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,060
And in the act, attempt to redress grievous injury

57
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,250
inflicted upon the honor of the Republic.

58
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,870
The field has been stripped of weapons and horses.

59
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,230
The Romans' loss again becomes our bounty.

60
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,580
What of Gannicus?

61
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,860
I would have his report as well.

62
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,220
You well know the man.

63
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,580
He favors celebration after a victory.

64
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,230
Often for many days.

65
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,780
A thing I would gladly give blessing

66
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,280
after Cossinius and Furius fall from concern.

67
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,600
They have proven themselves no fools.

68
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,630
And may yet attempt bold maneuver.

69
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,630
Double our sentries in surrounding hills.

70
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,080
I would not be caught unaware.

71
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,210
You give those shits credit beyond due.

72
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,440
Underestimating your opponent is a Roman trait, Agron.

73
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,120
Do not fall prey to it.

74
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,280
Cossinius and Furius come to the end of their days.

75
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,530
With each passing sun, hundreds of slaves

76
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,600
break bond to join our cause.

77
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,360
Agron is not wrong in this.

78
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,880
Soon we shall have the advantage of numbers.

79
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,310
Gauge prowess of all that have joined us, and see them readied.

80
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,050
I would strike again at nearest opportunity,

81
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,250
and give further warning to the fools in Rome

82
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,810
seeking to grind us beneath heel.

83
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,840
Every day for months he wrestles with the man,

84
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,050
groans and grunts filling ear.

85
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,570
Your father is a dedicated student.

86
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,270
And I forced to stand witness to the lessons,

87
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,730
while more pressing matters fall to ill attention.

88
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,810
Apologies, Dominus.

89
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,370
I lose myself in the heat of contest.

90
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,580
Less than a scratch.

91
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,130
Worse deserved for not anticipating blow.

92
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,430
You are quick of study.

93
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,270
Yet you open flank to injury when perceived advantage is pressed.

94
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,830
The ruin of many a man within the Senate.

95
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,350
Let us return to lesson after evening meal is broken.

96
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,410
Dominus.

97
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,700
The rumors prove true, Crassus.

98
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,960
You take instruction from a slave.

99
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,850
Hilarus stood a champion of the arena for many years.

100
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,950
I paid his lanista more coin than you'll ever see in your life

101
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,430
to purchase the man,

102
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,670
and impart what he's learned of the games.

103
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,890
And of the men who have drawn blood upon the sands.

104
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,020
Gladiators.

105
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,480
You strike upon very subject of my visit.

106
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,100
If we may break word in private?

107
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,450
Oh, Tiberius is well trained in the ways of men.

108
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,650
I would expose him to those of the Senate as well.

109
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,180
To the matter, we've have suffered unexpected complications

110
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,500
in our conflict with the rebel Spartacus.

111
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,020
Cossinius and Furius have fallen?

112
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,990
They live, but find themselves inneed of reinforcement.

113
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,070
An expensive thing to acquire, in these troubled times.

114
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,860
Their asses must be sore from the ramming Spartacus has given,

115
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,700
to come begging to me.

116
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,080
No one is begging.

117
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,980
They are asking assistance from a loyal member of the Senate.

118
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,670
How much assistance?

119
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,220
Ten thousand men.

120
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,910
It would take considerable coin and effort

121
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,570
to raise such a force.

122
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,970
And in return you will be offered a command.

123
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,180
Under Cossinius and Furius, of course.

124
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,400
An offer better received from the men themselves.

125
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,390
They've withdrawn to a villa on the outskirts of Nuceria,

126
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,600
within short ride of what remains of their legion to the north.

127
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,570
Spartacus continues to gather force in the valley of Campania.

128
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,640
You know I would not have come if situation did not demand of it.

129
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,320
No. You would not.

130
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,320
Their terms are agreeable.

131
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,540
I will dispatch message to them immediately.

132
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,690
Best I send my own men,

133
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,030
to ensure it arrives at intended destination.

134
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,330
Whatever your will.

135
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,340
To voice truth of it, I had expected you to extort

136
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,290
inflated title at the very least,

137
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,040
as Pompey did to take his charge against Sertorius.

138
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,720
My interest lies only in title and honor earned.

139
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,160
Apologies for ever suspecting any less.

140
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,680
You would agree to serve beneath Cossinius and Furius,

141
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,400
absent true command?

142
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,580
It would appear so.

143
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,630
I have heard how you berate their names,

144
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,980
how foolish and vain you think them and Senator Metellus.

145
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,940
- Father-- - The time for words has ended.

146
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,970
Spartacus must fall,

147
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,840
and I shall set upon what path I must to see day hastened.

148
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,650
For the glory of Rome.

149
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,050
I saw it with my own fucking eyes!

150
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,660
In the heat of battle, blood and brains thick to the knee.

151
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,080
and Gannicus, in the middle of it all!

152
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,750
Strips to his fucking cock,

153
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,340
bellowing to the Romans to kneel before him

154
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,270
and receive golden tribute!

155
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,690
In my defense, I had taken much wine that day,

156
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,100
not expecting Spartacus to turn and attack Scrofa.

157
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,920
There is more wine?

158
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,970
My friends, are of thirst.

159
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,780
Your woman brings gifts!

160
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,550
Gifts, yes.

161
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,470
Not for you.

162
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,970
Out.

163
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:21,830
Out.

164
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,260
It is my fucking tent.

165
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,050
Out.

166
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:28,370
We shall find another. Hopefully as well stocked.

167
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,630
Spartacus need to see you.

168
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,570
Then let him see me a while longer.

169
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,010
Is it imagining,

170
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,670
or do we rise to heights unknown in wake of battle?

171
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,960
As all men do,

172
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,460
when bathed in blood and victory.

173
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,850
When Rome falls, I fear we shall split the heavens in celebration.

174
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,580
And fuck Jupiter

175
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,210
as he plummets to the earth.

176
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,610
Oh, you believe you fuck as a God now?

177
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,080
I boast but upon evidence given.

178
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,260
Couple proud words with wine,

179
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,410
and see them better received.

180
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,260
You afforded yourself well upon the field this day.

181
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,890
You stand surprised?

182
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,510
I have always believed in you, Nasir.

183
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,970
Even when you were yet a contrary little Syrian slave boy.

184
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,100
My eyes were yet shrouded.

185
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,730
I am forever in Spartacus' debt, for parting veil.

186
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,010
A debt shared equally by all.

187
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,960
One we shall repay with Roman lives.

188
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,900
You summoned me?

189
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,500
I would not have had to.

190
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,230
If you had reported in with Crixus and Agron days ago.

191
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,600
My attentions were called by pressing matters.

192
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,380
Of women and drink?

193
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,330
Are there any more so?

194
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:37,660
Days can not pass after battle without your report.

195
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,930
We fought.

196
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,140
We won.

197
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,840
Does that cover needed ground?

198
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,800
You have proven valuable asset against the Romans.

199
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:56,820
Yet I would have you stand more than just another sword.

200
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,430
Take rightful place beside Crixus and myself, as a leader.

201
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:04,230
I will give life to your cause, in honor of Oenomaus.

202
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,990
I may even believe in it myself upon a day.

203
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,780
But I am no leader, nor seek to be one.

204
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,820
There are many that already look to you as such.

205
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,300
A greater number still would follow you in battle.

206
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,950
You mean die for me?

207
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,290
For the cause.

208
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,980
I would not be set above my brothers,

209
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,960
and thought greater than I am.

210
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,440
As many begin to think of you.

211
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,190
I do not wish it.

212
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,650
Yet it is so.

213
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,220
They begin to speak of you as a god.

214
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,630
And may react poorly when you prove yourself mortal.

215
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,820
Victory against the Romans is my only concern.

216
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,190
And how is it defined?

217
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,710
When Cossinius and Furius struck from this world?

218
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,500
You know that will not be the end of it.

219
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,770
Rome will send more and more in their wake.

220
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,570
Then they too shall fall.

221
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:58,400
And when we have laid waste to the mighty Republic?

222
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,240
What will you turn your wrath upon then hmmm?

223
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,890
The men that set you on this path,

224
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,320
the men that took your wife from you.

225
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,220
They are gone from this world. Their wives too.

226
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,380
In past news of Lucretia and Ilithyia's fall.

227
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,050
A thousand lives would not equal Sura's.

228
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,250
I dared to love a woman once.

229
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,420
When I was a slave to Batiatus.

230
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,530
She yet draws breath?

231
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,000
I would give the world to have it so.

232
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,650
A fate too common, for men such as us.

233
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,840
I had my vengeance, as you did.

234
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,340
And stood as empty.

235
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,170
Until Oenomaus forgave betrayal.

236
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,520
Oenomaus?

237
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:59,620
It was his wife I lost heart to.

238
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,730
Even when freedom was gained,

239
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,980
shackles of what I had done to those I loved remained.

240
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:15,900
With final breath, Oenomaus struck chains that bound me.

241
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,360
There is no one I hold to heart left

242
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,520
to break such balming words.

243
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,920
Absent such, a man must speak them to himself.

244
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,710
Words also denied me.

245
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,980
You seek them in the voice of thousands, clamoring for blood?

246
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,850
I could not save my wife.

247
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,740
And I can fight to see a day

248
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,950
when no innocent life is so easily disregarded.

249
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:54,590
A day when the Romans and their cruelty are but distant memory.

250
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,650
May you find peace in its arrival, brother.

251
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:12,230
Let us share wine and women,

252
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,260
and set aside such heavy fucking thoughts.

253
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,110
The offer is much appreciated.

254
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:23,870
Then I will drink and fuck in your name.

255
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,240
Fight when called upon.

256
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,190
The very steps to the Roman Senate

257
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,040
if that is where your madness leads.

258
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,510
Raise offer to 350 Denarii

259
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,030
and two iugera of land.

260
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,330
We must elevate numbers quickly.

261
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,150
I will dispatch Sabinus and see it done.

262
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,480
I thought you to bed.

263
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,510
Tiberius has filled his ears with talk of war.

264
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,710
The battle rages in his head, vanquishing slumber.

265
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:07,620
Is it true?

266
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,030
You ride with an army against Spartacus?

267
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,610
Yes to defend the Republic,

268
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,990
as is the duty of all Romans.

269
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,770
I'm a Roman. I will go with you.

270
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,750
Oh, would that you were of an age,

271
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,840
to stand by your father's side.

272
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,930
Now for your bed, Publius,

273
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,610
and dream of future laurels.

274
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,690
Yes, father.

275
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,910
He would follow you to the shores

276
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,360
of the afterlife, if so commanded.

277
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,740
As would Tiberius.

278
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,040
He will hold place amongst my troops when they march.

279
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,300
A place?

280
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,810
He deserves position of note, worthy of the name he bears.

281
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,740
He does not yet hold the years for the title of Tribune.

282
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,410
Coin and persuasion would see such rules set aside--

283
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,850
He has not earned it.

284
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,860
Tiberius has shown great promise as a soldier.

285
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,130
Yet he falls from target in strategy and discerning mind.

286
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,190
Then lend instruction.

287
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,020
My lessons never cease.

288
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,470
It is for him to apply them.

289
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,250
Your work carries into night?

290
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,880
And threatens break of dawn.

291
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,630
I shall see food and wine brought.

292
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,320
Kore shall tend to my needs.

293
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,960
Of course.

294
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,280
Your bed awaits.

295
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,930
If you find want of it.

296
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,670
It is an honor long deserved, to be given command.

297
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,110
One he finds beneath Cossinius and Furius.

298
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,560
I have never known your father

299
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,380
to remain beneath anyone for length of time.

300
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,120
Ah, perhaps the years have tempered desire for laurels

301
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,810
and adulation of the crowds.

302
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,190
And what of your desires?

303
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,470
Apollo himself would be set ablaze by them.

304
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,110
I shall remember not to stand too near,

305
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,600
for fear of melted wings.

306
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,280
I would not have you from my side in this, Sabinus.

307
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,230
The gods themselves could not wrest me from it.

308
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,520
I will see offer raised and numbers elevated.

309
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,680
Gratitude.

310
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,660
I recall a time when you and Sabinus were but children,

311
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,350
playing at war with wooden sticks.

312
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,220
Such games are of the past.

313
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,420
A thing yet proven to your father.

314
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,770
Do not give him cause to further doubt you.

315
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,700
Any shall be swept from thought,

316
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:43,380
when I stand awash in the blood of our enemies.

317
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,420
Watch your left!

318
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,010
Watch for the swing!

319
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,620
Raise fucking guard!

320
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,920
Your boy grows fiercer by the day.

321
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,330
Soon even I shall fear to call him little man.

322
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,240
At least now I will be able to understand you

323
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,910
when you yield, you simple shit.

324
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,020
Spartucus.

325
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,160
Next man! Take position!

326
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,370
Let's go! Let's go!

327
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,330
- Begin! - Come on!

328
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,570
We test the last of those that have joined us.

329
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,040
How do you find them?

330
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,560
Enthusiastic.

331
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,430
Yet short of skill.

332
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,300
Many among us once stood as such.

333
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,890
These will soon prove as worthy.

334
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,230
Perhaps not all.

335
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,050
Next man!

336
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,130
Do not speak of this.

337
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,180
Go.

338
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,660
Diotimos?

339
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,610
If I were?

340
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,010
Inside.

341
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,340
Quickly.

342
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:15,110
I can spare no more than this, so do not fucking ask.

343
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,820
Gratitude, gratitude.

344
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,830
You have killed a horse?

345
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,790
Lower fucking voice.

346
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,030
I would not follow the animal in crush news of meat would bring.

347
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,570
Who gave permission?

348
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,900
A man atop a horse in battle is valued ten upon foot.

349
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,000
He was gravely wounded against the Romans.

350
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,020
I would have sought permission from the great man upon the hill,

351
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,320
but King Spartacus is far too busy waging war

352
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,490
to bother with such low concerns.

353
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,310
What moves you to such thoughts?

354
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,850
Open fucking eyes you have your answer.

355
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,150
I begin to question turning from the calm of the ocean breeze

356
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,130
and the safety of my city's walls.

357
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,780
You were a free man, then?

358
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,210
Far removed.

359
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,610
I toiled beneath the heel of a most unpleasant shit

360
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,900
in Sinuessa en Valle.

361
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,410
Yet he at least provided for fucking needs.

362
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,740
Did you expect freedom to come absent cost?

363
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,790
No.

364
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:12,670
Yet absent fucking plan to be clothed or fed

365
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,000
we must take matters into our own hands.

366
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,050
Or risk early grave waiting for the Bringer of Fucking Rain

367
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:21,390
to bless us with much needed shower.

368
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,040
Weather will soon turn cold,

369
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,840
- and with it-- - Spartacus!

370
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,970
A clutch of Romans ride from the north,

371
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,090
attempting to slip past our position.

372
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,140
You are Spartacus?

373
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,940
- Apologies, I-I did-- - Still tongue.

374
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:47,480
You may not always have full belly or warm cloak,

375
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,870
but while I draw breath you have freedom to speak your heart.

376
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,290
Even against the great man upon the hill.

377
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,660
Fuck the gods.

378
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,700
You there!

379
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,350
What is your purpose so near rebel encampment?

380
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,130
Who else is with you?

381
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,770
Find fucking tongue.

382
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,090
Who is with you?

383
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,070
Death.

384
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,480
We must follow.

385
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,530
No. A spear. Quickly.

386
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,390
I stand your equal with sword.

387
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,620
Yet you have me by fucking spear.

388
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,820
Spartacus.

389
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,640
This one carried a message.

390
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,860
What does it say?

391
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,020
Ten thousand?

392
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,920
Led by Marcus Crassus Himself.

393
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,410
Cossinius and Furius will see their numbers swell,

394
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,270
stripping advantage.

395
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,020
We could lay trap.

396
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,760
Here, upon the Appian Way.

397
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,240
Catch them by surprise before they have chance to join their brothers.

398
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,860
That would place us between Crassus advancing from the north

399
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,840
and Cossinius and Furius in the south.

400
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,730
We do not have the men to face armies on both fronts.

401
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,920
We must strike Cossinius and Furius

402
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,770
before odds tip to imbalance.

403
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,770
We have inflicted nagging wound.

404
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,150
Yet for months we have failed to shatter resolve of their men.

405
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,560
Perhaps the heads of their commanders

406
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,900
carried before us would so sway them.

407
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,020
Trophies proven difficult to win.

408
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,980
On the field of battle, yes.

409
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,010
By what is written here, message was not directed

410
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,780
to where their troops lie.

411
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,920
It speaks of hope that word finds them safe within the villa.

412
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,010
They have gone to ground?

413
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:30,190
Warm bath and the comfort of women,

414
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,200
if my days in Rome are of worth.

415
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,570
Where is this villa?

416
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,810
It does not say.

417
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,570
Then we return to beginning.

418
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:41,610
We intercepted Crassus' men here, riding southeast.

419
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,330
Cossinius and Furius would seek to stay

420
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,790
within reasonable distance of their men.

421
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,120
Would place their villa somewhere within this region.

422
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,270
How do we divine which is theirs?

423
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,380
They are no fools, as you have said.

424
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,870
We will know location by placement of sentries.

425
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,400
And sizable force they no doubt have

426
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,500
without villa to lend protection.

427
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:03,890
Then we descend upon them with every sword we have.

428
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,940
No.

429
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,440
We risk discovery moving against the villa with large numbers.

430
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,390
Cossinius and Furius would be alerted,

431
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,430
and have chance to slip again from grasp.

432
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,120
Yet a few men might penetrate defense unnoticed...

433
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,670
A few against many.

434
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,640
Much as the old days.

435
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:25,340
Gannicus, Crixus-- I would have you at my side.

436
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,490
I am to stand idle, with arm up fucking ass?

437
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,610
You are to lead in my absence.

438
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,100
Gather every man and woman that can hold weapon.

439
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,570
Towards what purpose?

440
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,240
One of vital importance, if we are to gain victory.

441
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,830
It is plan born of fevered mind.

442
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,340
As often springs from his brow.

443
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,120
- Yet if we can see it... - If.

444
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,400
A word forever casting shadow.

445
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:52,510
You burn brightly enough to light darkest night.

446
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:56,370
I voice concern and you offer flattery.

447
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,610
I offer truth.

448
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,620
Your fire blazes to rival the fucking sun.

449
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,630
These hands, once trembled with broken memory,

450
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:14,150
now stand as strong as the steel they wield.

451
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,540
Because of you.

452
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,410
Because your heart is strong.

453
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:23,660
And your will undeniable force,

454
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,200
as I have often discovered.

455
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:32,140
I would not be from your side.

456
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,760
Nor I yours,

457
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,730
but this night it must be so.

458
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,330
Stay near to Agron,

459
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,150
and follow command.

460
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,500
Kill many Romans.

461
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:55,190
And return to my arms

462
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,790
with their blood

463
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,390
hot upon you.

464
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,620
The bodies of the dead

465
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,330
be all that greet Crassus and his army.

466
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,040
Sword.

467
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,000
There is yet much to be done,

468
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,570
if we are to move against Spartacus.

469
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,820
Hmmm, much.

470
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,150
Yet you waste hour sparring with a common slave.

471
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,640
Was Spartacus not also once thought of as such?

472
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:28,360
Would you dismiss him so casually as well?

473
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,000
No. Yet for all his victories spartacus is still a slave.

474
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,720
He's a man. No better or worse than any sharing title.

475
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,570
You would place him upon equal footing with a Roman?

476
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,940
In some regards, he's proven to stand even higher.

477
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,300
You believe wealth and position grant you

478
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,750
advantage over those beneath you?

479
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,030
I believe we tower above a slave in all things,

480
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,080
no matter what name he bears.

481
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,090
Then couple words with actions, and prove belief.

482
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:07,540
Well, you've been well trained in the Roman ways of combat.

483
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,480
Surely you can best a common slave.

484
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,390
Apologies, Dominus. I did not mean to...

485
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,870
You did but teach lesson sorely needed,

486
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:50,030
as Spartacus schools those who consider themselves gods,

487
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,920
perched far above lesser men,

488
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:58,470
And laughs as they tumble from the heavens.

489
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,810
There are too many.

490
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,160
Even for us.

491
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,160
Then let us pause moment.

492
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,020
And see numbers thinned.

493
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:35,940
The die has been cast. We cannot reverse throw.

494
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,730
There has been no word from Metellus.

495
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,450
He takes overly long.

496
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,710
And with what haste could we expect reply from Longinus for aid?

497
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,490
Cisalpine Gaul lays twice distance than Rome.

498
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,810
At least consider dispatching message--

499
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,070
Praetor.

500
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,170
The rebel army gathers near our legions in the north.

501
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:58,040
Give Mummius orders for first and second cohorts to move to support them.

502
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,990
To fuck with Crassus.

503
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,220
We shall rejoin our men and take Spartacus ourselves.

504
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,450
Fetch armor and sword! Quickly!

505
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,330
Agron's advance on position to the north draws them away.

506
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,590
Not all.

507
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,050
The gods have heard my prayers.

508
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,170
There is no boast in easy victory.

509
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,570
Stay to the shadows.

510
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,400
And let us end this.

511
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,960
He speaks to me as he would a child.

512
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,280
Then prove him wrong, and do not pout as one.

513
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,110
An army not yet raised to maturity.

514
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,950
Preparation for long march and campaign ignored.

515
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,890
All in favor of playing with this fucking brute.

516
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,170
I do not understand his mind.

517
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:07,360
Set aside wounded pride and think as he would.

518
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,650
And see shrouded mystery parted.

519
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,470
Swiftly. Before they are discovered from their post.

520
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,510
We do not know how many await inside.

521
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,610
Let us pray they are not too few.

522
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,900
I am encircled by mad fucks.

523
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,970
And begin to count myself as one.

524
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,400
The gods favor us.

525
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,100
Spartacus holds no belief in them.

526
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,200
I pray this night they prove me wrong.

527
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,100
Dominus, it takes time to master technique.

528
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,670
I well know it can swell frustration.

529
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:18,400
My frustrations lie not with myself.

530
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,010
Dominus? If I have done something to offend...

531
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:26,890
The only offense lies in what you do not do.

532
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,230
You hold back in your assault.

533
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,550
Do you think I'm not worthy of it?

534
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,230
As the Senate believes me unworthy of a true command?

535
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,490
No, Dominus.

536
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,200
None stand more worthy of respect than you.

537
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,830
Then see it given.

538
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,430
Come at me.

539
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,990
As you would an opponent in the arena,

540
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,670
absent thought of mercy.

541
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,750
Father--

542
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,020
We all have lessons that must learned.

543
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,970
I would have this my final test.

544
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,310
And in its completion, knowledge that I am readied

545
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,810
to face those trained in your arts upon field of battle.

546
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,160
You ask me to kill you.

547
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,720
I command you to try.

548
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,560
Then you command my death.

549
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,390
If you're victorious, it will be at the cost of my life.

550
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,810
If you fall to my sword, my life is equally forfeit.

551
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,490
Tiberius. Bear witness.

552
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,340
If Hilarus strikes me down

553
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,930
he's to be rewarded with his freedom

554
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:25,350
and ten thousand denarii.

555
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,840
You cannot be serious.

556
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,480
A man's true enemy is doubt.

557
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,400
A thing I would not carry into battle against Spartacus.

558
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,300
Make choice.

559
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:39,500
Or fall where you stand.

560
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,730
Your will, Dominus.

561
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,220
My hands.

562
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,420
First and second garrison ride to join the legion.

563
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,920
Spartacus does not hold the numbers for decisive victory.

564
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,820
What is his mind in such attack?

565
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,460
Let us see his skull split open,

566
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:13,690
and read his fucking thoughts upon the ground--

567
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,800
Spartacus.

568
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,370
Fall back.

569
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,480
Stay together.

570
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,400
You must stop this.

571
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,790
He has given command.

572
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,520
It must be obeyed.

573
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:13,910
Come on!

574
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,670
We must see you to safety.

575
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,910
I will not fucking turn from him again.

576
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,730
Seize reason. We will return with more men

577
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,560
and see Spartacus to his fate.

578
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,200
Don't let them away!

579
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:00,960
Go!

580
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:40,120
You were waiting...

581
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:44,680
for me to think you'd made misstep I warned you of...

582
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,620
Knowledge and patience.

583
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:49,900
The only counter to greater skill.

584
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,170
You have been well schooled.

585
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,780
Know that your service

586
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,320
will not pass unremembered.

587
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:12,360
The coin I promised had you bested me

588
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,530
shall be set towards monument

589
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,290
to the storied gladiator Hilarus.

590
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:24,350
It has been the greatest of honors to have served you, Dominus.

591
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,230
The honor was mine.

592
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:47,480
Fucking savages have blocked us from egress.

593
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,610
Take shelter here.

594
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:51,340
I will not fall trapped as fucking animal.

595
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,190
Your cause is lost.

596
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,380
The mistake is mine.

597
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,650
In not foreseeing you would attack in the night,

598
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:00,460
as the thieves and cutthroats you prove.

599
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,680
A mistake you shall not make again.

600
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,450
Name terms of surrender, and let us be done with this.

601
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,870
There are none I would trust a Roman to honor.

602
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:43,730
Gather their heads.

603
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:03,010
A most ill-fated turn.

604
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,450
And yet news of calamity does not end with their deaths.

605
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:09,220
Absent proper command, I fear Cossinius and Furius' men

606
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,040
will soon be scattered to the winds.

607
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:14,960
Yes it was most unfortunate their leaders fell before my arrival.

608
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,400
Even more unfortunate that your messenger appears

609
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,960
to have taken routes that passed so near the rebel encampment.

610
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:25,790
Give plain voice.

611
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,480
If you're of a mind.

612
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:36,910
Let us move from clouded past and turn eye towards pressing future.

613
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,290
Sole command and charge to bring Spartacus

614
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,360
to deserved end is now yours.

615
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:46,640
Along with title of Imperator, if you so wish it.

616
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:52,070
I serve the glory of Rome.

617
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,540
As do we all.

618
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,740
You planned this.

619
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:08,620
From the moment Metellus offered command under Cossinius and Furius.

620
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:11,640
The House of Crassus bows to no one.

621
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,190
How did you know Spartacus would make attempt on their lives,

622
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:15,740
instead of fleeing when knowledge was gained

623
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:18,270
of your army advancing from Rome?

624
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,780
Because it is what I would have done.

625
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:34,230
Mummius and the last of the Romans flee to the west.

626
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:37,080
Sight of their leader's heads upon pike has broken fucking spirit.

627
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:39,540
Let us give chase, and see them all to equal fate.

628
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,430
We have won our victory.

629
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:44,350
I would see us far from here in advance of Crassus and his army.

630
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:47,360
The mighty Spartacus turns from unwinnable fight?

631
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:50,330
Our numbers have grown beyond wildest expectation.

632
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,470
Yet winter will soon be upon us.

633
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:57,630
To face hunger and cold as well as Crassus

634
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,300
would drag us to certain doom.

635
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:03,100
We must seek advantage of supplies and shelter.

636
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,990
One that can be defended if set upon,

637
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:06,800
until spring warms intent.

638
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:10,320
There is not a villa in all the lands that could hold so many.

639
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:13,100
No, there is not.

640
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,690
Only a city could hold us now.

641
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,250
And we shall tear one from the flesh of Rome,

642
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,700
and salt mortal wound

643
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:30,250
with With blood and death.

644
00:49:32,010 --> 00:50:30,250

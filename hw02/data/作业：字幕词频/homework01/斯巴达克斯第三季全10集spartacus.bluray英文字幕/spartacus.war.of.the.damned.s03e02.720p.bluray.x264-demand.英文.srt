6
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,690
Our numbers have grown beyond wildest expectation.

7
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,530
And winter will soon be upon us.

8
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,640
Resources of the Senate are drained by these conflicts.

9
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,910
There is one among us

10
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,570
who could fund endeavor from his own purse.

11
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,340
It would take considerable coin and effort

12
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,560
to raise such a force.

13
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,630
And in return you will be offered a command,

14
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,700
under Cossinius and Furius, of course.

15
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,560
I begin to question turning from the calm of the ocean breeze,

16
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,380
and the safety of my city's walls in Sinuessa en Valle.

17
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,500
Their terms are agreeable.

18
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,260
Father.

19
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,910
Spartacus, this one carried a message.

20
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:37,990
You planned this.

21
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,050
It speaks of hope that word finds them safe

22
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,100
within the villa.

23
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,720
Sole command and charge to bring Spartacus

24
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,840
to deserved end is now yours.

25
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,360
There isn't a villa in all the land

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,430
that could hold such numbers.

27
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,550
No, there is not.

28
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,240
Only a city could hold us now.

29
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,290
Not as easy as butchering a horse, is it?

30
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,950
Their kick is considerably more gentle.

31
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,670
Diotimus.

32
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,820
Spartacus summons you.

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,390
The southern coast?

34
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,800
It will force Crassus' army to march much greater distance to meet us,

35
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,930
sapping strength and supplies.

36
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,230
But will we not stand as drained at journey's end?

37
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,020
The comfort of city walls will see us revived.

38
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,630
A thing denied Crassus.

39
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,630
Diotimus.

40
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,460
I would have your counsel.

41
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,830
Apologies...

42
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,720
I am absent knowledge concerning strategies of war.

43
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,270
Yet you are well versed in other needs.

44
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,330
You spoke of a city protected by walls

45
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,300
and caressed by ocean's breeze.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,050
Ah...Sinuessa en Valle.

47
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,730
Uh, home to me for many years...

48
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,380
Then you know of its defenses.

49
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,560
You would take the city?

50
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,960
Mmm, that path rests upon your words.

51
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,840
There are two gates.

52
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,440
The main one faces the hills to the west.

53
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,870
Open for trade during light of day, secured as sun retires.

54
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,070
And the other?

55
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,510
Set against cliffs,

56
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,160
running up to the canyons of Melia Ridge.

57
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,070
Impassable during winter months,

58
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,790
which are already upon its peak.

59
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,820
I would not find ourselves trapped there.

60
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:32,910
Nor I.

61
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,070
How stands the main gate?

62
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,080
Formidable, once sealed.

63
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,770
Could a few men from within see it opened, beneath cover of night?

64
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,370
It is well defended, and you would be absent means.

65
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,850
The Aedile feared weapons could be turned upon the guards,

66
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,910
ordered all of note locked within a storeroom near the gate.

67
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,120
We must give up sword upon entering?

68
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,660
Let us turn toward more favorable prospect.

69
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,440
Hold a moment...

70
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,160
I had dealings with a man during my travels,

71
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,580
who claimed the city his own.

72
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,030
Attius, a blacksmith by trade.

73
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:16,850
I know of him.

74
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,190
My dominus often spoke of his distaste for the man.

75
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,140
Can we lay trust in the Roman?

76
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,560
He stands Roman only by name.

77
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,080
Weigh his purse with enough coin

78
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,070
and he would call Thrace or Gaul his mother.

79
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,490
I would have you with me to break word.

80
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,270
I would join you.

81
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,770
Break camp and follow.

82
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,870
Remain unseen until called to purpose.

83
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,940
What of your brands?

84
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,410
If you are searched at the gate, effort will be short lived.

85
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,460
A point well made.

86
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,720
My fucking dominus holds sway with the Aedile.

87
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,200
Speak the name of Laurus towards meeting of trade,

88
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,110
stand chance of avoiding entanglement.

89
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,440
The next you greet him, it will be Laurus who kneels...

90
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,250
and calls you master.

91
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,150
Step forward!

92
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,170
That will do.

93
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,940
Give up weapons. Any weapons?

94
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,350
Step forward!

95
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,920
State business within Sinuessa en Valle.

96
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,880
We come for grain.

97
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,960
And all the pleasures your city has to offer...

98
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,850
Ah...you insult me.

99
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,770
By so light a palm.

100
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,980
Well...allow weighted apology...

101
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,380
I would have your brace, and the jewels upon it.

102
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,930
It is most treasured possession at this time.

103
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,110
I would not part with it.

104
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,770
Then turn from fucking gate.

105
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,630
Guards!

106
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,500
As you wish.

107
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,510
Oh, please inform Laurus that...

108
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,710
his guests will not be able to keep intended meeting, hmmm.

109
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,500
Wait.

110
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,110
Ah, give over weapons.

111
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,810
And grace ear of the man that Decimus saw you well treated.

112
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,540
Gratitude.

113
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,090
I shall see you well rewarded this day.

114
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,640
I understand your plight, Ulpianus,

115
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,680
but you must understand my husband's.

116
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,610
The Cilicians yet plague our waters

117
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,470
and Spartacus now assaults transport upon land.

118
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,470
The cost of grain --

119
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,720
-- soars beyond reason.

120
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,810
If I raise the price of my bread any further to cover loss,

121
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,530
I-I fear the crowd will turn upon me.

122
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,890
A matter to be taken up with my husband.

123
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,270
I would not ask if profit were my only concern, Laeta.

124
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,240
My wife is with child.

125
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,330
I will broach subject with him.

126
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,650
- Gratitude. - Hold sentiment until it is deserved.

127
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,880
I do not expect him to be moved.

128
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,880
Three denarii!

129
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,430
Yeah, fresh this morning!

130
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,860
This is the one you spoke of?

131
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,260
It is, Aedile.

132
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,670
I warned you shackle would not stand warning enough

133
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,590
after Diotimus slipped from grasp.

134
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,590
Words now heeded.

135
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,970
See it done.

136
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,470
And in grim wake,

137
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,160
post notice to quell further unpleasantness.

138
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,140
This way!

139
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,530
Stand up!

140
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,210
Come on.

141
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,840
Ennius.

142
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,230
Why are you not at the horreum?

143
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,560
I was delayed by young Ulpianus.

144
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,510
- He has implored me to broach - Now is place nor time.

145
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,250
Come on, get on with it!

146
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,690
By permission of honored Aedile,

147
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,640
I present yet another beloved slave

148
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,090
fallen to treacherous thought and whisper of rebellion.

149
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,850
And who would not fall to such beneath heel of a toad?

150
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,480
He was discovered secreting scraps of food

151
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,130
intended for journey far from these walls.

152
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,800
Laurus cannot be faulted for a dog turned to madness.

153
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,810
Show an animal kindness

154
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,120
and it will give loyalty until the heavens fall.

155
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,650
A journey that would lead to kinship

156
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,430
Show it nothing but the lash

157
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,170
with like mind of untold mischief towards the Republic...

158
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,500
and wonder not why it bears teeth.

159
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,700
Shackles alone no longer offer fair deterrent.

160
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,060
Let us add to them with warning of weighted stone

161
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,620
and the promise of death for any who dare follow in such regard.

162
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,290
Stop, and listen!

163
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,930
Make him suffer!

164
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,440
Finish that fucker!

165
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,360
Must make attempt to end this.

166
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,890
It would but pair our fate with his.

167
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,540
I will not stand idle

168
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,500
while the man's life holds in the balance--

169
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,880
Spartacus!

170
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,280
Spartacus!

171
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,680
Spartacus!

172
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,350
He will see your fucking Republic to blood and shit!

173
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,820
Spartacus!

174
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,360
Spartacus!

175
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,140
Spartacus!

176
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,800
- Spartacus! - See rebellious tongue forever stilled!

177
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,020
Spartacus!

178
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,610
Die!

179
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,440
With Spartacus that you will all gonna have to die!

180
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,300
Come on!

181
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,140
Throw!

182
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,190
Throw!

183
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,840
This is your time for retribution!

184
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,830
Die!

185
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,830
Throw more!

186
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,100
Yeah! Die!

187
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,770
Yeah!

188
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,410
Come on, throw!

189
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,860
You draw attention.

190
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,960
I but end suffering.

191
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,590
As I would for all so afflicted by festering disease of Rome.

192
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,370
Procure a cornicen for each centuria.

193
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,640
I would not have command obscured during battle.

194
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,820
And see tesserarius tripled in number.

195
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,880
Watch must be alert should Spartacus attack

196
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,380
under cover of darkness.

197
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,130
I will not be caught unawares as Cossinius and Furius.

198
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,180
Another message from Senator Metellus.

199
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,920
The man threatens to bury us beneath a storm of parchment.

200
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,220
The Senate grows anxious for our troops to move

201
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,890
from Field of Mars in pursuit of Spartacus.

202
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,940
They are not alone in such thought.

203
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,340
Mmm, there are yet needs to be attended.

204
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,420
How stand we on account of arma?

205
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,320
Sabinus and I have procured what was requested.

206
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,890
You will be well pleased.

207
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,040
Let us weigh the worth of your labor,

208
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,220
set achievement to scale.

209
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,100
You have exceeded expectation.

210
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,430
He will recognize value of all your efforts.

211
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,930
And who most deserves highest command beneath him.

212
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,180
Vulcan himself could not have forged

213
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,820
more glorious arma towards noble cause.

214
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,540
It's a rare thing... for such blasphemy

215
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,500
to be proven in execution of skill.

216
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,090
I stand humbled by the praise of Crassus.

217
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,990
A straighten back, and see words follow towards honest price.

218
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,550
Ninety denarii.

219
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,200
My-my finest offering.

220
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,650
And cost of less divine spectacle?

221
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,650
One hundred and twenty denarii per soldier, fully equipped.

222
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,330
As agreed upon by your noble son.

223
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,590
A fair price.

224
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,190
Apologies, Dominus.

225
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,050
He has arrived.

226
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,460
Your terms are agreeable.

227
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,640
Tiberius will conclude our business.

228
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,790
Yes, of course, gratitude --

229
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,990
Did I not tell you?

230
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,050
There now stands nothing between you and deserved title.

231
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,470
Am I to be kept waiting entire fucking day?

232
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,380
If that is my husband's wish.

233
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,780
Well, one he shall not see granted.

234
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Caesar!

235
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,210
Your men forget themselves.

236
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,760
You are the one that has lost mind.

237
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,630
Leave us.

238
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,880
She never did care for me.

239
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,380
Have you ever given her reason?

240
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,960
My apologies for not worshipping her as Juno upon cloud.

241
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,340
I would fall to my own wife, too long from my arms.

242
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,860
Cornelia has been sent word of your delay.

243
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,740
Delay?

244
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,810
Is that what you term setting upon me as I return through city gate,

245
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:09,140
in advance of bath or fresh robe to erase hard journey?

246
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,250
I term it necessity.

247
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,860
Your victories abroad are well known.

248
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,200
As is your insolence

249
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,300
in waging battle against the allies

250
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,640
of Mithridates absent proconsuls' permission.

251
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,020
The province would have been lost

252
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,810
if I had waited on word from those sodden fools.

253
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,980
Ah, as I would've lost advantage of lone voice upon ear,

254
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,260
if I had waited to break word with you.

255
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,140
Speak plainly.

256
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,060
I grow tired of mystery.

257
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,210
Ah, then let us part veil.

258
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:48,370
You hold revered name of the Julian clan.

259
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,490
Sired from the bloodline of Venus.

260
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,670
Divine mother of Aeneas, forbearer of Romulus,

261
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,310
exalted founder of Rome --

262
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,740
I require no lesson in my fucking heritage.

263
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,640
Then perhaps one in mine.

264
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,520
I am descendant from no god.

265
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,010
Nor man of lofty note.

266
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,730
I'm tolerated within the Senate

267
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,940
solely for the wealth I have amassed

268
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,940
through labor and dealings

269
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,550
those with "Proper" Lineage deem beneath them.

270
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:22,090
And you believe this singular cause why they hate you, hmm?

271
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,150
Your campaign against Mithridates

272
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,160
and um other adventures.

273
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,990
Costly, were they not?

274
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,980
I know you stand in considerable debt.

275
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,260
A dangerous place for a man to find himself,

276
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:48,100
when he's made enemies of the "Sodden fools"

277
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,370
who would see him to ruin.

278
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,110
Ah, I shall see it repaid.

279
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,250
By what means?

280
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,880
You possess name absent wealth.

281
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,130
And you possess wealth absent name.

282
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,380
Imagine what could be wrested from highest perch,

283
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:11,900
were Crassus and Caesar to align themselves.

284
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,890
My name has remained constant

285
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,150
since falling from my mother's womb.

286
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,970
You have been heavy with gold for equal years.

287
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,950
Why now suggest the pairing?

288
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,910
Opportunity to seize laurels and the gratitude

289
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,690
of the Republic presents itself.

290
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,690
And with it, first stone upon the road to greater glories.

291
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,830
What would you have me aid you in,

292
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,860
to see such a day hastened?

293
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,220
Bring end to slave rebellion.

294
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,050
And death of Spartacus.

295
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,140
Attius.

296
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,620
I would have words, you fucking goat.

297
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,920
Jupiter fuck me!

298
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,700
Have you lost wit coming here, you mad shit?

299
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,490
You are branded an enemy of Rome.

300
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,890
I was told you hold no love for the Republic.

301
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,160
Tell me you have not brought

302
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,150
the Bringer of Fucking Piss and Shit to my very door?

303
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,780
Your legend precedes you.

304
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,930
I bring but opportunity.

305
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,090
One that you may profit greatly from,

306
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,270
if you are of a mind.

307
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,990
It would have to be very considerable,

308
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,890
to outweigh risk of association dragging me to depths.

309
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,390
A river shall flow in its wake,

310
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,700
if we find ourselves lighted upon favorable shore.

311
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,550
What would such a journey require?

312
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,990
Your skill, towards the fashioning of swords.

313
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,680
Swords?

314
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,560
The fucking Aedile denies me the crafting of weapons,

315
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,100
blame laid on fear of your rebellion.

316
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,390
All that is struck now are fucking

317
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,470
tools and shackles,

318
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,920
to keep the slaves of those privileged fucks in hand.

319
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,860
The Aedile will not be of concern.

320
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,970
How many would you need?

321
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,040
Two will see our needs met.

322
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,350
You give coin enough for many times what you ask.

323
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,560
The balance towards your discretion.

324
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,030
And what purpose will silent tongue not speak of?

325
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,030
Do we have agreement?

326
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:45,040
Two swords, and an end to involvement.

327
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,170
Return as sun falls.

328
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,980
I would linger,

329
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,740
and recall joyous times with trusted friend.

330
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,480
I hold concern for the Roman.

331
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,530
Let us hope the weight of coin anchors him to purpose.

332
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,930
Rejoin Agron.

333
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,280
Make preparations.

334
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,740
When moon is at its highest, we shall see gate raised.

335
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,060
And fucking city fall to deserved fate.

336
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,700
Attius.

337
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,930
My appetite swells.

338
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,000
Where would I find holdings of grain

339
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,710
within Sinuessa's walls?

340
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,040
The finest quality.

341
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,200
From the fields of Sicilia.

342
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,280
I have mind towards large acquisition.

343
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,950
Ah, I'll seal that for you.

344
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,450
Apologies.

345
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,320
My husband concludes business...

346
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,640
No pressing concern until moon greets night.

347
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,070
You stand well supplied.

348
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,360
Shipment received this day from Sicilia,

349
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,250
with another to arrive upon the Kalends.

350
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,380
Although most of that has already been purchased by Crassus.

351
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,390
Marcus Crassus?

352
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,530
He favors our stores above all others.

353
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,920
And one of the few that can yet afford cost,

354
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,290
ever rising in light of events concerning the rebel Spartacus.

355
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:30,370
Have heard of the distress he has caused the Republic, in my travels.

356
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,960
What brings you to Sinuessa en Valle?

357
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Slaves.

358
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,620
I find myself with ever expanding family of them,

359
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,350
and would ensure they are well provided for.

360
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,100
You have thought toward housing them in the city?

361
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,380
It has crossed mind.

362
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,060
If you wish to see them any form of comfort,

363
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,760
I would strike from such.

364
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,000
I witnessed a slave stoned in the marketplace.

365
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,460
A common occurrence?

366
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,280
No.

367
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,720
Yet I fear it will become so,

368
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,220
if this matter of rebellion is not soon concluded.

369
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,870
Let us pray, then.

370
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,930
For the proper end to it.

371
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,600
He at last frees himself.

372
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,410
You were at the stoning this morning, were you not?

373
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,310
I was present at unfortunate spectacle.

374
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,390
And ended it prematurely.

375
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,590
Gratitude.

376
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,320
The crowd pressed towards frenzy.

377
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,950
I would not see more blood spilled absent cause.

378
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,240
Nor I.

379
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,140
Absent cause.

380
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,320
Bring knife to bear upon beard.

381
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,380
Why do you pause in the face of command?

382
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,520
She but obeys a higher one.

383
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,960
The dominus orders you to remain unshorn.

384
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,670
Toward what purpose?

385
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,080
His thoughts are his own in such regard.

386
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,170
And what are yours?

387
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,800
I do not understand.

388
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,780
It is a simple question.

389
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,670
What are your thoughts?

390
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,320
Towards what subject?

391
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,920
The one that stands before you.

392
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,820
How do you gauge Caesar?

393
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,770
I do not know him,

394
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,920
and can form no opinion of worth.

395
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,050
Demand any question,

396
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,330
and he shall break answer to aid you.

397
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,740
You are taken with wife?

398
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,750
Your eyes stand as my wife's.

399
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,910
As does taste upon lips.

400
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,900
I would be reminded of her in shadow's touch.

401
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,420
Eyes shut towards difference...

402
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:31,940
and warmed by longing remembrance...

403
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,000
Kore.

404
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,170
Remove yourself.

405
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,460
Yes, Dominus.

406
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,290
You send gift of wine and warm embrace,

407
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,180
only to snatch away--

408
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,530
She was not sent for your fucking pleasure.

409
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,080
Apologies.

410
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,010
I did not know the girl held meaning.

411
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,220
You've been away too long from civilized company.

412
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,800
See yourself to robe,

413
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,550
and thoughts towards more pressing matters.

414
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,330
You present yourself with breasts and ass

415
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,450
formed with morning dew.

416
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,160
Is it wonder that a man strong of desire

417
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,190
would not be tempted to taste such ripe offering?

418
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,220
Take lesson and remove yourself from fucking sight.

419
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,690
Yes, Domina.

420
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,050
We have not yet procured enough horses.

421
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,340
I will not have cavalry found lacking in moment of need.

422
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,340
What has happened?

423
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,350
Nothing of concern, apologies.

424
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:50,390
Break words, and find comfort in how they are received.

425
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,320
I was attending Caesar as commanded...

426
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,050
Caesar?

427
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,570
Gaius Julius Caesar?

428
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,990
He laid hands upon me.

429
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,700
If your father had not appeared, I...

430
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,420
Where is he?

431
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,640
The man we hunt...

432
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,140
was a champion at the arena,

433
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,990
to rival any in the Republic.

434
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,170
Yet only a gladiator, regardless of skill.

435
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,920
How has he bested our legions?

436
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,100
Spartacus knows of war,

437
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,780
and the waging of it from his days in Thrace.

438
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,340
If rumor is true,

439
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,010
he fought among the auxiliary beneath the fool Glaber

440
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:33,780
before his fall of Vesuvius.

441
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,910
Then he's familiar with our tactics.

442
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,670
And has used such knowledge to the regret of those that have pressed him.

443
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,150
He believes he knows what a "Proper" Roman soldier will do.

444
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,500
A thing that could be turned toward advantage.

445
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,550
Would that my own blood stood now so sharp of mind.

446
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,870
Ah, years and the taste of battle

447
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,550
will hone your pup's teeth.

448
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,210
Of that I have little doubt.

449
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,590
Yet to bring Spartacus to ground I must have a wolf at my side.

450
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:09,530
And let us turn gleaming fang towards moon of full purpose,

451
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,600
and see blood and gore matted upon fur.

452
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,860
Curfew! Inside please.

453
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,120
Make your way indoors!

454
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,420
Curfew! Move, move.

455
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,210
Move along!

456
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,430
Off the streets!

457
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,500
You move along!

458
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,840
Clear these streets!

459
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,890
Messalina!

460
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,860
She has a habit of running wild.

461
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,140
Here.

462
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,850
You stay close to your mother.

463
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,030
Gratitude.

464
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,170
You inside.

465
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:01,910
You there.

466
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,020
I laid eyes upon you in the square this morning,

467
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,110
- did I not? - As I upon you.

468
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,210
Word has reached ear you spoke my name

469
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,380
upon entering gate, claiming business.

470
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,280
I fear you have been misled.

471
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,610
You have nothing I find of worth.

472
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,270
Then why are you within these walls?

473
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,580
Remove hand.

474
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,220
What is your purpose here?

475
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:35,000
Put question to honored husband, and have reply.

476
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:36,770
He trades with the Aedile?

477
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:37,670
He does.

478
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,490
The mistake is mine, then.

479
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,810
See yourself from the streets before nightfall,

480
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,570
to avoid further misunderstanding.

481
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,820
Come along!

482
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,270
Apologies.

483
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,970
I assure you, not all in the city stand as him.

484
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,350
What he spoke of, removing myself from the streets...?

485
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,880
Is it not troublesome?

486
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,660
I made attempt to dissuade my husband,

487
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,600
but he thought it best to have streets cleared

488
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,780
of all but city guard,

489
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,710
until the rebellion has been quelled.

490
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,990
You have a place to call your own this night?

491
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,900
Yes.

492
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,270
I have my eye towards such.

493
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,060
Move inside!

494
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,290
All streets are to be cleared!

495
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,540
Curfew is in affect!

496
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,670
A little more securer this time!

497
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,830
The streets cleared by guards?

498
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,760
By command of the Aedile.

499
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,300
Did you know of this?

500
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:10,860
Fuck yourself.

501
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,160
News greets me with shared ear.

502
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,530
Trust these will service need.

503
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,690
They will.

504
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,870
Yet there is more we must ask of you now.

505
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,300
I thought as much.

506
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,570
Two hundred denarii a piece,

507
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,680
and you may lay hidden here until sun crests

508
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,110
and curfew is lifted.

509
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,820
It is not sleep we seek.

510
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,500
What deformity of mind do you think I suffer from,

511
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,950
that I would give further aid to enemies of Rome?

512
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,130
We find ourselves heavy with Roman coin.

513
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,910
What cost would sober intent?

514
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:09,520
Five thousand denarii would see me far from this city,

515
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,480
and shores of fucking Republic.

516
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,440
A bargain well struck.

517
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,640
Call me Roman no more, then!

518
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,180
How many more swords do you need?

519
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,100
Those that join us are well armed.

520
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,500
Join you?

521
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,840
You move to take the fucking city?!

522
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,380
We move to liberate it.

523
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,670
The gate stands only in our path.

524
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:37,780
We would to slit throats in the night and see it raised.

525
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,010
Unexpected curfew presents difficulty

526
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,710
in reaching it unnoticed.

527
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,680
City guard would raise clamor well in advance --

528
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,680
I cannot aid you in this.

529
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,170
It would mean my life.

530
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,020
You have forged weapons for Spartacus himself.

531
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,820
If we are discovered with your craft clutched in hand,

532
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,590
then they will send you to the afterlife all the same.

533
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,700
Fuck the gods.

534
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,430
What would you have of me?

535
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,050
Gently.

536
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:35,090
I should not have content fall to ruin by rough use.

537
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,740
Go fetch the rest.

538
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,670
See that they are careful.

539
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:47,570
You would see me weighted with unnecessary comforts.

540
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,760
Have I grown that heavy?

541
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,180
These are yours?

542
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,960
I would not be found wanting,

543
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,500
if campaign stretches beyond expectation.

544
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,730
You wish to join me, in pursuit of Spartacus?

545
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,670
I wish no such thing.

546
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,980
Yet I will not be removed from your arms

547
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,170
for months threatening years.

548
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,610
Publius and I shall travel with you and Tiberius.

549
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,440
You know women are forbidden within encampment.

550
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,880
Yet they are not banned from followers' camp,

551
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:17,470
unless rules have shifted absent knowledge.

552
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,700
I would not have my family bedded among slaves and whores.

553
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,160
Is it not better solution

554
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,590
than having them stricken from embrace?

555
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,660
Desire much appreciated.

556
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,990
Yet I could not stay mind from thought of your safety,

557
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,620
placed so near the enemy.

558
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,410
I would have you remain here,

559
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,620
far from the threat of death war so often promises.

560
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,140
Is that sole reason?

561
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,270
Father.

562
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,960
All has been attended.

563
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,680
Your army stands ready to march upon first light.

564
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,390
News well received.

565
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,670
I would have word.

566
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:09,870
There yet lingers issue of what title I shall hold.

567
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,860
I am possessed of leanings towards the matter.

568
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,610
Morning sun shall see them fall to place.

569
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,460
Have these returned from where they sprang.

570
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,410
I would have house in order before we take leave from it.

571
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,320
I thought honored position all but mine.

572
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,090
Now I fear he favors another.

573
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,430
Then you stand as your mother,

574
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,460
bound by blood and inconsiderate worth.

575
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,260
It is a thing of rare beauty.

576
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,150
Is it not?

577
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,950
Yes, Dominus.

578
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,490
You will carry it when you face Spartacus?

579
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,980
I shall carry my father's sword.

580
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,610
It is not as well bred or considered as this...

581
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,160
yet it holds deeper meaning.

582
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,920
Caesar will carry it then?

583
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,190
As your word and will?

584
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:23,090
I should not have placed you within his reach.

585
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,460
He is a man of base needs.

586
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:28,020
Then why honor him with title, that above your son?

587
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,560
Apologies, I overstep.

588
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,380
You speak your heart.

589
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,400
I know your concern for the boy.

590
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,860
He no longer stands as such.

591
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,310
But in the eyes of his father.

592
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,870
Would my wife could voice such simple wisdom.

593
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,790
I saw the gathering of trunks.

594
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,420
She goes with you?

595
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,450
It was her intent.

596
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:01,940
Yet I would find no comfort in her presence.

597
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,020
As I would in yours...

598
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,240
Is such a thing possible?

599
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:13,760
I will be forced to place you within followers' camp.

600
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,670
But yes, it is possible.

601
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,250
If you so desire it.

602
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,590
Yes, Dominus.

603
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,800
I do not pose question as master,

604
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,260
but as a man.

605
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,710
And would have answer as one.

606
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,530
Yes.

607
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:40,360
It is something I desire, Marcus.

608
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,350
Fuck my ass...

609
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,730
Quickly!

610
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,880
We must gather more men and swords!

611
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,190
Spartacus is here!

612
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,770
The moon nears its peak.

613
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:01,060
Yet fucking gate stands firmly rooted.

614
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,140
They will see it raised.

615
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,990
Or fall in attempt.

616
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,010
Ready the others.

617
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,550
When gate trembles, death follows upon heel.

618
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,540
Spartacus is within our walls!

619
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,450
Move, come with me.

620
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,880
See gate protected!

621
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,650
You, open the storeroom!

622
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,770
Quickly!

623
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:44,550
Reward will surely find hands for this.

624
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,210
Of that I have no fucking doubt.

625
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,910
Attius! Raise the alarm --

626
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,840
Call for more men!

627
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,560
Hide yourself, I will find you when it is over!

628
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,850
See gate opened!

629
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,070
Clear the way!

630
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,170
Move!

631
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,630
Arm yourselves!

632
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,460
Forward towards the front gate!

633
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:54,670
Diotimus.

634
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,610
Where is Laurus?

635
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,230
I am here, slave.

636
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:09,580
You would turn against your dominus and join rebellion?

637
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,620
Fucking animals...

638
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,530
Diotimus.

639
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,830
The villa is taken.

640
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,650
See yourselves free.

641
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,830
Move.

642
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,160
My dominus...

643
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,010
He is dead?

644
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:53,310
Then I shall follow him to the afterlife...

645
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:56,830
and piss upon his shadow...

646
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,700
Ulpianus!

647
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,960
We flee to Melia Ridge,

648
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,480
if they have not already sealed escape.

649
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:24,640
Have you seen my husband...?

650
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,320
I have not, we must go.

651
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,210
I will follow once I find him.

652
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,980
May the gods protect you.

653
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,320
The Aedile.

654
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:35,020
Have you seen the Aedile?

655
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,530
You.

656
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,560
You aid Spartacus?

657
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,400
No.

658
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,880
I stand the man himself.

659
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,310
Caesar.

660
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,520
I had thought to find Crassus himself,

661
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,090
the tone so matching.

662
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,630
I am proud reflection of my father.

663
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,200
Tiberius?

664
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:28,000
Jupiter's fucking cock,

665
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,590
you were but a child since I last laid eyes.

666
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,930
Apologies.

667
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,800
I am for my own home before we march,

668
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,830
I did not wish to stain it with such business.

669
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,780
Years abroad led you to strange pleasures,

670
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,330
worthy of the beast you appear.

671
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,960
And your father... he's not spoken to you of this?

672
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:00,980
He finds himself preoccupied with more pressing concerns.

673
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,840
Well, I'm certain he will share confidence.

674
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:05,720
When he deems you deserving.

675
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:10,320
You think I am not?

676
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:14,280
Sleep well, young master.

677
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,090
And dream of future glories.

678
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:18,670
Under my command.

679
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:18,200
Sanus.

680
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,910
Please, let my wife live!

681
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,580
The city is taken.

682
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,520
See the Romans that yet live to chains.

683
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,600
Chains?

684
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,300
You let them live?

685
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,660
They pose no threat.

686
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,400
Nor fucking use.

687
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:41,590
Would they show mercy if we were beneath heel?

688
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,150
Still, cunt!

689
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:50,540
Spartacus!

690
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:52,720
The Aedile bars himself in the horreum,

691
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,150
spilling pitch and threatens to put light to bear.

692
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:57,030
Come.

693
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,790
I will not lend aid to you and your animals.

694
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:03,290
If grain is put to fire,

695
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:08,290
even I will not have voice to calm my "Animals."

696
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,230
You will do this,

697
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:14,450
or see your people that yet live fall from this world.

698
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:21,920
- Please. - Stay still!

699
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:48,830
You will not have my city's heart!

700
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:49,840
Kill them!

701
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:52,630
Kill them! Fuck the Roman man!

702
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,360
Make attempt on gate and I will for all to torch,

703
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,410
you fucking cunts!

704
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:02,850
I can take him...

705
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,220
Agron!

706
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:06,520
Lower spear.

707
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,140
Laeta...

708
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,790
Kill them all!

709
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,680
Go to him.

710
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,920
And pray your words hold meaning.

711
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,880
Don't listen to his words!

712
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,940
He's the reason we suffered!

713
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,870
I thought you dead.

714
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,440
You would place our fate in her fucking hands.

715
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:35,210
I place it in what I believe in.

716
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,820
I yet live, among a clutch of others.

717
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,600
How many?

718
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:41,930
Too few.

719
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,420
And we will be fewer still, if you do not stop this.

720
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,310
You would give them all we have worked for?

721
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:50,150
I would see no more death this night.

722
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:55,350
Open gate, let us see sun crest upon another day.

723
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:57,370
I will not bow to fucking slaves!

724
00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:01,320
Turn thought from them, and towards your people.

725
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,570
If you do this,

726
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:06,900
you will condemn them all to the afterlife.

727
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:09,430
Your wife among them...

728
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,830
Oh, no!

729
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,670
He would have opened the gate!

730
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:43,230
I know he would of.

731
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:45,600
He would have opened the gate for me.

732
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,360
I could not place faith in it.

733
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:59,980
We have had our fill of blood and vengeance this night.

734
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:05,180
No Roman that yet draws breath shall suffer further harm.

735
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:08,960
The city is ours!

736
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,230
The city is free!

737
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,330
Once again the Romans fall!

738
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,110
Victory!

739
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:27,480
To see one loved robbed of life is a heavy thing.

740
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:31,940
One done lightly by Romans many times to me.

741
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:34,010
It is no balm,

742
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,900
but know that I carry the full weight of your loss.

743
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,230
Place her in chains.

744
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:51,830
War often carries with it great sacrifice.

745
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,930
None more keenly felt

746
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,890
than threat of those one holds closest to heart

747
00:49:57,890 --> 00:49:59,870
struck from this world.

748
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,890
I would not have my son fall to such a fate

749
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:08,050
because he was not ready for command.

750
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:12,390
Nor would I deny him opportunity,

751
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:15,380
to prove himself a man in his father's eyes.

752
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:25,510
You stand as my word and my will.

753
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,110
You honor me, father.

754
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:34,090
As I shall honor the name of Crassus.

755
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,760
Ride with Caesar and men of your choosing.

756
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:40,320
Seek out Mummius and what remains of Cossinius' legion.

757
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:43,220
Find Spartacus and send word of his movement,

758
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:45,040
but do not tempt engagement

759
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,480
until I have arrived with proper force.

760
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:58,640
You fill the air with lofty promise,

761
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,630
only to command I bow to a fucking boy?!

762
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:06,460
He is my son!

763
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,560
And shall be treated with mirrored respect!

764
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,840
I have spread coin towards your election as Military Tribune.

765
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:24,800
Formal title Tiberius is yet too young to hold.

766
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,790
Wear my token to pass unmolested through encampment,

767
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:33,520
until appearance is shorn to Roman likeness.

768
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:38,150
I would prefer fancy sword and expected position.

769
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:40,870
Stay upon path I have set,

770
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,820
and see greater glories bestowed at journey's end.

771
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,460
Sound horn!

772
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:03,210
We advance south on Spartacus and those who follow him in rebellion!

773
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,770
Let our shadow fall upon them...

774
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:08,490
and every man, woman, and child

775
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,400
so touched by it struck from this world

776
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:15,580
by the might and glory of Rome!

777
00:52:18,950 --> 00:53:15,580

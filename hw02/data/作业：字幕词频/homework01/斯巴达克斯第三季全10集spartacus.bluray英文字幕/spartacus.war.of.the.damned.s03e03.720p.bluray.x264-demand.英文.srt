6
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,360
We advance south on Spartacus and those who follow him in rebellion.

7
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,980
Let our shadow fall upon them and every man,

8
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,150
woman and child so touched by it, struck from this world.

9
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,500
A bargain well struck.

10
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,300
Call me Roman no more then.

11
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,210
Those that join us are well armed.

12
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,360
You move to take the fucking city.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,180
You honor me, father.

14
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,400
Find Spartacus and send word of his movement.

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,660
But do not tempt engagement until I have arrived with proper force.

16
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,840
The Aedile bars himself in the horreum,

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,610
spilling pitch and threatens to put light to bear.

18
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,070
No!

19
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,430
The city, is ours.

20
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,700
Swords born from shackles.

21
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,220
Your hands turn miracle, Attius.

22
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,390
Then perhaps you would bless them with additional coin,

23
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,260
in reward for such divinity.

24
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,030
Knowing effort serves higher purpose is reward enough.

25
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,280
You chew on fresh bargain, only to swallow stale shit.

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,260
Suck cock, you long-haired woman.

27
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,900
Aid Gannicus, in delivery of latest offering to Crixus.

28
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,560
Should you linger within our city,

29
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,210
we shall discuss terms of future benefit.

30
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,650
I do not lay trust in that little shit.

31
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,590
You do not lay trust in anyone.

32
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,300
You come with me!

33
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,810
More so when they carry name of Rome.

34
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,380
- Ah, go! - Silent cunt!

35
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,220
Lugo.

36
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,220
How fare our prisoners?

37
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,180
They fucking shit themselves!

38
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,680
A smell welcome to nose!

39
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,280
See that they are fed.

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,740
These prisoners? We take them where?

41
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,800
I question thought of keeping them shackled throughout fucking streets.

42
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,170
Is that all you question?

43
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,920
We are at war, Spartacus.

44
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,290
I would see our enemy struck to the afterlife.

45
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,260
Women and children counted among them?

46
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,900
Were the same not robbed of life in escape from Batiatus' villa?

47
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,940
Or the taking of this very city?

48
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:58,930
They were.

49
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,590
Yet few that remain pose no fall to concern.

50
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,100
They pose concern to fucking stomach.

51
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,240
Drawing from our food --

52
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,030
which runs low from Aedile dousing pitch upon grain.

53
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,920
Let us gauge our stores.

54
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,490
And turn from thought of needless slaughter.

55
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,730
Keep eye upon your opponent.

56
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,940
Seek to turn defense into attack.

57
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,340
More steel, forged towards purpose.

58
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,970
He has been paid what Spartacus promised,

59
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,500
for aiding taking the city?

60
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,300
Five thousand denarii.

61
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,320
Well earned.

62
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,270
Then why does he yet darken presence within our walls?

63
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,580
Give answer. I'm not fucking echo.

64
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,590
To further lend hand to your cause.

65
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,570
The promise of gathering more coin

66
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,140
before taking leave also weighs consideration.

67
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,240
Naevia! Nasir!

68
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,070
See those of skill to proper weapon.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,150
For your journey.

70
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,650
I wake with desire for cock.

71
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,070
Yet you from bed.

72
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,650
Cause bring fucking shadow.

73
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,830
The girl follows heel like errant pup,

74
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,280
since I took her master's life.

75
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,080
Clear a fucking path.

76
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,610
Keep moving!

77
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,320
Against the wall!

78
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,260
Sit here!

79
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,800
And shut mouth!

80
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,380
Your wife is with child.

81
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,750
She should not be absent nourishment.

82
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,290
Gratitude.

83
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,340
You mistake intent.

84
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,410
I do not offer charity,

85
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,210
I offer exchange.

86
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,720
Bread,

87
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,260
for whatever coin you may know of yet undiscovered.

88
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,560
Perhaps within walls of your own little hovel?

89
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,090
Two streets west of the horreum.

90
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,460
The name Ulpianus the above door.

91
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,380
Inside, leg of table stands hollow.

92
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,590
You will find all that I have there.

93
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,890
Any more offerings?

94
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,030
No?

95
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,140
Very well then.

96
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,820
Wait.

97
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,240
The bread. For my wife...

98
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,580
Ah. Apologies.

99
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,410
Who's more hungry?

100
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,940
Do you wish to see blood?

101
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,960
Someone will starve!

102
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,720
You cunt!

103
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,990
Do you desire blood?

104
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,650
Yeah!! Yeah!

105
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,330
Then let us have proper contest!

106
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,980
Bring swords!

107
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,270
I know that one.

108
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,210
Ulpianus, a baker of breads.

109
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,040
He is no fighter, nor man of distant heart.

110
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,940
We fall to fucking games now?

111
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,530
The Romans forced you and Crixus to such, for their amusement.

112
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,270
We but return favor.

113
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,730
I beg you... I have no skill in this.

114
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,590
Oh, he has no skill in this.

115
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,360
This is Roman cunt!

116
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,890
Let the victor, claim their bounty!

117
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,630
And the sea the fallen,

118
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:10,290
to join the Roman dead which we have swept from this city!

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,610
No!

120
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,040
Begin.

121
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,830
Go! Begin!

122
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,480
Get at him!

123
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,220
Draw blood!

124
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,520
Ulpianus!

125
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,050
Ulpianus!

126
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,840
Come on! Get at him!

127
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,840
No, Ulpianus!

128
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,690
A fight far from worthy arena.

129
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,500
But promise was made.

130
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,600
Yeah!

131
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,410
Feast upon laurels.

132
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,100
You fucking shit...

133
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,180
He reached for sword to strike when you presented back!

134
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,790
He was reaching for the food, you mad cunt!

135
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,470
Hold tongue,

136
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,020
or see it ripped from fucking head.

137
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,300
Take pause, brother.

138
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,460
Attius stands with us.

139
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,510
He stands a fucking Roman.

140
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,320
The man has never raised voice in anger, to slave, or any other.

141
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,550
How do your friends differ,

142
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,980
from the fucking villain they brand me?

143
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,910
Was he reaching for the bread?

144
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,430
I did not think it.

145
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,900
And what if you were mistaken?

146
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,010
The result the same.

147
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,730
A Roman that shall never raise hand against us.

148
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,660
I have never held love for any of such name,

149
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,180
- yet he held no threat -- - Men such as him hold the greatest.

150
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,220
True intent, shrouded behind mask of kind and gentle face.

151
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,980
Have you known his reflection?

152
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,430
Before I came to the mines of Lucania.

153
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,160
This one carried gentle name of Herius.

154
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,400
Husband.

155
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,010
Father of two young daughters.

156
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,540
He saw me fed.

157
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,790
Bathed.

158
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,420
Allowed me to feel safe for the first time since being turned

159
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,310
from the House of Batiatus.

160
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,900
When his family took to sleep, he came to me.

161
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,190
Lifting me in his arms.

162
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,080
I thought it a dream at first.

163
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,790
There was a place,

164
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,550
removed from the grounds of his villa,

165
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,570
where wagons were crafted and repaired.

166
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,730
He applied his many tools inside me.

167
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,940
Before turning them to outward flesh.

168
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,620
I wish I had power to seize memory,

169
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,790
and with hands strip it from life.

170
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,260
It is not the one that shadows mind.

171
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,460
What I saw in morning light,

172
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,760
forever darkens thought.

173
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,630
The man himself,

174
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:09,560
greeting his wife with kiss and warm smile.

175
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,940
His daughters laughing upon his knee.

176
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,220
The beast from the previous night transformed,

177
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,230
into a man who held no threat.

178
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,690
I have no words.

179
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,690
You do not need them.

180
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,120
Knowing, you are at my side gives comfort enough.

181
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,390
I will always stand so.

182
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,520
All the fucking stalls bear same misfortune.

183
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,870
And of the remainder?

184
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,960
- How long will it see us fed? - Two weeks.

185
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,170
Perhaps more, if we're cautious

186
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,880
and our numbers do not swell.

187
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,580
Fuck the gods.

188
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,220
Spartacus.

189
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,670
Ships weigh anchor off our coast.

190
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,750
It seems we have drawn notice.

191
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,040
Sanus.

192
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,340
What do your eyes fall upon?

193
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,810
Four men approach. Armed.

194
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,380
One with cask perched atop shoulder.

195
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,230
Romans?

196
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,800
Not fucking likely, by appearance.

197
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,490
Raise the gate.

198
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,670
What shit is this?

199
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,680
Brigands of Cilicia.

200
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,110
Pirates?

201
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,950
I would speak with the man that has claimed this city.

202
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,420
Your words fall upon his ear.

203
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,970
What business do you break?

204
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,930
You are Spartacus?

205
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,510
I stand so named.

206
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,500
The same fiend that brought down the arena in Capua?

207
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,960
Defeated Glaber at Vesuvius?

208
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:26,090
Wrought untold suffering upon the Republic and its people.

209
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:29,200
All deeds claimed with pride.

210
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,950
Then I call you fucking brother!

211
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,640
Let us share gift of wine,

212
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,650
and break words towards common enemy!

213
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,690
Gaius!

214
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,750
It has been too many years.

215
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,810
They have been unkind to you, old friend.

216
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,130
At least I do not stand woolly fucking goat!

217
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,700
Crassus denies me sharpened blade.

218
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,060
Under what purpose?

219
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,590
A personal matter,

220
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,790
concerning only those within his confidence.

221
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,130
Regrettably none stand so here.

222
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,560
You have received message in advance of our arrival, Mummius?

223
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,720
We stand ready to march upon your command.

224
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,930
Have use of my tent until such a time.

225
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,440
Come!

226
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,810
I would leave these boys to their plotting

227
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,890
and hear of your adventures with Antonius.

228
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,900
Impudent shit.

229
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,920
He brushes you aside in favor of swallowing Caesar's cock.

230
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,380
Let us pray he chokes upon it.

231
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,670
Adherbal!

232
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,520
Break open cask so we may share drink.

233
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,030
I would break words in advance.

234
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,190
While mind is yet unclouded.

235
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,120
Heracleo is your guest,

236
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,480
and I am at your will.

237
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,080
It is an honor for me to be across from the man

238
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,330
who steals an entire fucking city!

239
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,590
It was the fucking Romans who stole freedom from us.

240
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,430
We merely seize what is owed.

241
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,350
I favor turn of your reason, brothers.

242
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,380
Some Romans yet live within Sinuessa?

243
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,300
A few.

244
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,160
The Aedile among them?

245
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,060
He does not.

246
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,090
- You are sure of this? - His villa now stands ours.

247
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,510
His claim to it severed by my own hand.

248
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,540
Then I too have been injured.

249
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,090
This man speaks in fucking riddles.

250
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,320
Straighten tongue,

251
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,990
or fall from presence.

252
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,240
The Aedile and I had an arrangement.

253
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,860
He brokered such with men of your calling?

254
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,720
Openly, no.

255
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,320
Yet many things are born of dark corners.

256
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,360
The seas are fraught with dangers...

257
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,980
especially for those who,

258
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,740
consider themselves his competitor.

259
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,230
In return for your "Services"?

260
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,730
Knowledge of time and route of unfortunate vessels.

261
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,390
All goods aboard, added to my own,

262
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,510
with the seal of the Aedile

263
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,790
pressed upon new manifest.

264
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,520
What cause does thief upon wave need of parchment and seal?

265
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,760
The official seal removes unwanted attention when

266
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,060
trading acquisitions in respected ports.

267
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,270
Advantage snatched from hand,

268
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,880
by fucking action of your own.

269
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,570
To shit with this grinning cunt.

270
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,550
- Agron. - What threat does he hold?

271
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,720
Pissing on us from the sea?

272
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,550
You would be surprised by the reach of my stream, boy.

273
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,080
Let's us take breath then,

274
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,970
remove ourselves from heated words.

275
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,270
There is yet drink to be had.

276
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,990
Return when sun gives way to moon.

277
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,310
And discover if there stands cause to share cup.

278
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,760
As you command, King Spartacus.

279
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,860
As you command.

280
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,840
The man swings cock to rival Jupiter himself.

281
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,640
Close gate upon ass, and be done with him.

282
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,420
He may yet be of use.

283
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,920
Find Aedile's seal,

284
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,730
and let us weigh advantage it brings.

285
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,680
Cilicians!

286
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,290
Shit rises to fill mouth.

287
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,710
Have you laid eyes upon it or not?

288
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,780
I forge steel, not trade at fucking ports.

289
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,240
What need would I have of Aedile's seal?

290
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,140
Words I would have greeted sooner.

291
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,610
Is that what it was like,

292
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,000
before you gained your freedom?

293
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,410
Were you made to fight as an animal would,

294
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,010
as you made poor Ulpianus?

295
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,530
- I prompted no contest. - Yet you did not stop it.

296
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,750
What fate did you believe

297
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,690
when deciding to aid in taking the city?

298
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,240
I held no fucking choice.

299
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,530
Every man holds such at time's end.

300
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,700
You hold no love for these people, Attius.

301
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,420
Do not now raise vaunted concerns now.

302
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,680
"These people."

303
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,390
Am I not Roman, as they were?

304
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,040
As some yet are?

305
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,540
You stand for yourself alone.

306
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,530
As I once stood.

307
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,170
You are proof then.

308
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,980
That basest clay

309
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,200
may yet be molded into something of worth.

310
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,580
Turn from past,

311
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,490
set eye toward new horizon,

312
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,330
far from this place and the man that you were.

313
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,270
Praise fucking gods, I've found men of worth.

314
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,330
What crude form do you deposit at feet?

315
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,590
Sinuessa.

316
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,490
Spartacus has taken Sinuessa en Valle.

317
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,350
Summon Mummius.

318
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,440
Wine.

319
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,360
Gratitude.

320
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,560
Repay favor with gift of words.

321
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,170
I have few of note.

322
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,960
We thought the gate secure.

323
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,630
Yet Spartacus is of the underworld,

324
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,210
able to spirit himself through wood and stone.

325
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,540
He is but a man.

326
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,650
I've laid eyes upon him.

327
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,440
Bathed in blood and gore.

328
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,510
The city trembling in his wake.

329
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,430
Spartacus is no man.

330
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,980
He's the Bringer of Death.

331
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,160
And yet you live.

332
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,260
Your skill in combat must equal

333
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,650
that of the legend himself.

334
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,520
I was paid but a few coin by the Aedile to aid in curfew.

335
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,070
- I'm no soldier. - Put such question aside.

336
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,430
How many men does Spartacus now hold?

337
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,680
I do not know.

338
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,540
The streets were filled with them, slaughtering all in their path.

339
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,380
I barely made escape to the bay before they took the docks.

340
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,380
Now it becomes clear.

341
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,410
In place of falling a hero,

342
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,200
you chose to flee.

343
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,750
And fall a coward.

344
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,370
Have you lost mind?

345
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,890
The man held no worth, by his own tongue.

346
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,520
You are not in fucking command.

347
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,950
Apologies.

348
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,590
I slip from reason...

349
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,160
when presented with the faults of lesser men.

350
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,970
Let us see body removed, and discuss--

351
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,140
The time for words has ended.

352
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,390
Break camp,

353
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,290
and return to my father with news of Spartacus.

354
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,700
He gave order to remain at your side.

355
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,930
I am the word and the will of Marcus Crassus.

356
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,580
You are not at my side, Gaius.

357
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,430
You serve beneath me.

358
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,680
I fall to command.

359
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,310
Gather what remains of your men.

360
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,790
We move for Sinuessa en Valle.

361
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,030
Leave us.

362
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,620
This stood my home.

363
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,040
No longer.

364
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,330
I will not beg for my life.

365
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,210
I do not seek it.

366
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,760
Only your aid.

367
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,930
You rob me of my husband.

368
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,290
Lay waste to my city.

369
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,860
And now you call upon fucking aid?

370
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,270
We are at war.

371
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,780
You and your people stand casualty.

372
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,590
My own ranks question sparing a few that yet draw breath.

373
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,610
I give chance to prove wisdom of it.

374
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,960
So we may live out our days

375
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,310
as party favors for your fucking amusement?

376
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,330
As word carries of Ulpianus?

377
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,570
Ulpianus?

378
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,970
Your men made him fight for crust of bread.

379
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,400
And claimed hand even though he stood victor.

380
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,540
A thing I did not know of.

381
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,330
It shall not pass again.

382
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,290
I took belief in your reassurance once before.

383
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,450
And now stand widow for it.

384
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,260
I do not turn from what I have done.

385
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,000
He was an honorable man!

386
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,660
Forever stricken from this world by you!

387
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,270
You elevate the dead beyond their worth.

388
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,590
You did not know him.

389
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,790
Nor I fear did you.

390
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,840
The name Heracleo holds meaning?

391
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,590
A plague upon the sea.

392
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,440
My husband devoted much coin toward his capture.

393
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,100
He devoted greater sum,

394
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,730
towards secret pact.

395
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,420
You lie.

396
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,350
Your husband provided seal of office

397
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,220
in exchange for dispatching of his rivals.

398
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,150
Presented to me by Heracleo himself.

399
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:41,740
Know that I do not take pleasure in staining cherished memory.

400
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,820
You tear world from grasp, and whisper of kindness.

401
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,830
I whisper of opportunity.

402
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,100
Heracleo seeks the Aedile's seal.

403
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,050
With it I will forge trade that will see us fed.

404
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,470
It eludes discovery.

405
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,210
You know of the seal's location?

406
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,590
Ennius feared rebellion,

407
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,930
and took measure to protect what was his.

408
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,910
There are many places hidden to eye

409
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,360
among his holdings throughout the city.

410
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,970
Aid in revealing them,

411
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,440
and you and your people will share equal portion

412
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,550
from what we gain in bargain with the Cilician.

413
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,010
I would have freedom as price.

414
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,430
For all of us.

415
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,150
Do this thing,

416
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,990
and you will be released,

417
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,160
when we take leave of Sinuessa.

418
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,780
Am I to trust your word?

419
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,760
The reason is simple.

420
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,230
You stand absent choice.

421
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,740
Hidden within blushed eye, the guardian spirits.

422
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,030
Is it a wonder the gods turned on your husband

423
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,060
and this fucking city?

424
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,610
Let us turn from past

425
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,410
and set gaze towards favored bargain.

426
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,200
And fall to much needed drink!

427
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,260
How much would you have for it?

428
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,560
I ask for nothing.

429
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,200
Upon our abandoning the city,

430
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,510
the seal is yours.

431
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,710
And until such fated day?

432
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,370
An agreement of trade.

433
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,790
Coin for food.

434
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,330
First shipment from what stores you have aboard your ships.

435
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:30,580
You would entreat Poseidon to shun robes and present ass!

436
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,010
If he stood before me.

437
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,640
Yet he does not.

438
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,730
My supplies are of finest quality.

439
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,090
Eighteen thousand denarii easily fetched if sold at port.

440
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,680
Absent the Aedile's seal?

441
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,980
You are not the man one expects.

442
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,660
Ten thousand denarii.

443
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,580
If Aedile's wife is added to the bargain huh.

444
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,210
You mistake me for a Roman.

445
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,860
I do not trade in slaves.

446
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,510
Nor would I, if possessed with such a ripe cunt.

447
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,820
Twelve thousand denarii.

448
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,080
In hour before sun's rising,

449
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,720
upon landing beyond city walls.

450
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,530
Beyond the city?

451
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,810
Ground absent advantage, brother.

452
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,330
I would not sail into port, only to be set upon.

453
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,410
Beyond city walls.

454
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,860
In hour before sun rises.

455
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,780
It is settled then.

456
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,060
Now may we have fucking drink?! Huh!

457
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,430
What fucking piss does Heracleo offer?

458
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,070
Absinthe, by name.

459
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,530
I once drained six cups,

460
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,870
and found myself in heated argument with imaginary cat.

461
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,150
Then let us drain seven, and finish argument

462
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,160
before you strike from Roman shores.

463
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,990
Yes.

464
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,180
Dangerous thing.

465
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,960
Eyes upon man not your own.

466
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,860
Apologies. I meant no offense.

467
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,140
You want his cock inside you?

468
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,580
Speak, little thing.

469
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,880
Nemetes, you cock eater!

470
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,330
He saved my life.

471
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,860
I desire only to thank him.

472
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,520
Come.

473
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,350
I do not care for these Cilicians.

474
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,840
Yet they are preferred to Romans.

475
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:33,150
My cock is magic.

476
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,820
Then see it vanish from sight.

477
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,420
More wine!

478
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,380
You're a fool.

479
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,870
To lay trust in one stitched of lies and deceit.

480
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,970
I'm no stranger to his kind.

481
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,120
I thought myself so.

482
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,580
Yet now replay every moment.

483
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,900
Every touch my husband laid upon me.

484
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,200
Questioning truth behind them.

485
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:13,550
The gods punish me for being so blind.

486
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,850
Would that you had let Heracleo take me,

487
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,770
to see their wrath complete.

488
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,650
I place no stock in your gods.

489
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,470
Nor any that would seek injury

490
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,400
for crimes against those undeserving.

491
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,420
I have given command

492
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,040
that you are free to move about city.

493
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,850
In return,

494
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,920
you will lend hand

495
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,830
in seeing your people receive proper share of food.

496
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,070
And carry word to me if any should fall to mistreatment.

497
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,110
It surprises,

498
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:59,120
how such small a weight bears such heavy burden.

499
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:04,880
A truth known to all who take up arms against Rome.

500
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:11,770
You shall sleep where you are.

501
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,600
My people will turn from me,

502
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,800
if I'm known to bed beneath your roof.

503
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:21,010
My husband held stable at edge of city.

504
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,630
I would take shelter within its walls.

505
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,800
I sought only to provide comfort.

506
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,040
Heracleo spoke the truth,

507
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,150
at least upon one subject.

508
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,040
You are not the man one expects.

509
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,520
Apologies.

510
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,170
Share drink, and see them accepted.

511
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,400
My cup is spoken for.

512
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,120
I seek not to claim it my own.

513
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,880
Merely grace lips with its nectar.

514
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,510
You are bold of words.

515
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:27,600
I have been too long at sea

516
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,860
among, rough company.

517
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,050
I do not favor crashing waves.

518
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,340
Words from mouth such as yours

519
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,190
could move a man to forever turn from them.

520
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,930
Remove fucking hand.

521
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,020
He meant no harm.

522
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,120
Apologies.

523
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,840
I did not know you were mired in shit

524
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,840
East of the Rhine.

525
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,700
Smash him!

526
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,310
Agron!

527
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,480
Agron!

528
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,760
Fall from sight.

529
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,440
Revelry has struck sour note.

530
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,420
I would not have senseless quarrel open gap between us.

531
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,130
Then see it filled with coin

532
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,100
at appointed hour.

533
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,200
And we shall test sureness of our footing.

534
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:01,450
Spartacus stands displeased with celebration's end.

535
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,850
I was not the one who caused offense.

536
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,230
The Cilician overstepped,

537
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,180
yet your response was--

538
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,710
Was as it fucking should be.

539
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,480
Jupiter himself would find cause

540
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,320
to tremble if he laid hand upon you.

541
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,660
You would battle a god for me?

542
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,260
I would slay all

543
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,600
that would lay attempt to wrest you from my arms.

544
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,770
Strike Jupiter and the Cilician from mind.

545
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,180
I would have them of no concern

546
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,090
to the one that holds my heart.

547
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,440
You left absent word.

548
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,860
There was a fight.

549
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,070
It was very loud.

550
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,180
I leave to make shadow flesh.

551
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,890
...and to bring desire.

552
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,270
For you.

553
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,310
Come.

554
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,430
Gather your robes and leave us.

555
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,430
Go.

556
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,350
She does not please?

557
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,180
She is but a child.

558
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:22,270
And I would have a woman tend to my needs,

559
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,480
in brief hours before I move with Spartacus...

560
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,240
Apologies.

561
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,260
I would have words.

562
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,560
I would not.

563
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,430
You've not given opportunity towards gratitude.

564
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:04,660
I yet draw breath because of you.

565
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,950
Your dominus fell to an act of war.

566
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,540
He fell to a hero sent by the gods.

567
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,290
One that does not even recall your name.

568
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,500
My name is Sibyl.

569
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,030
Sibyl.

570
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,060
And you feel you owe debt Sibyl?

571
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,570
I owe you everything.

572
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,000
Then see it repaid

573
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:32,320
by staying far from my presence.

574
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,020
And men of my kind.

575
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,930
You would claim all that I have earned?

576
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,570
All you have stolen.

577
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:47,440
Did I not stand with my brothers when city was taken,

578
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,030
risking life beside you?

579
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,210
As I did in shadow of Vesuvius

580
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,620
and every fucking battle since?

581
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,900
As all that follow cause.

582
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,790
Know that you do not stand alone in sacrifice.

583
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,030
And what of the blacksmith?

584
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,810
Did you seize coin given him as well?

585
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:02,280
You mistake command for conversation.

586
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,090
Fall to your purpose.

587
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,840
You carry the balance?

588
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,870
He does.

589
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,890
Where is Gannicus?

590
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,180
He comes upon heel.

591
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,560
What is left of him.

592
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,420
Totus!

593
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,740
Fall to task.

594
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,400
We are committed.

595
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:31,690
Nasir, take position upon wall.

596
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,590
I would stand with you.

597
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,210
Go.

598
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,400
I shall return shortly.

599
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,170
Once gate closes behind us,

600
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,450
do not see it raised short of my word.

601
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,550
Terms of stroll worsen by passing moment.

602
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,690
Keep watchful eye towards sign of betrayal.

603
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,840
I pray they make fucking attempt.

604
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,710
If Heracleo and his men,

605
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:02,590
prove short of honor...

606
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,020
kill them where they stand.

607
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,550
Raise the gate!

608
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:22,550
Cilicians, by the look.

609
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,910
Why would they take landing outside Sinuessa?

610
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:34,520
To seek alliance.

611
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,950
Spartacus stands the fool

612
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:37,920
if he risks dealings with such as them.

613
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,340
They are thieves of equal nature.

614
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:44,140
And if they come to terms it would prevent my father

615
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,120
from starving the rebels out.

616
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,320
A thing I will not have fall to pass.

617
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,890
Mummius, prepare your men to advance.

618
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,690
Advance?

619
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:57,900
Fall to fucking command.

620
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,590
Tiberius, your father gave strict order

621
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:06,250
not to engage Spartacus.

622
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:09,490
My father desires a wolf of battle,

623
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,410
not a well-heeled dog.

624
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:17,260
And this night I shall honor him

625
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,290
with blood and death.

626
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,270
We are too exposed.

627
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:34,310
Spartacus and his men more so,

628
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,680
beyond the walls of his city.

629
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,720
They spill from gate.

630
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:43,440
Upon my signal only.

631
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,950
I would give no errant cause to doubt intention.

632
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,340
Nasir, what do you see?

633
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,080
Shit and piss.

634
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,010
They are too far in darkness.

635
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:11,530
What does she say?

636
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:15,460
Roman your man make fight gone.

637
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,860
Ulpianus?

638
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:19,210
With fat wife and others chained with him.

639
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,160
We must sweep the city --

640
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,680
No. Remain here.

641
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,600
It may be distraction,

642
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,920
to draw us from the gate.

643
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,080
Where do you go?

644
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,260
Do not tear eyes from purpose!

645
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:39,820
Your price.

646
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,910
As agreed upon.

647
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:44,940
Apologies, I mean no offense,

648
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:45,880
yet ah...

649
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:48,940
Open it.

650
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,110
You stand a man of your word.

651
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,060
A very rare thing, in such a world.

652
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,110
Rarer yet,

653
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,500
to greet my equal.

654
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,620
Castus. Adherbal.

655
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,220
Bring our brothers what they are owed.

656
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:29,770
You take leave of the city?

657
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:34,400
Absent parting words?

658
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,680
I've broken them to all that matter.

659
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:39,910
If dealings with the Cilicians end as desired,

660
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:42,860
I will buy passage far from your fucking presence.

661
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:45,330
Do you buy such for your friends as well?

662
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:46,210
Friends?

663
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,800
Tell me where there are.

664
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,570
Wait!

665
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:52,630
I do not know what you speak of!

666
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:53,800
I speak of Romans.

667
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,570
And your fucking treachery.

668
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,230
Fuck!

669
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:04,820
You wish for blood?

670
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:05,660
Come then.

671
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:07,340
And find greater challenge than that

672
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:10,540
of a simple crafter of bread in fucking chains.

673
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,050
This,

674
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:29,090
this stands the sum of your offerings?

675
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:32,530
Fuck the gods, no!

676
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,660
A mere sample for your approval.

677
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,910
The remainder lies aboard my ships,

678
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:44,150
too great a cargo to ferry by skiff.

679
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,180
Now that payment has been received,

680
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,810
I shall sail into port --

681
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:50,450
That was not the arrangement.

682
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,070
Apologies, if you fell to confusion.

683
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:55,560
Fuck your apologies.

684
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,660
Hold ground!

685
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,340
What are your thoughts?

686
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:11,830
That I stand the fool.

687
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:15,810
For laying trust in a man absent honor.

688
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,790
Then perhaps the time has come. For us to...

689
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,030
forever part ways...

690
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,100
We are betrayed!

691
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,560
This is not my hand!

692
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,720
Fucking pirates!

693
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:42,000
Advance!

694
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,350
Romans!

695
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,550
Where the fuck is Mummius?!

696
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:58,780
Fuck!

697
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,770
I have had my fill...

698
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:49,170
of men such as you...

699
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,450
Mummius?

700
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,410
Spartacus!

701
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:38,510
More come!

702
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,880
Spartacus...

703
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,820
Attack!

704
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,590
Testudo!

705
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:40,510
Load!

706
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:41,610
Fire!

707
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,470
Did I not warn you of my fucking reach!

708
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,460
I warned you!

709
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,120
Stand ground!

710
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:15,890
Retreat!

711
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:17,620
Stand your fucking ground!

712
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,880
Retreat!

713
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,600
Retreat!

714
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,490
Totus!

715
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,000
We must retreat.

716
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,160
- No... - I will not see you fall!

717
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:09,890
After them!

718
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:11,060
Let them go!

719
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,920
We must return to the city! Now!

720
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:14,600
Retreat!

721
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:18,330
How stand your thoughts now, King Spartacus?

722
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:19,220
Take coin.

723
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,040
And see your ships to port.

724
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:22,450
Come!

725
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,020
We go!

726
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:55,950
I thought you gone from this world.

727
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:58,500
You will not so easily see me from your arms.

728
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,160
I attempted to come to your aid.

729
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,890
Nemetes and his shits would not open gate.

730
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,230
If gate had been breached,

731
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:06,580
more would have fallen.

732
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:08,520
He but followed command.

733
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:19,250
Confounds why the Romans attacked in such small numbers,

734
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,480
led by a boy.

735
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:23,340
It holds no sense.

736
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:25,290
Answer lay among the dead.

737
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:33,950
And those we mistakenly name friend.

738
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:43,290
He came at me,

739
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:47,170
when confronted with question of aiding Ulpianus

740
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:48,480
and the others in escape.

741
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,850
You were left absent choice.

742
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:53,400
Would he lend hand in taking city,

743
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,140
only to risk life in such attempt?

744
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:58,140
He but sought to form basest clay,

745
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,910
into something of worth.

746
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:02,120
There stands matters of more pressing concern.

747
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:05,280
Let us sweep city for Ulpianus and the others.

748
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,630
I would not have Romans plotting beneath foot,

749
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,190
or seeking greater harm.

750
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,260
Gratitude.

751
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:34,940
There's more over here.

751
00:56:36,620 --> 00:57:34,940

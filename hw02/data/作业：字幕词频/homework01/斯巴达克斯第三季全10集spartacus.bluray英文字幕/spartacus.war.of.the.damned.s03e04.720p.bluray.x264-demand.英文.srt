6
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,660
He was reaching for the food, you mad cunt!

7
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,240
Attius stands with us.

8
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,050
He stands a fucking Roman.

9
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,110
Crassus denies me sharpened blade.

10
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,790
Under what purpose?

11
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,000
Personal matter.

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,480
Brigands of Cilicia.

13
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,320
Pirates?

14
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,180
The Aedile and I had an arrangement.

15
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,820
I will not beg for my life.

16
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,090
Do this thing...

17
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,460
And you will be released.

18
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,950
Your man make fight gone.

19
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,310
Ulpianus?

20
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,490
Tell me where they are.

21
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,460
I don't know who you speak of.

22
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,940
Tell your men to advance.

23
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,680
Your father gave strict order not...

24
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,860
My father desires a wolf of battle.

25
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,490
Advance!

26
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,340
Stand ground, stand your fucking ground!

27
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,630
Retreat!

28
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,430
There stands greater worry

29
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,950
than grain carried to port by Cilician shits.

30
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,440
What would you have us feast upon? Promise of better days?

31
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,680
I would see bellies filled with the death of Romans.

32
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,930
Crassus is certain to dispatch more soldiers.

33
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,900
And we should be preparing to greet them.

34
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,950
We are.

35
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,500
By ensuring our own do not go into battle weakened by hunger.

36
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,910
Full sails, we here for the night.

37
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,090
Heracleo.

38
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,700
How fares recent venture?

39
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,190
If you are of a thirst, the gods have shown favor.

40
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,340
You carry no grain?

41
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,080
A clutch of amphoras so filled were liberated from Roman ship.

42
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,000
Yet its captain held more stock in drink than seed of bread.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,300
Wine will not feed my people.

44
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,280
The Romans have stored most of their harvest

45
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,450
against encroaching chill.

46
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,910
Difficulty rises in securing such bounty.

47
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,610
As does its price?

48
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,720
Yeah.

49
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,600
Move back!

50
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,800
Whoa, hold and fall to reason!

51
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,270
See each to a handful, and clear them from the docks.

52
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,140
Spartacus.

53
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,680
More slaves taken afoot approach gate.

54
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,810
Will you see them to a handful as well?

55
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,680
Do you know of my sister?

56
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,140
I haven't laid eyes since the city fell.

57
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,630
We should not be wasting what little food we have

58
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,200
on fucking Romans.

59
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,590
You know my mind upon subject.

60
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,820
I stand with Crixus towards it.

61
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,990
I have given Laeta my word. It will not be broken.

62
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,630
Let me in, please!

63
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,850
If you hold weapon you must give over before entering city!

64
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,220
Fuck!

65
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,230
Weapon?

66
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,330
Just this.

67
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,500
Merci.

68
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,740
It seems a lifetime past, that I stood as him.

69
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,460
Show brand, and see what you...

70
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,620
Show brand or mark,

71
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,520
to prove you stand former slave and no friend of the Republic!

72
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,400
We have nowhere to go!

73
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,170
Show me your brand.

74
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,420
The most fearsome weapons yet exposed.

75
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,920
I would take no offense to closer inspection...

76
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,740
Open bag!

77
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,330
Put mind at ease, brother.

78
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,390
You'll have no need of this here.

79
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,260
Spartacus does not favor his people holding coin.

80
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,290
Spartacus!

81
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,350
This one carries knowledge of Crassus' army.

82
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,610
I say about a half day's march from our wharves.

83
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,690
How great a force?

84
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,130
Larger than fucking city by her word.

85
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,410
Yet he has made camp and holds advance.

86
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,800
Why stay hand when it grips such numbers?

87
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,630
He but grips his own fucking cock

88
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,270
if he believes we will...

89
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,150
- Run! - Fucking Romans! - The Romans!

90
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,450
Seal the gate!

91
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,020
Give fucking way!

92
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,170
Fucking shits drew upon us when pressed to show brand.

93
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,070
Gratitude for assistance.

94
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,100
There is no greater glory...

95
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,100
than the death of your enemy.

96
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,450
I would lay eyes upon your brand friend.

97
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,910
Well, that presents some difficulties.

98
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,220
More so if you are absent one.

99
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,970
My dominus branded all his slaves

100
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,380
close to cock and cunt,

101
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,730
equally enjoyed upon drunken nights.

102
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,570
With that knife I rid myself of him and his fucking mark...

103
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,060
Fall to cover and join the others.

104
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,220
Sever their heads and set them to pike upon wall,

105
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,370
as warning against future attempt.

106
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,980
Crixus, Gannicus, Agron...

107
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,650
I would have much needed words.

108
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,320
It seizes heart, to know you in such pain.

109
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,030
A deeper wound stands removed from sight.

110
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,540
He has not come to your side?

111
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,100
I recall my father's grim visage

112
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,970
when first you delivered me to encampment.

113
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,610
I have not since laid eyes upon it.

114
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,760
Place no worries in the absence.

115
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,220
The Imperator's mind is taken with thoughts

116
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,180
of coming battle against Spartacus.

117
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,360
We move to reclaim the city?

118
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,660
I have received no order to break encampment.

119
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,780
Though a large number of men have been dispatched north.

120
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,870
North?

121
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,950
Towards what purpose?

122
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,100
I do not hold your father's confidence in such matters.

123
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,240
We stand as one in such regard.

124
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,720
What of Caesar?

125
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,750
Does he circle fading corpse,

126
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,030
eager to strip flesh of title as word and will of my father?

127
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,220
He no longer stands among us.

128
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,700
Caesar has fallen?

129
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,250
He but follows command.

130
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,350
Leave us.

131
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,440
You have given Caesar mission?

132
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,030
One always intended.

133
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,160
He secrets himself among the rebels,

134
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,920
to hasten their fall.

135
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,110
The reason you ordered he remain unshorn.

136
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,720
To assume guise of errant slave.

137
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,280
One must appear as wolf to be welcomed by the pack.

138
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,430
A plan well considered.

139
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,030
I will stand by your side when it bears deadly fruit.

140
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,500
That day has not yet arrived.

141
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,160
Rest, allow wound to properly heal.

142
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,390
Uh, I am your word and your will, Father.

143
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,160
A position not commanded from upon back.

144
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,160
See yourself to uniform.

145
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,300
And let us break words towards your men's punishment,

146
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,940
for foolish attempt against Spartacus.

147
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,020
Mystery of Crassus holding advance falls to discovery.

148
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,470
The fucking cock on him.

149
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,560
Believing a few men could end rebellion.

150
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,200
Crassus does not move as the others we have faced.

151
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,760
He adopts our strategies,

152
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,050
in effort to twist them against us.

153
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,770
We should heed caution,

154
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,270
and see the gates remain closed.

155
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,040
I will not deny entry to those

156
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,510
who have risked life to break from their masters.

157
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,820
A thing born late in any regard.

158
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,040
Many unknown to us have already passed through gate to join cause,

159
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,590
if outward form does not conceal darker intent.

160
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,340
If there stand such among our ranks,

161
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,040
we must see them exposed.

162
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,560
You scale a mountain of ifs.

163
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,360
I would add to its peak.

164
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,850
If you are struck down by one of your errant flock,

165
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,310
how would they fare absent guidance?

166
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,980
Crixus would see them upon proper path.

167
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,800
With aid of wise council, gathered at this table.

168
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,370
I pray to the gods

169
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,560
that is a day I never see come to pass, brother.

170
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,060
Yet if I held sole command,

171
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,510
I would move swiftly against Crassus.

172
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,190
On this we share thought.

173
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,800
We are men of blood and battle.

174
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,840
And the streets grow restless with idle purpose.

175
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,270
We must stay course agreed upon.

176
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,980
We hold advantage of city walls;

177
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,320
Crassus' legions will suffer on open plains,

178
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,970
while we train swelling numbers

179
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,670
to see weakened foe to the afterlife.

180
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,960
Would that Attius was still alive,

181
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,880
to forge more weapons.

182
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,170
You would see traitor live,

183
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,850
and Naevia with brains upon fucking sand?

184
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,420
Let Attius stand as promised fate

185
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,430
for all who would see Roman slaves from shackle.

186
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,150
Fix mind upon the present,

187
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,330
gauge prowess of those newly among us.

188
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,810
Escaped Romans yet to be found,

189
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,290
Crassus upon our gate,

190
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,080
and you would have me play fucking doctore?

191
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,380
I would have you observe with watchful eye.

192
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,200
Any that measure beyond expectation

193
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,760
may reveal themselves more than they appear.

194
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,860
Join brother, and see it done.

195
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,380
A lifetime ago the words "Fucking Gauls"

196
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,060
would spring from mouth.

197
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,070
If it did fall to Crixus to...

198
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,790
You are yet among the living,

199
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,390
and I would see it remain so.

200
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,830
Until threat is known,

201
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,150
I will be as fucking shadow.

202
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,640
Then darken heel,

203
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,450
and let us move to better know mind of our enemy.

204
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,420
If I stood Roman,

205
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:19,010
my sword would have your life in favor of ass.

206
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,110
Again!

207
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,270
If that man proves assassin,

208
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,830
then I am Jupiter's fucking cock.

209
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,240
No skill.

210
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,400
Small cock.

211
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,460
You.

212
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,830
Step forward.

213
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,010
I have witnessed your skill with knife upon the unsuspecting.

214
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:02,110
Let us see how you fare with sword against more discerning eye.

215
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,490
We waste fucking effort.

216
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,850
If there is a Roman among them,

217
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,040
would they not feign ignorance of the ways of fighting men?

218
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,440
An animal cannot hide truer nature.

219
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,640
When pressed to corner,

220
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,860
it will expose teeth and snap jaw.

221
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,480
You are no stranger to the clash of steel.

222
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,000
All shepherds are versed in sound.

223
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,060
Many seek to claim another master's stock

224
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,940
upon hill and plain.

225
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,960
And what did your dominus call his defender of goat,

226
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,850
before he slipped from grasp?

227
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,340
Lyciscus.

228
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,300
A name forced upon me.

229
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,900
One I desire quickly shed.

230
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,620
I shall have rematch, upon a day.

231
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,220
You.

232
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,750
Step forward, and attempt to remain from fucking ground.

233
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,310
They take interest in you.

234
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,130
Do they take it in you as well?

235
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,020
And with coin I saw you relieving those

236
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,120
seeking refuge within your walls?

237
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,820
Break such words again,

238
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,130
and I shall relieve you of something far more valuable.

239
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,000
Ah, you mistake intent, brother.

240
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,620
I mention deed only towards thoughts of my own.

241
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,240
A city such as this holds great opportunity,

242
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,870
for those brave enough to seize it.

243
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,540
She turns from offer of villa

244
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,170
for straw and the smell of shit?

245
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,710
For reason fallen upon understanding ear.

246
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,140
The mind of a woman.

247
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,420
A foreign thing.

248
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,370
I would have words alone, and see it deciphered.

249
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,660
She holds no threat.

250
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,830
I shall place myself at entrance.

251
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,000
With sword clutched in fucking hand.

252
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,350
Did not think the Slayer of the Shadow of Death

253
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,110
had need of protector.

254
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,640
Unfortunate precaution, in wake of morning's events.

255
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,990
Word carries of the attack.

256
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,240
Does it also carry word of Marcus Crassus,

257
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,690
the man who commanded it?

258
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,720
Crassus...

259
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,630
You are pleased with the man Rome has sent to kill me.

260
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,980
Crassus stands as no other in certainty of intent.

261
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,920
He will not stop short of your end.

262
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,610
He is not the first Roman

263
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,570
to believe himself capable of the act.

264
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,460
Those that came before him did not hold wealth

265
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,510
to turn Juno Moneta envious.

266
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,630
Coin holds little worth upon the field of battle.

267
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,930
What of a mind keen enough to amass it?

268
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,140
Upon our first meeting you spoke of dealings with Crassus.

269
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,980
I would know of anything ear may have caught.

270
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,000
Such knowledge will not reverse sun,

271
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,380
nor alter the course of river's fate.

272
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,210
Then there stands no reason to deny request.

273
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,490
Our business with Crassus

274
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,910
concerned only grain and shipment, nothing more.

275
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,250
Yet my husband imparted story,

276
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,410
shared by Aedile of Neapolis

277
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,280
towards future dealings.

278
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,310
The man was thick in negotiations with Crassus

279
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,770
when he intercepted message from reviled competitor,

280
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,500
offering more favorable terms to Crassus.

281
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,840
While seeing both profit

282
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,510
and valuable client soon to vanish,

283
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,400
the Aedile burned errant message,

284
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,300
swiftly agreed to Crassus' demands.

285
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,970
Only to discover months later

286
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,770
Crassus himself had sent the message,

287
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,860
intending for the Aedile to lay hands upon it,

288
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,250
and move in direction desired.

289
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,650
I too intercepted message from Crassus.

290
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,080
And used what was gleaned

291
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,620
to clear path for him to assume command.

292
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,500
You have struck fear into the very heart of the Republic.

293
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,670
Imagine the glory that awaits...

294
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,080
the man who defeats you.

295
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,560
Heracleo delivers less than expected.

296
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,310
Rations must be lowered by another half.

297
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,720
We will make due.

298
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,940
Until Crassus reclaims the city.

299
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,830
He does not stand the only one capable of the unexpected.

300
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,440
Let us seek Heracleo,

301
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,310
and a future even the mighty Crassus will not see coming.

302
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,870
Dispatch another thousand men to aid Quinctius.

303
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,070
We must see progress hastened.

304
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,520
Imperator.

305
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,480
My word and my will.

306
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,980
You understand what that means?

307
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,490
Yes, Father.

308
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,030
Do you?

309
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,450
The first battle in my campaign forever etched in history.

310
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,400
As a victory for Spartacus.

311
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,400
- Father... - He was not to be engaged

312
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,070
until I arrived with proper force.

313
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,590
Was command not fucking clear?!

314
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,330
It was.

315
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,760
Yet opportunity presented

316
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,690
when Spartacus moved beyond city walls.

317
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,470
I thought it greater offense not to seize moment.

318
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,510
Apologies for disobeying your command, Father.

319
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,650
A thing that could be forgiven in light of youth.

320
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,880
Yet your men falling to retreat

321
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,310
does not so easily slip from concern.

322
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,180
I ordered them to stand ground.

323
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,550
Yet they fled.

324
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,460
Because they feared the enemy more than their commanders.

325
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,590
A false assumption we must see corrected.

326
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,780
What punishment would you have me inflict?

327
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,690
One to stand warning.

328
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,260
That death at the hands of Spartacus

329
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,930
pales against the wrath of the House of Crassus.

330
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,770
Decimation?

331
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,190
Not since the days of Marius

332
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,440
has savage ritual been so commanded.

333
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,310
He would make example.

334
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,070
Of what befalls a man who turns heel in face of enemy.

335
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,670
The fault is mine.

336
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,790
Had I obeyed your order to stand ground...

337
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,820
Our men broke rank and fled.

338
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,760
You were left absent choice.

339
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,870
As my father now leaves me.

340
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,010
Fifty men.

341
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,080
Fifty stones.

342
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,340
Five stained with the promise of death.

343
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,240
Draw well and live.

344
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,400
Draw poorly...

345
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,300
You stayed at my side while the others ran.

346
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,780
I am yet from this world because of you.

347
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,340
Place it from mind.

348
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,490
And pray I draw well.

349
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,840
You do not deserve to be placed at risk among cowards.

350
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,630
I will talk to my father

351
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,940
and beg your removal from decimation.

352
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,780
The act would only diminish you in his eyes.

353
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,400
A thing I would never allow.

354
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:34,700
You stand most honorable in his legions.

355
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,220
And this is fucking reward!

356
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,220
I shall do as commanded.

357
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,230
As all soldiers must.

358
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,010
The stables were a sweeter smell.

359
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,880
Castus.

360
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,220
Where is Heracleo?

361
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,700
He was heavy with drink and whores last I laid eyes.

362
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,390
Seek him upon deck of his ship.

363
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,060
The man has a well known preference

364
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,630
for sea and cunt, spread equally before him.

365
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,570
Gratitude.

366
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,940
Come, share cup, and we shall seek him together.

367
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,290
We would not wallow in such low company.

368
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,320
We are moved by pressing business.

369
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,420
Another time.

370
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,290
You wish to fuck the man,

371
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,720
make introduction and present cock.

372
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,350
I would sooner caress shit and call it lover.

373
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,640
Cilicians cannot be trusted.

374
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,570
You are familiar with their kind?

375
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,540
I have had the displeasure of their company,

376
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,250
in years past.

377
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,290
Choose words with care.

378
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,180
Spartacus calls them fucking ally.

379
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,680
You do not share opinion?

380
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,080
It would hold no fucking matter.

381
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,900
I am but humble servant

382
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,450
to the will of our glorious leader.

383
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,720
I have heard rumor.

384
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,930
Spartacus stands a god among his people.

385
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,420
I have imperiled life for his cause many times.

386
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,830
At Vesuvius and Calor

387
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,510
and battles far too numerous in the counting.

388
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,120
Even in the taking of this fucking city.

389
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,570
Only to witness remainder of enemy

390
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,340
spared within its walls.

391
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,490
And coin honestly gained

392
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,280
stripped from hand to forge bargain

393
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,980
with the fucking Cilicians.

394
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,330
But small wonder you are forced to relieve

395
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,510
what you can from those newly entering gate.

396
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,610
A fraction of what is owed to me.

397
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,350
That is all I carry.

398
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,500
Consider it yours, toward our continued friendship.

399
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,300
Too small a sum, to purchase so rare an item.

400
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,060
Perhaps together we can see it grow.

401
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,760
And both our fortunes rise.

402
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,300
Apologies.

403
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,560
I will not have you speak of this.

404
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,810
Yes, Domina.

405
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,190
I no longer stand as such.

406
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,630
You may call me Laeta.

407
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,550
I often dreamed of being of your house.

408
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,290
You were one of Laurus', were you not?

409
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:22,070
Many nights I laid prayers to be free of him.

410
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,870
If only city did not need to fall in their answering.

411
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,610
Embrace what you have.

412
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,960
All can change in sudden moment.

413
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,570
There, you fucking cunt!

414
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,770
Brictius!

415
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,980
Spartacus gave clear orders.

416
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,460
No hands are to be laid upon these people.

417
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,510
This Roman shit laid hands upon me,

418
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,060
snapping at robe as I passed.

419
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,990
I but entreated for word of my sister...

420
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,500
Fuck your sister!

421
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:57,040
Unleash cock, and find it severed.

422
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:01,050
All their fucking heads should be set upon pike.

423
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,720
Gratitude.

424
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,040
Owed to Spartacus.

425
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,600
I tend to agree about the pikes.

426
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,880
Wait!

427
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,950
My sister...

428
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,050
Fabia...

429
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,810
flaxen of hair, such as your woman.

430
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,550
I beg of you, I must know if she lives.

431
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,350
Many Roman dead.

432
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,430
You join sister perhaps, touch again one of us.

433
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,540
Please.

434
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,290
I have not seen her.

435
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,440
Why Spartacus allow them live?

436
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,120
I hold no understanding towards it,

437
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,600
yet we shall honor desire.

438
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,030
Gannicus, I must have words.

439
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,540
None give little girl,

440
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,040
not drink and fuck.

441
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,600
She makes valid argument.

442
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,050
You must listen.

443
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,980
I have laid eyes upon something that lends worry.

444
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,200
We have taken to each other's arms many times.

445
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,460
Yet never have soared so high.

446
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,140
We are far from Rome.

447
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,180
And tethers that prevent such flight.

448
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,380
Gratitude.

449
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,650
For allowing me to stay by your side.

450
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,580
I would never have you leave it.

451
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,390
Your presence gives much needed comfort.

452
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,090
It must weigh mind.

453
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,340
This war with Spartacus.

454
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:10,560
He is but nuisance, soon to fade from memory.

455
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:17,420
My thoughts churn upon closer relation.

456
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,560
You have said Tiberius' wounds already mend.

457
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,270
He will stand your word and will in coming days.

458
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:37,870
A weight I question placing again on so green a sapling.

459
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,910
He grows stronger each day

460
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:43,230
beneath warming sun of father's guidance.

461
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,020
Ah, Tiberius has given all to please me,

462
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,130
to become honored soldier.

463
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,290
Yet when eyes are greeted,

464
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:54,860
there stands only a child before me.

465
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,730
Playing at the games of men.

466
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,340
He has fought and bled for the glory of Rome.

467
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,070
For his Imperator.

468
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,390
Does he not deserve to be treated

469
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,750
as any other beneath your command?

470
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,800
You know I stand sympathetic toward your plight.

471
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,410
Our numbers have unexpectedly swelled.

472
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:26,690
My men and I can only provide what we ourselves can lay hand upon.

473
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,270
It is not enough.

474
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,420
Perhaps it would be,

475
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:35,390
if resources were not drained by undeserving mouths...

476
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,760
You stray from subject.

477
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,980
As you from reason.

478
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,280
Do you think they would treat your people with such kindness?

479
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,740
We are not Romans.

480
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,810
Nor shall we become them by acts of unnecessary cruelty.

481
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,430
This fucking man!

482
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,940
I will provide you with what I can

483
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,040
to feed the lofty ideals.

484
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,200
Yet fear, it shall fall short of desired mark.

485
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,060
I would see target adjusted,

486
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,240
and center struck with surer purpose.

487
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,440
You wish to alter terms of our agreement?

488
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,320
I would but add to it,

489
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,280
and see your ships filled with more promising cargo.

490
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,530
Nemetes!

491
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,170
I would have words.

492
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,870
And I would finish fucking drink.

493
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,990
Fucking Gauls.

494
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,800
Shitholes rivaling the Thracians...

495
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,680
I am not fucking cur!

496
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,420
Gauls.

497
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,580
Return to drink and whores,

498
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,120
or part from this world.

499
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,390
Choose.

500
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:04,420
You did not need to be so rough in demonstration.

501
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,870
We both must play our part.

502
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,650
Now speak about what have you discovered?

503
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,610
The man holds no love for Rome,

504
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,530
through weight of his words.

505
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,040
How do you balance them against truth?

506
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,670
I believe his loyalties mirror my own.

507
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,440
Yet I will set final test,

508
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,800
and gauge action against words.

509
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,680
If words prove false, so does the man.

510
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,730
See it done.

511
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:55,860
A common thing, to be so rudely handled by a brother?

512
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,500
Ah, he stands no brother to me.

513
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,590
Nor any man that has not earned my trust.

514
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,090
I fear mood has taken sour turn.

515
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,540
Come.

516
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,870
Let us sweeten it with drink.

517
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,890
I would set desire towards greater spoils.

518
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,830
And in the revealing of them, set true nature to light...

519
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,190
This precious jewel

520
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,790
once stood domina to many slaves within the city.

521
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,710
They attended her every need.

522
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,110
As she now attends ours...

523
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,550
Spartacus allows this?

524
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,570
Fuck the gods, no.

525
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:54,470
He helped himself to my fucking coin.

526
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,020
I returned favor...

527
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,650
with one of his little pets.

528
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:23,680
Prove yourself no friend to these people.

529
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,130
Use this Roman for untold pleasures.

530
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:31,140
And when you have finished,

531
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,040
leave fresh mark upon her.

532
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,070
As we have so often done.

533
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,820
Leave us.

534
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,830
Calm yourself, calm yourself.

535
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,880
I stand a Roman, as you.

536
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,580
My name is Gaius Julius Caesar.

537
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,320
I come in the name of Marcus Crassus.

538
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,610
His legions are gathering in the north.

539
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,580
We shall take this city,

540
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,670
and see all those who have done this to you suffer.

541
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,820
Free me...

542
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,530
Soon Crassus will come.

543
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,400
You have my word.

544
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,530
Free me...

545
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,420
What is your name?

546
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,710
Fabia.

547
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,500
Fabia.

548
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,500
Know that it shall not be forgotten.

549
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,830
Nor the men that set you upon this fate.

550
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,190
What have you done, you mad fuck?!

551
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,740
I set her free.

552
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,100
As I would all Romans yet held by Spartacus.

553
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,870
You truly do stand one of us.

554
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,620
Come, brother.

555
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,590
Let us see it done.

556
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:26,960
There stands no stronger bond between men,

557
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,730
than one forged in war.

558
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,550
Nor greater glory

559
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,370
than to fall in defense of mother Rome.

560
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:41,590
Each of you swore sacramentum.

561
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,570
To obey order given.

562
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:48,500
To refrain from theft or breach of common law.

563
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,580
To protect the Legionary Standard.

564
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:57,580
And never to break rank nor flee from enemy.

565
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:04,650
Those who stand before me

566
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,390
turned from field of battle.

567
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Retreated from the rebel Spartacus

568
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,650
and his army of slaves,

569
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:20,610
fearing them more than their own commander.

570
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,050
An error

571
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:28,550
this night I shall see corrected.

572
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,310
And in the lesson,

573
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,540
lay fear upon proper name.

574
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,360
Marcus.

575
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,770
Licinius.

576
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,660
Crassus.

577
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,060
Those who survive decimation

578
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:01,540
shall be banished to the followers camp.

579
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,510
To live among slaves and whores

580
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:10,650
until such a day I deem you worthy of proper company.

581
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,060
Father, I would have word...

582
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,640
I am not your father in this.

583
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,440
I am your fucking imperator.

584
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,840
I have too long considered you a child, Tiberius.

585
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,770
Apologies.

586
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,420
You stand a soldier now,

587
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,880
and deserve to be treated as any other.

588
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,890
Join your men.

589
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,240
Fall to command.

590
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,020
Draw lots.

591
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:04,630
Let this night be forever remembered.

592
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,370
And cause never repeated.

593
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,900
Present your fates.

594
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:44,860
No, no, fuck!

595
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,200
You cannot do that!

596
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,370
Apologies there is so little.

597
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,790
Food grows scarce.

598
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,990
You risk life for us.

599
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,720
There is no more we can ask of you.

600
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,790
See heart lifted with welcomed news.

601
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,040
Crassus and his legions

602
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,740
are but a day's march from our city.

603
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,990
He will retake it,

604
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,540
and in the act end our suffering...

605
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,290
I fear it has just begun.

606
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,740
Apologies, Laeta.

607
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,520
I had to tell them what I saw.

608
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,170
The fault is my own.

609
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:39,440
For laying trust in a rebellious slave!

610
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,990
Hold!

611
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,350
This man.

612
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,730
He is the one Attius helped free?

613
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,730
The blacksmith held no knowledge of it.

614
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,850
Your friend dead, because of her.

615
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:58,160
See them bound and taken to Spartacus.

616
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:00,320
They are his concern.

617
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,590
Where do you go?

618
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,300
To see memory of Attius well fucking honored!

619
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,540
None give rise to suspicion?

620
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,640
They are eager for Roman blood.

621
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,000
As any true to our cause should be.

622
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,550
Fabia...Fabia!

623
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:25,200
Nemetes!

624
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,240
Break fucking words, and knowledge of what you carry!

625
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,080
One of the missing Romans!

626
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,810
She came at me out of the shadows

627
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,770
half dead from attempted escape.

628
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,890
If it had not been for Lyciscus...

629
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,700
You spare their lives, and this is fucking gratitude!

630
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,420
Fuck the Romans!

631
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,770
Fuck the Roman cunts!

632
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:52,130
Kill the fucking Romans!

633
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,920
Fuck this.

634
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,500
All should be struck from this world.

635
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,250
- Fuck the Romans! - As you struck Attius from it?

636
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,300
Subject has been laid to rest, Gannicus.

637
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,230
Along with fucking truth.

638
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:09,640
He aided the prisoners in escape.

639
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,890
And made attempt on my life when I discovered...

640
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:14,080
The Aedile's wife saw them free!

641
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,380
How do you come upon this?

642
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,560
Laeta hid them beneath the floor of her husband's stables.

643
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,190
Saxa carries her and the others to Spartacus.

644
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:29,500
It holds no matter.

645
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:34,470
Attius was a Roman, who fell to deserved fate.

646
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:36,950
He was my friend, you mad bitch!

647
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,680
Seize tongue, brother...

648
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,750
Get him, Gannicus!

649
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,940
Kill him, get the fucker!

650
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,440
Let's see what you're made of, Gannicus!

651
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,660
Come on, hit him!

652
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,190
Gannicus!

653
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,870
Calm yourself...

654
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,040
Fuck you!

655
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,120
Come on!

656
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,340
Get up!

657
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:03,110
Gannicus!

658
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:29,510
He left me no choice.

659
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,470
He protects the Romans!

660
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,970
As does our mighty fucking leader!

661
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:37,810
Is this what we have risked all for in joining cause?!

662
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,040
Spartacus gives command!

663
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,750
And I would give my life,

664
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:44,690
to feel enemy's blood hot upon cheek.

665
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,990
We owe Spartacus our own lives.

666
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:05,240
Yet he is wrong in this.

667
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,780
A thing known by all.

668
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:19,240
For every unwanted touch placed upon you.

669
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:30,630
For every chain around neck,

670
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:32,950
and every lash upon back!

671
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:37,710
Take Roman blood as payment...

672
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:42,010
and let us see this city truly ours!

673
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,060
I will not do this.

674
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:13,800
You shall do as commanded.

675
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,260
As all soldiers must.

676
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:25,000
Let it be done!

677
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:27,420
Begin!

678
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,560
No!

679
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:41,290
Your lesson well learned.

680
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,040
Imperator.

681
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:09,410
Each day brings new madness.

682
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:13,020
Next you will ask to join in wresting moon from fucking heavens.

683
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,290
He sets purpose towards more earthly goal.

684
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:18,230
Does it lie within possibility, what I seek to do?

685
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,740
All dreams are possible...

686
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:24,040
it is but effort and cost that keeps it from waking grasp.

687
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,060
See this last thing that I ask of you to its end,

688
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,100
and I will fill your ship

689
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,110
with all the riches this city yet holds.

690
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,620
Let us see it done then, brother!

691
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,060
Spartacus!

692
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,970
Crixus and the others have gone mad.

693
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,540
They're killing the Romans.

694
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,210
Keep watch over the Cilicians.

695
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:47,840
You seem to favor their fucking company.

696
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:15,730
- Move, quickly! - Come on, quick!

697
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,270
Uh, sorry.

698
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,840
Oh, you must keep moving.

699
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,420
We will not make it to the villa.

700
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:22,840
No, you will not.

701
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:25,050
These for Spartacus.

702
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:26,700
Take from fucking path!

703
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,750
I do not see Gannicus among you.

704
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:31,410
Nor cause to heed his bitch!

705
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,330
I give cause.

706
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:40,250
Bitch.

707
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:42,190
More Romans!

708
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:55,090
Oh my God please, hands off him!

709
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,960
The Aedile's wife!

710
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:31,950
You will regain sense!

711
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,010
Or fall where you stand!

712
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:37,280
It is you who has lost sense.

713
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,480
And the Aedile's wife

714
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,130
who has seen you tumble from perch.

715
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:49,470
She is the one who helped these Roman shits slip bond!

716
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:52,200
And smiled at you through fucking lies!

717
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,550
A thing of truth.

718
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,270
Attius held no part in it.

719
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,160
Nor did he deserve the end that he met.

720
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:13,030
This is return for the mercy I grant you?

721
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:15,440
Mercy?

722
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:19,790
You robbed me of my husband.

723
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,900
Your people slaughtered thousands within my city.

724
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:25,610
And I now stand condemned,

725
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:28,830
for trying to save but a handful from such cruelty?

726
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:33,810
Learned at the hand of our Roman master.

727
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:36,570
Take her life, brother.

728
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:41,880
And in the act let us become as one again.

729
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:48,090
A thing deserved.

730
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:54,220
Yet I will not see us become the very thing we fight against.

731
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,990
There are many who question your mind in this.

732
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:01,440
I question mind as well...

733
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:11,290
placing faith in you as a leader.

734
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:19,370
See the Romans that yet live gathered within my villa.

735
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:22,270
Make further attempt against my will...

736
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:27,090
follow those you have struck down this night.

737
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:37,200
The man has helped us more than anyone.

738
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,530
Yet I now doubt path he travels.

739
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:48,050
Then perhaps the time has come, to forge our own.

740
00:54:52,180 --> 00:55:48,050

1
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
6
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,620
You have given Caesar mission?

7
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,750
He secrets himself among the rebels.

8
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,120
Greater glory than the death of your enemy.

9
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,640
Advance!

10
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,780
I ordered them to stand ground but they fled.

11
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,980
What punishment would you have me inflict?

12
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,100
Decimation.

13
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,530
Fifty men, fifty stones.

14
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,690
Five stained with the promise of death.

15
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,230
See this last thing that I ask of you to its end,

16
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,750
and I will fill your ship with all the riches this city yet holds.

17
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,720
Let us see it done then brother.

18
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,650
Spartacus, Crixus and the others have gone mad.

19
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,190
Get your weapons,

20
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,000
keep watch over the Cilicians.

21
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,470
You seem you favor their fucking company.

22
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,470
You will regain sense.

23
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,920
It is you who has lost sense.

24
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,830
Yet I now doubt path he travels.

25
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,020
Then perhaps the time has come,

26
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,410
to forge our own.

27
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,920
See them cleaned of blood and salted,

28
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,720
to hold rot at length.

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,280
They maybe yet some purpose.

30
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,580
Agron.

31
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,230
I would share a moment.

32
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,030
I have no time nor desire.

33
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,990
Perhaps Castus is less taken.

34
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,620
I do not care for the way his eyes frame upon you.

35
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,220
A gaze I grew familiar with

36
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,790
when we were yet slaves to Batiatus.

37
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,780
I fear return to days of old.

38
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,740
There are many who believe Crixus holds higher ground,

39
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,610
with the slaughtering of the prisoners.

40
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,330
And where do you stand, in such regard?

41
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,580
With you.

42
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,140
And always shall upon field of battle.

43
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,480
Return to the villa.

44
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,900
I would have you guard Laeta and her people in my absence.

45
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,050
Is it wise leaving city walls with so much unsettled within them?

46
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,720
Should you not attempt words and the healing of festering wound?

47
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,600
I'm done with words.

48
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh, you must learn our tongue.

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,550
So you would know what curses she rains upon you.

50
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,920
I prefer the bliss of ignorance.

51
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,710
As all men should, huh.

52
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,290
We break for Sicilia, and the promise of blood.

53
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,160
It is ill time for drink.

54
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,560
I but lend support to brother Lugo.

55
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,670
I fear the water.

56
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,610
And the monsters within it.

57
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,820
All has been prepared for your voyage, King Spartacus.

58
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,190
As agreed upon.

59
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,740
With many times its weight to follow.

60
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,130
More than enough for wine--

61
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,960
and for soft lips around you cock huh,

62
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,130
to remove lingering thoughts of the Syrian boy.

63
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,730
You do not sail with us?

64
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,070
Heracleo is for more pressing matters.

65
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,920
I paid for your services.

66
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,680
You paid for my ship.

67
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,160
And who shall helm it?

68
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,220
That is what I pay Tryphon for.

69
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,450
Good fortune, King Spartacus.

70
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,000
I shall raise a cup in your honor.

71
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,970
Come Captain.

72
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,470
Let this night be forever remembered.

73
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,050
Begin!

74
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,760
You wish to fight now?

75
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,540
Where was such lust for blood when stood against Spartacus?

76
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We are mired in piss and shit because of you.

77
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,750
Because you turned and fled like frightened children

78
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,600
in the face of our enemy.

79
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,390
It is cruelest fate that you yet draw breath.

80
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,480
While the man who stood ground beside me

81
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,130
was struck from this world

82
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,330
for your fucking cowardice!

83
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,030
- Clear way! - Move! Move!

84
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,870
I would not have our stores fall below reasonable note.

85
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,680
See more grain brought from holdings in Sicilia.

86
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,010
Imperator.

87
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,550
Senator Metellus.

88
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,760
Apologies for lack of proper reception.

89
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,280
I was unaware you'd strayed so far

90
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,080
from the comforts of mother Rome.

91
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,420
I seek neither vain formality nor luxurious appointment.

92
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,300
Only answer to singular question,

93
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,130
why did the Senate granted you an army

94
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,890
only for it to stand idle half day's march from Sinuessa?

95
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,020
The Senate did not grant me an army.

96
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,770
They granted command.

97
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,060
Every horse, every sword, every man your eye lays upon

98
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,190
was purchased with coin from my own vaults.

99
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,170
Shall be set to purpose by the will of Marcus Crassus alone.

100
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,750
Was it your will that sounded retreat against

101
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,100
Spartacus in inaugural confrontation?

102
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,890
You were dispatched to balm

103
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,380
grievous wound suffered against him.

104
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,490
Not to inflict further injury with such unfortunate news.

105
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,730
A minor skirmish foolishly engaged.

106
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,620
Those who turned from their duty have been dealt with.

107
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,560
News that also inflames ear.

108
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,610
Is it true you exhume putrid spectre of decimation?

109
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,530
I but give needed lesson in commitment.

110
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,910
When next my soldiers face Spartacus

111
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,980
it shall be the rebel who falls to misfortune.

112
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,880
The people shall greet such event with celebration.

113
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,210
As they greet word of Pompey's victory in Hispania.

114
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,050
He has defeated Sertorius?

115
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,360
And soon shall be once again upon our shores with his own legions.

116
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,520
It shall be of a comfort...

117
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,570
if Spartacus yet plagues us.

118
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,730
Spartacus shall be far from thought

119
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,520
in advance of the adolescent butcher's return.

120
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,940
Your tongue rattles bold noise.

121
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,130
But here you sit absent thunder and purpose.

122
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,050
What would you have me do?

123
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,890
Hurtle myself against city walls in mad attempt.

124
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,810
I would have you bring this to an end, Imperator.

125
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,930
A thing already set to motion.

126
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,120
Caesar is within Sinnuessa,

127
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,930
secreted among the rebels.

128
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,260
Caesar?

129
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,850
You would place our fate

130
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,350
in the hands of that arrogant fucking boy?

131
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,960
Spartacus will not be put to grass by brute force,

132
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,360
as Pompey would surely attempt.

133
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,430
He's a man of keen intellect,

134
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,600
and must be dealt with in kind.

135
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,810
You speak as though you admire the man.

136
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,750
He came from humble beginnings,

137
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,930
and now even the Senate trembles before him.

138
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,260
I find no greater cause for admiration.

139
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,320
The Senate does not tremble--

140
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,980
except in anger that you fail to act.

141
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,060
I but wait for proper opportunity.

142
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,930
Yet if a small force advanced upon above Sinuessa

143
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,860
would assuage fears...

144
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,130
How many men?

145
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,610
How many did you travel with?

146
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,590
You would seek to order my men to do what you will not?

147
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,980
I would seek to include you in glorious victory.

148
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,430
If thought does not appeal, return home.

149
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,870
And leave matters of war to the men who wage them.

150
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,120
You give me sword?

151
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,730
You've proven yourself trusted, Lyciscus.

152
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,900
And I would see you well armed,

153
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,310
were another attempt made upon my life.

154
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,840
Gratitude.

155
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,620
I long to see it put to proper use.

156
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,390
As do I.

157
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,290
A desire well shared.

158
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,140
Soon we shall throw open gate,

159
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,290
and split Roman ass with cocks hard of purpose.

160
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,500
What of Spartacus?

161
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,310
Will he return from voyage upon sea to join us?

162
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,480
Spartacus is no longer among us?

163
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,750
I was down at the docks when he departed

164
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,520
with Gannicus and the Cilicians.

165
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,960
You did not know of this?

166
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,300
No. I did not.

167
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,640
He protects the fuckin' Romans,

168
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,300
and now treads water with Heracleo, absent word?

169
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,100
Heracleo does not sail with them.

170
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,060
He remains in Sinuessa?

171
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,050
With his man Castus.

172
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,710
They are for drink, and baser pleasures.

173
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,290
And what of Agron?

174
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,450
Was he stroking Spartacus' cock when ship set to wave?

175
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,690
I didn't see him.

176
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,670
Seek Heracleo, and gain knowledge upon subject.

177
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,330
We will have words with Agron.

178
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,800
The fucking chasm widens.

179
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,890
Gratitude, for the food.

180
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,680
And the protection you provide my people.

181
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,730
I do only as commanded.

182
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,550
It is still a kindness,

183
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,360
much appreciated.

184
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,430
She fuckin' appreciates us.

185
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,760
You and your people

186
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,480
would have us all for the afterlife.

187
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,610
As we would have you.

188
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,750
But for the mercy of Spartacus.

189
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,290
Give way or see brains upon the ground.

190
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,580
Turn from whatever intentions cloud mind.

191
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,160
You will not lay hands upon these people!

192
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,450
We give no fuck towards your Roman pets.

193
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,050
Why has Spartacus left the city?

194
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,140
Where did you hear of this?

195
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,810
Give fucking answer.

196
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,250
Seek it from the man himself upon his return.

197
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,990
I thought more of Spartacus, than a coward

198
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,240
of secrets and schemes.

199
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,980
As you schemed to slaughter these Romans against his command?

200
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,660
They are the enemy.

201
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:03,110
No different to the ones we suffered beneath as slaves.

202
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,360
Or the ones who took your brother's life.

203
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,130
There stood a time when you followed your own heart

204
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,790
in matters of blood.

205
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,860
What does it tell you?

206
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,770
That we are different men now.

207
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,580
Not all of us.

208
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,470
Let Spartacus know I will have words, when he returns.

209
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,670
I have born witness to many of your mad plans.

210
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,260
Never did I believe they would lead us across the seas.

211
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,440
Last I found myself upon them, I was in chains.

212
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,950
Bound for Roman soil.

213
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,910
My wife taken from me.

214
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,630
A thing they shall eternally regret.

215
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,550
Of that I have no doubt.

216
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,650
Yet of current intentions,

217
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,020
my mind is of less certainty.

218
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,560
Crixus runs wild within the city,

219
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,520
Crassus threatens growing storm without.

220
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,010
Time ill considered for assault towards wheat in Sicilia.

221
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,990
Heracelo tells of shipments large in the gathering,

222
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,240
tended for Marcus Crassus.

223
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,110
I would sever a blow to the man himself,

224
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,050
not his purse.

225
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,940
The food is meant to feed his army.

226
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,880
Seizing it will aid in weak them,

227
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,920
and force Crassus to fall to desired path.

228
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,290
Point well made.

229
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,390
One perhaps you would divine absent my words,

230
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,420
were head not forever steeped in wine.

231
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,720
A man must do what he can to brace

232
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,010
against the shit of a simple day.

233
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,500
I hold you towards loftier esteem.

234
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,050
As would most loyal to our cause... if I were to fall.

235
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,420
You know my thoughts towards the subject.

236
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,120
I am no leader.

237
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,690
You proved yourself more one than Crixus,

238
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,930
when streets flowed with unfortunate blood.

239
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,100
Had Naevia not put me to ground,

240
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,310
I may have spilt the same.

241
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,930
No.

242
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,230
You would not have.

243
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,290
They come to land.

244
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,990
And blood of fucking Romans.

245
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,740
Perhaps one day you will find reason closer to heart,

246
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,840
to assume deserved mantle.

247
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,360
And perhaps I will fall this very night.

248
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,070
and leave you to weep with the other women.

249
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,760
Keep formation!

250
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,770
You wish to leave us?

251
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,770
Sanus will send you on your way!

252
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,550
Crassus well provides us.

253
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,160
No escape.

254
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,420
All dead.

255
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,200
Let us see what more he has to offer this night.

256
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,590
I look into his eyes,

257
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,940
and no longer gaze upon the boy I knew.

258
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,320
I have witnessed cold distance in his stare.

259
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,360
You should break words and draw him near, where he belongs.

260
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,010
Nothing do I crave more.

261
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,860
Yet he has to find his own path,

262
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,560
or be forever lost.

263
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,230
Of course.

264
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,290
I speak my heart, absent thought.

265
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,160
It weighs heavy, seeing one so loved cast adrift.

266
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,330
I can offer him no light upon welcoming shore.

267
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,410
Yet you may appear

268
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,990
as bright as the North Star,

269
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,700
constant in its guidance.

270
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,030
I'd do anything to ease the suffering

271
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,800
of both son, and noble father.

272
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,300
When you are within my arms,

273
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,180
the world falls from concern.

274
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,410
You will forever find me there.

275
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:56,390
Until the gods tumble from the heavens.

276
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,080
At last the fucking dice from favor.

277
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,870
I shall see balance of what you have stolen returned.

278
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:05,680
I shall see balance of wine drained from cock.

279
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,830
The night is young and so are the whores.

280
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,030
Linger, see both properly aged.

281
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,190
Another game, then.

282
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,600
I came about winnings easily,

283
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,990
I would part with them hard.

284
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:26,050
Would that all profited so in dealings with Spartacus.

285
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:30,990
I fear blood soon to replace desired coin,

286
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:35,960
when news meets of the rebel king's madness in Sicilia.

287
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,470
It is a thing to trouble thoughts.

288
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,790
And Spartacus commanding your ship,

289
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,750
forcing you to shore as he sails towards uncertain fortune.

290
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,940
A decision made of own fucking mind,

291
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,250
absent cracks threatening foundation.

292
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,440
To set upon holdings of the richest man

293
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,280
in all the Republic

294
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,640
is invitation for

295
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,220
calamity and collapse.

296
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,380
Spartacus moves against Crassus on Sicilia?

297
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,400
I would clear head and cock,

298
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:15,750
before more piss flows from errant tongue.

299
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,220
Move my darling.

300
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,430
Come on.

301
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:22,030
I think Crixus would be eager to learn this.

302
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,350
Pause.

303
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:31,140
Let us see what more can be drawn from Cilician waters.

304
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,420
I was of similar mind.

305
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,260
You must eat.

306
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,400
The man resents we yet draw breath.

307
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,740
You do not stand object of his displeasure.

308
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,280
Agron. Pause a moment.

309
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,440
Spartacus is due upon docks.

310
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,440
I would greet his return.

311
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,420
And I would have much needed words.

312
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,310
I yet have none to break.

313
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:16,090
Is it a common trait among men east of the Rhine to run from a fight?

314
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,410
No.

315
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,300
Yet I have learned it one of a Syrian to shit lies

316
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,830
from mouth and deem them sweetest nectar.

317
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,610
I have not broken trust with you.

318
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,560
You were with Castus.

319
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,120
After I commanded you remain absent his company.

320
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,590
Commanded?

321
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,260
The collar that once bound my neck is but distant memory.

322
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,610
Do not think I will slip it 'round again for you.

323
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,630
Do not raise fucking hackle.

324
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,520
If I had been discovered with the Cilician

325
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,030
after promises made to you, you would be of equal passion.

326
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,440
I came upon Castus in the street

327
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,910
while Crixus and the others were seized with madness.

328
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,620
We broke for you and Spartacus,

329
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,320
absent time even for words to pass between us.

330
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:55,550
And I am to believe of all within the city

331
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,800
he miraculously appears by your side?

332
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,310
As I would believe you.

333
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,300
In all things.

334
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,490
Agron, we have a fuckin' problem.

335
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,540
How many crest hill?

336
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,980
Thirty by count.

337
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,830
Perhaps more concealed by dawn's mist.

338
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,190
Scouts.

339
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,920
Their numbers stand too few for advance.

340
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,870
Soon they shall swell, their legions crashing upon us.

341
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,420
Then perhaps we should send message

342
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,220
of the folly of such an attempt.

343
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,690
Gather weapons, and prepare to open gate!

344
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,260
Spartacus would not allow foolish attack on Crassus.

345
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,200
Whilst he lays assault on the man in Sicilia?

346
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,860
He moves towards Crassus,

347
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,040
and yet we're to sit here stoking cock.

348
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:59,670
Let us show Crassus that all the coin in the world

349
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:03,390
will not stay his blood upon fucking ground!

350
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,360
You do not lead these people.

351
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,120
Perhaps it's time I should.

352
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,000
Crixus!

353
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,530
Why are you assembled with rising intent?

354
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,820
To meet those of Rome, gathered upon hill.

355
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,850
He's given order to throw open gate.

356
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,000
I would see it opened as well.

357
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,040
At last he falls to fucking reason.

358
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,450
Well you mistake me.

359
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,870
I do not give command to see Crassus' men engaged.

360
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,660
Then what moves purpose?

361
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,880
I would see what remains of our Roman guests released.

362
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,040
You set them free?

363
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,560
You have lost fucking mind.

364
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,520
As you have lost voice in all decisions of worth.

365
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,060
Attempt to raise gate in advance of my word.

366
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,820
And you will find it forever shut behind you.

367
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,830
It seems another life,

368
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,850
when we were embraced by the warmth of your father's villa.

369
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,530
For some a place of each chill.

370
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,590
When last did food pass lips?

371
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,920
A thing of no care.

372
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,390
To me nothing stands more so.

373
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,730
Let us fall to the comfort of my tent,

374
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,120
and turn from unforgiving ground.

375
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,130
I remain with my men.

376
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,960
As the Imperator would have it.

377
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,650
Your father cares for you more than you know.

378
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,110
His hand offered through touch of my own.

379
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,060
You come to me upon his order?

380
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,300
He has chosen to make gesture.

381
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,960
Just as you must choose how it is received.

382
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,660
What of your men that set upon us?

383
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,610
They now stand willing to see us live?

384
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,930
They are no longer my men, nor stand for reason.

385
00:27:58,690 --> 00:27:59,910
I will see you from the city,

386
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,820
and far from their wrath.

387
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,680
Would you have come to such compassion

388
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,590
in advance of unfortunate events.

389
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,560
We've both been deeply wounded by them.

390
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,610
You have suffered but annoying scratch.

391
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:13,050
Do not seek to place it upon level with severed fucking limb.

392
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,950
I seek nothing, except the parting of ways.

393
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:18,310
From you, and those who would break from my command.

394
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,530
You forced Crixus and the other from Sinuessa?

395
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,170
They'd remain within cursed walls.

396
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:29,600
I am for Sicilia with those yet loyal and points beyond.

397
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,620
The mighty Spartacus.

398
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,370
Turning from noble cause.

399
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,910
I but choose another path.

400
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:41,010
One slick with blood, as any you travel.

401
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,210
One Rome set me upon.

402
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,160
Be thankful I leave its shores.

403
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,120
And pray to your gods I never return.

404
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,510
Move them back.

405
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,800
Move! Stay back!

406
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,030
We shall have your blood upon a day!

407
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:15,890
You are blessed because Spartacus stands a fool.

408
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,240
Move aside.

409
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,250
You put us all at risk!

410
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,020
I but move more to victory!

411
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,110
By setting our enemies to the winds?

412
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,450
You place wrath upon errant hem.

413
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,260
Crassus stands truer enemy.

414
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,860
And you deliver weapon into waiting hands.

415
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,370
Laeta and the others have been among us too long.

416
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,880
What they might have heard or laid eyes--

417
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,560
They laid eyes on two brothers divided.

418
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,480
A chasm we must bridge.

419
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,920
One widen by your schemes in Sicilia.

420
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,750
A thing Crassus will believe as well.

421
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,860
When Laeta tells him of it.

422
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:33,300
You release her, so he will know of your plans?

423
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,910
And when he moves to halt them...

424
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,400
We shall see the man and his legions to their end.

425
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,990
Heracleo and his ships will carry half our forces in waves to Sicilia.

426
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,650
Sanus and a clutch of trusted men to ensure

427
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,240
the Cilicians stay true to bargain.

428
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,780
Am I to remain in the city?

429
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,650
With those known to be loyal to you.

430
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,530
At least that is what Crassus will believe.

431
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,680
The Roman bodies we have salted will be clothed to our cause,

432
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,050
and placed to give the illusion of presence.

433
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:05,120
You shall lead your forces through northern gate

434
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,600
and across Melia Ridge,

435
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,660
while we set upon Crassus' grain holdings on the island.

436
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,990
He will have no choice but to break men

437
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,030
in order to protect his supplies.

438
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,600
Dividing his legions...

439
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,430
Giving you time to crest the ridge...

440
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,830
and drop upon his remaining forces

441
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,140
while they yet believe you within city walls.

442
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,000
I will be too few to defeat him.

443
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,240
Alone, perhaps.

444
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,040
Yet I would not have you so.

445
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,290
We shall slip from Sicilia

446
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,740
after Crassus' men have landed to engage us.

447
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:33,360
And from the sea we shall join our brothers.

448
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,360
Setting upon Crassus' weakened forces from two sides.

449
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,000
You knew of this, when we broke words?

450
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,940
I held only Agron to confidence.

451
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,550
Gannicus being brought to knowledge during return from sea.

452
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,090
I could not risk Laeta and the others

453
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,730
discovering true intention.

454
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,160
You fucking shits!

455
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,390
You have been disagreeable of late.

456
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,490
Any wonder you and your woman were left from fold?

457
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,040
We must move past it.

458
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,030
Or fall to ruin.

459
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:09,810
Diotimus told of the ridge being impassable this late in season.

460
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,910
A thing the Romans will believe as well.

461
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,030
You shall prove them in gravest error.

462
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,710
A lesson I long to teach.

463
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,990
See our people quietly upon land.

464
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,410
and make swift return for more.

465
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:27,990
I shall try not to kill to many Romans short of your presence.

466
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,000
You've had your fill of women and drink?

467
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,250
I'm a man of the sea.

468
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,400
And do not belong from it.

469
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,580
If Castus ever awakes form drink,

470
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,290
give word and we shall return for him.

471
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,210
Gratitude, for all you have done.

472
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,320
None deserved.

473
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,230
I am but for coin,

474
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,670
and the weight of it in my hand.

475
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,180
You shall have it upon return.

476
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,730
A glorious day for all.

477
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,430
Until such time.

478
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,830
King Spartacus.

479
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,280
It is a mad fucking plan.

480
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,480
The sort I most favor.

481
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,080
You deem report from northern efforts accurate?

482
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,780
I do, Imperator.

483
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,150
Then we but await divinity of the moment.

484
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,680
If sign from the gods is all you seek to spur intent...

485
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,730
Then lay wanting eyes upon it.

486
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:25,300
Spartacus releases a clutch of prisoners from Sinuessa.

487
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:28,820
You will find what this one carries upon tongue of pressing interest.

488
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,220
Well come. Break silence,

489
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,400
and see more discerning mind gauge worth of it.

490
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,860
Spartacus and his men move against Sicilia.

491
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,920
What of the remainder?

492
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,010
They have fractured from the man and yet hold the city.

493
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,550
Now is our chance!

494
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,950
Sinuessa stands but partially defended.

495
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,320
So it would appear.

496
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,580
Must brought great suffering, to witness the fall of your city?

497
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,690
Beyond the telling of it.

498
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,090
And yet you survived.

499
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,070
A most fortunate blessing.

500
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,720
Bestowed only by name of Aedile's wife.

501
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,410
You stand married to Ennius?

502
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,310
Do not see the point.

503
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,130
Give reply.

504
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,050
When he was yet of this world, yes.

505
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,320
Spartacus knew of this, and forced me

506
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,210
to lend aid in dealing with the Cilicians.

507
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,460
You gave aid to the man that robbed you of husband's life,

508
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,760
in order to save your own?

509
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,190
To save as many of my people that yet drew breath.

510
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,210
A thing I would do again, if so needed.

511
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:30,850
Imperator.

512
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,970
The woman gives vital information.

513
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,890
Why do you continue to stand idle?

514
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:41,220
As I have said, I but pause for opportunity, now presented.

515
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,070
Gratitude for your spirit.

516
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:45,890
We shall break words again, once we retake your city.

517
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:48,150
Give command to prepare for march.

518
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,140
You have wine?

519
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,540
Falernian.

520
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,510
A gift from your father.

521
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,020
Come, let us share a cup.

522
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,450
The legions have been called to formation.

523
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:16,210
I pray it a favored sign.

524
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,750
That the war will soon be over, and we may return home.

525
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:23,040
To be met with glory and laurels.

526
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,260
For the Imperator and the men that yet serve beneath him.

527
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,850
To move without cherished son

528
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,440
weighs upon his heart.

529
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:35,680
I do not speak of myself.

530
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,860
But of those robbed of life by intemperate command.

531
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,360
Know that it was not given lightly.

532
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:47,420
Nor absent regret.

533
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,360
Would that I had drawn this stone,

534
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,880
and had fallen in Sabinus' place.

535
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,410
You do not mean that.

536
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,160
Would the world not still turn absent my presence?

537
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,860
Would the Imperator not still march towards desire's end,

538
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,860
absent dragging weight of constant disappointment?

539
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,130
Your father loves you, Tiberius.

540
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,390
It appears he loves you more.

541
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,290
A thing far removed from truth.

542
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,390
Everything will be as it should, little master.

543
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,200
Everything will be as it should...

544
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,260
Apologies.

545
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,970
You mistake intent.

546
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,500
No.

547
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,980
You mistake mine.

548
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,060
He took something from me.

549
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,950
And I would have something in return...

550
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:11,630
Stop this... Tiberius --

551
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,190
You forget your place.

552
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,670
Despite fine appointments and elevated worth,

553
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,850
you are yet a slave.

554
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,780
And shall do as I fucking command.

555
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,660
See all amphoras of pitch from atop wall.

556
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,300
Crixus shall find need of them upon the ridge.

557
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,470
Vertiscus! Correus! With me!

558
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,380
Move along.

559
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,710
Keep moving.

560
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:38,100
Move. Move.

561
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,080
Move along!

562
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,440
Litaviccus.

563
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,080
See her safely towards encampment.

564
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,080
All we could lay hands.

565
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,960
No more in city.

566
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,200
I pray we hold enough.

567
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,890
I pray we hold enough wine.

568
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,630
We forge journey towards new beginnings.

569
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,930
I would have one between us as well.

570
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,270
Would you now?

571
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,700
Your friend, the blacksmith.

572
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,460
Though he forced my hand,

573
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,990
I know now,

574
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:12,370
he did not deserve such a fate.

575
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,830
And your hand so forced when you made assault upon me?

576
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,840
Would you not have done the same,

577
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,540
to protect one you love?

578
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,920
You are a true warrior now, Naevia.

579
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:28,340
Lay hand upon me again for whatever reason,

580
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,070
and I will treat you as one.

581
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,130
Keep moving!

582
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,750
Move!

583
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,000
Move!

584
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:41,910
Move!

585
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,320
Keep moving!

586
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,170
Clear streets! Move out!

587
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,770
You move in wrong direction, brother.

588
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,140
We are for Crixus and Melia Ridge.

589
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,630
I would move towards more promising opportunities.

590
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,780
Well as would fucking I.

591
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,380
Yet Crixus has come to terms,

592
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,310
and we are but mortal men following in the path of gods.

593
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,310
We follow path to frozen death,

594
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,120
while Spartacus sails towards warm embrace of Sicilia.

595
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,380
He would not have you, so stained with the blood

596
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,210
of those Roman shits he gave protection.

597
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,800
The die has been cast,

598
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,780
and we must see game to bitter end.

599
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,870
I suppose we must.

600
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,480
Come.

601
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,970
Let us join Crixus--

602
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,610
Have you lost your fucking mind, Lyciscus?

603
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,510
It has always been my own.

604
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,830
That of Gaius Julius Caesar.

605
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,080
You stand Roman?

606
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,460
As you stand for the afterlife.

607
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,500
Wait! Wait--

608
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:09,440
stay your hand and I will offer aid!

609
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,700
You would turn against your people?

610
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,370
These- these are not my people!

611
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,860
I come from lands east of the Rhine,

612
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:26,320
and I would draw breath to return to them upon a day.

613
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,040
I can see you close to Spartacus.

614
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:34,960
And together--

615
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,120
we can end the mad fuck.

616
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,250
An offer much appreciated...

617
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,780
yet I have made other arrangements.

618
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,640
Move to your purpose and clear the streets!

619
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,350
Clear the streets!

620
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,620
See what delays Agron and Donar.

621
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,170
I would have leave of this fucking city.

622
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,710
As would I.

623
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,560
Gannicus.

624
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,350
I thought you for the ridge.

625
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:58,290
I did not wish to leave without words.

626
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,090
Would that I could stop them.

627
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,860
Before you came to the city,

628
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,530
I prayed to the gods that they would deliver me

629
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:05,110
from the hands of my dominus.

630
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,420
And in you my prayers were answered.

631
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,900
I have heard this tale before.

632
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,600
and found it equally misguided.

633
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,780
I do not ask you to believe it true.

634
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,900
Only to accept that it is what I hold to heart.

635
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,770
I accept it.

636
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:22,400
Now on your way.

637
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,500
May the gods watch over you.

638
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:33,540
And you, if I can not.

639
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:47,090
Drive on! Secure the ship! Make ready!

640
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,180
Their return stretches hour.

641
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,440
Cilicians are not known to be of such concerns.

642
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:55,420
Nor of good manners

643
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,090
nor proper bath.

644
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,480
Apologies.

645
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:01,870
The fates conspired towards unfortunate delay.

646
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:04,410
Where is Sanus?

647
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,050
Gone from this world.

648
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,310
He fell to the Romans?

649
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,140
To their desires...and to the weight of more coin

650
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,050
than even a king could offer.

651
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,460
Apologies, brother.

652
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,570
I did not wish you such an end.

653
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:28,440
Over here we must see that the be retaken!

654
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,740
Gather the last of the pitch and see it to Crixus.

655
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,360
Meet upon the docks when you are finished--

656
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,120
Romans!

657
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,200
You fucking traitor!

658
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,750
No, a fucking Roman.

659
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,370
Spartacus!

660
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,870
Open the gates!

661
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:10,450
Donar, The Rope!

662
00:49:58,330 --> 00:49:59,200
Crixus.

663
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:02,370
Crixus.

664
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,210
Fucking pirates.

665
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:16,120
You come to aid most fortunate moment.

666
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:21,090
As you have often done.

667
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:34,600
Spartacus!

668
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,530
Those are Roman ships.

669
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:56,860
Fall back to the ridge.

670
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:00,620
Move!

671
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,710
Fall back!

672
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:39,670
Whatever your plan...

673
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,370
it dies with you, Roman.

674
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,430
Now would be time to run.

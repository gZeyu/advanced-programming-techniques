6
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,200
Before you came to the city,

7
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,810
I prayed to the gods that they would deliver me

8
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,440
from the hands of my Dominus.

9
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,260
And in you my prayers were answered.

10
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,620
Then see it repaid, by staying far from my presence.

11
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,950
And men of my kind.

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,300
Spartacus releases a clutch of prisoners from Sinuessa.

13
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,860
You gave aid to the man that robbed you of husband's life,

14
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:26,890
in order to save your own?

15
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,670
A thing I would do again, if so needed.

16
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,130
Your father loves you, Tiberius.

17
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,730
No, he took something from me.

18
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,090
And I would have something in return.

19
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,530
Apologies, brother.

20
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,530
I did not wish you such an end.

21
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,990
We are betrayed!

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,650
We must see gate opened and city retaken!

23
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,350
Fucking traitor.

24
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,330
No, I'm fucking Roman.

25
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,600
Did I not tell you that you should run?

26
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,500
We must hold the gate!

27
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,800
There are too many!

28
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,980
Fall back!

29
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,360
Fall back!

30
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,310
Welcome to Sinuessa.

31
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,190
Where did fucking these appear from?

32
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,640
The gate has fallen!

33
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,790
We have been betrayed.

34
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,200
Fuck!

35
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,630
I stand eternal fool for laying trust in Heracleo.

36
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,630
Heracleo?

37
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,760
It was Lyciscus that turned upon us.

38
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,930
He stands fucking Roman.

39
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,330
Fucking shit!

40
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,400
That is why he aided the Cilicians.

41
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,080
They have fucked us as well?

42
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,820
Where is Nasir?

43
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,410
Dispatched with Lugo to call warning.

44
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,500
I must find him.

45
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Carry word to break for northern gate.

46
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,460
We must see all that remain to safety of the ridge.

47
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,360
You would have us run?

48
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,370
I would have us live.

49
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,260
Then we must fight and make our stand here --

50
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,680
Crassus has seized the moment.

51
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,600
We are not prepared to face him in the streets.

52
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,900
Nor will our numbers pass through northern gate

53
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,210
before he descends upon them.

54
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,690
I will cause distraction, and gain needed time.

55
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:20,820
By what means?

56
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,630
I have no fucking idea.

57
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,550
No, move with the others,

58
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,660
I will draw the Romans away --

59
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,380
This is not request!

60
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,840
You lead these people.

61
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,210
If you were to fall it would be fatal blow.

62
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,280
My passing of lesser concern.

63
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,010
Of concern to me.

64
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,470
Gannicus --

65
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,200
Go!

66
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,010
I will find you when it is done.

67
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,460
We shall wait as long as we are able, brother.

68
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,580
You mad fuck.

69
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,960
Do not die.

70
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,210
Nor you.

71
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,220
Go with them, quickly.

72
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,000
Go.

73
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,470
My passing would be of even lesser concern than yours.

74
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,120
Stay close to heel.

75
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,340
I would not greet this night our last.

76
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,840
Have you lost mind?!

77
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,070
Castus came to aid!

78
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,230
He and his people aid only the fucking Romans!

79
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,800
I do not know of what you speak!

80
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,210
I awoke from drink to find my brothers gone.

81
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,490
He had no hand in this.

82
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,850
Agron...

83
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
More come.

84
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,430
We must go.

85
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,180
Make attempt to seize weapon,

86
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,040
and I'll have your fucking life.

87
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,560
We move for the ridge.

88
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,410
Go!

89
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,430
Not much of a plan, is it?

90
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,520
If you hold better one, break words.

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,090
Gannicus...?

92
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,760
Jupiter fuck me.

93
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,040
Why are you yet within the city?

94
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,650
I was upon path to leave it when the Romans came.

95
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,960
I did not know what to do.

96
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,310
Gannicus.

97
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,630
Hold tears.

98
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,200
Stay by my side, do not make a sound.

99
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,180
Or see us all to the afterlife.

100
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,810
Go!

101
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,020
They abandon hope and burn the city.

102
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,140
The rebels have set torch to horreum.

103
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,650
Three centuries have been dispatched to quell --

104
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,960
Recall them and move towards commanded path.

105
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,170
Imperator.

106
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,600
Spartacus attempts to turn victory into ash

107
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,270
and you recall your men?

108
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,180
I have set plan to motion,

109
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,190
and will not fall to distraction.

110
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,200
We advance on northern gate!

111
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,640
Form up!

112
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,710
Keep pace and do not pause!

113
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,360
Quickly! Hurry!

114
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,400
Move!

115
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,850
Donar!

116
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,190
If I am to die,

117
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,330
it lifts heart to share final moment with you.

118
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,680
Many have fallen this night.

119
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,300
You shall not be among them.

120
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,870
Keep pace!

121
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,780
Spartacus!

122
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,900
Castus.

123
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,650
You traitorous fuck.

124
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,770
He knew nothing of this.

125
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,010
By his own fucking tongue.

126
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,770
This is not time to fall to quarrel!

127
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,270
Bind his hands and see him through the gate with the others.

128
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,050
Those who can fight take rear position as you take to the ridge!

129
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,010
Take him!

130
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,980
Move quickly, and do not turn back!

131
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,440
Fall back!

132
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,280
See all through the gate!

133
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,450
Hold!

134
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,020
Attack!

135
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,510
We must seal gate behind us!

136
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,900
Oh, Crixus!

137
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,850
Go!

138
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,910
The man you seek.

139
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,280
Spartacus!

140
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,930
Seize him!

141
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,530
Even the gods grant aid to the fucking man.

142
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,640
They but delay inevitable fall.

143
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,370
Bring ram to bear.

144
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,860
Sentries to guard sundered gateway.

145
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,720
We do not follow?

146
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,900
In time.

147
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,380
Sweep the city for any of his followers that yet hold breath.

148
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,260
So that we may rob them of it in celebration of glorious victory.

149
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,800
Fuck your little bird, you Roman cunt.

150
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,870
Search everywhere.

151
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,690
Search them all!

152
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,140
Give men rest and meal.

153
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,640
Tomorrow's dawn shall see them march upon the ridge.

154
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,900
What of followers' camp,

155
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,070
and the Romans freed by Spartacus?

156
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,850
Shall they be moved within safety of city walls?

157
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,890
Only soldiers to be permitted within.

158
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,650
Any found absent proper watchword

159
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,650
to be executed upon sight.

160
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,970
I would not have streets swollen with bodies errant rebels

161
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,140
yet could secret themselves among.

162
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,240
Though deserving few shall be granted consideration.

163
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,660
Dispatch your men and see all upon this brought to villa.

164
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,890
Imperator.

165
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,250
Ah, you return to form, Caesar.

166
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,230
A most welcomed sight.

167
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,160
I was only just praising him for his ability

168
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,200
to blend so effortlessly with a pack of savage dogs.

169
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,220
A thing of ill consideration,

170
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,400
had Crassus not plucked scheme from fevered brain.

171
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,990
I am of regret to have ever laid doubt upon it.

172
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,260
The Senate will be most pleased

173
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,880
to greet news of Sinuessa en Valle's liberation.

174
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,660
Linger before return to Rome,

175
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,050
see it celebrated with Carnificina.

176
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,420
Executions?

177
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,770
As night greets us.

178
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,810
I've set aside one of the finest villas

179
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,190
for you to rest and see yourself to bath, until such a time.

180
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,710
A gesture unexpected, yet much appreciated.

181
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,420
Gratitude.

182
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,210
Preening little fuck.

183
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,380
A sentiment shared.

184
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,880
Yet he holds the ear of the Senate,

185
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,910
and I would see him well satisfied

186
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,730
to further bolster tale of our victory carried back to Rome.

187
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,760
You speak again of victory shrouded from discerning eye.

188
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,180
Spartacus yet lives,

189
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,350
with considerable force aiding him upon Melia Ridge.

190
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,040
There is no escape from the ridge.

191
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,610
It stands impassable.

192
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,370
Words most likely broken by the fool Glaber

193
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,090
when he had the rebel trapped upon Vesuvius.

194
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,350
You believe me the fool?

195
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,730
I believe you a man of infinite plots,

196
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,120
twisting upon themselves to shame Gordian knot.

197
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,090
Praise well received.

198
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,340
Now part mind from troubled thoughts,

199
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,800
and allow it returned.

200
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,760
The rebellion has suffered fatal blow.

201
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,480
At celebration I would honor hand that struck it.

202
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,720
Would that the Thracian's head

203
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,570
upon pike bore witness to such laurels.

204
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,440
Hold fast to patience,

205
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,300
a thing that has propelled us to the ground we now stand upon.

206
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,600
And in briefest passing shall claim Spartacus

207
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,110
and all those who yet follow the doom of his shadow.

208
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,900
No one's here.

209
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,470
They take leave?

210
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,710
Not all.

211
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,730
Thousands more swell in streets.

212
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,870
The ones above spoke of victory,

213
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,610
great numbers lost to us.

214
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,310
Coupled with the curse that Spartacus yet eludes them.

215
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,440
He is a troublesome man to kill.

216
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,710
I have attempted it myself upon occasion.

217
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,730
The gods favor him.

218
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,900
And bless us as well.

219
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,540
They piss upon us and you welcome it as cooling rain.

220
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,370
We are alive.

221
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,630
Because they yet guide your hand.

222
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,990
One I have faith will see us from darkest hour.

223
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,960
Would that I shared the same.

224
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,520
You have done this before.

225
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:46,930
My dominus inflicted many wounds upon his slaves.

226
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,060
I often tended their injuries.

227
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,650
Who tended yours?

228
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,270
Diotimus showed a kindness.

229
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,130
Did he now?

230
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,940
He stood as a brother to me.

231
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,910
Apologies.

232
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,540
You struck down the man that took his life.

233
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,080
The man that took my own,

234
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,110
a small piece at a time over span of years.

235
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,300
Would that it had made difference.

236
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,850
You have made all in the world.

237
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,690
Hold!

238
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,680
See her hands freed of bond.

239
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,910
This woman stands no fucking slave.

240
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,010
I know you.

241
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,720
Do I not?

242
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:04,540
You have laid eyes upon distorted reflection of the man before you.

243
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,960
I was secreted among the rebels,

244
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,660
beard upon cheek and lies upon tongue.

245
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,630
You stood with Crixus and his animals

246
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,970
as they slaughtered my people, bound in chains.

247
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,810
A deed of much regret.

248
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,130
Yet born of necessity.

249
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,930
I could not risk discovery short of turning the Cilicians to our cause.

250
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,110
In war, one does what one must to survive.

251
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,750
A burden not unfamiliar.

252
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,990
Crassus would have word.

253
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,800
You are to be fed proper meal and bathed in rosewater,

254
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,560
in the villa you once called home.

255
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,380
Come.

256
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,930
Apologies.

257
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,090
I did not move to frighten.

258
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,840
Recent events set nerves to edge.

259
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,380
See grave concern give way.

260
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,310
The city is taken,

261
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,360
and I stand unscathed.

262
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,340
A great victory.

263
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,360
One whose celebration,

264
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,350
I would have you share in.

265
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,490
I am to stay here, with you?

266
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,160
Would you stand pleased by it?

267
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,590
Beyond the telling of words.

268
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,890
There is no cause for tears on such a day.

269
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,590
They are of joy,

270
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,890
to find myself delivered from followers' camp.

271
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,600
Delivered?

272
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,710
Has it grown so unpleasant?

273
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,820
Unbearably so...

274
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,720
The fault is mine.

275
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,820
I lay upon Kore heavy burden,

276
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,890
of lending ear to my grief

277
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,670
in the passing of Sabinus.

278
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,490
And my hand in it.

279
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,490
A man does what is required,

280
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,410
when fate calls upon him.

281
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,770
As all soldiers must.

282
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,750
Kore served greater comfort

283
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,200
than you will ever know.

284
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,100
Yet I fear my pain has,

285
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,990
pressed hard against her.

286
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,050
I pray you are not too delicate to bear such weight.

287
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,060
I stand no soldier in this conflict.

288
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,990
Yet I too shall do what I must.

289
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,460
I am forever grateful.

290
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,790
See wine and food prepared.

291
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,460
Yes, Dominus.

292
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,540
This war has forever changed her.

293
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,950
She does not stand alone is such regard.

294
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,870
I am but hardened by it,

295
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,160
and the lessons it has taught.

296
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,470
I had thought decimation

297
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,820
in threat of pulling you from reason.

298
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,030
Yet you rise like the phoenix,

299
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,460
the fire of purpose filling eye.

300
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,940
And soon shall take your place again as my word and my will.

301
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,310
Soon?

302
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,070
You did not summon to reinstate me into the legion?

303
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,880
I would have you present carnificina for the men.

304
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,030
It will elevate you in the eyes of the legion

305
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,160
to be seen in such giving spirit.

306
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,740
And ease the way for you to again assume command.

307
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,230
A privilege then.

308
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,710
And opportunity to honor you and your triumph.

309
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,290
You mistake intent.

310
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,490
We shall honor Caesar as the victor.

311
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,510
There is no love lost between us.

312
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,230
Surely there must be more fitting service that I might --

313
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,870
A shrewd man turns rival to valued ally.

314
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,310
Caesar is blessed with storied name,

315
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,800
and shall one day rise to shame the very sun.

316
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,970
Make peace,

317
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,550
and bask in glorious light.

318
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,830
He shall be awarded all respect deserved.

319
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,130
Many a boy may enter a war.

320
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,750
Yet at it's end,

321
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,910
only a man will emerge.

322
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,700
It warms my heart to see you become one.

323
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,810
I am what you have made me.

324
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,390
More soldiers return.

325
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,870
They pry wood and beams searching for vermin.

326
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,000
If we stay, will they not find us?

327
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,200
They will.

328
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,330
Is there nothing we can do?

329
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,720
There is but one thing.

330
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,390
Pray.

331
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,760
If any but my visage return,

332
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,350
take your life.

333
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,470
It will be a kindness in comparison to what they will do to you.

334
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:29,890
Rebel!

335
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,050
Here!

336
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,990
I got him!

337
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,130
I begin to believe in your gods.

338
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,510
Let us see how far they will take us.

339
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,980
Falernian.

340
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,860
A taste I recall you favor.

341
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,880
It is for your father.

342
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,370
As are many things.

343
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,090
The Imperator has much pressing upon mind.

344
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:23,970
Laying more upon it

345
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,250
would only serve to open grievous wound.

346
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,920
Do all the years I have cared for you stand for nothing?

347
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,320
They have brought me greatest comfort.

348
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,560
It would sadden heart,

349
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,510
to see you turned from our house.

350
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,140
Or set to cruelest punishment...

351
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:46,370
If he ever learned how you willingly

352
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,440
gave yourself to me in attempt to ease my pain.

353
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,630
If errant word falls from mouth,

354
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,820
only suffering will follow them.

355
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,320
At the hands of the Imperator.

356
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,030
Or my own.

357
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,720
And I will not be as gentle next time.

358
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,450
You stand a vision.

359
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,630
One to rival my own beloved wife.

360
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,750
It is as a dream, to be resurrected so.

361
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,850
Come.

362
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,200
Crassus awaits your company.

363
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,280
She has been prepared,

364
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,550
as commanded.

365
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,190
When last I laid eyes,

366
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,480
you appeared as defiled effigy,

367
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,670
marred by calamity of war.

368
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:27,220
Now restored to graven image of Venus herself.

369
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,640
Gratitude.

370
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,390
For all that you have done.

371
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,660
I would take my leave,

372
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,650
if I am of no further use.

373
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,320
Fall to your chambers in advance of celebration.

374
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,290
You shall find welcomed gifts,

375
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,800
most deserved.

376
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,590
You hold celebration?

377
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,040
Carnificina.

378
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,240
In honor of our victory against the rebel king.

379
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,760
Apologies.

380
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,170
I fear I am not yet of strength --

381
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,690
I did not imagine you would be of attendance.

382
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,260
It is a blessing you yet draw breath.

383
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,600
One bestowed by Spartacus himself, was it not?

384
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,390
As I have told you,

385
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,430
I exchanged words with the man only in hope

386
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,690
of sparing what remained of my people.

387
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,660
Know that I find no fault in it.

388
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,390
The whole of Rome echoes with

389
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:16,360
inflated legend of the Bringer of Rain.

390
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,500
I would hear air filled with truer tale,

391
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,260
of Spartacus the man.

392
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,830
I knew him only as captor.

393
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,620
I do not move to trap you.

394
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:32,470
I but crave honest appraisal of worthy adversary.

395
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,340
One I shall soon meet upon field of battle.

396
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,710
Spartacus seems...

397
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,530
not the beast, one would form thought of.

398
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,340
And in place of horns and sharpened claw?

399
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,100
A wounded heart.

400
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,550
Yearning to balance scale.

401
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,140
I know of his wife,

402
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,380
and his thirst to avenge her death.

403
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,730
No he is not consumed by a thirst for blood.

404
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,990
Perhaps he stood as such once,

405
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,580
yet now...

406
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:16,820
he fights for what he believes is just.

407
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,600
There is no cause more dangerous.

408
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,110
He will not stop.

409
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:25,770
I do not believe he could, even if he so wished it.

410
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,700
Then he and I stand the same.

411
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,830
Each believes himself the hero,

412
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,760
the other villain.

413
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,900
It is for history to decide who is mistaken.

414
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,830
Until such a day,we shall play our parts upon fortune's stage.

415
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,990
As each of us must.

416
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,100
The city is yours, mighty Crassus!

417
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,260
I would see to agreed upon price

418
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:04,110
for aiding in its return to Roman hands.

419
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,950
You set bargain with this fucking shit?

420
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,910
One of gravest cost.

421
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,460
Coin to set Midas to envy is carried to your ships.

422
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,710
See yourself far from my presence.

423
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:18,960
Or witness rise of morning sun from the shores of the afterlife.

424
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,940
I will take most welcomed leave by night's end.

425
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,830
With all that I have been promised.

426
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,240
I am a Roman.

427
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,390
One that gave aid to our enemy,

428
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,840
for whatever the reason.

429
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,670
You cannot do this.

430
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,010
It is already done.

431
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:55,590
It is the rarest of things, to see a man that honors his words.

432
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,520
Stay beyond agreed upon hour,

433
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,270
and you shall know the bitter truth of it.

434
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,500
May the gods grant all that you deserve.

435
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,270
mighty Crassus.

436
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:09,000
As they have granted Heracleo.

437
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,260
Come, my love.

438
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,200
There are many wonders beyond these walls

439
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,970
I long for you to see.

440
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,260
You wish to break words?

441
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,140
Tiberius.

442
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,580
It warms heart,

443
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,040
to see you recovered from your recent misfortunes.

444
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,180
Come, drink wine, let us regail --

445
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,080
My time is of short offering.

446
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:06,660
I am taken with preparing celebration in your honor.

447
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,060
Gratitude for the effort.

448
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,000
Is there anything you desire towards it?

449
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,950
Honeyed wine?

450
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,530
Roasted boar?

451
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:20,260
Oysters plucked from Poseidon's garden?

452
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:25,100
I would merely attempt to honor you with gift.

453
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,450
As you honor me.

454
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,080
This is Canthara.

455
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,590
Born east of the Nile,

456
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,330
but do not judge her for it...

457
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,990
Followers are not allowed within city walls.

458
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,690
It is a gift from your father.

459
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,260
One I would share.

460
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,680
Did he command you to do this?

461
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:46,600
As he commanded me to pay tribute to you?

462
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,110
Return to more willing flesh.

463
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:59,860
The boy favors contention over cunt.

464
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,980
I but favor truth.

465
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,410
The Imperator would see us to common ground.

466
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,560
I find us far removed.

467
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:15,210
As mortal from a god.

468
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:20,420
One set upon a small band of rebels

469
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:23,180
with support of a century,

470
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,300
lost his sword, turned heel and fled.

471
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:31,860
While the other, strolled into the jaws of the beast.

472
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,330
absent weapon, and brought down

473
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,930
an entire city with but cunning and silver tongue.

474
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,440
Refresh mind.

475
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,560
Which do you stand?

476
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:46,750
Upon a day my title shall be returned to me.

477
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,320
And place you beneath heel --

478
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,300
I have delayed you too long from pressing charge.

479
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,150
And the opportunity it brings,

480
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,370
to earn small sum of respect

481
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,760
from those of us that stand as soldiers.

482
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,170
Oh, and Tiberius?

483
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,200
Oysters.

484
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,430
The streets stand too swollen.

485
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,530
And rooftops alone will not carry us free of the city.

486
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,510
Gannicus...

487
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,040
Halt.

488
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,600
Part way.

489
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,340
The traitor yet lives.

490
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,920
I move beneath protection of your Imperator.

491
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,940
Your ship stands in opposing direction.

492
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,730
I would present precious bounty

493
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,550
with offering of affection,

494
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,060
before taking to unforgiving sea.

495
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,550
Let them pass.

496
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,890
You look upon me as a monster.

497
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,750
Yet am I not more desirable fate?

498
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,290
With husband fallen to the afterlife,

499
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,770
what life would you have among the Romans?

500
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,760
You are a woman.

501
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:21,290
No better than a slave to them.

502
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,840
I bestow loftier consideration.

503
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,660
I would never bargain you off,

504
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,510
as Crassus has done.

505
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:35,490
Nor would I lock you in a cage

506
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,060
and pass you about,

507
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,000
as my men would have me do.

508
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,760
No...

509
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,280
you shall stand beside me,

510
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,040
a queen upon the sea.

511
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,480
My greatest treasure.

512
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,670
And all who cross our path

513
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,950
shall know that you are mine.

514
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,200
No!

515
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,020
Heracleo, no!

516
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,560
Apologies for the pain I cause, my love.

517
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,900
No, no!

518
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,920
That is the worst if it my love.

519
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,710
I do not believe it so.

520
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:01,060
It lifts spirits to see you alive,my friend.

521
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,020
Many of my brothers did not fare as well.

522
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,250
An act born of necessity,

523
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,290
and raised with heavy heart.

524
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,260
I much liked King Spartacus and his companions...

525
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,750
Well, most of them.

526
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,600
Yet I was given a choice

527
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,070
between a wealthy life, or die a merciless death.

528
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,900
Which to a man of my sort, is no choice at all.

529
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,910
I know what thoughts pass through mind.

530
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,050
That we are but shit-eating Cilicians,

531
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,590
no match for a god of the arena.

532
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,140
Perhaps this is true, my friend.

533
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:39,670
Perhaps my sword will find your woman's throat, before I fall.

534
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,760
A thing you must appreciate

535
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,150
in such a delicate situation.

536
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,910
She is not my woman.

537
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,890
Sibyl!

538
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,660
So you do care for the little one, huh?

539
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,940
But it's a pity now that you have killed her.

540
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,120
No!

541
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:52,900
You are hurt?

542
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,580
We must move quickly before we are discovered.

543
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,520
What of Laeta?

544
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,330
What of her?

545
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,750
We cannot leave her.

546
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,610
She stands Roman.

547
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,390
She won't be seen with us.

548
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:13,480
I stand nothing but a slave.

549
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,220
As you once did.

550
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:13,040
You are truly gifted at motivating your men, Crassus.

551
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,980
As all great leaders must be.

552
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,700
Do not allow the Senate to hear you describe me as such.

553
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,710
They might well tear you asunder in like fashion.

554
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,520
Give no worry to such thought.

555
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,490
You shall gain their gratitude

556
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,520
in blow struck against Spartacus,

557
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,530
and return of Sinuessa en Valle to

558
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,560
rightful embrace of its citizens.

559
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,560
We've just begun!

560
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,480
Apologies, but I must serve correction.

561
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,390
The citizens of this fair city

562
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:43,950
were all laid to grass by rebellion's fury.

563
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,350
Not all.

564
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,340
All of note.

565
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,950
What of the Aedile's wife?

566
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:55,080
She has left these walls, never to return.

567
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,910
You would claim entire fucking city for yourself?

568
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,620
A wise man does not fight for glory alone.

569
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:15,750
The Senate will not easily swallow bitter news of such greed.

570
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:19,040
Greed is but a word jealous men inflict upon the ambitious.

571
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,090
They will be made to see past it

572
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,850
and oblige us in the spoils of war.

573
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,150
Us?

574
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,490
I would share in good fortune, of course.

575
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:34,310
Perhaps the villa you now occupy

576
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,700
and a portion of the taxes levied upon port?

577
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,530
If the Senate could be persuaded that we are

578
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:43,220
deserving of such bold claim?

579
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,500
We have done the impossible.

580
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,690
Surely we should be rewarded for it.

581
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,890
Let us have final tribute of blood,

582
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:19,140
in honor of Gaius Julius Caesar!

583
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,650
Caesar!

584
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:28,110
Caesar!

585
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,370
Roman fucking cowards.

586
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,050
Shit running your leg in thought of giving sword

587
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,990
and proper contest.

588
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:41,610
And what would you do if graced

589
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:44,310
with such opportunity, savage?

590
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:49,850
Such spectacle is deeply appreciated.

591
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:52,430
Yet the fall of Spartacus greeted more so.

592
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:00,090
Carnificina comes to an end.

593
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,760
The rebel king to soon follow.

594
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,510
Imperator.

595
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:06,100
Honored guests.

596
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:09,150
We come this day to praise a man

597
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,340
considered above all others.

598
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:15,050
A man possessed of such good fortune

599
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,120
that he must indeed be blessed by the gods themselves.

600
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:26,870
In storied tradition of Carnificina,

601
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:30,740
the ultimate kill signifies pinnacle of victory.

602
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:40,470
Shall we award Caesar the privilege of delivering fated blow,

603
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:46,370
with sword of steel in a war he began with but...

604
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:48,980
tongue of silver?

605
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:59,240
Caesar! Caesar!

606
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,240
You choose your words with care.

607
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,960
As all who must, in such position.

608
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:33,570
This man shall fall not in honor of Caesar.

609
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,120
Nor the great House of Crassus.

610
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,380
He shall fall in honor of the glory of Rome!

611
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,980
Glory of Rome!

612
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:08,840
Kill him!

613
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:10,310
Hold!

614
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:24,670
It is the will of the gods,

615
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:29,460
that this beast shall see himself free of shackles.

616
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,550
So that I may prove myself worthy of the praise

617
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:36,330
bestowed upon me by our Imperator...

618
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,330
and his boy.

619
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:52,880
Come then.

620
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,090
Let us see what challenge your rebellion truly offers.

621
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,730
They hold celebration?

622
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:15,060
Executions, for those among you yet of this world.

623
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,130
I will have blood in their name, upon a day.

624
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:21,950
Stay to the alleys and lesser streets as I guide.

625
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,180
And perhaps live to see it so.

626
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:03,020
If this man stands for all of the rebellion,

627
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,120
celebration may hold premature.

628
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:58,020
Let this man's death serve as

629
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,850
harbinger for the fate

630
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:04,450
that we shall inflict upon Spartacus himself!

631
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,380
Well fought, brother.

632
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:18,140
Swallow cock, you Roman shit.

633
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:37,970
Behold!

634
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:43,840
Their greatest warriors take their own lives in fear of Caesar!

635
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:56,580
Caesar!

636
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,860
We will not make it.

637
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,160
Can you ride?

638
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,190
I've seen it done.

639
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:15,450
Stay close.

640
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:17,600
We will not turn back for you.

641
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:40,300
You there.

642
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,890
I thought Heracleo granted but one woman.

643
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:53,470
Where did he come by this one?

644
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,020
Go!

645
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:36,300
Hiyaa!

646
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,430
Sound the alarm, you worthless shits!

647
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:39,660
Close gate!

648
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:42,670
The rebel escapes! Man the gate!

649
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:00,800
Why do we not move after him?

650
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,000
Must Julius fucking Caesar risk life to

651
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,150
kill every last Rebel himself?

652
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:07,660
To attempt the ridge at night would see us to disadvantage.

653
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:10,280
And by morning he will be to the wind with Spartacus

654
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:14,170
and the rest of his rebel horde you allowed to escape.

655
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,530
I have allowed nothing but the illusion of hope.

656
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:19,810
When sun breaks my legions shall begin final march,

657
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:22,160
spurred by dread of decimation

658
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,840
and dreams of glory sparked by celebration in your honor.

659
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,580
Spartacus is no fool.

660
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:30,520
You expect him to wait in driven snow,

661
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:33,170
for you to arrive and announce his end?

662
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,600
That is exactly what I expect.

663
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:00,590
We cannot remain here.

664
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:01,930
What would you have us do?

665
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:03,710
Sprout wings and soar towards warming

666
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:04,990
embrace of fucking Apollo?

667
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:07,510
We should turn and retake Sinuessa.

668
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,640
The city is lost.

669
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:10,850
As we shall be,

670
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:12,480
if we do not act.

671
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:17,880
Fuck the gods.

672
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,700
And I believed myself a difficult man to kill.

673
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,230
Spartacus!

674
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,420
You bring us a prisoner.

675
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,130
Laeta now stands as you or I,

676
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:23,870
beneath heel of Republic.

677
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,050
She may yet live,

678
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:27,790
if her wounds are tended.

679
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:29,240
See it done.

680
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,340
Lugo.

681
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:35,620
It is miracle any of us before you yet draw breath.

682
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:40,940
The gods themselves must have taken note of delivered prayer,

683
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:46,050
in order to see us from certain end.

684
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,540
I fear they have but delayed it.

685
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,190
How is such a thing possible?

686
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:10,310
Nothing is beyond reach for the richest man in the Republic.

687
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,110
Crassus.

688
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:17,910
It was always his intention, to trap us upon this ridge.

689
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,970
He will march from the city with his armies behind us.

690
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,840
And when he comes...

691
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:29,640
death shall follow in his wake.

692
00:55:31,750 --> 00:56:29,640

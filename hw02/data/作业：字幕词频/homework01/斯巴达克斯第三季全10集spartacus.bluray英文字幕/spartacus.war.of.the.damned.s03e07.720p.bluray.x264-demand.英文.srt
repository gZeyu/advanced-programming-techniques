6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,830
I begin to believe in your gods.

7
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,840
I ordered them to stand ground but they fled.

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,240
What punishment would you have me inflict?

9
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,700
He took something from me.

10
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,140
And I would have something in return.

11
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,690
If errant word falls from mouth, only suffering will follow.

12
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,140
Come, my love.

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,790
She stands a Roman.

14
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,350
I stand nothing but a slave.

15
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,660
You will regain sense.

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,150
It is you who has no sense.

17
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,350
Donar!

18
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,610
- Fucking traitor. - Have you lost mind?

19
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,520
Castus came to aid!

20
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,770
We must see all that remain to safety of the ridge.

21
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,300
Move quickly! And do not turn back!

22
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,630
Spartacus!

23
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,320
Spartacus is no fool.

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,350
You expect him to wait in driven snow

25
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,730
for you to arrive and announce his end?

26
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,700
That is exactly what I expect.

27
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,750
Give count to those who have fallen! I would have number!

28
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,360
The gods march us halfway to fucking Olympus,

29
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,670
only to piss on us from atop a wall.

30
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,160
Spartacus.

31
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,590
Crassus' army approaches from the mountain pass.

32
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,540
Move all those who cannot fight to safe distance.

33
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,350
See the others to weapons.

34
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,990
We will show the man forged of gold

35
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,670
the cost of our lives.

36
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,120
We shall see Roman blood upon fucking snow!

37
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,520
Or our own in glorious death!

38
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,010
Hold!

39
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,370
Calm yourselves!

40
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,560
Your words move against purpose.

41
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,150
We must press attack,

42
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,130
before his army washes over us.

43
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,020
They do not intend to advance.

44
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,000
The gods hold you privy to the future now, do they?

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,540
I am but familiar with unfortunate past.

46
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,340
I served in the Roman auxiliary when I was yet of Thrace.

47
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,300
Crassus' men did not fall to battle formation.

48
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,410
But they hold advantage of numbers.

49
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,070
Why pause short of blood?

50
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,250
They but await their commander.

51
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,130
The legion takes position upon the ridge?

52
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,830
With your praetorium to be set at forward position, as commanded.

53
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,910
Break urgent word when it's prepared.

54
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,620
I would lay eyes upon war's end at nearest opportunity.

55
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,820
Imperator.

56
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,740
I have been delayed from appointed hour by pressing need.

57
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,380
Apologies.

58
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,610
How fares Caesar?

59
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,820
He yet licks his wounds.

60
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,230
Or rather drops coin for more pleasing form to apply balming tongue.

61
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,100
Gratitude for seeing duties to completion,

62
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,930
and not falling prey to baser desires of your own.

63
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,760
A man must choose proper moment to seize pleasure.

64
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,980
Mine is forever entwined with your own.

65
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,960
I stand moved by sentiment.

66
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,620
As I do by the way you've afforded yourself of late.

67
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,870
You honor me, Imperator.

68
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,510
You honor yourself in deed and action.

69
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,660
I would see such spirit greet newest command.

70
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,480
Speak it, and see it done.

71
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,230
I wish this chest spirited from sight.

72
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,390
A simple task, yet one of grave importance.

73
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,000
Where shall I place it?

74
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,540
Crack seal, and make own decision.

75
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,080
My armor...

76
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,020
The hour rushes to Spartacus' end.

77
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,380
I would have my Word and my Will

78
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,020
once more at my side upon final battle.

79
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,030
I would have my son.

80
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,750
As I would stand with you.

81
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,990
Father.

82
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,590
See yourself to proper dress.

83
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,780
There is much of our future to turn upon discussion.

84
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,300
You prove yourself yet mortal.

85
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,910
A scratch, all but forgotten.

86
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,800
I will see to fresh bandage.

87
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,930
Wine and the warmth of your thighs

88
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,960
is all comfort needed.

89
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,560
Blood shall wait upon the day I draw it from those

90
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,180
who have dared move against me.

91
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,960
And they shall tremble with fear...

92
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,710
As I now tremble before Jupiter's cock...

93
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,210
Vacate!

94
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,700
Quick as you can!

95
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,860
A storm is coming.

96
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,060
And with it death upon frozen wind.

97
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,310
Storm certain, yes.

98
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,890
Yet not its hour...

99
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,970
You would move to fuck,

100
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,420
with Rome's might breathing upon our necks?

101
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,650
If I for afterlife,

102
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:10,370
I take memory of your cock inside me.

103
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,230
Let us turn thought from ourselves,

104
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,530
and see them towards deeper needs.

105
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,640
Your words sound as Spartacus.

106
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,110
They are my own.

107
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,400
Heed them as you will.

108
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,670
You traitorous fuck!

109
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,830
Donar, Nemetes and hundreds of our brothers

110
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,500
lay dead in the city.

111
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,040
Yet you take fucking meal!

112
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,100
Gratitude.

113
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,460
Your stew was turning stomach.

114
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,520
Fucking Cilician shit!

115
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,820
Brictius!

116
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,350
Fall from fucking sight.

117
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,860
If you were not Agron's boy,

118
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,050
you would stand as bloodied for shielding this little cunt.

119
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,590
Place Agron from thought,

120
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,230
if you believe your cock of a size.

121
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,440
For such a little man you speak as if a titan.

122
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,600
Do not move me to regret coming to aid.

123
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,910
Brictius is a dim brute,

124
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,520
but his tongue carries knowledge.

125
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,150
I stand a Cilician,

126
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,070
and by tether of name a traitor.

127
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,930
None should be darkened by shadow of another's actions.

128
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,580
A thing of no importance.

129
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,890
I find myself where the fates have led.

130
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,730
And call it blessing to find you there as well.

131
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,580
In chains and bloodied, yet still attempting to flatter.

132
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,320
I attempt but to live life to the fullest measure.

133
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,680
And would take arms against Crassus

134
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,370
to continue doing so.

135
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,630
You wish to fight?

136
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,260
Killing Romans was how I gained your trust, was it not?

137
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,670
Perhaps if enough fall to my blade,

138
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,320
your brothers shall one day be so moved...

139
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,780
It is a decision removed from my hands. But...

140
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,830
know that thought is well received.

141
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,960
I did not think to lay eyes upon you again.

142
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,360
Nor I you.

143
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,470
The gods mock us both.

144
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,170
You are still of this world.

145
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,490
Yet shall slip from it if you do not eat.

146
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,750
See it to one more deserving.

147
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,370
Do you seek to be pitied?

148
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,930
I seek nothing.

149
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,630
I am but ash.

150
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,340
The remains of heart's flame,

151
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,080
cooled by the Bringer of Rain,

152
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,370
who brought death to my city

153
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,210
and tore me from the life I knew.

154
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,310
Smothered by Crassus,

155
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,000
who cast me off in chains

156
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,410
for the pleasure of a savage.

157
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,510
You have known pain.

158
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,040
And loss.

159
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,480
A misfortune shared by many among us.

160
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,930
How do you move past it?

161
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,570
That's a question I've asked many times.

162
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,110
Live.

163
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,710
And help provide answer.

164
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,690
Caesar favored oysters in his celebration.

165
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,900
I would have the finest city has to offer towards my own.

166
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,590
Your father graces you again with favor.

167
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,360
A thing well earned.

168
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,670
I no longer the "Pouting boy" of days past.

169
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,490
The man my father has always longed for me to become.

170
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,860
I but wish Sabinus were yet among us.

171
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,730
Do you think he would gaze upon me with pride?

172
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,960
He held you to heart, did he not?

173
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,670
As you once did.

174
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,960
Your path carries you far from such concerns.

175
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,270
Spartacus shall fall,

176
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,720
and you shall rise to conquer foreign lands,

177
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,450
and build upon your name.

178
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,890
Far from those who once cared for you.

179
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,990
I yearn to honor the name of Crassus

180
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,780
with victory and laurels.

181
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,690
Yet after rebellion is struck

182
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,050
I shall remain rooted firmly upon current ground.

183
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,500
You are not to return to Rome with us?

184
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,080
I will be tasked with securing my father's concerns within Sinuessa,

185
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,020
until I reach proper age for title of Tribune.

186
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,080
A duty of great import.

187
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,040
One you shall aid me in.

188
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,220
I am to remain in Sinuessa?

189
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,230
Within this very villa.

190
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,310
My father grants you title of vilica

191
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,360
to oversee all who serve me beneath storied roof.

192
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:43,510
And to see comforting hand continue to guide me in life's journey.

193
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,370
One that drew me from edge of dire precipice.

194
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,530
I owe you much, Kore.

195
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:59,060
And soon I'll have the leisure of time to indulge repayment.

196
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,750
Imperator.

197
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,900
Your praetorium stands ready upon the ridge.

198
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,780
Call for my standard bearer.

199
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,120
Imperator.

200
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,530
Apologies, Dominus.

201
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,440
I have prepared afternoon meal --

202
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,960
I have appetite towards bloodier repast.

203
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,090
Again, apologies.

204
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,720
Yet I would also break needed words.

205
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,860
Well, shatter them quickly,

206
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,840
or see them to ground I once stood upon.

207
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,460
Is it true I am to serve Tiberius in Sinuessa?

208
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,760
By his tongue did news fall upon ear?

209
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,800
The boy carries my word yet spills it absent consideration.

210
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,240
I had meant to share thought with you in more intimate fashion.

211
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,560
As I would share with you troubled mind,

212
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,100
and cause of it--

213
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,920
All stands upon command, Imperator.

214
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,700
Time conspires against will of the heart.

215
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,060
We shall break words again when battle is won,

216
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:10,880
will see tears evaporate beneath warming sun of deeper intent.

217
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,150
Come, let us make show of presence upon ridge.

218
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,120
I'd have the Rebel King know what doom falls upon him.

219
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,380
Crassus erects pulvinus,

220
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,060
as if we fight for his entertainment

221
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,600
upon snow of fucking arena.

222
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,220
Then he shall behold what miracles

223
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,870
of blood a gladiator is yet capable of.

224
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,130
You speak as though all stand so.

225
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,480
The ways of us do.

226
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,220
Passed on from our very hands.

227
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,000
Too few to make difference against hordes we are pressed between.

228
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,100
Crixus is not wrong in his belief.

229
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,500
We have done the impossible, time upon time.

230
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,290
Yet by inspired tactic, not brute force.

231
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,700
What are the lay of your thoughts?

232
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,570
Crassus has become overly bold by advantage he holds.

233
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,390
He places his praetorium forward of proper position,

234
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,900
to better view anticipated victory.

235
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,170
Perhaps we should pay visit,

236
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,150
and explain fatal error.

237
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,710
Does not closer position suggest heavier guard surrounding praetorium?

238
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,120
The wind grows restless in advance of storm.

239
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,090
By night's fall, it shall serve as cloak

240
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,250
if our number is not swollen beyond intent.

241
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,400
How many?

242
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,380
Only the most skilled among us.

243
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,280
We must strike as the serpent, fast and sure.

244
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,890
If Crassus falls to our venom,

245
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,390
his legions will froth and foam absent proper command.

246
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,350
A plan well served against Cossinius and Furius.

247
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:54,180
You would send a sleeping man to the afterlife

248
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,850
when he could awaken to a nightmare.

249
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,290
A sea of death as our entire army crashes upon him.

250
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,800
Such a force would be discovered in advance of purpose,

251
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,330
and advantage lost. A thing a child could see.

252
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,590
You would brand me as such?

253
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,500
Words foolishly chosen, brother.

254
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,960
Stay by my side,

255
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,780
and when Crassus is falls from this world

256
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,320
we shall see his legions swiftly follow.

257
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,270
Lay eyes and report.

258
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,360
We shall hold perimeter against escape.

259
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,410
There shall be none for the mighty Crassus this night.

260
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,250
Donar...

261
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,400
What is carved upon his flesh?

262
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:08,760
Death is undeceivable.

263
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,750
Come on.

264
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,820
Naevia!

265
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,140
Come on.

266
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,670
Fall back to the camp!

267
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,310
Flee, you fucking coward!

268
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,990
In formation!

269
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,310
Crixus!

270
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,350
Advance!

271
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,630
Spartacus slips from snare?

272
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,990
Along with a small clutch of his men.

273
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,390
Let him feel the sting of his wounds,

274
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,840
and reflect upon the mind that inflicts them.

275
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,350
Raise Tiberius and Caesar from peaceful slumber.

276
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:54,240
The time for ploy and deception draws to an end.

277
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:09,610
Caesar at last rises from the dead.

278
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,940
As you from specter of punishment.

279
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,990
What draws concern in advance of morning sun?

280
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,860
I depart for Melia Ridge upon dawn's break.

281
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,150
A move long in coming.

282
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:20,960
Let us hasten arrival--

283
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,560
I'd have you pause to gather remaining troops yet in Sinuessa.

284
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,760
Fall to command beneath Tiberius

285
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,630
and join me before moon greets us.

286
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:33,000
Should not the man who took Sinuessa lead them?

287
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,900
Not a boy prone to losing his sword?

288
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,280
You find my gratitude short in the coming?

289
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,170
The abundant coin awarded to keep head above rising debts?

290
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:49,070
Tales of bravery dispatched with Metellus to ply ears of Rome?

291
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,810
Celebration thrown in your honor...

292
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,630
presented by the man you disrespect.

293
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,940
I need no reminder of past generosity.

294
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,430
I merely offer suggestion.

295
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,140
And I merely give command.

296
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,710
As I commanded your placement

297
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,700
behind city walls to move as my instrument.

298
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,920
I took this city.

299
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,670
As I shall take Spartacus' life,

300
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,960
with my son close at hand.

301
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,220
And where shall honored Caesar find himself

302
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,970
in the midst of such glories?

303
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,730
At equal distance.

304
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,790
If he but removes himself from his own path.

305
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,500
He falls to command, Imperator.

306
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,550
Stay true to course,

307
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,250
and we shall seize the heavens as promised.

308
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,970
I shall greet you upon the ridge.

309
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,680
Move with haste,

310
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,290
and thirst for enemy's blood.

311
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,560
Here we stand.

312
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,890
Title restored to me.

313
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,210
And you beneath heel.

314
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,150
You mind your step, boy.

315
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,300
Many a giant has tumbled to the afterlife,

316
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,790
believing himself too big to fall.

317
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,390
Assemble the men.

318
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,040
As commanded.

319
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,070
Does no one ever sleep in this fucking house?

320
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,500
Apologies.

321
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,440
I was drawn by argument.

322
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,730
And you lurked in the shadow to witness it?

323
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,800
It is a dangerous thing to be removed from them.

324
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:56,140
Since Tiberius is restored to imagined power.

325
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,280
You rattle tongue against your master?

326
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,140
I but whisper of common threat.

327
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,940
And means of striking it from mutual concern.

328
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,310
Gratitude for private audience.

329
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,870
I would not have it known that we break words.

330
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,370
They yet remain whole within fucking mouth.

331
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,000
You have witnessed foul mood.

332
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,360
Do not deepen it with mystery and obscured purpose.

333
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,210
Much has changed of late.

334
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:33,660
The boy that I once held to breast as a child

335
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,610
has now grown far removed from the tenderness of youth.

336
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,040
The thing he has become now threatens

337
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,530
to turn us both from desired position.

338
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:44,930
How deeply have you been pierced by the boy?

339
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:50,180
It must be enough to know that I stand wounded.

340
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:56,210
As you have been by Tiberius' return to exalted title.

341
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,210
So you have thought, do you?

342
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,840
Towards dressing such grievous injuries?

343
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,850
One that I should have birthed to action long ago.

344
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,410
Then do so.

345
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,600
And leave Caesar far removed from plots and schemes.

346
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,500
If victory over Spartacus is shared with Tiberius,

347
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,640
I fear their bond will be forged in permanence.

348
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,190
Cut circle with straightest line,

349
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,940
and give voice to what you would have of me.

350
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,580
It lifts heart.

351
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,220
To know you are yet among us.

352
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,780
Fate owed to you.

353
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,090
Crixus tells of how you carried me upon back.

354
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,560
It is what any of us would do.

355
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,160
For another warrior.

356
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,540
She yet requires rest.

357
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,700
She will have it, for a time.

358
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,170
Storm grows with the passing hour,

359
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,060
making Roman advance unlikely.

360
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:54,140
I would see her undisturbed by the gale of words as well.

361
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,760
Is this how it is to be now?

362
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,660
Are we always to find ourselves churning against one another,

363
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,620
as when we were yet slaves to Batiatus?

364
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,450
Forgotten days when you were yet of bolder mind.

365
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,800
If we had moved with proper force against Crassus --

366
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,100
What would have been result?

367
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,390
Peer into future of path not taken

368
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,510
and break where you believe it to lead.

369
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,680
Ground not stained with Naevia's blood.

370
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,990
You would see it but joined by thousands.

371
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,050
I would but fight.

372
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,190
Wall and trench block forward tactic.

373
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,180
Your plot against Crassus

374
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:44,220
you have been bested by more devious mind.

375
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,260
We should place sword in every hand

376
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,170
yet with strength to lift it and fall upon the Romans.

377
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,790
We are bound by canyon walls,

378
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,430
absent hope of flanking maneuver.

379
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,790
To face superior numbers possessed of armor and discipline

380
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,230
will gain us nothing but our own deaths.

381
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,670
Then let the Romans see how we fucking embrace it.

382
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,020
As we were taught to upon the sands.

383
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,340
You return to spent argument.

384
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,350
Few among us stand as gladiators.

385
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,520
They do not pray for a glorious death.

386
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,260
No. They pray to be led.

387
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,890
I will not march my people to the afterlife!

388
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:27,000
And I will not die with a Roman sword in my back!

389
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,870
I will gather those of a like mind

390
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,870
and press attack upon Crassus.

391
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,560
You will fall to command --

392
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,410
You are not a fucking God!

393
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:57,150
And I do not heed to voice upon high!

394
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,130
Crixus!

395
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,440
Have you fallen from fucking reason?!

396
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,140
A question better posed to your leader.

397
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,300
Crixus!

398
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,330
Now is not time for quarrel!

399
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,210
Medicus tent has been struck by rising winds!

400
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,840
The storm approaches!

401
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,170
See those exposed to shelter!

402
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,130
The Gods threaten to wipe clean the blight of rebellion

403
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,970
before we're able to mount attack.

404
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:30,440
Then we shall rise with morning sun,

405
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,150
and finish any they have chosen to spare.

406
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,380
Caesar.

407
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,030
I did not hear welcoming horns

408
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,640
announcing Tiberius' approach with balance of men.

409
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,680
They stand as absent as his presence.

410
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,090
You were to aid him in troops' movement.

411
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,330
Was command not clear?

412
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,720
As the air between us.

413
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,790
Yet pressing matter clouds thought,

414
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:51,330
and thunder sound toward higher duty...

415
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,640
You would bring her here,

416
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,020
upon field of battle?

417
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,510
Apologies, Dominus.

418
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,460
Caesar but bends to tearful plea.

419
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,430
From mournful tongue that must break word.

420
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,070
Leave us.

421
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:21,860
Caesar!

422
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,730
Caesar!

423
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,450
Why did you not wait at northern gate as ordered?

424
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,010
Apologies.

425
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:32,990
Urgent task drew me from the pleasure of your company.

426
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:36,120
My father will not stand pleased by word of insubordination.

427
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,370
I would pause before seeking audience.

428
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,480
The Imperator is otherwise taken...

429
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,410
by presence of beloved slave.

430
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,660
Kore?

431
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,470
You disobey command to bring a fucking woman to encampment?

432
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:52,250
She was desperate to break word with your father.

433
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:57,330
I could not find heart to deny her opportunity to gain his ear.

434
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,430
What concerns so move her?

435
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:03,040
Ah, that's the mystery, is it not?

436
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,280
Yet calm rattled nerve.

437
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,890
I'm certain father will share with trusted son

438
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,010
all she reveals.

439
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,040
Is my will to be defied at every turn?

440
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,240
Did I not tell you that wanted moment

441
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,230
would find you at battle's end?

442
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:25,340
I know my presence stands in violation of rule,

443
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,880
yet I could not wait upon the hour to see you.

444
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,120
Drink, see yourself warmed.

445
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,460
Gratitude.

446
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,040
Storm's fury stays hand in returning you to Sinuessa.

447
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,900
At first sign of its passing,

448
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,160
Caesar himself shall see you again to safety of city walls.

449
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,560
Where I am to remain when you return to Rome,

450
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,880
forever banished from your arms.

451
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,400
Banished?

452
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,950
You mistake intent.

453
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:58,670
I claimed Sinuessa for you.

454
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,240
So that we may have a place to ourselves when I am to visit,

455
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,450
frequently, far from jealous eyes and wagging tongues.

456
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,180
It is not punishment, but gift.

457
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,000
You shall rise as my name does,

458
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,070
as vilica of the House of Crassus in Sinuessa.

459
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,520
Beneath Tiberius.

460
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,190
He will be beside you,

461
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:26,590
receiving benefit of your company and wisdom.

462
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,040
As I so often have.

463
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,900
I know how much he cares for you.

464
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,820
And you for him.

465
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,780
You've helped move him from the boy he was

466
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,580
to the man he is.

467
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,770
I can think of no one more suited to further guide him.

468
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,580
I fear the prospect of blame,

469
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,650
should you find him less than expected.

470
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,430
Strike worry.

471
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,870
It is a thing beyond imagining.

472
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,030
He has proved bitter disappointment in the past,

473
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,470
has he not?

474
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:07,250
It is true that Tiberius fell to grievous error.

475
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:12,480
And I to wrath threatening to shake the heavens.

476
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,690
Yet we now stand as one,

477
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,150
and I know in deepest heart

478
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,400
there is no misstep that would see father

479
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,360
withhold forgiveness from treasured son.

480
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:35,580
I'd hoped soothing words to stem tide of overflowing tears.

481
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,350
Pay them no mind.

482
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,130
They are but lingering shadows of a foolish girl.

483
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,740
As long as the woman stands clear to heart's desire.

484
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,840
Yes, Marcus.

485
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:54,100
Everything is very clear to me now.

486
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,750
If we take in any more our difficulty

487
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,890
may be lack of air to breathe, not cold or snow.

488
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,640
I prefer the pressing of rancid flesh

489
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,460
to having cock become as ice.

490
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,810
Am I never to be free of this fucking shit?

491
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:08,270
Add to storm's bluster and see tent blown from strained mooring.

492
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,090
Castus.

493
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,020
Spartacus commands me here.

494
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,700
Choice is removed from hand.

495
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,500
Yet not from mine.

496
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,290
You would see me free?

497
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:30,320
Action born of Nasir's plea.

498
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:34,260
Know that absent them my blade would be slick with Cilician blood.

499
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,350
Gratitude.

500
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,030
Do not fucking cast that look.

501
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,120
Where is Gannicus?

502
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,750
He's not with you?

503
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,130
No.

504
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,900
Gannicus!

505
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,310
Gannicus!

506
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:16,190
With this blood... we humbly...

507
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,770
entreat...

508
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,270
Why do you not go with the others?

509
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:31,140
I must give offering...

510
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,250
the gods shall reveal path...

511
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,270
They reveal only your death,

512
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,500
if you remain on bended knee!

513
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,610
Seek shelter!

514
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:46,070
Or greet your gods upon the shores of the afterlife!

515
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,810
I could not find him.

516
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,430
I go.

517
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,360
You would be lost as well.

518
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:07,380
Gannicus will not fall to wind and ice.

519
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:11,420
Wine forever in his blood will keep him warm.

520
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,630
I have never favored the cold.

521
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,660
Share blanket, and see yourself warmed.

522
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,170
I have no need for it.

523
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,080
Your teeth threaten to shake from head.

524
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,380
As do mine.

525
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,330
Your wound gives pain?

526
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,380
It reminds that I yet live.

527
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,350
And choose to continue to do so.

528
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,490
We again find ourself in pressing space.

529
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,360
Nursing wounds and praying the afterlife does not take us.

530
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,540
You pray now, do you?

531
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,330
Upon many things.

532
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:45,570
Yet I am not dim of mind to kneel in storm,

533
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,500
raise voice to the heavens.

534
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,760
Nor spill my own blood as offering.

535
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,420
It stood as sacrifice.

536
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:55,050
For Spartacus.

537
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,690
You believe him a god now?

538
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,580
It was made on his behalf.

539
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,260
To plead for his cause and all those devoted to it.

540
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:07,670
I have doubted your belief in days past.

541
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,710
Found myself a fool for it --

542
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:17,480
You are safe...

543
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,520
you are safe...

544
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:30,830
I have warned you. To stay far from men of my kind.

545
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,040
You ask the impossible.

546
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:26,810
How many?

547
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:29,110
Nearly a thousand lost to the storm.

548
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,270
A thousand.

549
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:34,690
Spartacus...

550
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,370
I had feared you among the dead.

551
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,090
The gods took pity, and provided us with needed shelter.

552
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,260
Not all so blessed.

553
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:00,060
No. They were not.

554
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,930
We sought aid from the heavens.

555
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:14,030
To see us beyond darkness of trench and wall.

556
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:16,990
And here stands reply.

557
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,320
Yet in their cruelty,

558
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:28,370
perhaps the gods light way for those yet living.

559
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,550
You turned from fucking reason.

560
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:40,020
I have embraced it.

561
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:43,230
We shall forge trench and press attack, as you so championed.

562
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:45,590
When we held yet another thousand men,

563
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,910
now forever lost to us.

564
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,620
And what of the army that awaits beyond Crassus' wall?

565
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:53,600
How will we match their number?

566
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,760
Perhaps there stands no need.

567
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:00,840
You speak in fucking riddles, obscuring truth.

568
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,650
As Crassus obscures all he has done,

569
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,470
shrouding his moves in deception.

570
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,970
Placing Caesar among us.

571
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:09,520
Turning Heracleo to his cause.

572
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,850
Drawing us into trap within his tent.

573
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:14,820
Nothing is ever as it appears.

574
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,560
Then break fucking thoughts,

575
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:20,290
or fall from presence.

576
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:25,120
His trench stands barrier enough to halt escape.

577
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,540
Why see it coupled with impossible fortification?

578
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,660
To keep our eyes from what lies beyond it.

579
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:37,050
Or what does not.

580
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:42,210
A few man placed upon wall would give illusion of thousands beyond it.

581
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:45,290
A deception worthy of the man himself.

582
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,720
And if you are wrong?

583
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,670
Then we shall embrace a glorious death.

584
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,070
Absent Roman swords in our backs.

585
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:46,610
Your thoughts were true.

586
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,830
There stand only but a few hundred.

587
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,510
Let us warm the night with their blood.

588
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,170
Lugo! Brictius!

589
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,540
Take men and see breach made in the wall!

590
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,280
Imperator!

591
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,170
Imperator!

592
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:19,260
The rebels have breached the wall!

593
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,750
Command the legion to fall to formation!

594
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,880
Quickly!

595
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,910
Was my slave escorted back to Sinuessa?

596
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:29,760
None left your tent, Imperator.

597
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:08,200
Move quickly,

598
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,520
and follow the others!

599
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,230
Up here!

600
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:21,630
Check everywhere!

601
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:26,150
She has moved to join rebellion?

602
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:30,110
An opportunity denied her, had she not been brought to the ridge.

603
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,290
I thought her to have just cause --

604
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,150
Give report.

605
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:35,980
There stands no sentry upon the wall.

606
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,940
Nor sight of Spartacus and his army.

607
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,180
It holds no sense.

608
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:42,970
How could he have spanned trench?

609
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,260
The fucking savage.

610
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:03,460
He fills trench with his own dead.

611
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:18,210
He but seizes means left to him.

612
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:22,210
They can not have traveled far a distance.

613
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,390
Give order to advance the legion.

614
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,730
I would reclaim what is mine --

615
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,060
Protect the imperator!

616
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:42,270
We must fall back!

617
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,700
Break formation!

618
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:51,250
The mighty Crassus shows fucking ass as he flees from us!

619
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:00,170
He will return, with rams and ballistae.

620
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,270
And find his monument of illusion taken to flame,

621
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:06,550
lending opportunity to place distance between us.

622
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,500
Let us see ourselves far from here.

623
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:14,620
And honor the fallen with future victories...

624
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:19,400
and the blood of Marcus Crassus.
When sun breaks my legions shall begin final march,

625
00:53:22,590 --> 00:54:19,400

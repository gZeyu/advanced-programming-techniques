6
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,620
We shall see roman blood upon fucking snow!

7
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,340
I will not march my people to the afterlife.

8
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,330
And I will not die with a roman sword in my back.

9
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,600
I have warned you to stay far from men of my kind.

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,010
You have known pain and loss.

11
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,150
A misfortune shared by many among us.

12
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,870
Fall to command beneath Tiberius.

13
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,280
Not a boy prone to losing his sword.

14
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,700
Here we stand, you beneath heel.

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,530
- I am to remain in Sinuessa? - In this very villa.

16
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,340
- Beneath Tiberius. - I know how much he cares for you.

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,070
She was desperate to break word with your father.

18
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,860
What concerns so move her?

19
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,330
Ah, that is the mystery.

20
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,980
Was my slave escorted back to Sinuessa?

21
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,850
She has moved to join the rebellion.

22
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,360
The rebels have breached the wall.

23
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,960
We must fall back!

24
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,750
The mighty Crassus flees from us!

25
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,460
He will return.

26
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,560
Spartacus!

27
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,720
Romans set again upon rear position!

28
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,810
Crixus!

29
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,510
Is that all Rome has to offer this day?!

30
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,420
I have not yet had my fill of blood!

31
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,840
Crassus lays assault twice upon a day.

32
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,220
Yet with but a handful of men.

33
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,020
He seeks but time for his legions to narrow gap between us,

34
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,630
knowing we will slow to protect those weakest among us.

35
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,580
A strategy taking firmest hold.

36
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,780
Tell your gods that Crixus pisses upon them.

37
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,640
Crixus.

38
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,680
I would break words while he is yet of this world.

39
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,980
How many days march does Crassus find himself to our backs?

40
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,570
Stroke cock, you fucking slave!

41
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,120
See his tongue made more agreeable.

42
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,620
Four days!

43
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,460
Four days!

44
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:42,750
Four days.

45
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,510
Please.

46
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,050
Gather weapons, and rejoin march.

47
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,690
I gave what was asked!

48
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,830
I beg of you, spare my life!

49
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,450
You beg the wrong man.

50
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,310
Gone to grass three days past, by rot and stench.

51
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,330
We gained another day on Spartacus.

52
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,450
- Halt! - Is it a wonder?

53
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,380
The men have barely rested since Melia Ridge.

54
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,820
Nor will they find such this night.

55
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,790
Give command to second legion to fall from rest,

56
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,970
and continue pursuit in advance of fullest number.

57
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,230
You push them too hard.

58
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,030
Now is not the time for gentle words nor soft intent.

59
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,630
I harden towards future conflict.

60
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,410
Yet a legion on the brink of collapse

61
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,670
is ill thought towards Spartacus and his army.

62
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,740
Any within ranks unable to keep pace

63
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,530
shall be struck down where they stand.

64
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,190
Was decimation not threat enough --

65
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,660
I will not let him slip from fucking grasp!

66
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,380
Imperator.

67
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,320
Senator Metellus demands audience.

68
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,930
Metellus?

69
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,810
You dispatch me to Rome to crow

70
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,310
of the inevitable fall of Spartacus upon Melia Ridge,

71
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,560
only to have recent news brand me overreaching fool!

72
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,660
I find your tone displeasing.

73
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,860
As I find of many things swirling about failed campaign.

74
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,380
Spartacus but prolongs his end.

75
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,800
Return to Rome and deliver message.

76
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,820
I am a Senator of the Republic!

77
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,460
Not fucking message boy to deliver

78
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,640
yet more tidings of imagined victories.

79
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,950
You stand what I deem necessary.

80
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,710
Or has our arrangement slipped from mind?

81
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,230
Keep promise of villa in Sinuessa

82
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,110
and purse lined with the coin of taxes!

83
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,680
Association with the name of Crassus

84
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,050
will only serve to further taint my own.

85
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,520
Nothing has fallen to change.

86
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,060
I shall grind Spartacus and his rebellion beneath heel,

87
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,360
as I have promised.

88
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,100
Lofty words coming from a man whose most trusted slave

89
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,360
is said to have fled to join the rebel king --

90
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,600
Stay from argument.

91
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,690
You have lost fucking mind!

92
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,340
I will see the Senate cast you out

93
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,390
for laying hands upon honored member --

94
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:16,800
You...

95
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,740
will do...

96
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,680
as I...

97
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,750
fucking...

98
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,440
command!

99
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,220
Marcus.

100
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,840
Return to Rome.

101
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,530
Speak of this, or any word against me...

102
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,340
and I shall devote fortune towards your death in darkness of night.

103
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,950
See him upon his horse.

104
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,530
And second legion set to purpose towards Spartacus.

105
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,090
Give word to stand ready to move upon a moment's notice.

106
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,040
We must not fall to sense of comfort.

107
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,820
I do not favor fleeing like rabbits

108
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,280
at imagined footfall of hunter.

109
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,060
Nor I.

110
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,990
Yet we must stay in advance of Crassus

111
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,250
until numbers are replenished.

112
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,420
A wise path.

113
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,260
Though one paved with Roman heads fucking preferred.

114
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,970
We shall find our own upon it, if we fall from caution.

115
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,520
A word once unfamiliar upon your tongue.

116
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,520
Spoken now with thought towards those less able among us.

117
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,640
And yet they devour as much as any man of sword or spear.

118
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,940
He is not wrong in this.

119
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,900
Supplies are nearly spent.

120
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,190
Soon hunger will again be upon us, weighing each step.

121
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,870
Gannicus.

122
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,140
Gather Lugo and scout ahead.

123
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,440
I would know of any opportunity towards grain or meat.

124
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,970
We cannot run for an eternity.

125
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,550
One day soon we will once again have to stand and fight.

126
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,650
One day.

127
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,290
You know he holds right in this.

128
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:52,130
No ground held is certain, in times of war.

129
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,710
Is it possible?

130
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,780
To slip from jaws of Crassus yet again?

131
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,060
I will not see you caught between them.

132
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,600
I have been overreaching in my efforts,

133
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,440
and would share.

134
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,120
If you are of a mind...?

135
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,250
Fuck!

136
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,840
See fire to life.

137
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,630
And know my eyes are upon you.

138
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,260
His stare yet holds the promise of violence.

139
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,080
Continue to prove yourself against the Romans,

140
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,030
and see it soften.

141
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,240
The man need not fall to worry in such regard.

142
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,040
Yet in matters nearer the heart,

143
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,560
his concerns are well founded.

144
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,510
Rid yourself of them.

145
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,550
And break no more upon subject.

146
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,900
If you had laughed carelessly at my words,

147
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,020
I would have known feelings misplaced.

148
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,770
Yet you froth and foam,

149
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,350
showing they strike reflective chord.

150
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,480
You mistake reflection for your own.

151
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,870
And do I mistake your eyes stealing glance as I pass?

152
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,090
Or breath from lips catching when I draw near?

153
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,960
I had feared night spent beneath open sky.

154
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,980
Gratitude.

155
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,830
A thing of little note.

156
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,530
Little?

157
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,840
It was but short time past you would have found joy

158
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,730
in my suffering.

159
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,540
Do not think me so far removed from thought.

160
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,060
Then why offer hand?

161
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,580
I offer it towards Spartacus.

162
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,780
It baffles fucking sense,

163
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,980
yet he appears to carry affection towards you.

164
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,150
I-I've have not the words --

165
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,310
Nor I desire to hear them.

166
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,210
Spartacus has sacrificed much in this life.

167
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,110
He deserves some small measure of happiness in return.

168
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,270
As so many are owed.

169
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,050
Apologies.

170
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,140
I am in need of aid.

171
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,510
You must bear down.

172
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,060
As hard as you are able.

173
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,190
- Again. - I cannot.

174
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,470
Calm yourself.

175
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,820
And do as instructed.

176
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,010
The Bringer of Rain...

177
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,910
If you wish to live, bear down. Now.

178
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,320
Blade. Quickly.

179
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,590
You are blessed with a son.

180
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,710
Look at the cock on this one,

181
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,750
dangling as if from Jupiter himself!

182
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,570
I pray he uses it only upon the willing.

183
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,610
He is fortunate to have such skilled hands

184
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,040
to bring him into this world.

185
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,630
You have done this before?

186
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,930
Many times, for those owned by my dominus.

187
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,810
I wonder if I might have known of him.

188
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,170
What name did he carry?

189
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,280
Pompo.

190
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,070
A raiser of low animals near Campania --

191
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,040
She speaks of Pompo.

192
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,300
Yet mark upon her arm tells of a different master...

193
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,340
You were slave to Marcus Crassus himself?

194
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,190
I was.

195
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,500
Another spy, sent to infiltrate rank.

196
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,120
What manner of spy pauses in deceit

197
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,440
to give aid in child's birth?

198
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,780
One sent by the man trying to end our fucking lives!

199
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,130
He did not send me.

200
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,940
I fled his tent upon the Melia Ridge.

201
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,320
Why did you turn from him, in favor of cold and storm?

202
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,820
Break word.

203
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,830
Or find yourself forever unable.

204
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,060
The girl is fugitivus as many among you,

205
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,260
regardless of which dominus she fled.

206
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,160
She deserves protection,

207
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,540
not veiled threats.

208
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,160
I hide behind no veils.

209
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,400
Nor shall any bearing mark of my enemy.

210
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,660
Crassus himself has seen no harm to me.

211
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,540
Yet name of honored son inflicted grievous injury.

212
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,320
And would have continued to do so.

213
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,810
My wife stood equally mistreated,

214
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,200
by those that called themselves her masters.

215
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,780
She's your responsibility.

216
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,950
See her provided for.

217
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,590
And know if her tale falls from truth,

218
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,970
then her life shall swiftly follow.

219
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,190
Gratitude.

220
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,810
I hold concern in this.

221
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,560
Laeta breaks truth in the matter.

222
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,760
We cannot turn from any slave wishing freedom.

223
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,960
Then let her be free to starve with the rest of us.

224
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,870
See all readied before you take sleep.

225
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,710
We follow second legion at first light.

226
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,950
I do not recall commanding your presence.

227
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,170
Recent events spur initiative.

228
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,140
Fall from sight.

229
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,120
I am of a concern.

230
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,000
Towards your father.

231
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,330
What are the lay of your thoughts?

232
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,320
Fitful.

233
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,220
His manner since Melia Ridge has been...

234
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,170
unsettling.

235
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,750
He but commands with firm hand.

236
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,410
Clenched into fist striking ally.

237
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,450
Metellus spoke out of turn.

238
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,880
He is a fool, you will find no argument.

239
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,540
Yet one that stands a fucking Senator of the Republic.

240
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,000
As does my father.

241
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,280
Whose reply far outweighed balance of insult.

242
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,580
Especially for a man who prides himself

243
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,050
on appearance of control.

244
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,220
We are at war, Tiberius.

245
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,400
Against an enemy that will exploit

246
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,940
even the slightest weakness,

247
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,210
and bring us all to our doom.

248
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:36,470
Tread path of more direct route, and arrive at point.

249
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,230
Beloved son has regained favor of his father.

250
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,910
Measured counsel spilling from your mouth

251
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,000
may yet again fill him with reason.

252
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,830
And dispel troubled thought of Kore escaping --

253
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,360
The fucking cock between your legs!

254
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,910
That is why you have come to me.

255
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,530
To calm storm of his wrath before

256
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,050
you are swept away in downpour.

257
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,190
You mistake intent --

258
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,600
Were you not the one who defied command

259
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,650
to spirit Kore to Melia Ridge?

260
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,910
Giving her opportunity to betray him?

261
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,890
She pleaded with tears upon cheek,

262
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,090
to break words with your father about his fucking son.

263
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,240
A simple ruse,

264
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,120
one imagined to make escape upon Melia Ridge

265
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,150
to join the rebels.

266
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,930
Oh I believe there to be ruse.

267
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,110
Yet not one formed by mind of loving slave.

268
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,240
What did you do to her, boy,

269
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,010
to make her flee?

270
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,110
Did you force that tiny cock inside her --

271
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,170
You fucking overstep, Tribune!

272
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,280
Many times each day.

273
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,080
Yet in this, we both know I do not.

274
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,750
I will uncover the truth of what you have done.

275
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,800
And your father will fall again to reason...

276
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:57,210
when wounded heart is balmed by knowledge

277
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,560
that Kore is not the one who has betrayed him.

278
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,440
The child is born into a life of piss and shit.

279
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,350
He is free.

280
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,610
As so many among us.

281
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,770
As I stand now, because of you.

282
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,140
I wish you blessed with more than just a word.

283
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,660
An endless bounty of food.

284
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,830
And a proper home to keep you warm on coldest night.

285
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,130
Perhaps even a child of our own upon a day...

286
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,690
Yet I have not had the strength to provide you with any of this.

287
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:13,200
Your strength saw me from the mines.

288
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Guided me from the shadows, returning life to faded shell.

289
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,050
A life stained with blood and battle.

290
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,060
My path has been chosen.

291
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,990
Not by the fates.

292
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,900
Not by the gods themselves.

293
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,720
I choose to walk by your side,

294
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,630
in this life and the one that follows.

295
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,170
Until we find ourselves upon its shores...

296
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,820
I desire only to send more fucking Romans there before us.

297
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,860
I do not deserve a woman such as you.

298
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,930
You are the only man who truly does.

299
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,750
Crixus.

300
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,360
Gannicus and Lugo return.

301
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,460
Spartacus would have words.

302
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,720
They have laid eyes upon a valley.

303
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,880
Twenty or more villas nestled within.

304
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,530
Bounty of cattle and goat grazing lands.

305
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,940
Then let us fall upon them,

306
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,070
and see the blood of beasts and Romans

307
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,640
mingle beneath night's moon.

308
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,040
And upon dawn's break,

309
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,440
I would press north.

310
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,860
Towards rise of the Alps.

311
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,940
You would set up camp upon the mountains?

312
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,660
No.

313
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,740
I would cross them.

314
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,130
And upon other side,

315
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,770
see our people to the winds.

316
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,880
Has he at last gone fucking mad?

317
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,290
Crassus pursues a single army, easily tracked.

318
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,680
Thousands of slaves running free

319
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,350
beyond lands of the Republic...?

320
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,440
Not even he has resource enough to find so many

321
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,550
scattered across foreign soil.

322
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,980
All that we have done.

323
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,060
All that has been lost.

324
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,480
It will stand for nothing, if we now turn and flee.

325
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,220
If we stay, Crassus will again be upon us and --

326
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,030
Let them come.

327
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,900
We have bested them before.

328
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,230
And perhaps we may again.

329
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,920
But at what cost?

330
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,840
How many more among us will fall?

331
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,540
How many woman, unable to raise arms?

332
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,190
Or children, new to this world?

333
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,660
I would have them free.

334
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,420
Absent darkening shadow of the Republic.

335
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,540
Well, then let us pierce its heart,

336
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,070
and see shadow forever lifted.

337
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,090
Crassus' army pushes from the south.

338
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,120
If we were to turn west we would be at the gates of Rome

339
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,860
before his legions could turn to defend the city.

340
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,130
You would strike at Rome itself?

341
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,510
And would see it tremble.

342
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,330
As the man you once were thundered

343
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,030
when Batiatus fell.

344
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,210
Leave us.

345
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,420
You know that I hold higher ground on this.

346
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,880
How many Romans have we seen to the afterlife?

347
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,740
The Republic quakes

348
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,650
at the name of Spartacus and his army of slaves.

349
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,980
We have but nipped at the ankle of the beast.

350
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,710
To bare teeth at its throat, I...

351
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,770
I now fear the reprisal.

352
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,180
The Bringer of Rain?

353
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,720
The Slayer of the Shadow of Death? Afraid?

354
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,880
Not for myself, no.

355
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,400
But my concerns have grown far beyond such.

356
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,550
I grow tired of running.

357
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,340
Then rest.

358
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,400
With Naevia at your side.

359
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,580
No, she does not want to turn from cause.

360
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,450
Nor I.

361
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,360
Until Rome falls beneath our feet.

362
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,970
You would have us march to our end.

363
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,320
I would have us free.

364
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,500
Truly free.

365
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,610
Do you really believe that Crassus will stop

366
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,440
once you crest the mountains?

367
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,660
That the Republic will let us quietly slip away?

368
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,580
We have shown them vulnerable.

369
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,250
We have shown them that a trembling hand

370
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,650
can become a fist.

371
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,580
We have challenged the idea

372
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,890
that a slave must always know his place,

373
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:29,190
accepting rod and lash because he was taught to accept it.

374
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,250
We built their mighty Republic.

375
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,980
With our hands and our blood and our lives.

376
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,540
And we can see it fall, at equal cost.

377
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,190
You opened my eyes to this, Spartacus.

378
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,380
Do not ask me now to close them.

379
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,010
It was simpler between us.

380
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,400
When the bond stood only as hate.

381
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,670
Those days are sadly past.

382
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,990
With or without you,

383
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,080
I shall march upon Rome.

384
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,350
With those who share desire for vengeance.

385
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:14,220
We have fought for the choice to forge our own path.

386
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,850
I will no longer stand in the way of yours.

387
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,170
At the break of dawn then.

388
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,250
We shall at last part ways.

389
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,360
Crixus.

390
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,330
There is one final thing I would ask of you.

391
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,670
The valley is taken!

392
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,730
Let us share in the spoils of war!

393
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,230
And hold feast for Crixus,

394
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,590
and those who follow the Undefeated Gaul!

395
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,270
Blood rains down from an angry sky,

396
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,790
My cock rages on! My cock rages on!

397
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:26,700
Blood rains down from an angry sky,

398
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,160
My cock rages on! My cock rages on!

399
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,140
Blood rains down from an angry sky,

400
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,680
My cock rages on! My cock rages on!

401
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,460
It burns throat.

402
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,360
As does all proper drink.

403
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,010
Perhaps you should hold with water

404
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,320
and more purer thoughts.

405
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,840
Or perhaps you should get another.

406
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:02,780
This one's gone empty...

407
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,090
Recall when head pounds upon morning

408
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,380
but I but follow command.

409
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,990
You are with little thing, now?

410
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,420
Apologies.

411
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,270
I did not wish to see heart wounded.

412
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,320
You will ruin little thing

413
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:43,620
with drink and ways of your kind.

414
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,880
And you again will find my bed.

415
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,070
You do not share in drink?

416
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,570
I would have clear head.

417
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,870
When sun breaks, and Crixus strikes for Rome.

418
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,100
I have often been at cross purpose with the Gaul.

419
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,790
Yet his fucking presence shall be missed.

420
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,880
I shall not feel the sting of it.

421
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,740
You yet hate the man?

422
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,920
I will not miss his presence...

423
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,410
Because I shall not be from it.

424
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:47,110
You turn from Spartacus to march with Crixus?

425
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,000
Spartacus stands as a brother.

426
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:54,170
Yet in this we are not of like mind.

427
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,930
There is no life for me beyond the Alps.

428
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,290
I am no shepherd nor tiller of land.

429
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,860
Blood and battle are all I have ever known.

430
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,950
It is settled then.

431
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,030
Tomorrow we move for Rome with Crixus.

432
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,780
To hear such words lifts spirit.

433
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,600
Yet I would have you take with Spartacus.

434
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,190
My place is forever with you.

435
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,430
Not in this.

436
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,700
You once swore the gods themselves

437
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,480
could not wrest me from your arms.

438
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,090
And now you fucking cast me aside?

439
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,130
My heart will never beat for another.

440
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,190
Yet it would seize within chest,

441
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,880
if I were to drag you to your doom.

442
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,430
I am a warrior.

443
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,060
One I am most proud of.

444
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,570
Set skills to aiding Spartacus,

445
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:02,400
and see those less able to true freedom.

446
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,710
Do not ask me to turn from you.

447
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,850
I ask only that you live.

448
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,860
And wrest what joy that yet may be found in the remaining days.

449
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:29,970
Crixus.

450
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:32,750
I would break words.

451
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,360
They will fall upon hardest stone,

452
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,170
if they seek to alter mind.

453
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,840
I would seek to share drink.

454
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,980
With a man most worthy.

455
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,490
A sentiment not always held.

456
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,870
Nor always deserved.

457
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,800
By either of us.

458
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,930
I've been known to be contrary, upon occasion.

459
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,190
A talent among many that I best you in.

460
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,620
It is a wonder. We have not yet killed each other.

461
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,700
Would that we could reverse the years,

462
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,200
towards better footing.

463
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,050
I would not see it different.

464
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,960
We have done the impossible.

465
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,710
Seen the House of Batiatus to ruin.

466
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,630
Laid waste to the arena of Capua.

467
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:18,040
Defeated Glaber and all of the Roman hordes who followed.

468
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,600
Restored heart torn from chest.

469
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,140
If you and I had taken to loving arms,

470
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,090
fate may have led us on a less glorious path.

471
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,040
Batiatus once warned me

472
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,510
that a man must accept his fate --

473
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,410
-- or will be destroyed by it.

474
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,750
The fucking cunt said that to everyone.

475
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:52,130
I pray that yours holds all you desire.

476
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,250
And that one day we can greet each other again in this life.

477
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,260
Roman blood!

478
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,800
Does it cause pain?

479
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,580
All wounds heal upon a day.

480
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,760
Though I fear injury delivered to Metellus

481
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,370
may never cease to fester.

482
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,070
For all his remaining days,

483
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,290
Metellus will fear the name Marcus Crassus.

484
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:33,070
Times those beneath us must be struck severest blow.

485
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,500
To truly grasp how we tower above them.

486
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,770
And to ensure they never betray us.

487
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,810
A lesson well learned by Metellus.

488
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:45,700
Perhaps if Kore had been given similar instruction --

489
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,580
Do not form sound of her name.

490
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,220
Apologies.

491
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,910
It tears heart to know how deeply she wounded you.

492
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,080
I gave all that I could.

493
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,660
Treated her as if word of slave held no meaning.

494
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,500
Why would she risk all to fly from loving arms?

495
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,820
I hold myself to blame.

496
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:20,550
What did your hands do to cause such a thing?

497
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,070
It is what they did not.

498
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,410
I knew Caesar to be untrustworthy.

499
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:29,490
If I had laid closer eye upon him,

500
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,830
he would not have been able to see her to the ridge...

501
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,180
and allowed opportunity of escape.

502
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,980
Caesar is of wild mind.

503
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:38,750
Yet I do not believe he knew her thoughts in this.

504
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:41,480
And I believe that great power is accompanied

505
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,890
by many burdens, father.

506
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:46,640
Knowing whom to trust paramount among them.

507
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,870
Wisdom well received.

508
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,010
You are certain of this?

509
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:23,690
I have for heavy span been pulled in opposing direction.

510
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,580
A thing I have noted.

511
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,440
Gratitude for standing by my words,

512
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,820
even when you did not believe in them.

513
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,620
I believed in the man.

514
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,370
And always shall.

515
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,970
Agron.

516
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,030
I hope you find what you seek.

517
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,590
And you some measure of comfort, despite all that has happened.

518
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,670
No one is more deserving of it, brother.

519
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,040
Where is Kore?

520
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,770
Wrapped in arms of relieved slumber.

521
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,810
And filled with gratitude that she yet draws breath.

522
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,530
A kindness moved by your tongue.

523
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,590
One I did not expect to make sound towards life of a slave.

524
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,150
I mistreated none within my house,

525
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,260
when I was yet called domina.

526
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,140
Yet you held them as possessions.

527
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,630
Things to be bought and traded.

528
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:23,100
As I was by Crassus himself, or have you forgotten...

529
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,830
You have suffered but briefest moment

530
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,510
of that which so many have only ever known.

531
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,180
You desire to compare wounds?

532
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,130
Let us weigh them, and judge balance.

533
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,100
Your wounds must be all but healed.

534
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,900
You return to difficult woman of old.

535
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,760
We cannot turn from truest nature.

536
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,270
No.

537
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,980
We cannot.

538
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,190
Rejoin celebration.

539
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,820
Hard journey awaits at dawn's break.

540
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,840
I have had my fill of wine.

541
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,730
And company less desired...

542
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,510
You yet stand Roman.

543
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,810
A thing I can never hold to heart.

544
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,470
It is not your heart I'm after this night...

545
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:12,590
It seems but yesterday you stood as opened-mouthed Gaul,

546
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,170
anxious to prove yourself in the arena.

547
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,430
Now thousands gladly follow you,

548
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,740
lay assault upon Rome itself.

549
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:24,150
I would hold it as a blessing from Jupiter himself,

550
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,270
if you would join with us.

551
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,350
My journey leads toward other path.

552
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,430
There is no greater cause,

553
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,570
to turn a man from battle.

554
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:58,950
Do we stand ready?

555
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:02,540
Upon your command, we move for Rome.

556
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,860
A decision I yet hold in grievous doubt.

557
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,180
Yet if I believed in the gods,

558
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,310
I would split heavens in prayer that I was mistaken.

559
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:18,260
And I would give my all to prove you yet the fool.

560
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,040
Shoulder supplies!

561
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,090
We move north for the mountains!

562
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,280
Spartacus...

563
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,520
When we were yet of Batiatus' ludus,

564
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,860
I spoke of how we may have been as brothers,

565
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,680
in another life.

566
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,630
Yet not in this one.

567
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,830
Know that I was wrong.

568
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,870
And will always hold you as such.

569
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,970
As I will hold you.

570
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,660
Spartacus divides his forces?

571
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:28,130
The larger sum striking north towards the mountains.

572
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,980
Their numbers weighted by women and children.

573
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,740
The remainder?

574
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,080
What course do they take?

575
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,480
West.

576
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,260
Towards Rome?

577
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,380
What path would you have us follow?

578
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,410
There is but one.

579
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,440
The city must be defended.

580
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,700
Others will give resistance upon way.

581
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,500
And Arrius and his legion hold position beyond its gates.

582
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,010
A single legion will give Spartacus briefest pause.

583
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:55,470
Spartacus does not command western forces, upon sighting of exodus.

584
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,330
His pet Gaul leads assault.

585
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:58,900
Crixus?

586
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,580
A man of equal skill

587
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,780
and deadlier passion.

588
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,960
Not the Bringer of Fucking Rain.

589
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,410
We cannot leave Rome undefended.

590
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,440
Arrius will slow Crixus' advance,

591
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,490
granting needed time to set upon Spartacus and weakened numbers.

592
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,390
We must press advantage.

593
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,290
Follow advice of this child, and Rome herself may fall.

594
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,350
And with her everything we have fucking reached for.

595
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,890
I have had fill of you questioning

596
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,640
every word that falls from my tongue.

597
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,630
Then break them with more fucking sense.

598
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,170
We cannot turn from Rome.

599
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,850
We shall turn in whatever direction my father decides.

600
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,700
Then aid him in proper choice.

601
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,740
Not one you believe he seeks to hear.

602
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,650
I follow my own desires.

603
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,040
As you did when you forced yourself upon Kore,

604
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,520
the night your father reclaimed Sinuessa?

605
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,030
I warned you that your deed would fall to discovery.

606
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,420
You would fabricate lies now, to see me lessened...

607
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,090
The game is over, boy.

608
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,540
The whore Canthara tells of how she saw you come from Kore's tent.

609
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,530
Of finding her roughly used.

610
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,470
She was made to promise never to reveal

611
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,080
what her eyes laid upon.

612
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:16,080
But I can be very, very persuasive.

613
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,350
You risk all on the tale of a woman

614
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,560
who swallows cock for coin?

615
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,300
I have made more uncertain wagers,

616
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,710
in years past.

617
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,240
And yet here I stand.

618
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,920
Then why have you not yet told him?

619
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,510
He has been pushed to brink of madness by imagined betrayal.

620
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,430
I would not see him forced over precipice by truth

621
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,130
of harsher realities.

622
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,960
What would you have of me?

623
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:53,040
What you have already been asked.

624
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,310
You have your father's ear.

625
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,220
Bring him to reason,

626
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,250
breaking words as I command them...

627
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,810
I do not take command from you!

628
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,710
You should have accepted offer, boy.

629
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,280
Your father nearly saw you to end in decimation.

630
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,780
Perhaps he shall see fate to completion

631
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,870
when he hears what you have done --

632
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,440
Seize him!

633
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,810
Get up!

634
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,860
You shall never lay hands upon me again.

635
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,790
Nor whisper lies against me.

636
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:35,500
You cannot take my life

637
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,300
and see my body from encampment absent notice.

638
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,540
I am Julius Fucking Caesar --

639
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,100
Hold him against table.

640
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:52,120
You are of same cloth as Metellus.

641
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:56,100
And must be taught severest lesson

642
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,000
in who towers above you...

643
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,340
Speak of what you know to anyone...

644
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:07,190
and I shall spin tale of the mighty Caesar...

645
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,560
taken like a woman...

646
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,070
The day is ours.

647
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,890
When is it fucking not?!

648
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,220
Prepare to march.

649
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:03,030
There is one battle yet remaining.

650
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:25,110
Rome at last lies within our grasp!

651
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,880
One last legion led by the fool Arrius

652
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:37,490
is all that stands between us...

653
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:41,700
and a victory that shall become legend!

654
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:49,770
A lifetime ago when I yet stood beneath the roof

655
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,960
of the House of Batiatus...

656
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:57,140
my doctore Oenomaus demanded answer

657
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,860
from those recruits who sought glory

658
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,980
upon the sands of the arena.

659
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:07,130
"What lies beneath your feet?!"

660
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,300
Sacred ground!

661
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,620
Watered with tears of blood!

662
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,970
And this day...

663
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:22,070
it shall be Rome who sheds them!

664
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:29,950
Shall we begin?!

665
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,300
Shall we begin?!

666
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,220
Shall we begin?!!!

667
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,080
Bring fire forth.

668
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,060
Halt!

669
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:17,310
Shields!

670
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,590
Raise your fucking shields!

671
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,190
Rear position stands absent threat.

672
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,780
Pray it remains so.

673
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,160
Our numbers stand ill match absent Crixus

674
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,550
and those who follow him,

675
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,780
if Crassus were to set upon us.

676
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:05,640
Arrius has fallen!

677
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,690
You stand as a fucking god.

678
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,010
With Rome trembling before you.

679
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:16,800
As Spartacus once promised.

680
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:46,230
Give report.

681
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,480
The men stand ready, Imperator.

682
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,330
Caesar.

683
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,370
How have you come to be so rudely handled?

684
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:57,400
I found myself in shameful altercation.

685
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,700
It shall not happen again.

686
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,690
And reason you not astride horse?

687
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,130
I gave command for him to lead charge upon foot, Imperator.

688
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:10,700
To rally the common men that hold him in such high regard.

689
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,300
Let us see this to proper end,

690
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,480
and return to pursuit of Spartacus.

691
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,440
They will attempt to overrun position!

692
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,490
Let them think they have succeeded,

693
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:22,350
and fall upon them from our flanks!

694
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,390
You are the undefeated Gaul.

695
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:29,020
Let us show them how such name was earned.

696
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,520
Sound horns!

697
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:36,430
Bring spear and sword to bear!

698
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:38,930
And fall upon them all.

699
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,230
Send them to the fucking afterlife!

700
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:20,530
Father!

701
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:46,840
Fall back and re-form upon higher advantage!

702
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,800
Drink my fucking piss,

703
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:57,130
you Roman cunts --

704
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,850
Caesar!

705
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,130
Their eastern flank has been broken!

706
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:29,330
Advance!

707
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:42,490
There are too many.

708
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:46,090
If Crassus falls, we may yet seize fucking day!

709
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,830
Crixus!

710
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,240
No!

711
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:40,840
I would not have you so easily leave from this world, Gaius.

712
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:42,920
Crixus!

713
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,760
Silence that fucking bitch.

714
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:51,880
Hold!

715
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,770
This is the Gaul that would seek the fall of Rome?

716
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:01,320
And his fucking woman.

717
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,790
Defeated by my hand.

718
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,440
Retrieve your sword.

719
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:11,270
It has been too long from proper hands.

720
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:27,640
The man yet lives.

721
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:30,420
I shall see him crucified --

722
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,540
No.

723
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,960
I would use opportunity to send message to Spartacus.

724
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,280
So that he may know the depths of his failure.

725
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:44,470
And what fate I shall see him to as well.

726
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,530
Take his head.

727
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:57,530

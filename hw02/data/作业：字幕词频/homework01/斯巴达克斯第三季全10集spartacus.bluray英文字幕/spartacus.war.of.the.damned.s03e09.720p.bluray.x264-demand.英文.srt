6
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,460
You would have us march to our end?

7
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,980
I would have us free.

8
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,850
With or without you

9
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,160
I shall march upon Rome.

10
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,510
You were slave to Marcus Crassus himself?

11
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,240
I was.

12
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,160
Why would she risk all to fly from loving arms?

13
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,920
Tomorrow we move for rome with Crixus.

14
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,820
Yet I would have you take with Spartacus.

15
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,980
My place is forever with you.

16
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,410
Not in this.

17
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,950
The whore Canthara tells of how she saw you come from Kore's tent.

18
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,580
Game is over boy.

19
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,070
Take it like a woman.

20
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,190
Rome at last lies within our grasp!

21
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,610
One fucking hare between us?

22
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,650
Lower voice.

23
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,460
I do not tremble in the dark as frightened child.

24
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,390
Carry torch forward!

25
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,970
Time next, you carry bow.

26
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,230
Too far from fucking blood.

27
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,030
Strip them of weapons and armor.

28
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,840
and what supplies they yet carry.

29
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,010
These men travel from the north.

30
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,530
What purpose would Crassus have there?

31
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,660
Those who follow him are known by mark of the bull.

32
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,350
These are not his men.

33
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,820
The eagle and the dolphin.

34
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,530
I have laid eyes upon crest before.

35
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,200
The mark of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus.

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,210
Pompey?

37
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,440
A master of both land and sea.

38
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,820
My husband spoke with deep admiration of the man.

39
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,490
Bending tongue to welcome him as Rome's greatest warrior--

40
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,290
I have heard tale of his conquests.

41
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,220
And name of Adolescent Butcher given him.

42
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,500
We shall butcher bird and fish!

43
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,920
I thought Pompey mired in Hispania against the renegade Sertorius.

44
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,480
His absence the reason Crassus took arms against us.

45
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,430
If Pompey's scouts return to the Republic,

46
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,340
as night follows day,

47
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,210
the man and his legions will trail their shadow.

48
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,090
Spartacus.

49
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,050
A rider approaches.

50
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,640
This may hold but distraction!

51
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,330
Give voice if eyes fall upon movement upon flanks!

52
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,390
They wear cloak of the fucking legion.

53
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,400
That is no Roman.

54
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,270
Drink.

55
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,900
Do not waste such on the dead.

56
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,570
You yet live.

57
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,390
I a but pale shade,

58
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,070
haunting a world fallen from meaning.

59
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,740
Then we must nourish specter,

60
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,020
so that it may reclaim flesh

61
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,070
and promise of better days.

62
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,010
There stand none upon horizon.

63
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,370
Was his end as he had always dreamed?

64
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,660
In glorious battle?

65
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,510
In battle, yes.

66
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,060
Though robbed of glory.

67
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,420
Tell of it.

68
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,930
That we may share in the burden of grief.

69
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,310
The days after we parted were filled with victory.

70
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,270
The blood of our enemies turning fields to crimson mud,

71
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,910
thick with the dead.

72
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,770
Rome lay within our grasp.

73
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,620
Only to have it snatched from us by Crassus and his legions.

74
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,390
It was the man himself

75
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,630
that robbed Crixus' life?

76
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,880
Crixus!

77
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,490
Crixus was engaged by the traitor Caesar.

78
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,470
When boy of scant years

79
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,070
pierced back with spear.

80
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,340
A fucking boy.

81
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,100
What of Agron?

82
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,430
Does he share fate with Crixus?

83
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,260
Or is he yet of this world?

84
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,600
There is but single reason crassus spare my life.

85
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,240
To taunt Spartacus with vision of his end.

86
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,270
Crassus tempts to goad you into foolish action.

87
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,220
If I stood only for my own life,

88
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,680
perhaps I would stand so moved.

89
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,000
Yet we must turn from such thoughts,

90
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,220
and set purpose towards more pressing concern.

91
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,720
Pompey.

92
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,350
His scouts were headed south, towards Crassus' legions.

93
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,600
He will send more, when they do not return.

94
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,560
We cannot afford to be caught between two armies, fighting as one.

95
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,950
No. We cannot.

96
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,860
None among the Gaul's men form words of note?

97
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,050
We have set lash and heated iron towards the loosening of tongues.

98
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,020
I shall press until one unmoors from stubborn tether.

99
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,930
Or command all torn from rebellious root.

100
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,820
I have time nor patience to pause for such distraction.

101
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,170
Give word to break encampment

102
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,000
as Apollo approaches eastern sky.

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,610
I would quicken pace.

104
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,160
There is a matter of some small concern within the followers' camp.

105
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,190
A whore by the name of Canthara,

106
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,280
discovered beaten and slit as pig from womanhood to throat.

107
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,040
Canthara? What do you know of this, Caesar?

108
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,430
News only now falls upon ear.

109
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,130
I have been seeking the woman for several days.

110
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,180
Whoever she angered, his wrath is a thing to be feared.

111
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,360
Followers' camp is but brief step from our very ranks.

112
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,960
I would not have it fall to chaos and murder.

113
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,990
I shall personally attend to matter.

114
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,770
May those responsible suffer equal fate.

115
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,670
Imperator.

116
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,550
Two soldiers approach on horseback,

117
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,550
bearing crest of Pompey.

118
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,120
The butcher at last reveals himself.

119
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,390
See them to my praetorium.

120
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,020
Proconsul Gnaeu Pompeius Magnus...

121
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,240
...offers support in campaign against the rebel Spartacus.

122
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,830
Offer greeted with wondrous surprise.

123
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,080
I've never known Pompey

124
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,060
to support any cause but his own interests.

125
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,120
Apologies.

126
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,770
I but carry message.

127
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,920
Hmmm, see remainder fall from tongue.

128
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,470
Pompey requests meeting.

129
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,320
Why does he not appear before us himself, if taken by such desire?

130
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,420
Because he does not stand the fool.

131
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,400
Does he?

132
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,810
I will not risk journey to your commander's camp.

133
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,770
Nor will I break from my charge

134
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,840
to bow and scrap before imagined titan.

135
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,870
Pompey seeks but neutral ground.

136
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,600
Twenty men attending him, to be met in kind.

137
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,870
I will consider terms.

138
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,040
See them to food and wine.

139
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,340
Imperator.

140
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,600
You cannot seriously be turning offer upon mind?

141
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,290
Pompey but seeks your knowledge of Spartacus

142
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,270
so that he may snatch victory from deserving hands.

143
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,700
Caesar, you agree, do you not?

144
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,580
I share your concerns.

145
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,680
Yet Pompey returns the hero against Sertorius,

146
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,220
ripe with laurels.

147
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,960
To refuse offer would be considered insult.

148
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,280
One that could be set against you within the Senate.

149
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,770
To shit with the Senate.

150
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,570
There is practical reason as well to accept terms.

151
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,070
We could press attack from the south,

152
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,680
Pompey could stay Spartacus

153
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,390
from gaining the mountains and slipping from grasp.

154
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,430
With all who follow him.

155
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,340
A thing I would not see come to pass.

156
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,950
Father, you cannot go.

157
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,670
It would appear Pompey commands you.

158
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,130
Again, I share concern.

159
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,550
You should give no impression that you are beneath him.

160
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,480
Instead send honored name in your place to broach negotiation.

161
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,410
And I suppose such name holds letters forming "Caesar"?

162
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:04,550
No. Only the imperator's word and will holds such lofty position.

163
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,570
Pompey stands shrewd opponent.

164
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,530
I would have one of more seasoned years to set against him.

165
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,900
Tiberius has proven himself worthy advisory.

166
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,930
His youth will but cause Pompey to lower his guard,

167
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,010
to deepest regret.

168
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,960
Caesar at last breaks words that I am moved to embrace.

169
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,400
We shall pause advance until your return.

170
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,780
Weigh Pompey's true intent yet give upon no issue.

171
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,610
I shall stand as my father, unforgiving in command.

172
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,680
Was it so short a span,

173
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,570
when he stood uncertain boy?

174
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,740
Such days have faded from memory.

175
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,030
He stands a man now.

176
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,000
And I wish for him all that he deserves.

177
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,770
You were slave to Marcus Crassus?

178
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,330
The one that slipped from him upon Melia Ridge?

179
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,130
I have heard rumor.

180
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,250
That he was of a favor towards you.

181
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,320
There stood such a time.

182
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,060
Then you were of a closeness to him.

183
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,050
Before you fled.

184
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,110
I shared his tent that night.

185
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,070
I took knife and

186
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,460
slipped from presence while he slept.

187
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,910
Why did you not seize opportunity?

188
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,160
And end his life?

189
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,560
If Crassus had fallen that night,

190
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,610
then Crixus would yet be of this world.

191
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,710
I am moved by your loss.

192
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,960
Yet I cannot be held for it.

193
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,080
We are all held for our actions.

194
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,110
The choices we make.

195
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,970
The things that we do.

196
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,550
And those that we should have.

197
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,590
We cannot reverse the sun.

198
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,200
Nor relive days past.

199
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,290
No.

200
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,380
We can but brace against uncertain future.

201
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,990
And when moment presents,

202
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:06,820
balance scale against those who have most deeply wounded heart.

203
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,920
Inform Pompey of my arrival.

204
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,450
Stay at my side.

205
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,730
If the man makes but slightest move, unleash sword.

206
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,350
Let us break words with your commander.

207
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,470
And divine his intent.

208
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,440
He stands most eager to greet you.

209
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,000
Honored Pompey.

210
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,060
My father sends regret that he could not --

211
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,440
The regret is mine.

212
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,460
I had hoped to embrace the Imperator himself.

213
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,880
Yet fate delivers mere shadow of the name Crassus.

214
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,970
Is this the blade?

215
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,440
The one that robbed Crixus of his life?

216
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,620
See the boy's men bound and readied for march.

217
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,220
Get up!

218
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,570
You would keep them alive?

219
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,490
I would see them give honor to the dead.

220
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,170
In advance of joining their ranks.

221
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,490
You will have no need of that.

222
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,140
I had no hand in Canthara's fate.

223
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,920
The one who commanded her so rudely from this world

224
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,090
will never again cause harm.

225
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,770
You know the animal that took her life?

226
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,290
A bleating sheep who mistook himself as fearsome wolf.

227
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,790
Maneuvered towards deserved slaughter.

228
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,630
I would give all to lay eyes upon his suffering.

229
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,450
Let us take comfort in thoughts of blood.

230
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,290
And the warmth of flesh, yet among the living...

231
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,720
What of Crassus?

232
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,400
Plan to lure him to his doom falls short of mark.

233
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,680
Stay your hand!

234
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:31,240
I would not have the boy and his men fall to errant wrath!

235
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Their blood is to serve higher purpose!

236
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,260
Games?

237
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,680
To honor the fallen.

238
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,810
And give comfort to those left in death's wake.

239
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,150
I have seen this before.

240
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,420
In Crixus' hands.

241
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,310
And the boy's upon field of battle as it...

242
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,220
His name is Tiberius.

243
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,040
He is the son of Marcus Crassus.

244
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,900
He stands prisoner with a clutch of his soldiers.

245
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,300
I will have his fucking life.

246
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,690
The reason he yet clings to it.

247
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,320
Let us build pyre

248
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,840
and gather around imagined sands of storied arena.

249
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,080
To bear solemn witness to the clash of sword and shield.

250
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,620
And pay final tribute to the Undefeated Gaul.

251
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,240
Who shall forever stand so in my eyes.

252
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,210
There was a time not along ago

253
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,970
when he turned from you.

254
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,150
A thing I moved him towards.

255
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,430
The past is seldom as we would have it.

256
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,590
The future yet to be known.

257
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,450
Embrace the present,

258
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,840
and strike all else from concern.

259
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,470
Let us have your games.

260
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,860
Each drop of Roman blood spilled

261
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,810
in honor of those who have been taken from us.

262
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,720
Die Roman dog!

263
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,300
I know this one.

264
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,490
Agron. From the lands east of the Rhine.

265
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,030
A savage people, holding no trust even among their own kind.

266
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,830
This one is of a difference.

267
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:23,640
A gladiator standing beside Spartacus in valued position,

268
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,370
the Celt Gannicus and the fallen Gaul

269
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,870
his only equals.

270
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,560
Has he given voice?

271
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,230
Only to rude curse, Imperator.

272
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,200
There is yet more upon tongue,

273
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,670
you fucking cunts...

274
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,060
More dead than living,

275
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:42,140
yet still conjures breath toward insult.

276
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,870
I would care to own gladiators such as this,

277
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,280
and turn hard men toward harder purpose.

278
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,500
As I would see this one softened.

279
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,620
Nail him to cross...

280
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,340
...stand warning to all who refuse to break proper word.

281
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,630
I shall yet... have your fucking head.

282
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,740
An impressive feat,

283
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,940
For one who will never again grasp sword...

284
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,630
Would that all who follow Spartacus shared like fate.

285
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,750
Imperator.

286
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,710
An envoy from Pompey has arrived.

287
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,860
What of Tiberius?

288
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,950
He does not stand among them.

289
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,710
Imperator Crassus.

290
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,680
I carry message from Proconsul Pompeius--

291
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,960
Where is my son?

292
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:40,980
Your son...?

293
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,030
Dispatched with two of your reflection

294
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,580
to break word with your commander.

295
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,540
Apologies, I know nothing of your son,

296
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,720
nor others sent to you in my place.

297
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,420
I am sole envoy--

298
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,890
They stood before me bearing fucking mark of Pompey!

299
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,750
Other messengers were dispatched.

300
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,060
Yet not to you.

301
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,070
Have any failed to report?

302
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,970
A clutch of men, heading south towards Latium.

303
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,760
Leave us.

304
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,080
They were Spartacus' men,

305
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,640
posing as Pompey's.

306
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,570
You can not know this --

307
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:25,260
You do should have! You stood among the rebels in Sinuessa!

308
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,480
There were thousands within the city.

309
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,880
Fortune would be most kind for me to know

310
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,410
the one that presented himself.

311
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,940
The gods rain shit upon us.

312
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,480
Yet is it not blessing,

313
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,860
that they stayed you from being ensnared in clever plot?

314
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,220
If the Imperator were to fall to Spartacus --

315
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,890
We do not know that Tiberius has fallen.

316
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,430
He carries the name of Crassus.

317
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,200
And with him the worth of the world towards bargain.

318
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,780
You believe him alive?

319
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,320
As any father would,

320
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,350
absent eyes laid upon lifeless form.

321
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,680
Then we must pray towards proper outcome,

322
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,910
and wait for Spartacus to return--

323
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:08,190
I will not stand idle while my son's life

324
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:10,490
dangles by fraying thread.

325
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,460
We know which direction Spartacus heads

326
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,560
A few men fleet upon horse could overtake him and broach trade.

327
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,870
Spartacus will kill you upon sight,

328
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,480
regardless of cost.

329
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,120
I shall set Rufus towards task.

330
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,290
I would place trust in someone

331
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,440
with greater knowledge of Spartacus and his horde.

332
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,970
Someone who's lived among them,

333
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,870
and knows of their treacherous ways.

334
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,000
You would send me to my death.

335
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,870
They will not lay hand upon you.

336
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,120
We hold something I'm certain Spartacus desires.

337
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,750
And if you are in error?

338
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,000
Then I shall mourn your passing as well.

339
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,080
Fucking shits.

340
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,920
I hold share of blame.

341
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,480
I latched upon bait lured with praise and paternal pride.

342
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:29,200
He must have known they stood Spartacus' men,

343
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,710
draped in false mantle.

344
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,920
Do not raise weapon when called upon.

345
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,280
We will not give entertainment in our deaths.

346
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,790
Remember that we are Romans,

347
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,400
and they nothing but slaves.

348
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,660
Yet you are the one in chains.

349
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,930
A heavy thing, is it not?

350
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,090
To be so condemned to the whims of a master?

351
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,290
You were never placed in chains.

352
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,890
You forged them with your own hands.

353
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,000
Each unseen link binding heart

354
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,690
forcing me from the arms of your father.

355
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,280
See me from these chains, and I shall return you to them.

356
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,620
His heart yet beats for you, Kore.

357
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,620
Despite all that has happened.

358
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,240
He still hold love for me?

359
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,910
And would move the heavens to regain you.

360
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,540
I have not dared to hope such a thing.

361
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,710
Gratitude.

362
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,890
Know that I shall return at night fall.

363
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,500
When it is your time to die.

364
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,920
A thing I long to lay eyes upon.

365
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,690
It's been a lifetime since I last stood gladiator.

366
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:29,440
Title and purpose I never desired.

367
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,110
Rome forced such upon me and many of my brothers.

368
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,760
And this night...

369
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,160
we shall return favor!

370
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,670
Let us show the son of Crassus and his men

371
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:55,160
what we have learned beneath the heel

372
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,360
of their mighty Republic.

373
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,000
And in such lesson,

374
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,950
honor the dead

375
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,480
with Roman blood!

376
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,570
I would know what challenge you present.

377
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,860
Absent legions to give aid,

378
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:51,400
as they did against Crixus and Agron.

379
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,080
Begin!

380
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,310
I am a Roman!

381
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,070
I will not fight for your fucking entertainment --

382
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:39,190
You will fight, or fall where you stand!

383
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:45,090
If a single Roman lacks courage enough to face me...

384
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,850
send two to brace nerve!

385
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,710
I have never laid eyes upon the games.

386
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:56,320
They are but dim reflection of their glory.

387
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,420
You speak as if heart yearns for such days.

388
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,980
To return to shackle and lash, no.

389
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,110
To stand upon the sands again...

390
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,470
To know a clear purpose

391
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,700
of who you are and what must be done...

392
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,500
That is a thing that calls to all of my kind.

393
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,410
I would have more blood,

394
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,370
to honor my brother Crixus

395
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,870
and all who have followed him to the afterlife!

396
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,510
Gannicus!

397
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:58,970
Take position!

398
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:04,880
Two Romans seem to deliver no contest!

399
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:11,400
Send three, so that I may deliver proper tribute!

400
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,160
Gannicus seeks to best you?

401
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,760
Gladiators seek to best all.

402
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,850
It is the only way to survive in the arena.

403
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,140
Gannicus stands the only among us

404
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,080
to win his freedom upon the sands.

405
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,100
If free, why does he raise arms with the slaves

406
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,370
against the Republic?

407
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,010
He took up cause to honor a fallen brother.

408
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,350
One that taught us the ways of battle

409
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,630
and the bond that joins all men in such pursuit.

410
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,190
It holds difficulty?

411
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,810
To see one of your people fall?

412
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,670
They no longer stand as such.

413
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,910
I have been cast from the Republic,

414
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:58,230
with less thought towards loss or suffering.

415
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,420
I may flinch from gory sight...

416
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,720
...yet know that I revel in its meaning.

417
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,500
Gannicus!

418
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,830
Would that you stood a thousand men.

419
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,340
Your deaths by my hand worthy of Agron's memory.

420
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,760
You stand prepared for final contest?

421
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,460
Crixus once boasted of his prowess as a gladiator,

422
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:52,360
in first words he ever broke with me.

423
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,970
I said I did not favor the games...

424
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,200
now they are all that I long for.

425
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,530
You're certain that's him?

426
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,500
Do not lower guard.

427
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,240
Who do you speak of?

428
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,300
One I long to greet.

429
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:27,580
I offer fair trade!

430
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,800
Five hundred of your men

431
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,210
taken in battle against Crassus for Tiberius' life--

432
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:36,920
Hold!

433
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,140
I would hear of this--

434
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,500
He lives then?

435
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,890
The boy?

436
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:44,890
Perhaps.

437
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,900
For yet a moment.

438
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,470
Tell me you do not fall prey to this viper's tongue?

439
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:51,690
The words they form are not my own.

440
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:55,990
Do not think me the fool to greet you

441
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:58,330
with willful fucking intent.

442
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,430
Crassus would offer such a bargain?

443
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,950
He would offer Jupiter's throne in return

444
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:06,700
for festering disease that sprung from noble loins.

445
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,140
He but attempts to draw us into another plot turning upon itself.

446
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,410
He attempts nothing!

447
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,780
The man is of singular mind.

448
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,800
One I do not fucking share--

449
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,870
Five hundred?

450
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:24,340
Take my life as I know you desire...

451
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,730
and end theirs as well.

452
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,650
Fuck the Gods.

453
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,200
You honored Agron well.

454
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:50,220
As you shall honor Crixus.

455
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,440
For you!

456
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:42,640
I would have my sword returned to me, slave.

457
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:45,330
You claim the sword as your own?

458
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,120
The way it fits hand,

459
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:56,410
I thought it forged for woman or sickly child.

460
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,890
Do you yet consider me sickly child?

461
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,950
I find you more than expected.

462
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,920
Gratitude. I held worries you would die to quickly.

463
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:31,450
I will have your life...

464
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,470
As I took the fucking Gaul's --

465
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:25,700
I would see blade returned to you now.

466
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:35,950
Naevia!

467
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:47,740
Take pause.

468
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:56,040
Crassus offers trade!

469
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:01,440
His son's life for five hundred captured in battle with Crixus!

470
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,580
Let her finish him!

471
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,700
Another Roman lie!

472
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,570
I do not believe it so.

473
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:27,500
Yet I lay choice with the one most wronged by the boy.

474
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,410
I held your life in my hands.

475
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:21,510
Live each moment knowing that one day soon

476
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,810
I shall reclaim it.

477
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:10,950
Kill them! Fucking kill him!

478
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,060
Fucking kill him!

479
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,880
Delivered into hands, as agreed upon.

480
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,330
I would break words.

481
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:36,560
He has been too long from embrace.

482
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,010
It lifts heart. To see you yet of this world.

483
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:52,260
Do not ply me with silver tongue.

484
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,820
You knew them to be Spartacus' men, under guise of Pompey's.

485
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:57,630
A bold claim.

486
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:00,670
Well one my father will surely take interest in.

487
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,740
The journey to return you to his arms is fraught with peril.

488
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,990
For one needing to be taught severest lesson in who towers above you.

489
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:22,570
No!

490
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:54,500
You mad bitch. Do you know what you have done?

491
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,700
I have balanced fucking scale.

492
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:03,790
Five hundred of our people will suffer for this.

493
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,520
The boy holds no value now.

494
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,910
Nor does life of Caesar.

495
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:12,390
Wait! Crassus will yet honor trade!

496
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:16,740
If you give him something else his heart desires.

497
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:36,380
He was struck down by hand of rebel slave,

498
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:40,570
as we attempted to withdraw from Spartacus' camp.

499
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:46,350
A man long of years, the scars of his master

500
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:47,850
etched deep upon flesh.

501
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:54,280
And yet you held to fucking bargain?

502
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,840
I knew wound such loss would cause.

503
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:00,200
I sought only to balm it with opportunity presented...

504
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,570
Gratitude, Gaius.

505
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,790
You now stand my Word and my Will.

506
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:18,240
You honor me.

507
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,650
Prepare the men for march.

508
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,590
I would press towards Spartacus

509
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:29,270
and see him to deserved end.

510
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:30,730
Imperator.

511
00:52:58,330 --> 00:52:59,500
Raise eyes.

512
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,650
Marcus--

513
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,660
From this day forth...

514
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,580
you shall address me as Dominus.

515
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:47,170
Would that those we held to heart stood among them.

516
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:52,350
Nasir...

517
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,820
The gods return you to my arms.

518
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:23,480
I was fool to ever leave them.

519
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:21,750
This night hearts lift in joyous reunion

520
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:23,460
with those thought lost to us.

521
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,650
Fathers.

522
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,070
Brothers and sisters.

523
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:33,480
Sons and lovers.

524
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,260
Hold them close for the shadow of Rome is upon us.

525
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,480
We shall seek our destiny together.

526
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:46,530
Whatever the cost.

527
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:52,190
Yet let us not pass from memory

528
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:55,040
those left absent from our arms.

529
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:58,640
Those who sacrificed their lives

530
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,660
so that all may live free.

531
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,120
For Crixus!

532
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:43,570
For Sura.

533
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,660
For Varro and Mira!

534
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:50,750
For Oenomaus!

535
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:53,290
For Diotimus!

536
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,720
For Rhaskos.

537
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:57,770
For Sanus!

538
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,290
Donar!

539
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,810
For Duro!

540
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,140
For Aca.

541
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:05,200
Fortis!

542
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,330
Barca!

543
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,140
Nemetes!

544
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,090
Liscus!

545
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:19,910
For Crixus! Crixus! Crixus...

546
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:24,990
Crixus! Crixus!

547
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:29,080
Crixus! Crixus!

548
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:32,970
Crixus! Crixus!

549
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:35,690
Crixus! Crixus!

550
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:38,460
Split heavens with the sound of his name!

551
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,740
Let it carry to Crassus and Pompey

552
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:47,810
as distant thunder promising storm and blood!

553
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:53,550
All those who are able shall make final stand against Rome.

554
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,080
And this I promise you.

555
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:03,040
We will live free...

556
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:06,990
or join our brothers in death!

557
00:58:10,510 --> 00:59:06,990

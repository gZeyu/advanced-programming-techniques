6
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,490
If you go to war,

7
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,590
you are destined for great and unfortunate things.

8
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,080
I would press north, towards the Alps.

9
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,220
Let's see our people to the winds.

10
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,020
We could press attack from the South.

11
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,540
Pompey could stay Spartacus

12
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,160
from gaining the mountains and slipping from grasp.

13
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,520
I will not be as gentle next time.

14
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,420
She has moved to join rebellion?

15
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,100
Five hundred of your men for Tiberius' life --

16
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,570
The boy holds no value now.

17
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,220
Crassus will yet honor trade.

18
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,130
If you give him something else his heart desires.

19
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,300
Prepare the men for march.

20
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,100
I would press towards Spartacus

21
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,900
and see him to deserved end.

22
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,100
Spread word to your kind to strike shackle from their slaves.

23
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,870
Or see their houses follow yours

24
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,800
in blood and death.

25
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,370
Who are you?

26
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,130
I am Spartacus.

27
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,320
Another villa set upon.

28
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,310
What number holds total?

29
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,010
Six in half as many days.

30
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,090
I am Spartacus.

31
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,000
I am Spartacus.

32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,870
I am Spartacus.

33
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,720
I am Spartacus.

34
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,140
He lays assault with swiftness to rival winged Mars.

35
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,600
Spartacus stands but mortal man.

36
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,720
I have yet held privilege of one that

37
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,930
could span distant ground within single breath.

38
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,370
You believe reports false?

39
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,250
I believe he lays strategy,

40
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,970
to set Pompey to confusion,

41
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,530
chasing veiled spectre of the man himself.

42
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,750
We were charged with bringing spartacus to heel, not Pompey.

43
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,700
If the Thracian slips beyond the mountain,

44
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,020
burden of defeat shall rest upon our shoulders.

45
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,810
And those that have given life towards campaign.

46
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,240
There was nothing save cooling embers

47
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,310
in the rebel camp where Tiberius met his end.

48
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,170
Forward scouts are yet to have set eyes

49
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,600
upon Spartacus and his army.

50
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,140
See efforts doubled.

51
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,920
I would press the Thracian upon field of battle

52
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,900
at soonest opportunity.

53
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,500
And gaze into his eyes

54
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,470
as life and hope forever drain from them.

55
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,740
Lugo. See it done.

56
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,900
Many times have I marveled at

57
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,200
mad scheme sprung from fevered mind.

58
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,090
Yet one you now set forth towers above all.

59
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,910
We have confounded Pompey to the north,

60
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,330
yet Crassus still advances from the south

61
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,140
with overwhelming advantage.

62
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,550
Hope lies only in deciding field of final battle.

63
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,280
You weave barest tether to the promise of such.

64
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,350
It will hold long enough

65
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,940
for the others to slip from grasp.

66
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,540
I pray it so.

67
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,830
And would lend much needed aid in giving Crassus fucking pause.

68
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,360
Grip sword. And have it so.

69
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,760
They have taken all from me.

70
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,580
You will yet serve purpose in coming battle.

71
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,210
By seeing those who cannot fight to the mountains.

72
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,930
Return to task with Nasir,

73
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,290
and prepare for journey.

74
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,920
The man is more dead than living.

75
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,570
And yet eager to give life to your cause.

76
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,960
My cause?

77
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,550
It does yet not stand your own?

78
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,700
I'm no martyr upon cross,

79
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,970
that will gladly give my life,

80
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,230
so that those more deserving may live.

81
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,690
Then take pause,

82
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,280
see heart attended in advance of parting.

83
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,760
It seems another life.

84
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,980
That I last stood in equal embrace with Crixus.

85
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,960
Much has been taken from us.

86
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,670
Soon we will face the legions of Rome.

87
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,570
And we will return bitter favor.

88
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,890
You crafted this?

89
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,340
We will lash hand to grip.

90
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,030
So it is not torn from grasp

91
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,430
if called to split Roman flesh.

92
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,760
I cannot flee to the mountains with the others.

93
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,810
Despite command, my place is upon field of battle.

94
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,020
As mine is forever by your side.

95
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,010
The hour is upon us.

96
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,790
I do not want to leave your arms.

97
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,040
Nor I see you from them.

98
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,040
Yet you must go with the others.

99
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,660
Come with me.

100
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,720
You know I must stay.

101
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,720
That you may reach the mountains,

102
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,760
live free of the Republic beyond them.

103
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,240
There is no life absent your touch.

104
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,820
You once said to me that the gods

105
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,840
had sent me to save you.

106
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,620
And you were mistaken.

107
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,790
You were the one sent.

108
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,530
And I in need of saving.

109
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,470
Your skills remain keen, Imperator.

110
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,270
I would sharpen them to deadly edge,

111
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,950
in advance of facing the Bringer of Rain.

112
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,880
He appears at peace.

113
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,080
Does he not?

114
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,950
Yes, Dominus.

115
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,850
It is false image of the boy I knew.

116
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,370
Forever of furrowed brow

117
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,640
and pressing concern.

118
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,970
A reflection of his father,

119
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,710
grave of face and disposition.

120
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,280
He was not always so. Was he?

121
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,270
No, Dominus. He was not always so.

122
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,860
The passing of years hardens a man to the simple joys of life.

123
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,260
Until all that is left is a thing of stone,

124
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,280
cold and unforgiving.

125
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,360
I wish nothing more than journey had set towards different path.

126
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,050
Give voice to slave that robbed him of life.

127
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,250
A man long in years.

128
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:58,030
With scars of his master etched upon flesh.

129
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,820
Would that he had been struck from this world,

130
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,860
so that Tiberius may yet be of it.

131
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,620
Apologies for intrusion.

132
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,360
We have received word from forward scouts.

133
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,130
Spartacus?

134
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,110
A clutch of his men sighted to the north.

135
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,800
Give order to break encampment

136
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,010
and fall to march.

137
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,140
Imperator.

138
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,390
War at last draws to its end.

139
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,400
As all things must,

140
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,570
born of man and misplaced desire.

141
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,670
The guards will see you returned to where you belong.

142
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,830
You have not asked yet why I turned from you.

143
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,990
Could answer reverse course of time's passing?

144
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,970
Or erase memory of deepest wound?

145
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,080
No.

146
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,160
Yet I would give life to gaze upon

147
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,110
forgiveness in your eyes again.

148
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,490
For all that I have done.

149
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,060
If but I could be so moved.

150
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,310
Once beyond camp, you will divide number and path.

151
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,130
Better give chance of reaching mountains absent discovery by Pompey.

152
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,130
I would count fortune more assured, were you to lead us.

153
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,030
Crassus must be given pause.

154
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,480
So that you and the others may slip beyond grasp.

155
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,670
We will wait for you then, at foot of the mountains.

156
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,430
But I would not have it so.

157
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,920
Am I not free, to make own choice?

158
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,510
As you frequently remind.

159
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,340
Yet do not hazard life,

160
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,100
in hopes that I yet cling to my own.

161
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,180
You will not fall in battle against Crassus.

162
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,760
You now hold power to pierce future's uncertain veil?

163
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,180
I hold but faith.

164
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,120
In a man like no other.

165
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,300
Gratitude. For your words.

166
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,210
And for what comfort your presence has given.

167
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,470
Go.

168
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,160
You are clear of purpose?

169
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,770
Never more so.

170
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,950
Yet Nasir and I shall not be among those

171
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,700
striking towards mountains.

172
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,830
We have broken words towards subject.

173
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,390
You cannot fight --

174
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,120
He has yet found way,

175
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,450
forged by loving hands.

176
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,420
Do not ask my own to lay idle in coming battle.

177
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,680
I have born witness to the fall of many i have called brother.

178
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,990
You are the last yet living

179
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,990
that stood with me when Batiatus' ludus was laid to ruin.

180
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,590
You honor me,

181
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,600
by standing again at my side in final conflict.

182
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,800
They are ready to journey.

183
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,500
My friends.

184
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,200
The time of our parting has come.

185
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,780
Know that you will be heavy upon thought

186
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,030
when we face Crassus and his legions.

187
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,040
Many of us will fall.

188
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,790
There remains strategy nor deception

189
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,690
that can bend course of inevitable fate.

190
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,870
Yet know that our blood...

191
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,250
...shall purchase needed opportunity

192
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,480
for you to gain mountain paths.

193
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,700
Beyond snapping jaws of Rome

194
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,490
that have plagued us with death... ...and misery.

195
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,760
Part ways.

196
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,750
And live free.

197
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,400
Gratitude. For all you've done.

198
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,480
Gratitude. Gratitude, Spartacus.

199
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,580
Gratitude. Gratitude Spartacus.

200
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,900
May the gods bless you.

201
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,580
May the gods bless you.

202
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,650
Gratitude...

203
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,070
Gratitude.

204
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,070
Spartacus!

205
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,640
Roman scouts have laid eyes upon us to the south of the valley!

206
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,180
What markings did they bear?

207
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,970
Fearsome bull upon chest.

208
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,500
Crassus.

209
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,550
Fucking bait is seized upon.

210
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,360
Set upon path, and do not turn from it!

211
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,810
Go!

212
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,420
I shall lend prayer.

213
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,760
Toward the end of Crassus.

214
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,190
And the triumph of Spartacus.

215
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,780
I have had my fill of words and tearful farewells.

216
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,980
I desire blood,

217
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,830
and cries of our enemy.

218
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,320
Let us make it so.

219
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,260
Halt!

220
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,800
Balistae ready!

221
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,890
Do not engage unless given command!

222
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,110
Stand ready!

223
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,380
Spear.

224
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,300
I do not seek quarrel!

225
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,460
Only to deliver message from Imperator Crassus!

226
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,610
Spear.

227
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,130
Break words.

228
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,580
And pray to your gods I find them of worth.

229
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,560
Have you ever witnessed such a thing?

230
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,660
So many hearts,

231
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,910
beating towards inevitable end?

232
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,960
Why did you call me here, Crassus?

233
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,600
The same reason you came.

234
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,280
Curiosity.

235
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,400
Well has it been satisfying?

236
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,760
We've vexed each other for many months.

237
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,320
Both suffering grievous wound upon effort.

238
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,070
Yet have never broken single word.

239
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,530
There are none that would hold difference.

240
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,720
Perhaps.

241
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,100
Yet I would stil l have them regardless.

242
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,310
Leave us.

243
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:16,980
Imperator --

244
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,590
Fall to command.

245
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,210
It is a thing known, is it not?

246
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,580
That you cannot win this conflict.

247
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,420
A sentiment shared.

248
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,040
By all the Romans I have killed who held such belief.

249
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,810
My son among them.

250
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,180
Apologies Imperator

251
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,790
I cannot give voice to regret of passing.

252
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,040
To the soldier that robbed Crixus of life.

253
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,490
The Gaul died upon field of battle.

254
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,240
An honor denied Tiberius.

255
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,000
It is not as I had commanded.

256
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,910
Yet the woman had been rudely treated by his hands,

257
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,660
and her own claimed vengeance.

258
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,270
As mine are so moved in memory of my son.

259
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,400
And yours towards wife no longer --

260
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,440
Do not think to place your loss upon equal footing.

261
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,120
Your son took up arms for the Republic.

262
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,750
The same one that saw my innocent wife torn from grasp

263
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,380
and condemned to slavery and death.

264
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,020
And now you would lead thousands to join her in futile attempt.

265
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,840
Whatever happens to my people

266
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,860
it happens because we choose for it.

267
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,380
We decide our fates. Not you.

268
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,040
Not the Romans.

269
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,910
Not even the gods.

270
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:00,740
You choose but time and place of journey's end.

271
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,820
Better to fall by the sword

272
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,150
than by the master's lash.

273
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,440
And will it balm festering wound?

274
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,760
If the Bringer of Rain heralds miracle

275
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,700
and defeats Crassus and his legions,

276
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,930
will he withdraw from the Republic?

277
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,300
Content that he's brought those

278
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,920
who so injured him to justice?

279
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,790
There is no justice.

280
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,020
Not in this world.

281
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,680
At last.

282
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,110
A thing we agree upon.

283
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,630
When we again meet, I will kill you.

284
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,420
No. You are going to try.

285
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,160
It is all a free man can do.

286
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,580
You cannot place trust in the words of Spartacus.

287
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,210
What reason would he have to twist tongue upon subject?

288
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,630
I do not pretend to know lay

289
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,690
of a savage's fucking thoughts.

290
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,980
Tell me again.

291
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:23,510
What hand struck Tiberius from this life?

292
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,630
One belonging to a man long in years, as I have said --

293
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,190
Spartacus spoke of a woman.

294
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:36,240
Moved by vengeance.

295
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,750
He but attempts to turn us against each other with plotted lie.

296
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,530
The threat of ruin carries upon such deceit, if so embraced.

297
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:48,810
Yet only in the breaking of truth

298
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,490
swells hope of forgiveness.

299
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,730
It was my hand that moved against Tiberius,

300
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,660
and saw him from this world.

301
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,350
Was my touch so cruel?

302
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:17,310
That you would strike at heart through noble son?

303
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,200
Speak!

304
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,430
While you yet have throat to give voice!

305
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,720
You place blame upon victim!

306
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:27,740
Your "Noble" Fucking son forced himself inside her.

307
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,150
One of many acts that lead to deserved fate.

308
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,120
More lies!

309
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,700
It is the truth!

310
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,140
His love for you turned to hate

311
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,130
in the wake of the decimation.

312
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,590
And he struck at you the only way he could.

313
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,690
One he knew would inflict deepest wound.

314
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,320
Why did you not tell me?

315
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,910
I made attempt, upon Melia Ridge.

316
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,530
There is no misstep that would see father

317
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:01,750
withhold forgiveness from treasured son.

318
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,970
We did not wish to cause you further pain absent reason, Marcus.

319
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,550
The cause of withholding truth.

320
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,820
Leave us.

321
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:38,270
A son is but reflection of the father.

322
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,940
Is this how I stand?

323
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,410
Twisted and grotesque?!

324
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,500
You stand as you always have.

325
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,380
A good man. That does what he must.

326
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,970
Apologies.

327
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,600
Apologies.

328
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,190
Apologies for all you've suffered.

329
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,110
Know that it shall end when Spartacus falls.

330
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,830
And unfortunate events of war

331
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,710
trod path of distant memory.

332
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,350
It is heavy burden.

333
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:06,080
Gaze at war's end. And weigh bitter cost of it.

334
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,830
You do not believe that we can defeat Crassus?

335
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,040
You are forever conjuring the impossible.

336
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,150
And I would not wager against you in final gambit.

337
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,860
Yet odds are not of a favor.

338
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:30,620
No. They are not.

339
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,930
I would offer drink to lift spirits,

340
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,500
but I have turned from it of late.

341
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,210
A thing not escaping notice.

342
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,120
I too turned from wild pursuits.

343
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,730
When possessed by purest heart.

344
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,490
You speak of your wife?

345
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,120
When we first lay together,

346
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:57,880
she told of how the gods delivered oracle in her dreams.

347
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,760
And foretold that I would never love another woman.

348
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,140
Did prophecy hold true?

349
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,230
I found comfort in others.

350
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,720
Yet there's an emptiness that can never be filled.

351
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,360
A void left where heart once beat,

352
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,350
when Sura was taken from me.

353
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:27,090
You once questioned how victory can be defined.

354
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,230
I thought answer held in Roman deaths.

355
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,930
A position no longer taken?

356
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:36,620
Life is what defines it.

357
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,370
Not the death of Romans.

358
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,460
Nor ours, nor those that follow us into battle.

359
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,380
But the life of Sibyl.

360
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,270
Of Laeta, the mother and her child,

361
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,420
so many others.

362
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,430
They are all Sura.

363
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,370
And I would see them live.

364
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,590
A cause even I can embrace.

365
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,590
If we are to give the others any chance against Crassus,

366
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,630
you must do more than embrace it.

367
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,880
You must lead.

368
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,140
An old argument, Spartacus.

369
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,330
One that must now stand settled.

370
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,910
I cannot do this without you assuming rightful position.

371
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,690
One that there is none more deserving of.

372
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:28,200
What would you have me do?

373
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,880
The impossible.

374
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,610
The men stand ready?

375
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,230
They do, Imperator.

376
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,790
Gratitude.

377
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,900
For loyal service.

378
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,560
Spartacus stands the fool,

379
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,830
to face our legions with so few.

380
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,300
He has proven himself many things.

381
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,930
A fool not among them.

382
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,880
They stand an ocean.

383
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,980
As when Crixus was swept from the shores of the living.

384
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,110
They but offer opportunity.

385
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,830
To swim in a sea of Roman blood.

386
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,210
Great and unfortunate things.

387
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,920
What meaning do words carry?

388
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:05,420
A warning, given voice by loving wife.

389
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,110
To a man who no longer exists.

390
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,770
Soon Crassus will give command!

391
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,100
And we shall face his legions in open battle!

392
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:31,780
We stand in the shadow of greater might!

393
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,190
As their Republic cast across the lives of every man...

394
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,820
every woman... And every child...

395
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,190
condemned to the darkness of slavery!

396
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,230
Forced to toil and suffer,

397
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,460
so that those of coin and position

398
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:55,120
can see their fortunes grow beyond need or purpose!

399
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,120
Let us teach them,

400
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,340
that all who draw breath are of equal worth!

401
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,120
And that those that seek to place heel

402
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,560
upon the throat of liberty...

403
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:14,960
Will fall to the cry of freedom!

404
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:29,990
No wounded enemy is to be blessed with merciful passing!

405
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,130
I would make example of all those who dare raise

406
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,610
hand against the glory of Rome!

407
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,770
Raise ballistae and catapults.

408
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,740
Go!

409
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,750
Ignite!

410
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,600
Ready! Release!

411
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,210
Sound advance!

412
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,470
And see Rebellion distant memory!

413
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,890
Advance!

414
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,420
Advance!

415
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,430
Take position!

416
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,340
Hold...

417
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,750
Hold...

418
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,990
Hold!

419
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,040
Archers!

420
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,890
Now!

421
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,650
The savage yet proves resourceful.

422
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:22,680
He but delays coming tide with grains of sand.

423
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,990
Give signal to form testudo!

424
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,560
They fall to predicted maneuver.

425
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,430
Let us show them one unexpected.

426
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,840
Now!

427
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,750
Raise command for ballistae and catapults!

428
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,830
You would rain death upon our own men?

429
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,890
I would end this fucking war!

430
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,670
Do not turn from advance!

431
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,140
Press forward!

432
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,320
The slaves fall to superior strategy and tactic.

433
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,330
As do Romans beneath our command.

434
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,900
An unfortunate loss.

435
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,250
Yet one gladly accepted,

436
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,030
to bring Spartacus to his end --

437
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,120
Riders approaching!

438
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,950
About face!

439
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,890
Turn ballistae! Quickly!

440
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,170
You there! Defend the left flank!

441
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,700
Caesar! Take command of rear position!

442
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,760
Do not let them fall to confusion!

443
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,700
We must withdraw!

444
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,800
No! That is what he expects!

445
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,540
Sound horn and advance!

446
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,620
Castus!

447
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,510
Would that I had been you...

448
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,540
... for but a day.

449
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:14,870
Agron!

450
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,530
Shore your flank!

451
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,330
Do not let them close upon us!

452
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,960
Nasir!

453
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,940
Naevia! Aid Gannicus!

454
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:30,740
Move!

455
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,820
Come!

456
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,010
Spartacus!

457
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:08,870
Imperator!

458
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,510
Protect the Imperator!

459
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:14,970
Crassus!

460
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,040
It is a glorious day!

461
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,950
To have so many Romans to kill!

462
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,690
It is but one life that holds meaning.

463
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,300
Draw attention upon field.

464
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,540
I shall claim it.

465
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,520
Hold the line!

466
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:41,540
Seize amphoras and see them to purpose!

467
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,130
Caesar!

468
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,170
Send for the medicus!

469
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,760
I need no soothing balm.

470
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,710
Only to return to field with rebel blood hot upon face.

471
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,370
Do not place yourself at further risk.

472
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:19,130
If you fall, spartacus would gain advantage --

473
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,190
I have longed to meet you in true contest.

474
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,750
As I have longed to see your head

475
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,600
parted from fucking neck.

476
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,260
Saxa!

477
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,830
I made promise.

478
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,360
That time next we met...

479
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,250
I would have your life.

480
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:38,800
Come then.

481
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,000
And attempt to take it.

482
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,380
Formation!

483
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,880
This does not belong to you, slave.

484
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,380
No!

485
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,840
Rotate!

486
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:42,470
Hold!

487
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:04,790
Halt!

488
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:30,030
Would that you had been born a Roman.

489
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:36,670
And had stood beside me.

490
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,770
I bless the fates...

491
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,590
that it was not so.

492
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,840
Agron!

493
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,610
Give me a sword...

494
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,570
Imperator --

495
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,940
Fall by my side and retake hill!

496
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,200
Sweep surrounding hills!

497
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,270
Imperator!

498
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,880
The gods once more aid Spartacus

499
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,040
in slipping from fucking grasp.

500
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,770
He weeps from a thousand wounds.

501
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,510
And if heart yet beats,

502
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:07,640
it shall cease at briefest passing --

503
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,190
There are many who have followed mad cause

504
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,700
that still cling to fading life.

505
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,800
See them to promised example upon Appian Way.

506
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,780
And let all slaves, upon road to Mother Rome know reward

507
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,750
for turning hand against master.

508
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:20,990
Ignoble end.

509
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,930
For a legend that once stood a god of the arena.

510
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,270
Legends are but bone and meat of dreams.

511
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,940
Rotting in the harsh sun of reality.

512
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:36,850
It is hard sight.

513
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:40,260
To see one so loved among the damned.

514
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,370
She was known to be of the rebellion.

515
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,980
I have forgiven reason.

516
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:52,380
Yet do what I must.

517
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:02,430
Pompey.

518
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,870
Praise the gods to find you well old friend.

519
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:12,520
I'd feared that Spartacus and his Rebels

520
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,170
had overrun you before I routed him in the north.

521
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,190
The north?

522
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:20,360
He came upon rebel army attempting to gain the mountains.

523
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:23,400
Dispatch has already been sent to Rome,

524
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,380
naming Pompey victor

525
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:27,570
against enemy you could not quell.

526
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:29,400
You claim false laurels.

527
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,890
Spartacus was defeated --

528
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:34,840
-- in the north. By valiant Pompey,

529
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,920
hero of Hispania.

530
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,610
You honor me.

531
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:40,150
I but honor Rome.

532
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:44,360
And those of like mind, that would see it flourish.

533
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:48,450
Then we are one in such regard.

534
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,820
Let us break meal on your return.

535
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,960
After all that we have suffered,

536
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,810
you allow Pompey to snatch triumph from deserving hands?

537
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,340
Supporting claim he will be made ally.

538
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:08,720
We shall stand fearsome triumvirate,

539
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:11,200
with means to bend the course of history.

540
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,140
You forever speak of the future.

541
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:15,660
The past cannot be altered.

542
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:18,660
The present holds but regret and loss.

543
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,880
It is only in the days to come that a man may find solace.

544
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:27,240
When memory fades.

545
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:22,940
Gannicus! Gannicus! Gannicus!...

546
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:47,870
He yet lives.

547
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:55,690
We've gained the mountains.

548
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,200
We waited for you, as promised.

549
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,060
All safe?

550
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,780
Pompey set upon other half.

551
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,100
Many were lost.

552
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:21,580
We must see him to mountain path,

553
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:23,600
before we too are discovered.

554
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,720
Stay hand.

555
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,810
I would rest awhile.

556
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:36,950
We cannot stay here.

557
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,320
No, you cannot.

558
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:43,500
Nor can I follow.

559
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:57,540
Spartacus... Spartacus.

560
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:05,640
Spartacus.

561
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:10,770
That is not my name.

562
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:17,360
I shall finally hear it again.

563
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:22,920
Given voice by loving wife...

564
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,130
in greeting longed for...

565
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:38,370
Do not shed tear.

566
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,810
There is no greater victory...

567
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:46,540
than to fall from this world...

568
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:50,030
a free man.

569
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:12,300
One day Rome shall fade and crumble.

570
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:18,920
Yet you shall always be remembered.

571
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,910
In the hearts of all who yearn for freedom.

572
00:57:25,040 --> 00:58:23,910

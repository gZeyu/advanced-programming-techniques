1
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,247
( panting )

2
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,257
( neighs )

3
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,391
( men yelling )

4
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:17,702
( horse snorts )

5
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,790
( neighs )

6
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:37,972
Come back!

7
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:02,413
- ( neighs )
- Behind you!

8
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,844
( neighs )

9
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,879
l believe the man's dead.

10
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,050
( laughs )

11
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,177
Agron!

12
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,683
Supplies. Be quick.

13
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,226
Take anything of value.

14
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,063
( wind blowing )

15
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,743
Spartacus, you leave
his cock to the sun?

16
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,246
No.

17
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:27,081
l send a message...

18
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,209
to an old friend.

19
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,230
Glaber:
Pompey was a fool

20
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,150
to engage Sertorius
absent support.

21
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,986
When has Pompey
ever delayed action

22
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,155
in favor of reason?

23
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:01,991
Advancing in years,
yet ever the adolescent butcher.

24
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,577
Where youth plummets,

25
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,621
maturity may soar.

26
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,082
Rome will lose all of Hispania

27
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,168
if Pompey's numbers
are not shored against the renegade.

28
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:15,630
And who would lead such a force
to glorious accolade?

29
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,256
Freshly minted praetor, perhaps?

30
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,217
l serve the Republic, Marcus.

31
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,428
We will take arms
against her enemies

32
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,348
if so commanded.

33
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,894
The embellished robes
of a praetor not yet to wrinkle,

34
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:33,773
and yet he speaks of war
and laurels.

35
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:37,401
l speak only
of pressing matters.

36
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:41,238
We need not tread foreign soil
to find them, do we, Varinius?

37
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,990
Not when Spartacus
and his mongrels

38
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,617
continue to evade capture.

39
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,620
The man is no longer
bound to my concerns.

40
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,580
More of young Seppius's men

41
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,290
were slaughtered
on the road outside Capua.

42
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,336
He sends word to me that one
of the fallen bore your name

43
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,713
carved into his chest.

44
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,259
An unfortunate tether.

45
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,262
Albinius:
Quickly to be severed.

46
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,265
Cossutius awaits my attentions.

47
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,309
Apologies to your daughter,

48
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,521
that l could not linger
to gaze upon her.

49
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,774
Disappointment
to be tempered

50
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,026
with promise
of future visit, hmm?

51
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:25,408
Come. Let us break meal.

52
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,326
The consuls
will present a motion

53
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,869
dispatching you
to Capua at once.

54
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:33,165
This is a simple tumultus,
Albinius,

55
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,209
undeserving the attentions
of a praetor.

56
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,379
You brought the Thracian
to Roman soil, Gaius.

57
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,214
You granted patronage

58
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,216
to that grinning shit Batiatus

59
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,386
a breath before his house
fell to massacre,

60
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:50,016
a massacre my daughter
barely fucking escaped!

61
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,978
Varinius lends his support
to Seppius.

62
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:57,398
lf he's the one to bring
Spartacus to justice,

63
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,693
then that victory will be used
to embarrass you.

64
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,696
Attend to this,

65
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,575
or see yourself rise
no further within the Senate.

66
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,418
( rats squeaking )

67
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,921
( men grunting )

68
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,509
Man:
Don't lower your sword.

69
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,847
( grunting continues )

70
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,816
Eight more Romans
sent to the afterlife!

71
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,611
( cheering )

72
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,326
Peirastes!

73
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:53,079
Replace wood with steel
for those who are ready.

74
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,499
Vitus, Pyrrhus, Lysandros,

75
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,334
divide these among you
according to skill,

76
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,252
and ready the rest
for demonstration.

77
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,506
l will kill many Romans.

78
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,299
Of that, l have no doubt.

79
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,885
Return to training.

80
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,599
Spartacus, we need food,

81
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,226
not more weapons.

82
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,978
Steel and coin
are all they carried.

83
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,940
( laughter )

84
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,984
- Whoo!
- ( overlapping chatter )

85
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,612
Oh, good.
My fish supper.

86
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,406
Crixus's men fare better.

87
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,409
Rhaskos.

88
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,994
Where is Crixus?

89
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,289
He seeks Marcellus,
the cunt peddler.

90
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,792
( laughter )

91
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,086
Your men have done well
for themselves.

92
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,463
See everyone to equal portion.

93
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,757
Fuck!

94
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,426
Let the rabbits
fend for themselves.

95
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,679
You have more than enough.

96
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,430
Gained by blood and risk.

97
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,307
What do they do but lay about?

98
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,059
Divide what you have.

99
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,603
l will not ask again.

100
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,537
Fucking Gauls.

101
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,336
Rhaskos is a selfish fool,

102
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,839
unable to see
beyond his own desires.

103
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,425
Spartacus:
No one will go hungry tonight.

104
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:32,303
That is all that matters.

105
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,679
And tomorrow?

106
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,640
Will bring death
to yet more Romans.

107
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,148
l would see all of them
struck down...

108
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:49,612
yet not at the cost
of your life.

109
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,241
l have proven
troublesome to kill.

110
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,493
( laughs )

111
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,373
There is no one
that stands your equal.

112
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,167
Hmm.

113
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,838
Yet for those less skilled,

114
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,466
moving towards
the mountains in the east

115
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,301
would be sorely welcome.

116
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,345
Game is plentiful there

117
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,388
and Roman numbers sparse.

118
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,392
lt would be wise.

119
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,354
Then why do we stay?

120
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,730
What holds us here,

121
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,191
so near Capua and the threat--

122
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,401
Spartacus.

123
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,120
l hear you wish
to command my men.

124
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,250
No.

125
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:49,630
Simply to remind them
of what is just.

126
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,591
You would have done the same,
had you been present.

127
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,607
l shall have words with them.

128
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:12,152
They would be better received
from your lips.

129
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,824
You were in town again.

130
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,119
You risk discovery.

131
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,454
l was not seen,

132
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,498
except by Marcellus,

133
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,083
and he will never speak of it.

134
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,503
Did his blood bear fruit?

135
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:32,172
A name.

136
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,716
Trebius.

137
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,552
The slaver?

138
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,929
Spartacus:
He will point us towards her?

139
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,682
Marcellus revealed that he
brokered deal of Naevia.

140
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,393
Where do we find him?

141
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,854
He frequents Capua upon
each moon to trade his wares

142
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:49,148
and to wet his cock
at Arminius's brothel.

143
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,317
News to lift the heart.

144
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,242
lt remains firmly bound
until Naevia is back in my arms.

145
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,624
l will have those words now.

146
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:11,712
Crixus.

147
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,632
Have you had sight of Doctore?

148
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,386
The ludus was his life's blood.

149
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,889
To lay eyes upon those
who have spilled it,

150
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:25,017
it would salt mortal wound.

151
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,446
- ( cheering )
- ( yells )

152
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,549
( screams )

153
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,429
You fight like a woman!

154
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,014
Fucking kill him!

155
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,747
( booing )

156
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,548
( groaning )

157
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,716
A poor showing,

158
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,719
even for the lesser games
of the Vulcanalia.

159
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,763
Apologies, Magistrate.

160
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,306
These were the best
that could be procured.

161
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,477
The crowd demands spectacle,
Mercato.

162
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:51,895
Hmm?

163
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,025
They must be distracted,

164
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,820
lest the city fall
to ill temper and panic.

165
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,948
Gladiators and games

166
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,617
while Spartacus and
his murdering horde roam free.

167
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,079
Your brother has the matter
well in hand, Seppia.

168
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,790
Words of comfort

169
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,793
to the eight of his men
slaughtered this morning.

170
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,087
Eight?

171
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,923
( crowd cheering )

172
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,477
Yeah!

173
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:33,604
Apologies.

174
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:37,357
Pressing business
conspired to delay me.

175
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,151
ls it true, Seppius?

176
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,612
Eight more of your men,
fallen to Spartacus?

177
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:45,032
- ( giggles )
- A thing of little note.

178
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,034
Spartacus will soon
be brought to terms.

179
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:51,038
And our beloved
cousin Sextus avenged.

180
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,873
Or you to join him,

181
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,126
leaving me woefully unattended.

182
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:59,129
What form of brother would l be

183
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:02,216
to abandon such cherished blood?

184
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,926
( giggles )

185
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,719
Would that Batiatus yet lived

186
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:09,181
to feel the sting of blame
properly braced.

187
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,725
Spartacus and his shits will be
put to grass soon enough.

188
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,352
l have already
sent dispatch to Rome

189
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,728
for aid in the matter.

190
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:19,358
Perhaps you can secure
better entertainment as well.

191
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,528
The current offerings bore
beyond the telling.

192
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,702
( cheering )

193
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,041
( gasping )

194
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,417
( groans )

195
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,764
( jeering, booing )

196
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,817
Crowd: No! No! No!

197
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,861
No! No! No! No!

198
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,030
A poor showing.

199
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,742
( cheering )

200
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,811
l have nothing of worth.

201
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,813
We seek only words.

202
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,985
l am absent them as well.

203
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,778
You were Batiatus's man,
were you not?

204
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,155
You are mistaken.

205
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:49,781
No, l saw him

206
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,075
when he yet commanded
the sands of the arena.

207
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,537
l was there in Pompeii
the day he faced Theokoles

208
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,248
and barely lived to speak of it.

209
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,126
Oenomaus, he was called.

210
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,879
lt is fortunate you are not him.

211
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,340
The man stands accused
of turning upon his dominus,

212
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:10,886
the reward for his capture
a substantial sum,

213
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,180
toward Spartacus yet higher.

214
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,851
lf he were to be revealed,

215
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,520
a man such as you could...

216
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,230
continue not being himself.

217
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,734
As l said,

218
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,445
l have nothing of worth.

219
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,074
A lesser sum, then.

220
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,875
( screams )

221
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,298
Apologies.

222
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,886
You are not Batiatus' man.

223
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,471
( gurgles )

224
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,774
( dog barks )

225
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,445
Spartacus:
You should not be outside.

226
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:11,988
l wanted to see the moon.

227
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,283
Janus loves to gaze upon it.

228
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,830
Varro would hoist him
upon his shoulders,

229
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,373
and he would stretch
his hands out,

230
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,625
attempting to wrest it
from the heavens.

231
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,752
Perhaps one day he shall.

232
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,256
But not upon
his father's shoulders.

233
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:34,261
Janus is yet too young
for memory to take proper hold.

234
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,390
l doubt he would recall
the sight of me now.

235
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,268
You are his mother.

236
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:45,105
Years would not lessen
such a bond.

237
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,940
He will burst
as sun through clouds

238
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,483
at the sight of you.

239
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,364
l have dreamt of nothing else
since our parting.

240
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:58,118
A lopsided grin,
eyes promising mischief.

241
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,329
l've seen it many times...

242
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,125
on his father.

243
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,171
lt was what drew me to him.

244
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,342
l fell to love the crooked bend
of Varro's lips

245
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,219
long before the man himself.

246
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,724
As did l.

247
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,648
Mira speaks of the mountains
to the east.

248
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,109
l have thoughts
towards dispatching men

249
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,153
to hunt for game.

250
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,657
Your brother tends to Janus
not far from there, does he not?

251
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,409
The moon within closer reach.

252
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,244
l would shorten the distance.

253
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,751
You think l have not longed
to have it so?

254
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,253
To be far from all of this?

255
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,634
l am branded fugitivus
with the rest of you.

256
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,638
What life could l offer my son
beneath such shadow?

257
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,057
None...

258
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:05,602
within the Republic.

259
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:11,566
All the coin l have relieved
of the Romans since our escape--

260
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,945
enough to buy you
and your son passage

261
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,112
far from these shores.

262
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,906
Spartacus--

263
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,992
Varro's last words
were of you and Janus,

264
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,829
that l see you cared for.

265
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,834
lt need not have been spoken.

266
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,516
Send word to Crescentia

267
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,352
that l must move our midday meal
to later in the week.

268
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,605
And respond to Varis' request

269
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,274
for our presence
at his celebration.

270
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,317
We will not be attending.

271
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,363
( giggles )

272
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,323
l know you
do not care for the man,

273
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,742
yet he is well connected.

274
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,661
We must make appearance.

275
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,413
Your father
would have it otherwise.

276
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:09,082
He dispatches me to Capua

277
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,876
to deal with Spartacus.

278
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:16,131
- l will have word with him.
- He is set upon it.

279
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:19,134
You are a praetor, Gaius.

280
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:22,637
Hunting errant slaves
is beneath you.

281
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,978
Yet it must be done.

282
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,107
But l promise
we will return to Rome

283
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,777
well before our child
enters this world.

284
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,946
We?

285
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,448
You will accompany me,
of course.

286
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:43,199
l will not.

287
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,951
Out.

288
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:56,171
l am bound to the house
of Batiatus by patronage,

289
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:59,174
granted only
to bury knowledge

290
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:00,550
of the blood
staining your hands.

291
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,302
What happened to Licinia
was an accident.

292
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,763
She was the cousin
of Marcus Crassus!

293
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,806
She was a fucking bitch!

294
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:19,736
All who knew of the deed

295
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,031
speak no more.

296
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,745
Let us put it behind us.

297
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,624
l intend to.

298
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:36,044
Now make preparations.

299
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,088
We leave for Capua

300
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,507
to put an end
to the curse of Spartacus.

301
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,639
You believe
the words of Marcellus,

302
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,225
bleated from tongue
with sword to neck?

303
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,310
Crixus moves on Arminius
and his place of whores,

304
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,937
and l will be at his side.

305
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:56,606
So we follow
the fucking Gaul now?

306
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,400
l swore aid in the matter.

307
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,151
You did not.

308
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,405
l would not think less
if you stayed from it.

309
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,825
l am with you.

310
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,537
You had me at whores.

311
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,957
Avoid unnecessary risk

312
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:17,585
and provoking words
towards the Gauls.

313
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,339
( man laughs )

314
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,633
( man coughs )

315
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,385
Was he swayed?

316
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,762
Have you met the man?

317
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,682
Taking such a large force
to the city is foolish.

318
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,853
As are all things
in the pursuit of a woman.

319
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,816
Peirastes leads
the hunt for game.

320
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:43,278
He will see you safely
to your son's arms,

321
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:46,322
from where you have been
too long absent.

322
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,411
See your boy to a man,

323
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:54,581
that l may one day greet him
as a brother.

324
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:57,876
l will tell Janus of you,

325
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:02,047
of the man who loved his father
above all others.

326
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,276
She takes to foot?

327
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,445
Long overdue.

328
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,450
As are many things this night.

329
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,410
This is not your fight,
Spartacus.

330
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,370
l gave my word.

331
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,456
Blood and honor,

332
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,333
it yet speaks to the man.

333
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:43,546
Then let us split darkness
with the cries of Romans.

334
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:47,383
( music playing )

335
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,178
( women laughing,
squealing )

336
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,100
( man shrieks )

337
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,705
( woman laughs )

338
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,582
( man yelling )

339
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,758
( laughter )

340
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,425
( screams )

341
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,760
( all screaming )

342
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,902
Go!

343
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,780
Trebius!

344
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,161
( screams )

345
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,720
( gasping )

346
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:13,404
Where is Trebius?

347
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,201
Where?

348
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,456
( women sobbing )

349
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,333
- Get off the fucking floor!
- No!

350
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,543
Get off the fucking floor,
bitch!

351
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,337
( screams )

352
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:30,755
( spits )

353
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,924
- ( chuckles )
- ( screaming )

354
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,593
Trebius.

355
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,306
l would have words.

356
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,017
l would not.

357
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,560
Raah!

358
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:45,937
( metal ringing )

359
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,480
Hah!

360
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,822
No!

361
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,452
- Your man?
- More guards!

362
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,037
We need--

363
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,623
Trebius. You fucking cunt!

364
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:06,791
Agron!

365
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:10,670
This is the Roman shit
that sold me and Duro to Batiatus.

366
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,630
My brother would be alive
if it were not for him.

367
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,340
He knows the whereabouts
of Naevia.

368
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:15,675
We will take him and go.

369
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,176
He will not last.

370
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,594
( groans )

371
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,597
l need but a moment.

372
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,182
You shall have it.

373
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,101
The man meets his end.

374
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:26,644
That is all that matters.

375
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:31,941
( men grunting )

376
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,694
- ( metal ringing )
- Man: Go!

377
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:37,155
( sobbing )

378
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,490
You brokered the sale of a woman

379
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,285
from the house of Batiatus,

380
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:44,203
dark of skin,

381
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:48,374
the mark of the domina
upon the back of her shoulder.

382
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,628
Where is she?

383
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:55,757
Fuck yourself.

384
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,759
l'm already dead.

385
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,721
( groans )

386
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,685
There is life in you yet.

387
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,688
Speak, and see it
ended quickly.

388
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,483
( gasping )

389
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,659
Spartacus: South?

390
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,245
There are villas and farms

391
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,622
far from the city.

392
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,749
And Naevia was sold
to one of them?

393
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,710
No. She was handed
from dominus to dominus,

394
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,588
a gift from Batiatus
to secure favor

395
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:37,131
on his campaign
for fucking aedile.

396
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,592
These places you speak of,

397
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,761
how heavily are they guarded?

398
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,554
lt would not matter
if the gods stood watch.

399
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,348
How many villas are there
in the south?

400
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,642
Over what spread of distance?

401
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,977
How will you know if Naevia's
even located in one of them?

402
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,480
Only a few are owned
by men of note,

403
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:56,234
cocks Batiatus would have sucked
to further his cause.

404
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,319
We'd be exposed,
in the open.

405
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,238
We must proceed
with caution.

406
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:01,447
( sighs )

407
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:04,325
You advising caution?

408
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,494
The tempest shouts
for the breeze to calm itself!

409
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,037
What good will
your death be to Naevia

410
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,914
if we do not pause to think?

411
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,250
She has been
from my arms too long.

412
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,670
l do not have time
to sit and ponder.

413
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:18,131
None of us do now.

414
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,924
What is your meaning?

415
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,805
With his last breath,
Trebius frothed of Rome

416
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,809
and the death that has been
dispatched from her bosom

417
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:32,478
to wash us away
in rivers of blood.

418
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:33,855
Soldiers.

419
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,732
Arriving with the sun.

420
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:42,113
Who leads them?

421
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,323
( neighs )

422
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,354
The city is in a panic.

423
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,232
Scores were slaughtered
in the raid against Arminius.

424
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,151
Halt!

425
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,154
See the men fed and rested.

426
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:26,157
Squads to sweep the countryside
by nightfall.

427
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,867
Your will, Praetor.

428
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,328
Fall out! Break supplies!

429
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,583
( shouting orders )

430
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,127
Do you have enough men for this?

431
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,840
lt does not appear
you have enough men.

432
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:45,885
They face only slaves,

433
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,386
not Hannibal at the gates.

434
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,056
They are gladiators,
led by Spartacus,

435
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:52,183
- the Slayer of the Shadow of--
- Where is the magistrate?

436
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,227
l would discuss this
with someone of note.

437
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,855
He was otherwise detained,
in view of last night's--

438
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,732
He sends apologies.

439
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,026
Seppius, however,
is eager for audience.

440
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,904
The man has
Praetor Varinius's ear.

441
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:07,949
l have no desire for his tongue
to fill mine as well.

442
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,163
l would address the people,
put their minds to ease,

443
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,749
tomorrow as the sun rises
in the marketplace.

444
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,876
( laughs )
What will you say?

445
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,837
Attend to the arrangements.

446
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,881
Yes, Praetor.

447
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,133
Why have l been brought here?

448
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,853
Gaius, why have l
been brought here?

449
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,021
To this house?

450
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,314
The hilltop offers

451
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,900
excellent vantage
of the surrounding country.

452
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:45,278
The ludus below will easily
garrison my men.

453
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,988
Then use it as such.

454
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,949
l will remove myself
to my father's villa.

455
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,123
You will stay at my side.

456
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:05,131
Now, set the house to order.

457
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,386
This is our home now, llithyia.

458
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,099
Until Spartacus falls.

459
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:20,646
l want everything
in this fucking house

460
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,898
seen over the cliff.

461
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,652
We will purchase
new appointments of much coin.

462
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,821
lf my husband
would have me here,

463
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,532
he can certainly pay
for the comfort.

464
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,535
And see all traces
of blood cleansed.

465
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:38,539
lt reeks of Batiatus
and his faded bitch.

466
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:41,459
- Go! Go!
- Yes, Domina.

467
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,450
( laughter )

468
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,330
( moaning )

469
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,938
( screams )

470
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:45,314
What has happened?

471
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:46,941
ln matters concerning my wife,

472
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:49,026
the gods themselves
fear to speculate.

473
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,364
( shuddering )

474
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,909
Have you lost wit?

475
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,372
Speak.

476
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,800
You should have sent word
you were coming.

477
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:17,012
We would have prepared a feast.

478
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,140
Lucretia.

479
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,808
You see it, then?

480
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:24,812
- You see it?
- ( claps hands ) Naevia,

481
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,731
bring wine
for our honored guests.

482
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,404
Kill it. Kill it! Kill it!

483
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,030
Praetor!

484
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,574
This is Batiatus's wife?

485
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,455
A shadow of the same.

486
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,081
And yet she lives.

487
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,666
To be spared from such carnage,

488
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,042
a blessing from the gods,

489
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,045
one that would calm a city,
if it were known to be such.

490
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,672
Naevia!

491
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,049
Apologies.

492
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,221
l do not know
where she's gone.

493
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,100
Lucretia: What...

494
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,935
Why do you pause?

495
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,521
She could prove
a powerful symbol.

496
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,064
lt would give the city hope

497
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,192
to see a woman
survive Spartacus and his men

498
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,027
and courage to confront them,

499
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:15,321
speeding your return to Rome.

500
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,702
Gaius...

501
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,205
you cannot let her live.

502
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,962
See her bathed and tended

503
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,424
and what fragments
her shattered mind yet holds.

504
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,095
( Lucretia muttering )

505
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,644
- The Roman army?!
- We are all of us dead!

506
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:49,063
- Grab your fucking cock.
- We never wanted this!

507
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:51,106
You gladiators,
you will see us all to our end.

508
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,901
- You little fuck.
- Agron!

509
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,411
We knew this day would come.

510
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,165
Some have feared its approach.

511
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:13,170
Others have longed for it.

512
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,716
Yet few have grasped
deeper meaning...

513
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,345
that this moment...

514
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:25,724
was always fated to be so.

515
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:31,689
l made promise to all of you

516
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:34,650
when the house of Batiatus fell...

517
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,612
that we would
see Rome tremble.

518
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,365
Doctore: You are the ones
that shall quake.

519
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,827
( murmuring )

520
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:52,084
l have witnessed Glaber
and his men entering the city,

521
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:57,339
enough in number
to end your lives.

522
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:03,637
Then stand with us,
and balance the odds.

523
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:08,017
Mercato has announced
Glaber will make address

524
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,144
in the market as day breaks.

525
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:12,605
lt would be wise to use
the distraction

526
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,566
and leave
such thoughts behind.

527
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,235
Doctore!

528
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:23,782
That is no longer my title.

529
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,284
Where do you go?

530
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,079
There is but one place

531
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,081
for an animal without honor.

532
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:36,253
( murmuring )

533
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,963
He is lost to us.

534
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,673
How many more
would you have follow?

535
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,300
- ( sobbing )
- Come on.

536
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:43,177
Join with us, brother.

537
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:44,553
We can head south

538
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:46,388
while Glaber cups his balls
and makes speeches.

539
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,016
He's the reason l am here

540
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,352
and my wife forever absent.

541
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,854
You often preach to me
about caution.

542
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,648
Turn advice now towards self.

543
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,150
- We are ready.
- ( gasping )

544
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:01,278
House slaves
playing at being men.

545
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:03,656
They are not gladiators.

546
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,367
They are not an army,
as much you wish it to be so.

547
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:14,124
Sleep upon it, Spartacus,

548
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,293
but when the sun rises,

549
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,504
l would see reason dawn.

550
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,061
Lucretia: Water.

551
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:37,064
How did we come by it,
with the drought?

552
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,359
llithyia: Drought is long past.

553
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,779
Do you not recall its ending?

554
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,035
lt is of no concern. Come.

555
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:53,497
l would have you dry
and seen to proper dress.

556
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,842
Your wound.

557
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:06,969
Wound?

558
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:09,221
How did you come by it?

559
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,902
Leave us.

560
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,122
lt must have been terrible...

561
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,500
trapped within these walls,

562
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:41,420
your beasts running wild.

563
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,007
Everyone believed you dead,

564
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:48,343
smashed upon the cliffs,

565
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:52,389
bits of bone and flesh...

566
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,559
your only testament.

567
00:39:57,771 --> 00:40:01,356
How did you survive all alone?

568
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,320
Lucretia.

569
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:09,948
We are friends, are we not?

570
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,952
The very best.

571
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:19,416
And you have so many--

572
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,503
Aemilia, Caecilia...

573
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,756
...Licinia.

574
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:31,428
Cousin to Marcus Crassus.

575
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:35,974
lt would be a very great honor
to be seen at her side.

576
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,310
Would you make introduction?

577
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,901
Let us see you dressed.

578
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:47,945
llithyia.

579
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:52,282
Why didn't you tell me?

580
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:59,373
You're with child.

581
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:07,631
Quintus and l have been trying
for such a long time.

582
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,468
This is a sign,

583
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,804
a sign from the gods.

584
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,896
Life blossoms
in the house of Batiatus.

585
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:35,909
This is why
we are yet in Capua...

586
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:40,205
why you saw Aurelia away.

587
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,749
You hoped
they would send Glaber.

588
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:45,669
No.

589
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,047
l prayed for it.

590
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,888
And what do you pray for now

591
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:59,016
to the gods
you do not believe in?

592
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,645
Would your wife
have wanted this?

593
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,357
To see her husband
consumed?

594
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,860
There are many things
she would not have wanted,

595
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,279
and yet they are so.

596
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:17,284
Follow Crixus to the south.

597
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:21,121
Do not let your vengeance

598
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:23,624
claim so many
you have saved from bondage.

599
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:37,638
l would not see another life
forfeit to my desires.

600
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:55,364
We will find Naevia

601
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:58,951
and move far beyond
the grasp of Rome...

602
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:05,123
far from the name Spartacus
they have branded you with.

603
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,129
Let us turn thought
from uncertain future

604
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,716
and embrace
fleeting moment.

605
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:28,897
Get up!
Move to fucking purpose.

606
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:31,149
Be ready when word is given.

607
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,110
You bark as a dominus.

608
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:35,070
Sheep stand idle
if not prodded by snapping jaw.

609
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:37,322
- Lazy fuck.
- Get up!

610
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,366
Does the maw from a pup
spur the same?

611
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:41,618
( laughter )

612
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:44,162
Let us compare teeth
and have answer.

613
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,665
Cease your quarrels.

614
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:50,002
l am for Spartacus
and the lay of his thoughts.

615
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,920
Last night, they were
towards heeding caution

616
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:54,756
and joining you in the south.

617
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:56,550
And in the light of morning?

618
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,848
He was gone from our bed
when l awoke.

619
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:08,520
( crowd murmuring )

620
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:11,565
Magistrate: There is no cause
for rising concerns!

621
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:14,443
The situation
is well in control!

622
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,986
What of Arminius?!

623
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,487
ls that fucking control?!

624
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,156
Seppius: No!

625
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,785
lt was an act of savagery,

626
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:28,123
committed by animals
who know nothing more.

627
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:33,378
These same beasts laid waste
to the house of Batiatus.

628
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:35,797
Many were lost that night,

629
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:38,050
women of proper standing,

630
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,802
men of honor and position,

631
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,138
my own cousin Sextus,

632
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,932
your beloved magistrate
of years past,

633
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,893
among the dead.

634
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:49,186
- ( murmuring )
- He speaks the truth!

635
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:51,980
At the hands of butchers,

636
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,566
who crave only blood and death.

637
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:58,320
And they shall see it
returned in kind.

638
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,284
But Spartacus leads them!

639
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:06,453
Even Theokoles fell before him!

640
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,623
He's the Bringer of Rain!

641
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:13,502
Spartacus is but a man,

642
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:17,172
and not all fall to his touch.

643
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:22,719
The wife
of Quintus Lentulus Batiatus

644
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,597
stood against
the merciless assault

645
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:28,892
of Spartacus and his dogs,

646
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,978
and by favor of the gods...

647
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:35,232
she yet lives.

648
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:52,582
Woman: lt's a miracle!

649
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,334
- Gods be praised!
- ( gasping )

650
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:57,003
- lt is a blessing!
- ( murmuring )

651
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:04,594
You stand eclipsed.

652
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,890
You ought to shed
a fucking tear.

653
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:12,310
She is their herald...

654
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:17,399
plucked from the shores
of the afterlife

655
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:19,401
to deliver a message

656
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:23,113
that Spartacus
shall never triumph

657
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:26,741
over the people of Capua!

658
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,035
( cheering )

659
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,003
He comes.

660
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:41,673
He comes.
He comes.

661
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:43,717
- He comes.
- Still yourself.

662
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:48,597
And yet the gods
grace us with further signs

663
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:52,934
that Spartacus's end is near.

664
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,190
Woman: Burn! Burn!
Just fucking burn her!

665
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,358
( crowd jeering )

666
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:05,906
Man: Open her guts
onto the ground!

667
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,578
Hack that bitch! Fuck her!

668
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,501
- Get rid of her!
- Gut the cunt!

669
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:34,142
My men came upon
a clutch of Batiatus' slaves

670
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:38,480
attempting harm
in the mountains to the east.

671
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:41,441
( gasps )

672
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:46,071
This one is all that remains
amongst the living.

673
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,866
Before she succumbs
to her wounds,

674
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:52,786
l will force
her tongue to purpose,

675
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:55,080
and with her dying breath,

676
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:57,040
she will tell me

677
00:47:57,208 --> 00:48:00,418
where Spartacus and his men
hide themselves.

678
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:06,424
And they shall be struck
from this mortal world

679
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:12,889
by the hand
of Gaius Claudius Glaber!

680
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:15,100
( cheering )

681
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:22,983
Glaber! Glaber! Glaber!

682
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,652
( cheering )

683
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,196
Preening little shit.

684
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:30,615
l rather favor him.

685
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:33,118
As l favor the shade
of our villa.

686
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:34,411
( giggles )

687
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,330
Thank you.

688
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:48,174
- Yaah!
- ( screams )

689
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:58,059
( yelling )

690
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,048
Surround him!

691
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,180
Seize him!

692
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:38,600
Spartacus!

693
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,207
Seize him!

694
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,669
Take Aurelia and go!

695
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,066
- Where is Naevia?
- ( screams )

696
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:41,371
Take him!

697
00:50:45,835 --> 00:50:47,210
You cannot win this!

698
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:55,301
Stay, and see vengeance
forever denied.

699
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:12,902
You are no better than Rhaskos
and the fucking Gauls.

700
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,030
All driven
only by your own desires.

701
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,950
Do any of us hold
fucking worth to you?

702
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:20,577
The reason l went alone.

703
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:24,205
A hard comfort, if you had
fallen to Glaber's men.

704
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:25,832
Agron would have led you south.

705
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,125
We need a leader,

706
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:30,211
not some angry boy
who can barely piss

707
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:31,838
without splashing
everyone about him.

708
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,590
What would you have me do?

709
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:38,052
Turn from the man that condemned
my wife to slavery?

710
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,055
Let him live,

711
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:44,392
that took everything from me?

712
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:53,067
Your heart still beats.

713
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:56,112
Place ear to chest,

714
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,073
and you will find it
absent sound.

715
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,953
And yet you are not dead.

716
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:08,333
Because of you.

717
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:10,627
Know that you have my gratitude.

718
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:15,131
l didn't come to lend you aid,
you mad fuck.

719
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:17,258
- ( coughs )
- l came to stop you.

720
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,890
You would place yourself between
Glaber and what he deserves?

721
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:28,353
As you would place yourself
between Naevia and me.

722
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:32,524
What do you think
would be the result

723
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:36,152
of killing a fucking praetor?

724
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,238
The Senate would burn upon itself,

725
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:41,115
belching forth fire and vengeance.

726
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,868
They would not send a few men,
as they do with Glaber.

727
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:45,245
They would send thousands,

728
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,413
a true army...

729
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:50,792
which we will never be.

730
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,798
( footsteps )

731
00:52:58,968 --> 00:53:01,261
Aurelia calls for you.

732
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:20,655
( gasping )

733
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,408
Spartacus.

734
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:26,035
l am here.

735
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:31,332
Promise me...

736
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,334
Anything.

737
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:36,880
Promise...

738
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,257
you will stay far from my son.

739
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:45,263
l would not have him die
in your wake...

740
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,434
as his father

741
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:51,352
and mother.

742
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:29,140
Glaber and his men
will pay in blood.

743
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:31,851
Gather swords.

744
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,603
No.

745
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:38,441
We move south...

746
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,946
to find Naevia.

747
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:47,241
Let Crixus and the other Gauls
chase lost hope.

748
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,535
- Spartacus--
- The decision's been made.

749
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,832
We must stand as one...

750
00:54:58,379 --> 00:55:01,756
or fall divided.

751
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,973
A lesson hard learned.

752
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,184
Shackle will be struck

753
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:15,979
from every slave
upon our path.

754
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,524
We will see
our numbers grow,

755
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:23,194
and when they
have become legion,

756
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:25,571
we will face Glaber

757
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:29,075
and the hordes of Rome again,

758
00:55:29,243 --> 00:55:32,245
and the gods shall weep
for their suffering.

759
00:55:37,243 --> 00:56:32,245

1
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:05,046
Oenomaus:
Freedom?

2
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:06,422
Batiatus: No longer shall
you be my Doctore.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,925
You will assume the mantle
of Lanista

4
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:12,303
and be warmly greeted
by your name-- Oenomaus.

5
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:16,099
- What is this madness?!
- Spartacus shows us the way.

6
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,519
He sends word to me
that one of the fallen

7
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,562
bore your name
carved into his chest.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,232
The consuls will present a motion
dispatching you to Capua.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,984
There are villas and farms
far from the city.

10
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,320
Naevia was handed
from dominus to dominus.

11
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,114
- ( gags )
- Spartacus: We move south

12
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,116
to find Naevia.

13
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,367
( screams )

14
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,244
This is Batiatus' wife?

15
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:39,372
- A shadow of the same.
- And yet she lives.

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,791
lt would give the city hope
to see a woman

17
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,459
survive Spartacus and his men.

18
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,131
- ( screams )
- Where do you go?

19
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,550
There is but one place

20
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:53,219
for an animal without honor.

21
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,524
( panting )

22
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,031
( muted crowd booing )

23
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,120
( crowd jeering )

24
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,842
- Come on!
- Raah!

25
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,510
( yelling )

26
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,264
Go on!

27
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,399
Yeah!

28
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,195
Kill!

29
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:48,459
- Yeah!
- Get up!

30
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,090
Man:
Take his fucking face off! Yeah!

31
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,511
- ( laughing )
- Yeah!

32
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:33,546
( yells )

33
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:38,301
( screaming )

34
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:49,061
Yeah!

35
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:53,774
( yelling )

36
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,287
( cheering )

37
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,665
Yeah!

38
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,848
That is no boy,
but fucking demon

39
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,101
belched from the cunt
of the underworld.

40
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,651
Your presence in the Pits
comes as welcome surprise.

41
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,196
When word that Titus Batiatus
graced us with his presence--

42
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:41,364
Where did you find him?

43
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,909
He's from a pack of Numidians
purchased from Maalok.

44
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,161
The others fell
within the week.

45
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,539
This one proves too dim
to sniff out their trail.

46
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,166
- Has he any training?
- Training?

47
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,377
A rabid dog would be
more agreeable pupil.

48
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,129
Barely answers
to the name given him.

49
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,131
All men can be tamed,

50
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,842
no matter how wild.

51
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,554
One must only find
an ember of purpose

52
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,598
and give it breath.

53
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,225
l give no shit to embers.

54
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:12,144
Coin warms my breast.

55
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,064
And the price
to see you so inflamed?

56
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,067
10 denarii,
and the boy is yours

57
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,152
to train, to fuck,

58
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,405
whatever you would
have of him.

59
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,031
Eight.

60
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,033
Eight? You appear
as honorable man,

61
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,494
yet attempt
to slip cock in ass.

62
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,873
lf l held such desire...

63
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,419
you would be split in two.

64
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,049
l give you this bargain
only to entice further purchases.

65
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,386
Rise.

66
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,221
Greet your new master, Oenomaus.

67
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,390
( crowd cheering nearby )

68
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,528
lt is time.

69
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,163
Filthy animals.

70
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,248
Living in offal and shit
beneath the city.

71
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,833
lf we'd known
they were there,

72
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,877
we would be riding
towards Rome

73
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,920
with news
of Spartacus's death.

74
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,881
Now they could be
anywhere.

75
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,884
He would have left the city
to rougher terrain.

76
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,178
lt will be no simple task
to sweep such an area.

77
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,889
More men would spur
to purpose.

78
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,266
Attempts to raise soldiers
have borne shriveled fruit.

79
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,435
lt is the fault of Seppius.

80
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,313
He's secured every man
familiar with sword as his own.

81
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,106
Perhaps it's time
we called on his support.

82
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,567
He is Varinius' man,

83
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,487
not worthy of such invitation.

84
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,280
And yet his men
prove a necessity.

85
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,324
lf we had them
in the marketplace,

86
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:51,452
Spartacus would never have
found himself so close to you.

87
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,996
The gods conspire
against you.

88
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,500
Return to your quarters.

89
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,461
They demand proper offering,

90
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,463
one of blood and sacrifice.

91
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,840
You speak of ritual?

92
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,384
To restore this house

93
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:11,305
and to force our enemies
to their knees.

94
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,477
See yourself to market

95
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:21,148
to gather what you require
when sun greets day.

96
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:25,194
And we shall confer
with Seppius.

97
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,613
l'll make arrangement.

98
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:39,667
You believe the gods
will heed your prayers?

99
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:42,378
lf my cause is just.

100
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:46,382
Then entreat them
to divine

101
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,760
where Spartacus
has gone to ground

102
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:53,806
before the villain
robs another Roman of his life.

103
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,492
( gasping )

104
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,755
( gags )

105
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,428
( yells )

106
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,890
Tiberius, l would finish.

107
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,600
Place cock in ass.

108
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:41,937
- ( men yell )
- Come on.

109
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,481
- ( yelling outside )
- ( metal clanging )

110
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,483
My robes! Quickly!

111
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,589
( women yelling )

112
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,259
( overlapping chatter )

113
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,305
Strike fear, and quiet concern.

114
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,641
Our quarrel is not with you.

115
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,310
lt's with those that would
place themselves your master...

116
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,564
a title that bears
no meaning to us,

117
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,734
nor to you now,
should you wish it so.

118
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,155
You are presented choice
as we once were:

119
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,494
to submit forever
to Roman cruelty

120
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,665
or take up arms
and to join us in freedom.

121
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,917
( whispers )

122
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,670
And who are you
to present such fucking offer?

123
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,134
l am Spartacus.

124
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,138
( gasping, murmuring )

125
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,056
Still your fucking tongues!

126
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,643
Are you the dominus
of this house?

127
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,272
l am.

128
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,399
( blade scrapes )

129
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,151
Then we should have words.

130
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,695
( yells )

131
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,200
What is it you seek?!

132
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,454
Give desire voice,
and see it satisfied.

133
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,457
You are a man
of fucking influence.

134
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,584
Yes. Yes.

135
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:11,378
l have the ear
of the magistrate.

136
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,505
l can deliver message.

137
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,633
lt is message sent to you
which l have interest in.

138
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,596
You were friends of Batiatus,
were you not?

139
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,182
( whimpering )

140
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,434
Were you not?!

141
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,771
l knew him only in passing.

142
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,649
He was filled with mad dreams

143
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,235
of rising
in prominence of office.

144
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,738
Yet he needed support.

145
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:41,283
To gain it, he sent a gift

146
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,869
from villa to villa
in this region,

147
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,915
a woman.

148
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,126
- A woman.
- You know of her?

149
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,587
lf l do...

150
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,798
my life yet spared?

151
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:01,678
Speak while you still
have fucking tongue!

152
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,934
She was-- she was here.

153
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,352
She was here.

154
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,730
You would break false word
to Jupiter himself

155
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,941
just to see another dawn.

156
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,567
No, no. No.

157
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,570
Dark of skin.
Hair roughly shorn.

158
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,407
The mark of her domina
upon the back of her shoulder.

159
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,785
Where is she?

160
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,621
l do not know.

161
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,374
She was put to cart after.

162
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,253
After?

163
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,840
How-- how--

164
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,593
how could l know
that she held meaning?

165
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,179
Did she not breathe?

166
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,057
Did her heart not beat
like any other woman's?

167
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,103
Yet you did not see
a woman, did you?

168
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,189
You just saw something
to be used and discarded.

169
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,693
- Please.
- You just saw a fucking slave!

170
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,738
- ( laughter )
- ( crashing )

171
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,117
Everything is in the back.

172
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,622
Yeah!

173
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,624
Take everything.

174
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,835
Your beauty stirs my cock.

175
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:18,046
A rise too slight
for eyes to notice.

176
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,676
- ( laughter )
- Hey!

177
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,219
That's how it's done.

178
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,721
( cheering )

179
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,806
That one smells of shit.

180
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,433
From where does he hail?

181
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:30,851
Gallia.

182
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:35,022
Gauls, they fuck absent regard
of pleasing a woman.

183
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,941
A skill lacking in most men.

184
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,153
And what of Spartacus?

185
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,613
How does he stand?

186
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,948
Above the rest...

187
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,533
in all regard.

188
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,285
Apologies.

189
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,870
l did not know he was yours.

190
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,707
l do not claim him
in such terms,

191
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,626
nor would he be
so enslaved.

192
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,462
He offers you protection
in return for affections.

193
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:00,923
We have no such
arrangement.

194
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,050
ls it love then?

195
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,141
Of course.

196
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,893
The hope of love to come.

197
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,479
A danger in its own right.

198
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,482
l need an accounting
of all food and supplies.

199
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,692
Find Vitus and see it done.

200
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,577
We suffered no casualties,

201
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,204
though Liscus and Acer
took minor wounds.

202
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,207
The Gauls grow careless.

203
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,917
How many weapons were secured?

204
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,710
Enough to see
a dozen more men well armed.

205
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,462
And we will put them to use

206
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,965
in the next villa that we take.

207
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,300
The dominus?

208
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,220
He recalled a slave

209
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,763
marked the same as Naevia.

210
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,807
Where was she taken?

211
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:54,142
She was put to cart

212
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,936
to be passed
to the next fucking dominus.

213
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,479
Crixus.

214
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,861
We will find her, brother,
and see everyone

215
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,864
that has kept her from your arms
to the afterlife.

216
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,908
♪ ...rains down
from an angry sky ♪

217
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,743
♪ My cock rages on ♪

218
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,662
♪ My cock rages on. ♪

219
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,665
l will see to my men

220
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,792
and Rhaskos's cock to cover.

221
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,961
( laughter )

222
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,921
Ah, Crixus.

223
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,007
Get down.

224
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,010
He is given crumbs,

225
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,845
yet you present
his fucking meal.

226
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,598
His heart aches
for nourishment.

227
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,600
l would have it well fed.

228
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,394
Even if Naevia lives,

229
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,896
she will not be the woman
he holds to memory.

230
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,940
lf we are to stand against Glaber
and the Romans,

231
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,067
we must liberate fighting men,

232
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,819
not waste effort
on dwindling hope

233
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,947
- and worthless house slaves.
- Every man has his worth,

234
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,493
a lesson
the Romans will soon learn.

235
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,875
The bonds of slavery
have been struck.

236
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:02,544
Never again

237
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:06,173
will you feel them tighten
around your neck

238
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,720
robbing you
of breath and life.

239
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,266
See your own join
your brothers

240
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,144
and take up just cause.

241
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,106
We will see the Romans bleed
for taking us as dogs,

242
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,110
to be yanked by the leash
at their command.

243
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,989
Tychos, Sophus,

244
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,532
weapons.

245
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,418
Now...

246
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,674
who would have blood?

247
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:55,430
This place...

248
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:59,142
the very air clings
to the flesh, tainting it.

249
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,978
Close eyes, Domina,

250
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,022
and replace thought.

251
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,470
( gasping )

252
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,948
llithyia.

253
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,533
( gasps )

254
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,912
Oh, Gaius.

255
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,958
You give heart
cause to flutter.

256
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,211
The water ripples
in evidence.

257
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:11,214
The result of your child

258
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:14,176
and firm kick
upon swollen belly.

259
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:20,098
Such aggression
prophesies a boy.

260
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,058
Would l give you any less?

261
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,102
You have given me much of late.

262
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,981
Your sacrifice
has not gone unnoticed.

263
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:32,819
Yet there is more
that l would ask.

264
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,071
You need but command it.

265
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:38,658
Escort Lucretia
to market at dawn.

266
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,410
She intends ceremony
to cleanse this house

267
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,037
and deliver my enemies.

268
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:44,456
The gods
would rather piss on Rome

269
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,666
than whisper in her ear.

270
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,669
People of this city
believe her prophet.

271
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,254
She is not to be trusted.

272
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,548
lt was not long ago
you named her friend.

273
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,425
A mistake dearly paid for.

274
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,178
A sum costing us both.

275
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,974
You truly believe her blessed?

276
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,103
Spartacus must fall

277
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,939
if we are to be
returned to Rome,

278
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,899
and l am willing to believe

279
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,651
whatever revelations
tumble from her lips

280
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,655
if they shall hasten
such a day.

281
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,366
Now...

282
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:24,579
see yourself dried
by loving hands

283
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,665
and to our bed.

284
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,171
( bleats )

285
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,049
Spartacus: Oh, to have
a proper bed once more.

286
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,387
lt's been a lifetime.

287
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,516
l have never
known such a thing.

288
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,479
Then it is much deserved.

289
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,984
Spartacus...

290
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,362
what we share...

291
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,116
what meaning
does it hold for you?

292
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,536
What answer would you have?

293
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,498
One spoken from the heart.

294
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,298
l have feasted so long
on pain and sorrow,

295
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,385
it is difficult
to recall sweeter taste

296
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:26,433
except when you
are in my arms.

297
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,188
Then let me
never be from them.

298
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:40,322
Spartacus!

299
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,290
You've already killed me once.

300
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,083
Do not hesitate
to revisit the deed.

301
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,544
He did nothing
but offer freedom,

302
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,129
and this is how you repay?

303
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,756
lt was not his to grant!

304
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,591
l was body slave
to the dominus.

305
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,635
l had position and respect.

306
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,386
You were a slave,

307
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,181
everything you possessed
a mere fleeting illusion.

308
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,724
You but take my master's place.

309
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,269
And what would your master
do now,

310
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,189
if he stood so assaulted?

311
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:15,523
He would see me dead.

312
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,236
Yes, he would.

313
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,662
You yet wish
to train this fuck?

314
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,039
The boy deserves opportunity.

315
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,874
He was given such a thing

316
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:36,461
and made attempt
on your life in response.

317
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,088
Gods save me.

318
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,799
l find myself in agreement
with a Gaul.

319
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,676
He has known nothing
but slavery,

320
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:46,262
the strength of such a tether
not easily severed.

321
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,349
- Perhaps never to be so.
- And if we take his life?

322
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,184
What message
will that send to those

323
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:52,602
who wish to join our cause?

324
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,229
That they
had best be agreeable.

325
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:55,397
We're Romans then?

326
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,857
Commanding through fear
and threat of death?

327
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,235
lf he makes attempt again,

328
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:03,363
l will make sure he joins
his fucking dominus.

329
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:16,001
And how do you propose
we train this wild little dog?

330
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:20,046
As Batiatus
had Doctore train me.

331
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,425
And that turned out so well.

332
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,683
( crowd cheering )

333
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:51,327
Liberius draws plumbatae!

334
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,495
- ( cheering )
- ( snarls )

335
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,920
Addonexus selects vinculum!

336
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,922
( cheering )

337
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,596
( yells )

338
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,686
Take his fucking head off!

339
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,546
Go on! Come on!

340
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,509
- ( yells )
- Yeah!

341
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:03,858
Release him.

342
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,537
- ( groans )
- Broken.

343
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,205
A minor injury,

344
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,290
meant only to instruct.

345
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,167
( groans )

346
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,838
l stand in victory in my match,

347
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,632
yet Doctore provides
only lash and rod as reward.

348
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,968
You believe
you deserve otherwise?

349
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:33,721
This is a house of champions,
Oenomaus.

350
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,807
lt does not submit to you.

351
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,475
You submit to it.

352
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,019
Yes, Dominus.

353
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,194
One must learn to kneel
if he is ever to rise.

354
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:51,072
A necessary lesson

355
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,490
if you are to one day

356
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,534
join the champions
of the House of Batiatus.

357
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,996
How is such a thing possible?

358
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:02,667
The answer lies
within your breast.

359
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:06,671
You fight with a strength of men
beyond your meager years,

360
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:10,675
yet lack the discipline
to see it properly harnessed.

361
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,804
Quintus, two cups of mulsum.

362
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,681
Tell me what l must do.

363
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,019
The most difficult of tasks.

364
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,816
You must discover your purpose.

365
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,527
- My purpose?
- That which you fight for.

366
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,154
l fight to stay alive.

367
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:32,947
( laughs )

368
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,700
As do we all.

369
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,620
But to grasp the heavens,

370
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,914
you must fight
for something greater,

371
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,583
something beyond
mere survival.

372
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,628
You are my dominus.

373
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,588
l fight for whatever you decide.

374
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:50,548
No, no.

375
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,759
This is a decision each man,

376
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:56,763
whether slave or freeborn,
must forge himself.

377
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,599
lt is yours alone.

378
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,780
To your purpose

379
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,950
and the destiny
it shall lead you to.

380
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,794
( yells )

381
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,718
Yeah!

382
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,107
Come on! Bring it!

383
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:06,457
( grunting )

384
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,593
( cheering )

385
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:27,353
Addonexus, victor!

386
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,523
Yeah!

387
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:36,696
Just fucking barely.

388
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,866
Send another to face me.

389
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,785
And what of his opponent?

390
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,622
Send him as well.

391
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,085
You wish to leave this world,

392
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,212
l shall ferry you.

393
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:58,968
Addonexus thirsts
for yet more blood.

394
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:02,388
- ( cheering )
- And he shall have it!

395
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,144
Last position!

396
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,812
- Attack!
- ( metal clanging )

397
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,439
( grunting )

398
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:12,899
Keep your left arm up!

399
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,489
- ( blade slaps )
- ( growls )

400
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,324
You carry a shield
as well as sword.

401
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:22,825
Not the man, the shoulder.

402
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,786
- Again.
- ( men grunt )

403
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,371
Attack!

404
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,541
Good.

405
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,711
( groans )

406
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,089
You expose flank,

407
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,715
the ruin of many a great man.

408
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,133
l'm no fucking soldier.

409
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,052
( laughs )

410
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,848
Not yet.

411
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:50,061
First and second position.

412
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,604
- Attack!
- ( men grunting )

413
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:52,772
lt's heavier than l imagined.

414
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,649
lt will lighten in time.

415
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:57,777
And when it becomes
as a feather,

416
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,821
what purpose
do you think it shall fly to?

417
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,619
One of your own choosing.

418
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,124
Now set foot to path...

419
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,709
- And second positions!
- ...and come at me again.

420
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,253
- Attack!
- ( men grunt )

421
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,805
Should have put the boy down.

422
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,723
A dog bites once,

423
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,809
he will bare
fucking teeth again.

424
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,311
Pity.

425
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,321
( goat bleats )

426
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:47,243
Why do they stare?

427
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,454
How could they not

428
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,706
when one blessed by the gods
moves among them?

429
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,499
The gods?

430
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:55,918
Oh, yes.

431
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:59,797
You rarely spoke of them
in times past.

432
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:03,134
Now the divine is held
as confidant and council.

433
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:06,137
Much has changed.

434
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,889
( bleating )

435
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,515
Curious words

436
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:13,644
from one who claims
no memory of the past.

437
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:18,774
Shadows of it begin to form
in the light of a new day.

438
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,193
( goat bleating )

439
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,529
What shape do they take?

440
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,781
One of secrets
passed between us.

441
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,702
You confessed
that you do not always heed

442
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,872
the commands of your father
or your husband.

443
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,792
( laughs )

444
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,962
You speak of my first visit
to your villa...

445
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,258
when we had yet to come
to truly know one another.

446
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:50,765
l so wished to please you.

447
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,767
You're the wife of the legatus.

448
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:55,102
Such a gift.

449
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,439
You do not know what it means

450
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:01,025
to find you within the walls
of my house once again,

451
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:05,947
filling it with life
and promise.

452
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,784
To survive such barbarity,

453
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:13,162
you are truly touched
by the gods.

454
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,623
Gratitude.

455
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,710
May the gods bless you.

456
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,171
( crowd murmuring )

457
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:23,839
May the gods bless you.

458
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,716
- Lucretia.
- Lucretia.

459
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:26,884
llithyia.

460
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,427
Bless me.

461
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,804
They seem
rather taken with her.

462
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:33,432
Seppia. A welcome sight.

463
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:39,188
Unless you intend tribute to
the oracle of Batiatus as well.

464
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:41,732
l do not push about in throngs.

465
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,735
l find the odor of desperation
lingers upon garment.

466
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,654
We are of similar mind.

467
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,948
More so tethered
by blood and marriage.

468
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,492
My brother only just departed
to sit with your husband.

469
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,370
- Men and their politics.
- Let us leave them to it

470
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:57,957
and turn thought
toward more pressing subject.

471
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:01,460
What news
of latest scandal from Rome?

472
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,754
Husband and coming child

473
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,548
have drawn attention
from such events.

474
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,842
l cannot believe you
so removed.

475
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,885
You are acquainted
with positively everybody.

476
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,847
And yet desired
by more than a few.

477
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:14,849
( giggles )
How l envy such attentions.

478
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:17,518
And how l miss them.

479
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:20,229
Must all joy be so abandoned
when weighted with husband?

480
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,233
lt must

481
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,944
if a woman is
of proper breeding.

482
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,071
Oh.

483
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,948
How miserable.

484
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,867
Perhaps l should
entreat the gods

485
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:35,202
to shield me from such dour fate.
( laughs )

486
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,208
Lucretia:
May the gods bless you.

487
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:44,337
- May the gods bless you.
- Lucretia.

488
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,963
- Lucretia.
- May the gods bless you.

489
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,381
- Lucretia.
- lt's a sign.

490
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,300
May the gods bless you

491
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,385
- Lucretia.
- Lucretia.

492
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,346
May the gods bless you.

493
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,363
Lucretia.

494
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,822
Bless me. Bless me.

495
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,908
May the gods bless you.

496
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:16,077
- Lucretia.
- Lucretia.

497
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,918
Spartacus was one of yours,
was he not?

498
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:28,964
During your overly brief
campaign in Thrace.

499
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,884
Conscripted to the auxiliary.

500
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,804
An animal prone
to disobedience even then.

501
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,180
A beast you brought
to our shores.

502
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,807
To die in the arena.

503
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,183
Yet he lives,

504
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,186
a pleasure denied
my noble cousin Sextus.

505
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,147
Many have suffered injury.

506
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:50,444
To be healed by news
of Spartacus' fall.

507
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:53,072
A venture l eagerly
set hands to months past.

508
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,574
Yes, word touched me
in the Senate of your efforts.

509
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,911
How many of your men
has he sent to the afterlife?

510
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,038
( sighs )

511
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,749
The man proves resourceful,

512
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:07,253
as he did when he set upon you
in the market square.

513
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:12,800
lt is a pity my men were not
present to end the matter.

514
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:17,596
Spartacus stands
a common foe, as l said.

515
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:22,184
Yes, my tribune cleaves
to the heart of it.

516
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:26,856
Spartacus is enemy
to us both,

517
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,108
shared in offense
and blood,

518
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:32,987
so let us
sweep aside differences

519
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:36,490
and in union
see him forced to knee.

520
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,002
l would need to consult Varinius
towards such agreement.

521
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,545
Are they your men or his?

522
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:53,841
And who would lead
combined effort?

523
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:57,261
You shall hold
station of note,

524
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,638
second only
to my command,

525
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,391
and promise
that you shall be present

526
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,351
when Spartacus
is put to grass.

527
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,604
The man takes habit of slipping
through your fingers.

528
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:09,273
What moves you
to certainty of victory?

529
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,066
Because the gods
themselves will it.

530
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,693
They speak with you now,
do they?

531
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,779
Through voice of former domina
of this very house.

532
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,031
- ( laughs ) Lucretia?
- They have blessed her,

533
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,241
as they blessed her
the night they guided her

534
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,868
from death
in the massacre.

535
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:24,997
Yet she is not alone
in such fortune.

536
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:27,333
Did the gods not...

537
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:32,087
guide your wife
to safety as well?

538
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:36,550
llithyia took leave

539
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:39,428
before unfortunate turn.

540
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:43,015
And with her,
a clutch of your men

541
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,727
soldiers that might have
tipped the balance

542
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:50,022
towards halting Spartacus
short of fucking slaughter.

543
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,025
You will tend your words with
more care in my presence, boy.

544
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:56,111
- Come, let us take seat--
- My words are carefully chosen

545
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,656
for a man holding title

546
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:01,075
as favor to his wife's father.

547
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:08,165
You speak to me
in such manner again,

548
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,626
and l will have your tongue.

549
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,256
Yet not my men.

550
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,056

You.

557
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,325
Slave, see my jug filled.

558
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,995
Rhaskos.

559
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,747
Fetch drink yourself.

560
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:56,046
Do not fucking drain jug

00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:04,263
You offer privilege
before it is properly earned.

564
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,765
And you would have them bow
and scrape in service

565
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,100
as they did
before their dominus?

566
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,436
No.

567
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:14,440
Yet neither would l have them
seen as equal.

568
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:17,318
They were not forged
of the brotherhood, as we were.

569
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,488
They join our cause
of their own free will.

570
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:25,367
Such fire may yet
prove more fierce.

571
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:28,287
Or be extinguished
by threatening storm.

572
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,917
l would move at first light.

573
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,627
There are yet more villas.

574
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,795
( men yelling )

575
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,972
You press fortune

576
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,975
glaring so
at the Slayer of Theokoles.

577
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:52,728
His victory
but proving even giants fall.

578
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:53,979
( laughs )

579
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,195
What name do you go by,
little man?

580
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:03,155
So l may properly
mourn your passing.

581
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:05,324
l'm called Tiberius.

582
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,201
Tiberius?

583
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:09,745
You are far too dark
to have such a fair Roman name.

584
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,455
l'm more Roman than Syrian.

585
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,417
There was a Syrian at our ludus.

586
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,422
A treacherous fuck,
if ever there breathed.

587
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,467
You had family there?

588
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,429
l only recall a brother.

589
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,933
l too had a brother.

590
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,811
No longer?

591
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,983
He was struck down
by the Romans.

592
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:42,152
When you turned swords
against them?

593
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,326
As you shall one day

594
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,204
if you hold any fucking sense.

595
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:08,929
Look at me.

596
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:13,559
l would see that pretty face
as l finish.

597
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:18,313
You fucking animal!

598
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,441
- Mira!
- Go!

599
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,067
Or part with your cock.

600
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,777
lf you were
not Spartacus' bitch,

601
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,864
l would show you
how to use that and my cock.

602
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,951
Apologies.
l will see that Rhaskos--

603
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,494
l chose to lay
with the fucking Gaul.

604
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:35,080
Why?

605
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,082
Not all of us have Spartacus
warm our beds

606
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,459
and see us to position.

607
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,252
You gain freedom

608
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,254
only to be enslaved
by that shit?

609
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:44,465
Freedom is not without cost.

610
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,468
l pay with the only coin l have.

611
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,386
As do you.

612
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,433
( men cheering )

613
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,378
Perhaps we should
stand further away

614
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:27,049
for fear of errant bolt
from the heavens.

615
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:31,053
Such ritual may bring profit,
absent cost.

616
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:33,514
The goat came
at no small expense.

617
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,391
The gods whisper
of deceit and treachery

618
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,020
and give assurance
that those who would harbor

619
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:43,315
secrets against you
shall be brought to light.

620
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,615
Accept our offering

621
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:57,329
and bless us with your favor
against our enemies.

622
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:07,256
ls it wise

623
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,758
to allow such unsteady hands
to play with knives?

624
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,677
Hold tongue.

625
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,547
( bleats )

626
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:04,855
Your will, my hands.

627
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,566
Hmm.

628
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,610
Perhaps another goat?

629
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:12,196
When ritual is ended,

630
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,531
see blood cleansed

631
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,658
and Lucretia attended.

632
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,708
( crowd cheering )

633
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,546
( footsteps )

634
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:34,051
You are to fight Caratacus next,

635
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,261
a beast that has claimed
many lives.

636
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:39,348
You believe he shall end mine?

637
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,433
ln your condition?
( laughs )

638
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,230
lf he does not,

639
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,981
send one that will.

640
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:51,818
Spectator:
Get up! Get up!

641
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,459
You have taken
important step

642
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:11,171
towards rising above
base animal.

643
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:15,008
lt shames me
l fought in that place,

644
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:16,593
absent thoughts of honor.

645
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,387
The Pits are for men whose lives

646
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,097
promise nothing greater
than an ugly end.

647
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:23,767
You are destined
for far grander fate.

648
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:25,644
The arena.

649
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:28,105
Place where legends are forged.

650
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:32,484
l fear for those that dare
take the sands against you.

651
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,611
l shall make
their deaths memorable.

652
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:35,988
The gods will be pleased.

653
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,906
l do not fight for the gods.

654
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:45,539
l fight for you.
That is my purpose, my life,

655
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:47,374
to honor the House of Batiatus.

656
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:55,465
The honor is mine.

657
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:02,556
( thunder rumbles )

658
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,228
( crowd yelling )

659
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:09,771
Yeah!

660
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:17,404
( cheering )

661
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:44,723
- Come on! Finish it!
- Yeah.

662
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,183
Take his head off!

663
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,990
Here. His blade!

664
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:03,427
( blade strikes )

665
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,889
( crowd groaning )

666
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,857
You.

667
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:23,697
Domina!

668
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:25,824
Men approach.

669
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:31,621
Torches arriving from the north.

670
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,373
How many?

671
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:34,875
Six, maybe more.
Gather the men.

672
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,793
Spartacus: Wait.

673
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:38,712
These may be scouts
from a larger force.

674
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,755
lf a single rider
was to escape our grasp,

675
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,382
it could bring
a far greater concern.

676
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:43,884
Then we shall grip tightly.

677
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,598
There is a better way,

678
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:53,518
one that will keep our movements
yet hidden from the Romans.

679
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:55,270
( bangs on door )

680
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,738
l would have words
with your dominus,

681
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:06,990
on orders of Seppius.

682
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,743
Apologies. Business has
called him to Picentia.

683
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,621
Picentia?

684
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,623
l have never known him
to favor the city.

685
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,791
He does not.

686
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,793
He favors its whores.

687
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,963
( laughs )

688
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:24,841
You are his body slave,
are you not?

689
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:28,303
Tiberius.

690
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:30,013
Tell me...

691
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,058
why are you
not at your dominus' side?

692
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,437
Because there's
no one he trusts more

693
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:39,272
to see his villa attended

694
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,358
while his cock is satisfied.

695
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,945
You serve your master well.

696
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,582
Return to your charge.

697
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,752
Wait.

698
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:07,926
You have come
a fair distance from Capua.

699
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:10,011
Come, and l will
give you something

700
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,930
to make effort worthwhile.

701
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:14,516
He betrays us.

702
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:16,726
( yells )

703
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:16,953
Spartacus!

704
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,666
( man yells )

705
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:38,933
Why did you stop them
from leaving?

706
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,101
He killed a man.

707
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:42,312
When he saw
they would not win.

708
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,605
His eyes fell to my neck.

709
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:44,939
He saw the absence
of my collar.

710
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,858
lf l had not allowed him in,

711
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,568
he would have returned
with more men.

712
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:58,119
You did well, Tiberius.

713
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:00,622
Nasir.

714
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:03,667
My brother called me Nasir.

715
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,972
Who disturbs peace
at such an hour?

716
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:26,856
l come bearing a gift

717
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:31,778
which shall set you upon path
to the fall of Spartacus.

718
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:39,244
The gods truly heed my prayers.

719
00:50:44,118 --> 00:51:39,244

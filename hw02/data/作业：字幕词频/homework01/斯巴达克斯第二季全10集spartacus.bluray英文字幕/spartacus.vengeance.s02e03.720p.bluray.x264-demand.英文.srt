1
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:08,091
You brokered the sale of a woman
from the house of Batiatus,

2
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,594
the mark of the domina
on the back of her shoulder.

3
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:12,762
Where is she?

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,931
Spartacus:
We will find her, brother,

5
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:16,974
and see everyone
that has kept her from your arms

6
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,102
to the afterlife.

7
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:23,106
We will see the Romans bleed
for taking us as dogs.

8
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,233
Spartacus is enemy to us both.

9
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:27,902
The man takes habit of slipping
through your fingers.

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,780
What moves you
to certainty of victory?

11
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,115
Because the gods themselves
will it.

12
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,450
May the gods bless you.

13
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:40,164
There is but one place
for an animal without honor.

14
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,210
You.

15
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,337
l come bearing a gift...

16
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:49,966
that shall set you upon path
to the fall of Spartacus.

17
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,511
( theme music playing )

18
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,144
( wheels clanking )

19
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:13,698
( chains rattling )

20
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:16,367
( woman crying )

21
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:23,291
Quiet your fucking bleating!

22
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:26,502
Still yourself.

23
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,421
This how you came for the mine,

24
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,882
by not heeding fucking command?

25
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,550
( clatter )

26
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,023
( slaves yelling )

27
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,442
See yourselves free.

28
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,450
( yells )

29
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,357
You favor clever strategy.

30
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:30,942
Fuck the man from behind.

31
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,360
( Agron chuckles )

32
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,992
A good start to the day.

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,537
Crixus:
l would see it built upon.

34
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,665
l seek a woman named Naevia.

35
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,960
She was cast out
from the House of Batiatus

36
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,336
before its fall.

37
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,713
Batiatus?

38
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,507
You are Spartacus?

39
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,260
l am Crixus.

40
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,179
Spartacus stands the fool
beside me.

41
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,475
The woman he seeks
is of rare beauty,

42
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,102
the mark of her domina
upon her back.

43
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,478
She was carried from...

44
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,647
Spartacus tells a sword
becomes lighter in time.

45
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:13,234
lt is a heavy thing
to rob a man of life.

46
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,986
Less so that of a Roman shit.

47
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,487
Stay close by.

48
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,865
l will help shoulder weight
until we can--

49
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,575
( gasps )

50
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,493
The girl, Naevia...

51
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,537
her fate, known to me.

52
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:25,788
Speak it then.

53
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,833
Spare a horse and my life.

54
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,167
Speak.

55
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,086
They add to our number,
yet not my cause.

56
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,254
We will find her.

57
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,755
Words you have
spoken many times,

58
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,090
still ignored by the gods.

59
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,009
( slaver screams )

60
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,390
The man, he spoke of your woman.

61
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,058
What did he say?

62
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,435
Find fucking voice.

63
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,020
Agron: Dead.

64
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,482
Naevia is dead.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,334
Mira: l cannot believe
she is gone.

66
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,837
The gods again turn from those
most worthy of blessing.

67
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,111
- l hold no love for the man.
- ( Crixus screaming )

68
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,905
Yet it tears heart
to see him so.

69
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,118
How did she meet her end?

70
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,704
Naevia was put to cart
for Lucania,

71
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,748
having served purpose
for Batiatus' ambition.

72
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,833
She perished in the mines?

73
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,169
She gave life in passage,

74
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,296
from injuries
borne of mistreatment.

75
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,924
Death a kindness then,

76
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,301
to be spared such a fate.

77
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,762
Kindness only to the one taken.

78
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,931
( yelling continues )

79
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,435
( yelling echoes )

80
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,104
( flesh sizzles )

81
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,984
The man yet stands mute.

82
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,361
This is what you would offer me
to gain favor?

83
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,489
A statue that bleeds?

84
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,449
Oenomaus believes himself
a man of honor.

85
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,452
Pain alone will not move him
to betray his brothers.

86
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,705
And l know the man well.

87
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,872
Given over to my hands--

88
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,082
Oh, do not think
l've forgotten

89
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,877
what your hands
are capable of, slave.

90
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,672
Or how they aided Batiatus

91
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,632
in tethering me to this house.

92
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,552
l but did
as my dominus commanded,

93
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,929
absent thought of refusal,

94
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,015
as l would
faithfully serve you now

95
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,891
in seeing Spartacus
brought to his end.

96
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,852
You speak of loyalties,

97
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,147
yet the mark of Batiatus
brings allegiance to question.

98
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:00,901
A blight upon flesh

99
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,238
forever mocking
more noble intentions.

100
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:05,906
Prove them...

101
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,787
and live to see
if you are of further use.

102
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,132
Your will,

103
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,010
my hands.

104
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,264
( grunting )

105
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,483
You must be patient.

106
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,984
The gods would not
deliver Oenomaus,

107
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,486
only to mock us
with his silence.

108
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,280
The sum of my doubts does
not lie with the gods alone.

109
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,532
lt's equally shared
with their messenger.

110
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,534
( laughter )

111
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,165
Ah. Here is our man.

112
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,667
Courteous to finally
acknowledge our presence.

113
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,836
Apologies.
l was unaware of your arrival.

114
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,755
The fault is mine,

115
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,007
between happy reunion
with father

116
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,302
and plying Varinius
for news of Rome.

117
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,304
ls this the lanista's wife,

118
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,807
the one they whisper of
in the streets?

119
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,558
Lucretia.

120
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,271
To find you alive
is a blessing from Olympus.

121
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,024
l am but its humble instrument.

122
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,776
You're overly modest.

123
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,361
To have survived such horrors,

124
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,531
Jupiter himself must have
taken note of your worth.

125
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,785
Varinius comes to present games.

126
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,788
- Games?
- Two weeks of blood and sport

127
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,498
to move this city
from heavy thought

128
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,668
of Spartacus yet untamed.

129
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:44,672
lt shall be glorious spectacle,
made more so

130
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,841
by your men presented
in opening celebration.

131
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,219
The sight of them coupled
with Lucretia in the pulvinus

132
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,347
shall help calm the citizenry.

133
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:57,101
An honor that l
would happily oblige,

134
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,646
were they not otherwise
occupied in the south.

135
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,731
Do they draw any closer
to their goal?

136
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,234
Or does Spartacus
yet elude them,

137
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,236
as l heard he did
in the market?

138
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:12,408
Perhaps Seppius' men
could march in your games.

139
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:15,744
lt's well known you hold
considerable sway with them.

140
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:19,832
Seppius' men do not carry
the seal of Rome as your men do.

141
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:23,627
Show good Varinius to wine

142
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,921
and enticing view
of the city below.

143
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,007
Varinius:
l would voice no argument.

144
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,468
Come then. l shall
see you properly attended.

145
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,437
Varinius is admired
within the Senate,

146
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,564
a thing to be
carefully considered

147
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,608
before words fly
from errant fucking tongue.

148
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,152
- Do l not stand his equal?
- ln title only.

149
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,738
They think you
an incompetent child,

150
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,574
unable to wipe clean
his own shit.

151
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,411
So a show of respect
towards a fellow praetor

152
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:01,081
would be wise step
towards quietening doubt, hmm?

153
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,001
Not only among the Senate.

154
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,592
Capua to the north.

155
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,135
Our current position, here.

156
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,722
To the east, Vesuvius.

157
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,515
Strong position to make camp.

158
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,976
Within striking distance
of Pompeii to the south.

159
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,105
Or Neapolis to the northwest.

160
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,025
Prison ships often
empty at its ports,

161
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,361
vomiting men
to be sold into slavery,

162
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,488
as my brother and l were
a lifetime ago.

163
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,658
l was carried
across the Adriatic

164
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,202
to the eastern seaboard.
l know little of Neapolis.

165
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,037
There are fighting men
brought to its shores?

166
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,705
Captured in foreign wars.

167
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,250
Already enemies of Rome
easily recruited to our cause.

168
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,713
A reasonable course.
Well thought.

169
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,924
l shall break words
with Crixus.

170
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,384
Towards what end?

171
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,136
He stands for the Gauls.

172
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,806
- Then he is waist-deep in shit.
- They are half our number

173
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:01,642
and much needed
in any attempt on Neapolis.

174
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,143
The man himself

175
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,521
is in need of distraction
from wounded soul.

176
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,306
How did you survive...

177
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:46,478
after your woman
was taken from you forever?

178
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,522
The man that l was did not.

179
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,655
l am but bones and flesh,

180
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,532
void of beating heart.

181
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,160
We will see empty chest filled

182
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,203
with the blood of Romans.

183
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,039
An ocean of it

184
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,499
would not wash away
what l have done.

185
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,710
What you have done?

186
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,837
l pursued Naevia's affections,

187
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,049
regardless of concern
toward discovery,

188
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,718
of what Lucretia would do if...

189
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,388
betrayal were known.

190
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,478
Naevia is gone
from this world...

191
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,607
because of
my selfish desires.

192
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,109
We do not choose love.

193
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,237
lt claims each man as it will.

194
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,577
And it grips
until there is nothing left.

195
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:49,291
An empty hand
can yet become a fist.

196
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:53,170
How many more remain
shackled in servitude

197
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,713
as Naevia was?

198
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,174
Without hope of love
or gentle touch?

199
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,593
Together we can strike chain
from neck--

200
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:03,263
On this subject,
l have heard your thoughts.

201
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,103
Leave me to my own.

202
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,315
She was a radiant spirit.

203
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,902
Yet she died a slave.

204
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,072
A fate shared by my wife.

205
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,326
l would not see
more like them fall

206
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:28,997
because men who could
make difference stood idle.

207
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,975
A sword in his chest
would be a blow less felt.

208
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,021
We have all made sacrifices.

209
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,607
- Crixus now makes his.
- l would speak with him.

210
00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:00,279
Your words would only cause
greater suffering.

211
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,698
lf he knew the truth...

212
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,741
l would not have you
and countless others

213
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,410
fall in vain attempt.

214
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:08,996
Come.

215
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:11,540
There is much planning
yet needed towards Neapolis.

216
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,056
Ah, that vacant gaze.

217
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,685
l've witnessed it before,

218
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,271
when you were upon your knees
in the Pits, awaiting death.

219
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,734
Or were you longing for it?

220
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,652
ls that why you sought out

221
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,447
a place void of precious honor?

222
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,408
A thought drags
the mighty Oenomaus

223
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,577
into the depth
of the underworld?

224
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,038
Your betrayal of the house
that saved you

225
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,040
from such torment there?

226
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,918
A brotherhood turning
your instruction as Doctore

227
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,419
to treachery or murder?

228
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,547
Or that Ashur
escaped your attempt

229
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,925
to rob him of life?

230
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,682
A thing of low importance.

231
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,227
Let us set past behind us...

232
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:19,066
...and turn eye towards
less quarrelsome future.

233
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,029
Ah. No, no.

234
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,948
You must ask for it.

235
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,826
You must break silence
and speak.

236
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:35,290
You thirst for water?

237
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,959
For the release of death?

238
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,838
Free your tongue,
and see desires quenched.

239
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,968
( scoffs )

240
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:56,103
Tell me where Spartacus
and his shits are to be found.

241
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,564
They have spat on everything
you've held true.

242
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,567
You owe them nothing.

243
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,860
Speak, you fucking cunt.

244
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,783
Very well.

245
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,702
Remain silent.

246
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,705
Remain living and in pain

247
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,790
day after day

248
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,751
with only Ashur
to comfort you...

249
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:25,424
as you once comforted me
upon these very sands.

250
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,653
You should have warned me
of their arrival.

251
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,656
l was swept by the moment.

252
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,117
They stood
but a short length waiting.

253
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,411
Long enough for your father
to slip noose about my neck.

254
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,289
All will be forgotten
when you present your men.

255
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,583
Oh, to honor a jest of a man.

256
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,003
Go.

257
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,256
To honor your child...

258
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,637
with a father that will rise
within the Senate.

259
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:23,899
l did not care for Varinius' hand
upon you.

260
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,152
Nor l.

261
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:39,581
His touch will never know
wetter climes.

262
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,433
Pressing concerns
pull mind from task.

263
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,102
Task?

264
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,021
You know my meaning.

265
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,816
Must confer with Marcus

266
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,236
towards the recall of my troops
from the south.

267
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,114
( men grunting )

268
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,283
We must not fall to quarrel!

269
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,788
- You fucking--
- Get off him.

270
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,169
Vesuvius will
serve purpose well.

271
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:29,214
Agron speaks of fighting men
to be liberated from Neapolis

272
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,590
not far from its banks.

273
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,843
Agron can suck the piss
from my cock.

274
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,594
Too small a drink for a man.

275
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,929
Fuck you!

276
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,640
- Vesuvius offers advantage.
- Fucking coward.

277
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,184
From its shadow, we can strike
at the ports of Neapolis,

278
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,520
ships heavy with warriors

279
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,397
captured by the Romans,

280
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,482
as many of us once were.

281
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,984
Let us hear from Crixus!

282
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,944
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

283
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,821
Crixus:
And what would he say?

284
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,242
What words
would make difference?

285
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,787
The ones l have told myself?

286
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:04,458
Ones of hope...

287
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,544
and promise of better days?

288
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,507
Throat can no longer
make such empty noise.

289
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:15,802
lt is choked with loss.

290
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,140
An agony familiar
to many of us.

291
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,479
Spartacus lost his wife.

292
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,690
Yet his fire still burns.

293
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,986
Agron, a brother.

294
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,864
Yet his fire still burns.

295
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,742
We have all lost.

296
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,496
We have all seen
those held as friend...

297
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,666
as family...

298
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,212
as lover...

299
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:54,090
fall to the Romans.

300
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,511
Yet our fire still burns.

301
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,141
And together,

302
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,853
we shall ignite an inferno.

303
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:15,111
l move to Vesuvius
with Spartacus.

304
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,074
( cheering )

305
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:33,338
- ( grunting )
- ( yelling )

306
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,886
( groans softly )

307
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,932
( growls )

308
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,688
( panting )

309
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:54,109
You will speak.

310
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:55,902
ln your final moments,

311
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,406
when you beg for life's end,

312
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:02,492
you will tell me
where Spartacus and--

313
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,500
You fucking cunt.

314
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,921
l shall tear the words
from your fucking mouth.

315
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,468
Lucretia: Ashur!

316
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,905
Oenomaus must not die
before prophecy is fulfilled.

317
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,740
Then entreat the fucking heavens
to pry his lips.

318
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,074
Oh, you would do well

319
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,035
to seal your own,
lest tongue escape you.

320
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,579
l should never have returned
to this house.

321
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,374
Fortunes darken
as consequence.

322
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,002
Look to the gods
for illumination.

323
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,130
The gods?

324
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,427
Was it Jupiter
that found you near death?

325
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:10,477
Or Venus who stitched
your mangled womb?

326
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,355
( screaming )

327
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:20,528
Did Mars see you
fed and clothed?

328
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,739
Did Apollo deliver Oenomaus
into your hands?

329
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,491
No!

330
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:27,577
lt was Ashur,
lowest of fucking mortals.

331
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:30,372
You but service
the will of the gods.

332
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,999
- l was serving you.
- And l them.

333
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,924
( laughs )

334
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:47,097
Then l fear
that we are both forsaken.

335
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,018
The man will not speak.

336
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,687
Absent his words,

337
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,398
your prophecy
will fall to ruin,

338
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,358
the pious
quickly to follow.

339
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,446
Even the dead
may give voice to passion.

340
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:06,908
The man stands empty
of such worldly vice.

341
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,370
Then see him filled

342
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,789
with memories of the past.

343
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,378
There is a secret buried
within these walls.

344
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:23,383
And you will see it exhumed

345
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,802
and the corpse set to purpose.

346
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:35,729
( dice rattle )

347
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,481
Double or nothing.

348
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,241
The hour grows late,

349
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:49,993
and our bed cold.

350
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,412
Fall to it.

351
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,622
l'll be with you presently.

352
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,085
A maddening thing,

353
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,588
to forever be waiting for you,

354
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:03,256
far from your side.

355
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,259
lt's not always
the safest place,

356
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,344
as many have learned.

357
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,141
l am not the past.

358
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:17,437
l stand with you now

359
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,981
and would hold more value
than gentle touch

360
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,858
and satisfying your needs.

361
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,320
l would stand beside you,

362
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:28,490
blade gripped
in hand slick with Roman blood.

363
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,660
l will not be helpless
as Naevia was...

364
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:37,415
her life slow march
towards death.

365
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,628
We all move toward such end.

366
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:44,047
Only the length
of the journey differs.

367
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:46,800
Then let us greet it together...

368
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,471
and show not all go quietly.

369
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,257
No, no. l've got it.

370
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,508
- You got it?
- Yes.

371
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,927
( laughs )
You intend to spirit away

372
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,429
the entire villa in that trunk?

373
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,349
We do not know
what Vesuvius holds, Chadara.

374
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:37,934
Agron would have us
well supplied.

375
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,435
Agron, yes.

376
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,563
He is of a form, is he not?

377
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,064
l suppose.

378
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,649
Oh, you suppose?

379
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,068
Do not think l have not noticed
your eyes upon him,

380
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,570
nor the way of late

381
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,780
you have been huddled together
in intimate conversation.

382
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:53,658
You mistake
subject of discussion.

383
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,119
Yet not the blush
upon your cheek when he is near.

384
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,163
( laughs )

385
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:02,458
You would do yourself well
to pursue desire.

386
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,669
l would myself,
if l believed he favored me.

387
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,713
l thought you were
taken with Rhaskos.

388
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,882
Rhaskos is a base animal,

389
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,508
yet one with sharp claws,

390
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,427
offering protection
and position.

391
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,055
Spartacus holds Agron
in much high esteem.

392
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,767
l envy you his attentions.

393
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,984
( overlapping chatter )

394
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:29,235
We can reach Vesuvius
by nightfall

395
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:30,862
if we put
the slaver wagon to use.

396
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,280
lt would commit us to the roads.

397
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:33,573
The forest
would hide our numbers.

398
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:34,741
And slow progress.

399
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:37,160
A fair trade, to see us all
to the mountain alive.

400
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,085
Crixus.

401
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,379
l was not in favor
of your training.

402
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,131
Do you know the reason?

403
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,592
l made attempt on Spartacus.

404
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,221
As have l,
on more than one occasion.

405
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,764
l did not trust you,

406
00:25:57,932 --> 00:25:59,891
because you are Syrian.

407
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,434
l have had
unfortunate acquaintance

408
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:04,187
with one of your people,

409
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:06,981
as did my woman--
Naevia.

410
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,108
Apologies.

411
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,527
He caused her much pain.

412
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,029
Yet despite this,

413
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,906
she would not have held you
for his actions.

414
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,533
Such was her heart,

415
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,160
one l shall try to honor

416
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,746
in thought and deed.

417
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,299
There is something
l must tell you.

418
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,094
Rome considers us nagging fly.

419
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,179
After Neapolis,
they shall know the sting--

420
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:39,764
Agron!

421
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:49,023
Take your man!

422
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,733
- Fucking shit!
- l'll fucking kill you!

423
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,111
Have you lost mind?

424
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,487
Regained heart.

425
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:55,905
Naevia lives.

426
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,034
How do you come by this?

427
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:01,536
The boy Nasir.

428
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:04,205
The slaver told
not of her death,

429
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:05,707
but of her suffering
in the mines.

430
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,625
An equal fate.

431
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,335
Why would you bear false tongue

432
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:10,837
when a life
holds in the balance?

433
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:12,547
What of our lives?

434
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:17,176
What of our lives?!

435
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:22,557
Crixus has no thought
towards any but Naevia

436
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:25,685
and would have us all
meet our end

437
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,645
in foolish attempt on the mines.

438
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,607
l did what needed to be done,
Spartacus.

439
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,319
You must see this.

440
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:43,369
A lie for the greater good.

441
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,001
One that would never
have passed lips,

442
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,628
had it been your brother Duro
in her place.

443
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:02,013
lf a single life
holds no value...

444
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:04,807
then none are of worth!

445
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,820
l stand with Crixus

446
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:20,198
and will see Naevia
from bondage.

447
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,911
l will not fucking die for this.

448
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,706
l move for Vesuvius.

449
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,001
Those that would live...

450
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,340


451
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,477
Fuck.

452
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:01,614
( overlapping chattering )

453
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,623
( chuckles )

454
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,959
He returns to us.

455
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,045
l have sat vigil

456
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,422
throughout chill embrace
of night,

457
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,007
concerned that in eruption,
l had...

458
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,969
released you to the afterlife.

459
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:24,470
Gates, hup.

460
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:27,140
lt swells heart to find you
yet bound to this world.

461
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,601
Still not a word?

462
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,355
Very well. Save voice.

463
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,443
l would enjoy the sweet caress
of my own.

464
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,988
So very much to speak of,

465
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:44,449
long years of secrets
within this house,

466
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,702
seeping in the very bones
that support it.

467
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,288
Place ear to any beam,

468
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:53,791
and marvel at the whispers
of the past.

469
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,296
lt was there
that l first discovered Crixus

470
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:01,299
embrace an ill-fated love
with the young Naevia.

471
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:09,098
There, dominus blessed me
with elevation

472
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:11,225
upon heel of ending
Magistrate Calavius

473
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,478
and cursing Solonius
with the deed.

474
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,480
Further inside,

475
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,648
where Gannicus
first took your wife

476
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,568
as entertainment
for noble Varis.

477
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,242
Lie.

478
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,786
( sighs )

479
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,706
Stone at last cracks

480
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:35,708
in defense of a fucking whore.

481
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:41,214
Were you really so blind?

482
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,341
The lingering gazes
they shared?

483
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:46,511
The subtle change
in your brother?

484
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:53,226
You know nothing
of brotherhood.

485
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,895
Nor did Gannicus.

486
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,231
Have you never asked yourself
how your wife

487
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,691
came to sip a tainted wine

488
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,735
that was meant
for Batiatus? Hmm?

489
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:04,946
And she was not in the habit
of thieving, was she,

490
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:08,908
or partaking of drink alone.

491
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,746
Do you recall that night?

492
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,541
Gannicus to be sold
the next morning.

493
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:20,336
You conveniently
removed to town.

494
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:25,675
Your wife slipping away
into Gannicus' cell.

495
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,928
One last drink.

496
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:33,474
One last fuck.

497
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,603
( coughs )

498
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,523
You're all the same.

499
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,400
Spartacus, Crixus,

500
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:46,070
the noble Oenomaus.

501
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:49,782
Fallen to ruin for a woman
plowed by other men's cock.

502
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:55,121
Search heart
and feel the sting of truth.

503
00:31:57,291 --> 00:32:00,209
lt was a gift for Titus.

504
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,128
How did it come
to pass her lips?

505
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:03,588
She was no thief.

506
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,925
Your wife betrayed you,

507
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,261
your brother--

508
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,722
everyone you believed
to love you.

509
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,684
What does a serpent
know of love?

510
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:18,185
Oh.

511
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,146
That its bite is often fatal.

512
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,691
Your wife fell to its venom,

513
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,611
as did the traitor
Spartacus' bitch.

514
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,614
Even the mighty Gaul
saw his heart withered

515
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,618
when ripe Naevia was plucked
forever from his grasp.

516
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,620
They will find her

517
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,205
and, one day...

518
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,334
your fucking throat.

519
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,837
Find her?

520
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:51,927
That is why they
have moved south.

521
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,513
( laughs )

522
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,311
Spartacus is not the one
that spurs their intent.

523
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:02,855
Crixus?

524
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,316
The Gaul who lost mind
before you and Batiatus

525
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,235
and attacked me,
his purpose then as now,

526
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:12,031
love for domina's
body slave Naevia.

527
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:15,368
You pledged to discover
Spartacus' location.

528
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,203
lnstead you return

529
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:20,206
with tales of fluttering hearts.

530
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:23,000
She was taken from this house.
l know Crixus.

531
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,710
He will not rest until--

532
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,504
See him to proper reward!

533
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,297
Wait! Wait! Wait!

534
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,259
You would turn from the gods

535
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,928
and their guidance?

536
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:40,309
Even if this crude vessel
disgorged truth,

537
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,353
such knowledge
provides little more

538
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,647
than feather upon breeze.

539
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:47,650
Yet l know of calming winds

540
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:51,654
and where a dark little feather
came to rest at tempest's end.

541
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,832
Do not die, you simple fuck.

542
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,167
Will you mourn me if l do?

543
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,503
Until l find better to fill me.

544
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:10,631
- Bitch.
- ( laughs )

545
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,762
Are we to attack naked,

546
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,849
with our cocks as weapons?

547
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,059
You would fare just as well.

548
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:25,062
Remove yourself
from fucking sight.

549
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,230
Go.

550
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,357
Seek us out at Vesuvius

551
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:29,817
if you live.

552
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,652
Pray l do not.

553
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,489
l accompanied my dominus
to the mines once.

554
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,283
l may be of some aid.

555
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,660
Well received.

556
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,040
Fucking Syrians.

557
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,044
The wagon is readied.

558
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:54,967
Spartacus.

559
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,389
Save words for Naevia,

560
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,266
when we have returned her
to your arms.

561
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,769
l would have it so

562
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,437
or perish in the attempt.

563
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:26,081
Move along, you fucking dogs!

564
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,530
Do not expose brand.

565
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,157
We will lose advantage of
being thought as common slaves.

566
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:03,369
A crack to Liscus' skull
will add to the deception.

567
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:04,537
( laughs )

568
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,916
That's the wagon for Ferox.

569
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,377
Lower voice.

570
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,675
Keep moving, cunt.

571
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,677
Do l give coin to sit upon ass?

572
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:21,637
See them from the fucking wagon!

573
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:24,098
Out.

574
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:28,644
Hurry up.

575
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:31,146
ls this the stock from Ferox?

576
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:33,566
Two days past expected delivery.

577
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,192
- Two fucking days!
- Apologies. l--

578
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,862
l do not know you.
Where is Ferox?

579
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,322
Dead.

580
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,575
We were set upon by Spartacus
and his shits,

581
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:45,536
the reason for our delay
and Ferox's permanent absence.

582
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:55,170
( laughs )

583
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,632
l have wished the man
to grass for many years.

584
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,885
Yet he fucks me
from the afterlife.

585
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,178
Schedule now teeters upon brink,

586
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,181
with little hope
of regaining balance.

587
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,017
Yes, again, apologies. l--

588
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,977
Am l to present myself now?

589
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:14,815
Yes. Yes!

590
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:17,192
A special offering,
to compensate your troubles.

591
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,694
Wait here.

592
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:21,572
Rotten cunt serves no trade.

593
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,717
( laughs )

594
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:45,304
What misdeed sees such beauty
condemned to the mines?

595
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:48,265
Form words, or find my cock
reason you cannot.

596
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,434
l fell in love.

597
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,354
( chuckles )
Well, no danger of that here.

598
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:56,982
( gasps )

599
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,443
l would have you
form words now,

600
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,195
or find your cock
upon the floor.

601
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:04,365
There was a woman brought here
from the House of Batiatus,

602
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,950
beautiful and young,

603
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,161
one a fat shit like you
would have taken notice of.

604
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:10,746
Speak.

605
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:12,915
l know of no such woman.

606
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,250
Search fucking memory.

607
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,919
She is dark of skin

608
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:19,546
with the mark of Batiatus' wife
upon the back of her shoulder.

609
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,967
l do recall one
as you just described.

610
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,260
Does she yet draw breath?

611
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,470
l believe it so.

612
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,931
- ( groans )
- Where is she?

613
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,432
Assigned to dig
the eastern vein.

614
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,268
( groans )
There is a map.

615
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,355
Show me.

616
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:37,690
Slowly.

617
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,858
Mira has been gone too long.

618
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:43,612
You there.

619
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,035
From where do you hail?

620
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,662
Sicilia.

621
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,622
( panting )
ln the tunnel

622
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:57,251
where it branches off, here--

623
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,172
l have seen you before...

624
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,757
somewhere.

625
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,177
The arena.

626
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,619
Keys quickly. Come.

627
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,124
Mira.

628
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,252
lt is Roman blood.

629
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,337
Did he know of her?

630
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,505
Does Naevia live?

631
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:44,715
She does.

632
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:48,093
Mannus, Plenus,
assume their mantle.

633
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:50,137
Make it known if any
become aware of our presence.

634
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:52,056
lnto the mines. Quickly.

635
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,103
Come, brother.

636
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,688
Let us see heart restored.

637
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,231
Go.

638
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,567
Move. Go!

639
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,827
Mmm, you really must try this.

640
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:15,662
lt is divine.

641
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,415
l fear stomach turned
at the moment.

642
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,917
l do not envy you.

643
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,878
Sickness with every sunrise.
Swelling beyond reason.

644
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,839
Though the breasts
are a benefit, l suppose.

645
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,132
( chuckles )

646
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,427
To feel a child
grow within you.

647
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,137
There is no greater blessing.

648
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,556
What of being thought of
other than matron?

649
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:38,185
Enticing men until they
fawn over your every word,

650
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,938
aching to receive
the slightest touch? ( laughs )

651
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:44,399
The bonds of marriage
desired result.

652
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:48,987
l suppose
it would not be too horrid

653
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,448
if he were handsome and rich

654
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,283
and thought of nothing
but his hands upon me.

655
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,786
( laughs )

656
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,834
Lust, as all things,

657
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,294
fades with the passing of years.

658
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,588
( horns sound )

659
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,007
( cheering )

660
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,509
Sun draws high.

661
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:12,719
Let us fall to our seats
and see day begin.

662
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:18,100
Varinius tells that your men
are to be presented.

663
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:21,019
Yes. The request
would have fallen to yours

664
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,938
if they were proper soldiers.

665
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:24,356
( chuckles )

666
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:27,985
l look forward to witnessing
proper Roman formation.

667
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:30,362
lt should be a pleasant
distraction for the people

668
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,574
while my men
bring Spartacus to justice.

669
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:35,868
Yes.

670
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,877
Are your soldiers to purpose?

671
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,628
They are.

672
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,672
The crowd is yours, Varinius.

673
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,596
Good citizens of Capua!

674
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,392
l present these games to honor
the beloved sister of Rome!

675
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:04,396
And to send message
that her spirit

676
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:07,608
shall never be quelled by those
who seek to cause her injury.

677
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,318
( cheering )

678
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,819
Your cheers in the coming days

679
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,447
shall serve as balm
to wounded heart,

680
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:16,825
a wound shared by many
in this great city

681
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,203
so inflicted by the treachery

682
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,455
of Spartacus
and his murderous horde.

683
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:23,790
- ( booing )
- Yeah!

684
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:27,961
l call now upon the sons
of Rome to march,

685
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,297
the thunder of their every step
a declaration

686
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,966
that loss and grief

687
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,552
shall give way
to triumph and joy!

688
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,804
( cheering )

689
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,769
Spectator:
What's happening?

690
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:45,520
Come on.
No one's coming!

691
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,898
- ( booing )
- Where are they?

692
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,441
What the fuck
is going on?

693
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,823
Where are your fucking men?

694
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,952
Set to purpose,
as promised.

695
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,959
Hey, forward!

696
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,128
Find the fucking passage.

697
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,050
Seal the road.

698
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:18,512
You!

699
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:23,350
We come on order of
Praetor Gaius Claudius Glaber.

700
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,185
Has attempt been made
to breach the mines?

701
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,604
None. lt stands secure.

702
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:31,692
Dispatch word to Capua.

703
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,318
l would turn from fool's errand

704
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:35,195
and recommit
to sweep the countryside.

705
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,834
Seize him!

706
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,713
l know these men.

707
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,214
Mannus and Plenus,

708
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,049
gladiators bearing
the mark of Batiatus.

709
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:06,226
Spartacus is here.

710
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:09,271
( men grunting )

711
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,356
Which way do we go?

712
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:12,774
They both
should lead us to it.

713
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:15,235
This one the shorter path.

714
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:16,486
l would double odds
toward goal.

715
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,238
Take the longer path.

716
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:20,073
Move quietly.

717
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,495
( booing )

718
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,040
People of Capua!

719
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:31,335
Noble Varinius!

720
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,337
l offer apologies!

721
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,715
l do not seek to lower spirits

722
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:40,052
with absence of display,

723
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:43,221
but instead to raise them up

724
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,807
with knowledge that my soldiers

725
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:49,061
have been set to higher purpose

726
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,896
by the gods themselves!

727
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:52,773
( cheering )

728
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,400
At this very moment,

729
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:58,403
they close on Spartacus!

730
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,243
And by day's end,

731
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:08,747
he shall once more kneel

732
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:12,626
before the glory of Rome!

733
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:15,462
- ( cheering )
- Rome!

734
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,964
( chanting )
Rome! Rome! Rome!

735
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:21,259
Rome! Rome! Rome!

736
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,303
Rome! Rome!

737
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:25,889
Rome! Rome! Rome!

738
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,521
( water splashing )

739
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,530
We must see them freed.

740
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,907
There are too many of them.

741
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,242
We would be discovered.

742
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:51,164
Live,

743
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:53,500
and know l will return.

744
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:56,169
Crixus: Naevia!

745
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,340
Naevia.

746
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:09,307
Naevia?

747
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:11,852
Naevia!

748
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,649
This is where
he said she would be?

749
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:19,192
lf he spoke truth.

750
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,659
Crixus!

751
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:30,537
There is one here with mark
of her domina upon back!

752
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,875
Naevia. Naevia?

753
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:42,257
( woman sobbing )

754
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:43,925
No.

755
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,054
You are safe.

756
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,140
You are safe now.

757
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:57,522
l'm here.

758
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,945
Crixus?

759
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:09,993
Crixus:
Forgive me.

760
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,622
Forgive me
for what l have done.

761
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:17,667
Spartacus,
someone comes.

762
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:23,256
Go! Go!

763
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:25,091
Roman:
They're down here!

764
00:47:42,235 --> 00:47:43,485
Ashur.

765
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:45,904
Ashur!

766
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:48,615
Move! Move! Go!

767
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,330
( cheering )

768
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,977
Come on!

769
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,187
( metal clanging )

770
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:20,855
( gladiator yells )

771
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:26,486
Here!

772
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,325
( yelling )

773
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,003
- ( gasps )
- ( cheering )

774
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,342
Wait!

775
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,844
There's a runoff.

776
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:53,054
lt empties out
on the other side of the mine.

777
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:54,556
Which path do we take?

778
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:56,725
- Quickly!
- This way.

779
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,023
She leads us
to our fucking death.

780
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:08,278
Take breath,
and gain your bearing.

781
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,116
A turn missed.
lt will take us to the water.

782
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,703
Here.

783
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:27,255
Move! Stay together.

784
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:30,717
Wait!

785
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:36,264
Come on! Go!

786
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:38,642
- Weapon.
- Come on.

787
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,813
Roman: Back there, by the gate.

788
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,983
l will give them pause...

789
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,445
so you may slip from grasp.

790
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:52,113
- Roman: You two, down there.
- Right.

791
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,617
See Naevia to safety.

792
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:57,911
Crixus!

793
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,413
See it done, brother.

794
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:02,332
- ( shrieks )
- Go! Go!

795
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,833
Spartacus!

796
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,420
Go!

797
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:14,969
( shrieks )

798
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,433
- Yeah!
- Ooh!

799
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,070
Fuck you!

800
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:34,280
Fuck you, bastard!
You Roman dog!

801
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:03,768
( chanting )
Kill! Kill!

802
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:05,812
( stadium crowd chanting )

803
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:08,982
No!

804
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,074
Naevia: Crixus!

805
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:19,242
Crixus!

806
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,791
Crixus! Crixus.

807
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:28,376
Naevia: Crixus!

808
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:30,420
( sobbing )

809
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:39,012
( theme music playing )

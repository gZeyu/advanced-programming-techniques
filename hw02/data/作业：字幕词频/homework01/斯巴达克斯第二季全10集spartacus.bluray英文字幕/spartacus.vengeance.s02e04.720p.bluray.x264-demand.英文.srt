1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,297
( laughter )

2
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:09,175
Glaber: l did not care
for Varinius' hand upon you.

3
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,426
Nor l.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,138
The girl, Naevia.

5
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,349
- What did he say?
- Dead.

6
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,101
The slaver told
not of her death,

7
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,269
but of her suffering
in the mines!

8
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,980
l stand with Crixus and will
see Naevia from bondage.

9
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,273
l move for Vesuvius.

10
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,359
Those that would live,
join me.

11
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,319
Noble Varinius!

12
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:29,487
l offer apologies.

13
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:33,449
My soldiers have been set
to higher purpose!

14
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,451
- lnto the mines.
- Quickly!

15
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:40,289
At this very moment,
they close on Spartacus!

16
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,666
( cheering )

17
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,167
You're safe.

18
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,877
You're safe now.

19
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,045
Crixus?

20
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,548
- ( chuckles )
- See Naevia to safety.

21
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,093
- ( blade rings )
- No!

22
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,346
( theme music playing )

23
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,399
( birds chirping )

24
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,740
( croaks )

25
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,745
- ( whimpers )
- Shh.

26
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,050
Shh.

27
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,181
( screams )

28
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,183
- Mira: Naevia!
- Halt!

29
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,145
- Swing around to the left!
- ( yelling )

30
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,689
Soldier: l've got her!

31
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:17,947
( yells )

32
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,542
( yelling )

33
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,723
( panting )

34
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,184
- You made me run.
- ( sobbing )

35
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,312
l fucking hate running.

36
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,230
( Mira screaming )

37
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,572
- ( men grunting )
- ( metal clanging )

38
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,003
- ( flesh squelches )
- ( bone cracks )

39
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,947
l would see Tychos to ground,

40
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,115
far from Roman hands.

41
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,285
More come.

42
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,121
- Soldier: For Rome!
- ( horn sounds )

43
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,791
( soldier yelling orders )

44
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,250
Right.

45
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,962
- There is no time for it.
- lt does not fucking matter.

46
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,255
We shall all join him soon.

47
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,770
Spartacus shall fall.

48
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,773
ls that not the reason
for my presence in Capua?

49
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,400
To shit with reason.

50
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,026
The absence of your troops
from the games

51
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,861
was an insult to good Varinius.

52
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,114
The Republic would bear
far greater slight

53
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,282
were l to turn from purpose.

54
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,452
Seppius has been searching
for the Thracian for months.

55
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,371
How came you to divine
he would make attempt

56
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,789
on the mines at Lucania?

57
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:36,127
Because the gods
themselves presented it

58
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,379
through voice
of humble servant.

59
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,425
- Lucretia?
- Her counsel moved my hand.

60
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,345
Perhaps your course
was justified then.

61
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,348
l pray it true.

62
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,183
Otherwise offense has been made

63
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,935
upon the ramblings
of a madwoman.

64
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,353
We have moved
past this, llithyia.

65
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,771
ln spirit, at least.

66
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:01,318
Let us make it a thing
of the flesh with celebration

67
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,070
here within these walls

68
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,739
to pay tribute owed.

69
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,617
An excellent notion.
Well received, yes?

70
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,287
lt would stand the more
grievous insult to refuse.

71
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,080
( chuckles )

72
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,208
You honor me.

73
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,044
The honor is mine.

74
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,925
l only thought to help.

75
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,594
By plying that preening shit

76
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,471
with celebration
in our own house?

77
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,056
Our house is in Rome, Gaius,

78
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,892
and l would speed return.

79
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,478
With Varinius' support,
you will have Seppius' men.

80
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,563
Now worth their weight in piss.

81
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,233
When Marcus returns with
Spartacus as Lucretia fore--

82
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,985
You place
too high a value on her.

83
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:46,530
She will drag us to ruin
when it plummets.

84
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,285
Lucretia continues
to prove herself

85
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,080
worthy of such estimation.

86
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,625
Would that my own wife
held the same.

87
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,638
- ( gasps )
- Spartacus!

88
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,228
- She needs a moment.
- She needs to fucking move.

89
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,021
How quickly
would your feet carry

90
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,523
after months
condemned to that place?

91
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,566
She is not alone
in needing rest.

92
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,111
The lack of it
sets nerve to edge.

93
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,741
We will find higher ground,

94
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,368
better defended if set upon.

95
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,370
Can you walk but a little more?

96
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,747
She will make it.

97
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,834
Come on.

98
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,256
The weight of her increases
with each step.

99
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,258
Perhaps it is time
to lighten burden.

100
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,468
l swore a promise to Crixus.
She is the man's heart.

101
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,137
Would you again
tear it from his chest?

102
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,847
Crixus is dead,

103
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,473
and l would be freed
of his woman

104
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,976
before we fucking share
the same fate.

105
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,311
We move for Vesuvius
to rejoin Agron,

106
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,230
all of us.

107
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,857
Speak of this again,
and the Romans

108
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,525
will be the least
of your concerns.

109
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,329
Ashur: Tychos,

110
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,039
one of the lesser men.

111
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,749
Let him serve as a warning

112
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,587
that Rome is not
so easily defied.

113
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,634
Their numbers dwindle.

114
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,929
Yet ours follow
at more rapid pace.

115
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:37,016
- Up!
- We still hold the greater sum.

116
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,479
Spartacus and his men
are gladiators.

117
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,689
A handful of your men

118
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,107
would stand a pale shadow
against one--

119
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,817
Roman soldiers
know something of death

120
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:47,985
and the dealing of it.

121
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,946
Do not measure their worth
against common slaves.

122
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,699
Slaves, true,
but far from common.

123
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,201
Move absent proper force,

124
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,662
and see the rank
of the dead swell.

125
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,041
Your men...

126
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,585
are spread too thin
throughout the forest.

127
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,004
A single man
carried by a swift purpose

128
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,589
could return
with reinforcements--

129
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,133
Carry word to the other squads.

130
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,718
- We do not rest.
- Tribune--

131
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,595
See this to its end

132
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,431
in the name
of Gaius Claudius Glaber.

133
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,892
Turn from your charge,

134
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,269
and l'll put a sword
in your fucking back.

135
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,322
Varinius is a man
of the highest regard.

136
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,241
See his cup always full

137
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,576
and all desires met.
Am l understood?

138
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,078
- Domina.
- Yes, domina.

139
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,872
- ( laughs )
- lt's true.

140
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,749
Promise.

141
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,252
Bathe and prepare yourselves.

142
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,420
- ( laughs )
- Seppia.

143
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,715
Apologies. l was not
told of your arrival.

144
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,593
None required.
l came seeking Lucretia's counsel.

145
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,265
A thing desired by many,
it would seem.

146
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,933
Your words set her to path.

147
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,434
Mine?

148
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,145
You are forever extolling
the virtues of marriage.

149
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,647
Wisdom of years

150
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,275
has finally proven
master over fatuous youth.

151
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,110
You've found a husband
so quickly?

152
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,779
lf the gods bless such a union.

153
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,781
l shall entreat them
on your behalf.

154
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,492
With their favor,
Varinius shall be yours.

155
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,537
Varinius?

156
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,747
ls he not handsome
and tall and strong

157
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,207
and of means?

158
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:29,712
The form of a man every woman
longs to call her own.

159
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,964
He would make a husband
to rival all others.

160
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,549
( Seppia giggles )

161
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,134
l must prepare myself
for his celebration.

162
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,802
l would catch his eye

163
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,471
and, with it, see the rest
of him swiftly follow.

164
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,771
You have made
impression upon her.

165
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,234
As have you.

166
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,988
No longer is pilgrimage
needed to Delphi.

167
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,991
Those seeking
the consideration of the gods

168
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,286
need only bow
to the oracle of Capua.

169
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,666
l am but humble vessel

170
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,252
offering a mere taste
of their will.

171
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,047
Then Seppia shall find tonight
a bitter draft.

172
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,715
Varinius is a praetor.

173
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,676
As is your husband.

174
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,054
Yet Varinius
rises more quickly

175
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,014
and one day shall
hold title of consul.

176
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,809
The wife of such a man must
possess refinement and poise,

177
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:29,188
traits yet lacking
in a spoiled little girl.

178
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,066
Perhaps you would have me

179
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,734
petition the gods
for a different union...

180
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,071
one closer to heart.

181
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,115
The morning cock
has better chance

182
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,617
of crowing
to such heights.

183
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,370
Your husband believes otherwise,
as does your father.

184
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:50,376
When Marcus returns
absent Spartacus,

185
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,294
you shall be revealed
as what you are,

186
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,046
an empty vessel,

187
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:58,133
barren of life and prophecy.

188
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,303
See yourself
dressed for tonight.

189
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,554
l have no doubt my husband

190
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,557
will wish to parade you about
as favored pet.

191
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:10,354
Your husband's trust
is valued gift.

192
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,941
Yet yours would prove
the greater treasure.

193
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,819
Soldier:
Open the gates!

194
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,695
Packers, tend to your horses!

195
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,323
( overlapping chatter )

196
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,543
( chuckles )

197
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,420
Soldier: Line them up!

198
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,175
The faith placed in me
is not mislaid.

199
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,011
Spartacus proves
where l predicted.

200
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,513
Praetor.

201
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,432
This is all that stand captured?

202
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,392
Many more lay dead
in the mines.

203
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,967
Your Gaul returns
to you at least.

204
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,471
Where is Spartacus?

205
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,974
He fled into the woods
with a clutch of slaves.

206
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,601
Marcus gives chase.

207
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:34,146
Alert me the moment
he is sighted upon road.

208
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,278
- To the cells.
- Move!

209
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:45,491
Even aided
by your divine guidance,

210
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,993
he stands with empty hands.

211
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,497
He will yet find
Spartacus between them.

212
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,831
The gods--

213
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,666
Your tongue writhes
absent their purpose.

214
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,169
Was Naevia not found
in the mines as l foretold?

215
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,172
And who so condemned her
to such a place?

216
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,216
Juno...

217
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,468
or a lanista's wife,

218
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,845
more earthly bound?

219
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,848
Your prophecies bear
the stench of opportunity.

220
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,350
Oenomaus--

221
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,018
Was delivered
by your dead husband's man,

222
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,647
a toad who has seen
his share of wounds.

223
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,946
l wonder if he
could mend them as well.

224
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,121
Do not think me the fool

225
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,582
as my husband and father.

226
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,211
You and l have
unfinished affairs...

227
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,840
and l would see them
draw to a close.

228
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,514
Get in!

229
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,015
( laughs )

230
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,810
Again to this house
of piss and shit.

231
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,562
A fate l alone should bear.

232
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,063
The risk was known to us all.

233
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,941
Fuck risk,
and fuck the fucking Romans.

234
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:04,069
l stand with you
in this life and the next.

235
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,988
As do l.

236
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,242
The bonds of brotherhood.

237
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,662
They have always run deep
within these walls.

238
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,919
Oenomaus.

239
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,259
What has happened?

240
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,261
How did you come here?

241
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,929
l was a fool...

242
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,933
that now stands
in fellow company.

243
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,435
Their fault lies

244
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,645
only in following me
on impossible journey.

245
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:40,731
Naevia lives.

246
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,985
We liberated her from the mines.

247
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,614
Love.

248
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,118
You fall to ruin for love.

249
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,497
She is my heart.

250
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,459
She is a woman...

251
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,379
a delicate creature
at the best of times.

252
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,467
They are moved by desires

253
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,470
unknown by the men
that place trust in them.

254
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,937
She lives.

255
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,399
That is all that matters.

256
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,617
( gasping )

257
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,205
Mira: Shh.

258
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,956
You're safe now.

259
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,418
You are safe.

260
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,368
You do not rest?

261
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,329
l would not see
another of us fall.

262
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,960
Not even the gods could have
done more to prevent it.

263
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,131
A thought holding
no comfort to the dead.

264
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,551
( Naevia screams )

265
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,219
- Naevia.
- ( men shout )

266
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,266
- ( Naevia screams )
- Liscus!

267
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,685
- ( wails )
- Nasir.

268
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,730
He risked life to save my own.

269
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,692
And l am forever in his debt.

270
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,445
( yells )
You were right.

271
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:19,157
My sword becomes lighter

272
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,992
with each Roman l have taken.

273
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,455
( gasping )

274
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,381

Most impressive showing.

279
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,666
Staggers to think
this house so recently a tomb.

285

Such memories shall soon
be cleansed from thought,

286
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,391
never again to darken mind.

287
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,226
l long for such a day.

288
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,312
Let us hasten it
with ample libation.

289
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,064
l fear Mercato
may lose himself

290
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,316
in the bottom of a cup

291
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,526
and forget that
we are of position.

292
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,528
l would never
make spectacle of myself.

293
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:39,696
( giggles )

294
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,072
Gallienus:
Come then.

295
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,408
l would test the strength
of your resolve

296
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,536
and my own as well!

297
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,955
l have never
beheld sour Gallienus

298
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,249
in such high spirits.

299
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,418
This celebration already
proves clever suggestion.

300
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,587
To be made brilliant

301
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,714
if Spartacus's capture
were to be announced.

302
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,428
The gods may yet bless us this night
with unexpected gifts.

303
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,723
Let us entreat them
with wine and song,

304
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:09,267
our voices to carry
to Olympus itself.

305
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:13,021
This house once sat
perched within its reach.

306
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:16,733
l have worshiped here
myself upon occasion.

307
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,401
( Varinius laughs )

308
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,613
Good Cossutius.

309
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,239
l had not heard
you were in Capua.

310
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,950
He comes for my games.

311
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,453
And to remove himself
from the prudish eyes of Rome.

312
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,955
Ah! Both just cause.

313
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,791
llithyia: Come.
Let us enjoy spectacle.

314
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,536
Truly a feast for the senses.

315
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:12,122
Even l stand speechless.

316
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,083
Then l shall seize
upon rare moment...

317
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,170
to honor noble guest.

318
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,091
Good citizens of Capua,

319
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,260
your presence

320
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:28,179
here in this house
once stood cursed

321
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,182
is testament
to your courage and faith,

322
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,684
faith not only in me,

323
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:35,270
but in the body
of the Senate as well,

324
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:38,648
represented
by beloved Albinius...

325
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,359
- Good Albinius!
- ...and noble Varinius.

326
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,863
( applause )

327
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,782
A man worthy of celebration

328
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,536
for his generosity in providing
distraction with games

329
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,664
to ease troubled thoughts.

330
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,666
( applause )

331
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,211
Man:
Praise Praetor Varinius.

332
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,299
- ( overlapping chatter )
- To the Republic!

333
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,009
See how they admire you.

334
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,386
Man:
Good Varinius.

335
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,264
( applause continues )

336
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,729
The girl takes
your counsel to heart.

337
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,565
And l repay
your kind attendance

338
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:24,069
with welcome news
of retribution.

339
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,653
( crowd murmurs )

340
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,238
My soldiers return

341
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,742
with news of Spartacus'
imminent capture...

342
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,911
- ( crowd gasping )
- Yes!

343
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,246
( cheering )

344
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,750
And offer in advance

345
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:42,754
the lives of the few
surviving remnants

346
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,924
of his most trusted men.

347
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,827
These gladiators...

348
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:18,623
these slaves,
were responsible

349
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:22,752
for the deaths
of many of your noble kin...

350
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:25,922
and they will pay...

351
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,591
with blood.

352
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,885
( crowd yelling )

353
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,390
Praetor Varinius.

354
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,809
Pressing concerns
forced hand

355
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,645
in preventing my men
from presenting at your games.

356
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,607
l offer you the lives
of these enemies of Rome

357
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,360
to balm unintentional wounds.

358
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,449
Man: Cut the pig!

359
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,535
( crowd cheering )

360
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,414
Man:
Come on, we want blood!

361
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,016
Gratitude for this honor

362
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:21,978
and for your tireless pursuit
of the villain Spartacus.

363
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:26,524
- Yet l cannot accept.
- ( crowd gasping )

364
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,778
l cannot accept,
because to do so

365
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:34,407
would rob the people of this
city of deserved pleasures.

366
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,160
Let these men
not fall here tonight

367
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:39,120
in the honor of a single man,

368
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:42,540
but in the arena
before all of Capua!

369
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,043
( cheering )

370
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,045
Man:
Justice be had!

371
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,380
- Great Varinius!
- ( applause )

372
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,723
( water splashing )

373
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:02,435
Water!

374
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,111
( gasping )

375
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,117
Drink.

376
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,745
The boy fought well.

377
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,164
Would this were wine to send him
properly on his way.

378
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,709
You speak of him
as if already gone.

379
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,795
Then he speaks the truth.

380
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:30,380
Naevia is burden enough.

381
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,756
We have settled this.

382
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,383
Come to reason.

383
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,426
There is more blood upon
the ground than within him.

384
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,845
Even if we carry him,
he will not survive.

385
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,264
But he will leave a trail,

386
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,515
one that the Romans
shall follow.

387
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,392
We cannot just leave him.

388
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,853
No, we cannot.

389
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:50,149
You would take his life?

390
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:53,278
l would but sever
dangling thread.

391
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,530
lt would be a kindness.

392
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:57,699
You will not touch him.

393
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,034
Then do it yourself.

394
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,829
Put him from misery,
as you did Varro.

395
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,548
Crixus.

396
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,302
He survived worse

397
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,429
against Theokoles.

398
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,224
The boy too will live

399
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,935
if his wound
is sealed with fire.

400
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,565
Fire would call
the Romans down upon us.

401
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:31,983
Then we must be quick

402
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,736
and be gone before they arrive.

403
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,487
And if we are not?

404
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,990
We do not have enough men.

405
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,658
No, we do not.

406
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:47,623
Find Agron
and bring all to purpose.

407
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,502
We will follow as swiftly
as we are able.

408
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,339
l fear it will not
be swift enough.

409
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,515
( music playing )

410
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,251
( laughter )

411
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,340
( no audible dialogue )

412
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,557
Trussed as game
awaiting slaughter,

413
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,435
yet the man
still eyes us as prey.

414
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:52,855
The fire will soon be put
from rebellious eyes.

415
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,399
A fitting end
to your games, Varinius.

416
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,150
lt shall be a day
etched in memory.

417
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:58,694
l cannot wait to see their blood
spill upon the sands.

418
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,239
- ( giggles )
- Nor l.

419
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:04,242
Yet should they not fall here,
in the very place

420
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,745
they robbed our beloved
cousin Sextus of his life?

421
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,916
A man dearly missed.

422
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:15,920
lt is a pity he shall
not be honored this night.

423
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:19,215
Would the greater honor
not be before all of Capua?

424
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,428
( Varinius chuckles )

425
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,388
We are politicians, are we not?

426
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:28,099
Let us come to middle ground
and see everyone satisfied.

427
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,101
Choose a single man,

428
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,062
and let us make sport of him
in memory of your cousin.

429
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,858
A most judicious compromise.

430
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:41,446
Seppius is not the only one
who stands injured.

431
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,239
The gods themselves took note

432
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:44,782
of the horrors
inflicted upon Lucretia

433
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,327
and pluck her from
the shores of the afterlife

434
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,037
to voice their desires.

435
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,458
Should she not choose
what blood is shed

436
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,919
beneath roof
she once claimed her own?

437
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:06,471
She has been
most sorely grieved.

438
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,557
lf there are no objections...

439
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,894
What mortal
dares defy the gods?

440
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,271
Only one who would draw
their wrath.

441
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:29,076
Varinius has seen fit

442
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,079
to allow us a taste
of the blood to come,

443
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:35,333
a single man to be sacrificed
to this house

444
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,752
where so many lives
were stolen

445
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,671
by Spartacus
and his jackals,

446
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,841
to be chosen
by its former domina,

447
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:47,470
the gods themselves
guiding her hand.

448
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:50,431
( applause )

449
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:20,628
The gods have chosen.

450
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,214
This one.

451
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,758
( cheering )

452
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,722
We shall draw lots

453
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,724
and cut but shallow
to prolong the game.

454
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,561
Seppius to stand first,
in honor of fallen cousin.

455
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,772
Fuck the lot of you Roman cunts!

456
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,233
( laughs )

457
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,735
( overlapping chatter )

458
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:07,592
Do not think that the gods
have shown you mercy.

459
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,844
l but delay your passing

460
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:12,013
so that l may savor it.

461
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:16,601
My life is gladly given

462
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,561
for Naevia's.

463
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,105
She lives?

464
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,274
( chuckles )

465
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,193
Far from your fucking grasp.

466
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:28,738
News greeted with joy.

467
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,949
l would have her hear
of your final moments

468
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:35,369
in the arena
you held so dear

469
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:37,830
and the crowd
which once cheered your name

470
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,166
spitting upon you.

471
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,668
And when you fall,

472
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,920
it will not be as champion,

473
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,631
but as a common slave,

474
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,216
absent honor
and absent glory

475
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,345
and your name
forever lost to history.

476
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:58,100
( muffled grunting )

477
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,647
- ( yelling )
- ( laughter )

478
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,401
Let this shit speak now
of Romans!

479
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,195
( cheering )

480
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,115
( groaning continues )

481
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,411
First blood has been drawn!

482
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,622
Who stands next?

483
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:26,003
Remember, do not cut too deep.

484
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,839
l would not deprive
everyone fair turn.

485
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,925
( laughter )

486
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:33,719
Varinius in town
but a handful of days,

487
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:36,681
and already
outshines your husband.

488
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,933
The man does exude...

489
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:41,143
presence.

490
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,187
- The breast!
- ( yelling )

491
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,192
- ( laughs )
- ( applause )

492
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,864
But your heart was
always set upon Gaius.

493
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,617
lt is a deceitful thing
that has led many astray.

494
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,203
Well, the fault
stands equally shared,

495
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,163
for succumbing
to your teary-eyed pleas

496
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:03,541
in defense
of misplaced affections.

497
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,042
( grunting continues )

498
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,878
Years have proven them so.

499
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,339
Yet mistakes of youth

500
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,508
need not forever
haunt maturity.

501
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:15,010
( laughter )

502
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,182
You would see
marriage dissolved?

503
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,143
l do not hold such power.

504
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:26,939
That decision lies
in trusted father.

505
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:32,069
Well, Gaius is not without
considerable fault.

506
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,697
Yet it would not lend
favorably upon your name.

507
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:38,242
You carry his child,

508
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,202
and he yet holds position
of praetor.

509
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:44,248
He is not the only one
with such title.

510
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,416
( screams )

511
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:48,878
Let him bleed.
Let him bleed.

512
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,631
lt would seem the gods favor
less mature schemes.

513
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:55,384
Strike it
from your thoughts,

514
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,595
as l have from mine.

515
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,388
Don't be greedy, Gallienus.

516
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,515
- Leave us some.
- l'm trying.

517
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,194
( screaming )

518
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,446
( laughing )

519
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:20,701
Mira: He is fading.

520
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,287
Fetch something for him
to clutch between teeth.

521
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,253
When it is done,

522
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:33,255
we must smother fire
and move quickly.

523
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,051
l've seen that look

524
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:39,720
and the blame
it inflicts inward.

525
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:42,389
None other deserve it.

526
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,975
We chose to do this,

527
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,645
even fucking Liscus.

528
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:50,314
Glaber does not send
his men against Liscus.

529
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,983
He sends them against me,
and all suffer because of it.

530
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,568
Yes.

531
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,654
lt is because of you

532
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,823
that we are free.

533
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,117
( grunts )
What are you doing?

534
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,662
We must close your wound.

535
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,499
l am to be branded with fire,

536
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,668
as a true gladiator would.

537
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:13,254
You have earned your place
amongst the brotherhood.

538
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:19,051
Hold him down.

539
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:26,559
Do not cry out.

540
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,564
( muffled gasping )

541
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:34,066
The fire, quickly.

542
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,789
Soldier:
Smoke sighted!

543
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,916
Take my sword. Go.

544
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,632
( laughter )

545
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,593
The man fades.

546
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,136
As do l...

547
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:05,055
from prying eyes.

548
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,682
( laughs )

549
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,186
l do not care for the way
he looks at me.

550
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,688
Few women do.

551
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:14,398
Come, it is your turn.

552
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,735
( chuckles )
l have never held one before.

553
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:20,362
My brother would not allow it.

554
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,866
( chuckles )
Well, then it falls

555
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:26,118
to more experienced hands
to guide you. Come.

556
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,667
( Seppia giggling )

557
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:40,049
You do not care
for your master's affections?

558
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,967
l am slave to no man.

559
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:44,762
Yet you bow and scrape
toward Varinius' purpose.

560
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,181
lf it aids me in pursuit
of Spartacus.

561
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,142
l would have done so as well,

562
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,895
absent attempt
to fuck your sister.

563
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:54,939
Magistrate, a word.

564
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:57,900
( giggling )

565
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,493
Varinius: Now place
the tip against flesh...

566
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,163
...and feel it part
at your desire.

567
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:14,124
( giggling )

568
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,976
Uh...

569
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,645
l cannot.

570
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,107
Apologies.

571
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,865
Our honored guest

572
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,451
asks too much
of inexperienced hands.

573
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,749
( crowd gasping )

574
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:08,971
Your wife does not shy
from taking life.

575
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,266
l only regret
she moves prematurely,

576
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:14,893
robbing deed
from more deserving hands.

577
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,111
That is how you sate desire,

578
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:28,073
for love or vengeance,

579
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,451
without hesitation.

580
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,412
( chuckles )

581
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,876
- ( applause )
- Yeah!

582
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,844
( revelry echoing )

583
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:58,228
lt is a sight, is it not,

584
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,731
all of Capua laid at your feet?

585
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,649
lt is not the view,

586
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,819
but quiet respite
from celebration that draws me.

587
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,740
l have shattered it
with prattling tongue.

588
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,241
Apologies.

589
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,576
Linger.

590
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:16,038
l would not sweep you
from perch once your own.

591
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,542
lt seems a lifetime ago
l called it so.

592
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,420
Time flees from us all,

593
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:26,924
leaving regret for what might
have been churning in our wake.

594
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:30,511
l fear we share much
in such regard.

595
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,930
A husband lost.

596
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:34,431
A wife...

597
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,266
Dearly missed.

598
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,438
Let us turn to common joy

599
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,274
of friend and daughter.

600
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,194
llithyia. Hmm.

601
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:50,322
The name fails to lighten
troubled thoughts.

602
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:57,121
Give them voice,
and see them fly to the heavens.

603
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,581
l've not the lungs
to shout so loud.

604
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,419
Then whisper desire to me,

605
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:08,173
and l shall entreat the gods
to see them satisfied.

606
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:16,223
Your counsel
would be much appreciated.

607
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:41,999
( twig crunches )

608
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,131
Where's Fortis?

609
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:51,466
We avoided one squad of Romans.
A second, we could not.

610
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,302
l lost Fortis
in the woods as we fled.

611
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,679
- Which direction?
- The one which you travel in.

612
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,431
We shall break west

613
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,391
and hope to miss them
before righting course.

614
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:00,809
And if we do not?

615
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:03,187
Then they shall learn

616
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,189
that a wounded animal
may yet bare teeth.

617
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:34,426
But of course we can.

618
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:36,637
( women giggle )

619
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:40,474
You overreach,

620
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:43,143
and hot tears burn in result.

621
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,148
Turn from him...

622
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,318
and dry your eyes.

623
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:58,075
Let us leave this fucking house

624
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:02,412
and see memory of this night
fade in warm embrace.

625
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,833
Yes, brother.

626
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,261
( Varinius laughs )

627
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,263
Crassus, yes.

628
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,599
Yes, l have dined and bathed
with him on many occasion.

629
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,602
A man large of coin,
small of cock.

630
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,396
( laughter )

631
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:30,232
His wife has often
spoken of it...

632
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,443
in far grander terms.

633
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,113
Seek more wine.

634
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:37,948
l shall join you presently.

635
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:44,454
Your eye flits from young
to younger still.

636
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,039
lf celebration stretches,

637
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:49,584
l fear to discover you
with a newborn clutched in hand.

638
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,130
llithyia, l would not see

639
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:55,382
my jest towards Crassus
reach his ear.

640
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:00,929
And what do you offer
to purchase my silence?

641
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,267
What is it you seek?

642
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:07,436
Favor for your husband?

643
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,481
l have secured many
for him over the years.

644
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:19,364
Perhaps it is time to place
myself higher in concern.

645
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:22,367
lt would be well deserved.

646
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:25,370
Why do you chase
after simple little girls,

647
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:27,581
barely formed of breast?

648
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:29,958
They are unencumbered

649
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:31,668
of marriage...

650
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,755
and obligation.

651
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:44,139
And if a woman your equal
stood removed from such?

652
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:50,854
We speak
in ever-tightening circles.

653
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,486
l would see them
come to a point.

654
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:12,209
My father never favored Gaius.

655
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:21,385
lf a more suitable husband

656
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,721
with equal title

657
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,390
and greater promise

658
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,142
were to make
his intentions known...

659
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,729
You play a dangerous game.

660
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:45,242
With stakes worth the risk.

661
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,494
Your name...

662
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:49,704
wed to my father's--

663
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,125
power and wealth

664
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:56,878
to rival Crassus himself.

665
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:02,717
Gain your father's approval
to dissolve your marriage...

666
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:08,056
and find me as wet
with desire as you now stand.

667
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,279
( music playing )

668
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:13,705
( panting )

669
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:53,620
Fuck the gods.

670
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,709
Fortis.

671
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,922
Back the way we came.

672
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:10,262
Soldier: ...to the northwest,
General.

673
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:14,266
( soldiers yelling )

674
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,227
Soldier: One, two, three, four.

675
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:18,770
Go!

676
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:21,690
( all yelling )

677
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,213
( blade rings )

678
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,925
- Liscus!
- ( Roman yells )

679
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,047
( metal clanging )

680
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:10,715
( groans )

681
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:13,051
Did l not fucking warn you?

682
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:36,616
A serious wound,

683
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:38,702
- but you should live--
- Call the remaining squad.

684
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,496
lt will not make a difference.

685
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:43,957
Spartacus is possessed
by the gods themselves--

686
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:45,583
Spartacus is here!
Bear arms!

687
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,043
You will draw them to us.

688
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:50,004
And we will fight until
the last drop of Roman blood--

689
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,966
l am not a Roman.

690
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,094
And l will not
fucking die this night.

691
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:58,847
( blade squelches )

692
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,307
( gasps )

693
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,646
( Spartacus yells )

694
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,815
( coughing )

695
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,110
We must move before more come.

696
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,864
l am done running.

697
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,204
Do not fucking
let this be for nothing.

698
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,040
Live...

699
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,044
and see many Romans fall.

700
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,203
You really believe
this will save you?

701
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,915
Maneuvering my father's cock
inside you?

702
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,333
You mistake intent--

703
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:10,877
Do not attempt to twist
fucking word to advantage.

704
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:12,879
l will not be placed
beneath your heel again,

705
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,714
you withered cunt.

706
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:19,093
You think so low of me?

707
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:22,055
Based upon lasting memory
of blood and betrayal.

708
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:26,434
l've done many things
to hurt you,

709
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:29,312
because l was jealous

710
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,315
of your position,
your beauty,

711
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,859
your youth,

712
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:36,528
moved by base passions

713
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:40,532
which served only
to wound my own heart.

714
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,992
l would do anything, llithyia,

715
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:47,247
to erase injury
my actions have caused.

716
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,666
You remember
what happened between us?

717
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,378
l remember everything.

718
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:58,174
Do not think l will be
so easily threatened.

719
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:01,135
Again, you mistake intent--

720
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:07,308
Mistake is yours.

721
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:14,148
l will dash your head
against the stones

722
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:15,650
- as l did Licinia...
- Wait.

723
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:18,111
...with tales of how
you lost wits and came to me.

724
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:19,612
- Your father--
- Will not mourn

725
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,239
the passing of a faded whore.

726
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:23,908
He will dissolve your marriage!

727
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:27,161
That is the reason
l took him to my thighs...

728
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,207
to sway him to your cause
of wedding Varinius.

729
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,834
That is what you desire,
is it not?

730
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:34,794
Even if it were,

731
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:38,089
why would my father be moved
by serpent's tongue?

732
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:40,550
The gods speak through me.

733
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,138
He sees wisdom
in their counsel.

734
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:47,932
l did it for you, llithyia...

735
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:52,103
to secure future
for you and your child.

736
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,109
l would mend rift between us...

737
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:03,031
one torn by my own
foolish hands.

738
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:15,793
Perhaps it is l
that have been foolish...

739
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:23,843
to ever doubt such dear friend

740
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:26,471
was blessed by the gods.

741
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,193
Laughter and drink

742
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:41,861
have done much
to dispel darkening gloom.

743
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:43,404
Good.

744
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:47,158
But yet l fear shall
see split head come morning.

745
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:48,868
( laughter )

746
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:50,495
You stand satisfied then?

747
00:54:50,663 --> 00:54:52,914
ln all things.

748
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:57,418
Let us set past aside and look
towards deserving future.

749
00:54:57,586 --> 00:55:00,296
Words of significant worth.

750
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:06,719
Come, l would
break more with you

751
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:08,972
before sleep claims us.

752
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:20,525
Apologies for earlier doubt.

753
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:26,114
This evening has proven
most advantageous.

754
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,950
Yes.

755
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:31,869
l long to see
what dawn shall bring.

756
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:38,209
( birds chirping )

757
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,096
Vesuvius.

758
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:53,433
How far?

759
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:56,978
Half a day's journey.

760
00:55:57,146 --> 00:55:59,188
( men yelling )

761
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,860
( equipment jangling )

762
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,618
Take Nasir.

763
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:15,079
l will hold them back
for as long as l am able.

764
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:16,956
No.

765
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:19,333
l stay by your side.

766
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:28,634
Naevia.

767
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,945
( theme music playing )

767
00:57:32,443 --> 00:58:28,945

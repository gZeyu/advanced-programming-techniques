1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,798
- ( roars )
- Gannicus has proven himself.

2
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,925
Let him be rewarded
with freedom.

3
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:10,510
You have earned the rudis--

4
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:13,471
proof you no longer stand
a slave.

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,849
Your wife betrayed you--
one last fuck.

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,352
And we will fight until
the last drop of Roman blood--

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,270
l am not a Roman.

8
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,480
( man grunts )

9
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,857
- Naevia is dead.
- ( screaming )

10
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,360
- Fucking shit!
- l'll fucking kill you.

11
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,362
- Have you lost mind?
- Naevia lives.

12
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,573
l will not fucking die
for this.

13
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,868
( men shouting in distance )

14
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,121
- ( grunting )
- Crixus!

15
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,123
Varinius: Let these men
not fall here tonight,

16
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,417
but in the arena,
before all of Capua!

17
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,961
Gain your father's approval
to dissolve your marriage,

18
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:47,380
and find me as wet with desire

19
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,882
as you now stand.

20
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,218
( theme music playing )

21
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,060
Crowd:
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

22
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:04,230
Kill! Kill! Kill!

23
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,611
( distant crowd roaring )

24
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,463
( crowd stomping )

25
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,302
( crowd chanting )

26
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,638
Boo!

27
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,433
( hit thuds )

28
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,117
( shouting )

29
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,468
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

30
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,609
A fine showing.

31
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,778
To be forever remembered
by adoring crowd,

32
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,988
as will the name Varinius,

33
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,990
who bestows such
generous gifts.

34
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,828
lndeed, he shall never be
forgotten.

35
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,704
Same cannot be said
of all men.

36
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,251
Would that more
stood your equal.

37
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:52,129
A pity there is but one of him,
so soon recalled to Rome.

38
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,382
Magistrate:
A brief yet profitable stay.

39
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,551
Your games have given
the city much needed

40
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,678
distraction in these
dark times.

41
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,221
( fanfare )

42
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,348
The executions begin.

43
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,475
A glorious finale
to our stay at Capua.

44
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,602
lf only Spartacus
were among the condemned.

45
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,605
The man shall be put to grass
soon enough, Mercato.

46
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,233
My men move towards
this very purpose.

47
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,527
Until such a time,
let us send message

48
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,529
punctuated in blood.

49
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,156
( crowd cheering )

50
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,368
( cheering subsides )

51
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,704
"Hannibal stands at our gates"--

52
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,790
a phrase used to invoke fear

53
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,209
among the children of Rome,

54
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,545
a specter
of the Carthaginian animal

55
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,338
who besieged this city

56
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,966
with terror and death
many years past.

57
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:40,344
Yet, as is the fate
of all enemies of the Republic,

58
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,179
Hannibal passed from this life

59
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,056
at the end of a Roman sword!

60
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,850
( cheering )

61
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,227
A fate that will
one day be shared

62
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,229
by the rebel Spartacus!

63
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,774
Was it not your
distant relative,

64
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,526
Appius Claudius Pulcher,

65
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,403
who failed to defeat Hannibal

66
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,572
in the first battle of Capua?

67
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,491
lt was.

68
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,826
( chuckles )

69
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,331
The gods have yet to bless us
with such glorious sight.

70
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,250
Yet they grace us
with portent upon horizon--

71
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,211
three of Spartacus's
most trusted men,

72
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,589
their deaths to serve
as warning

73
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,549
to all who would
challenge Rome!

74
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,094
( crowd jeering )

75
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,472
Boo!

76
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,684
Man: Kill those bastards!

77
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,520
Woman: Get ready to die,
you fuckers!

78
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,276
Varinius: They've got to be shed
ad gladium

79
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,487
by the warriors
whose victories this day

80
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:42,281
have earned them
position in the Primus.

81
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,242
Yet who shall lead
the forces of Rome?

82
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,621
Who deserves
such storied mantle?

83
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,498
There stands but one--

84
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,376
the only gladiator
from this fair city

85
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,253
to ever earn his freedom
upon the sands,

86
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,589
a true god of the arena.

87
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,425
l give you Gannicus!

88
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,844
( crowd cheering )

89
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:12,687
Gannicus! Gannicus! Gannicus!

90
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,189
Gannicus! Gannicus!

91
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,991
Woman:
Fuck me, Gannicus!

92
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,411
Man: Come on, Gannicus,
kill them all!

93
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,998
Why would he do this?

94
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,375
Because he's a man
without honor.

95
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,846
We at last face each other
upon the sands...

96
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,933
as Melitta always feared.

97
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,193
ls it true?

98
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,655
Did you lay with her

99
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,033
the night she left this world?

100
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,369
Oenomaus--

101
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,917
Begin.

102
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,900
We should not have torn
our forces.

103
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,818
lf we had been
with you at the mines--

104
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:46,238
Even more would lay dead
within its tunnels.

105
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:51,077
Mistakes were made
on both sides.

106
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,500
Let us place them behind us,
or risk finding them repeated.

107
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,128
( wings fluttering )

108
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,768
We have found something.

109
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,826
Finally the gods show
a fucking favor.

110
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,372
Let us see to what extent.

111
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,142
Bring the others.

112
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,647
Search for weapons.
Something may have been left behind.

113
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,656
A roof over our heads.

114
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,951
Mostly.

115
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,329
We shall take rest,
consider future.

116
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,623
There holds none for you

117
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,835
in my fucking temple.

118
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,587
Apologies.

119
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,006
lt appeared abandoned.

120
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,175
l stand proof it is not.

121
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,012
Return to where you came.

122
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,065
So the gods finally
fuck me to the afterlife.

123
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,027
Care to join me?

124
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,237
We seek only shelter...

125
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,949
nothing more.

126
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,286
Spartacus.

127
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,830
You are Spartacus?

128
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,540
l am.

129
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,965
Then l mistake
fucking for blessing.

130
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,467
( laughing )

131
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:18,349
This temple has remained
absent worship for many years.

132
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,560
lt does not offer much
in the way of comforts,

133
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,897
but l would share what l have.

134
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,732
Gratitude.

135
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,610
You would trust wine and words
from a Roman shit?

136
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,570
And what are you?

137
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,406
A Gaul, by your
lack of manners?

138
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,158
l am no fucking Gaul.

139
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,911
l am Agron, from the lands
east of the Rhine.

140
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,956
And l am Lucius,
a Roman of the Caelian clan.

141
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,667
A pleasure to make
fucking acquaintance.

142
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,295
Why are you here, Lucius?

143
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:54,260
l did have more
esteemed lodgings once--

144
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,095
a villa,

145
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:59,265
land, horses,

146
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,517
a family,

147
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:05,396
struck from this world
by Sulla's black heart.

148
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,939
Sulla?

149
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,941
He too was a Roman,

150
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,818
yet marched upon
his own people,

151
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,861
punishing any
who dared to defy him.

152
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,281
A slave is so treated.

153
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,869
l have owned them.

154
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,915
lf that be offense enough,

155
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,084
have my life.

156
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,462
Wine's gone anyway.

157
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,885
Your eyes seemed to brighten
when you heard my name--

158
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,804
unexpected from a Roman.

159
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,850
The ones l held to heart

160
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:45,853
were slaughtered by the same.

161
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,772
They stand no kin to me now.

162
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,402
And yet

163
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,071
the man who
would make them suffer,

164
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:59,033
l would gladly call brother.

165
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,164
You could not have made speech
before swilling the last of the wine?

166
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,958
( Lucius laughs ) lf l had l known
you were for this temple,

167
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:11,211
l'd have stocked it
to the fucking rafters.

168
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:18,594
l thought the lot of you fallen
in the mines of Lucania.

169
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,013
Where have you heard such tales?

170
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,849
ln the streets of Neapolis,
frequented for trading.

171
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,518
The city is afire
with news of your defeat,

172
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,938
the only survivors to be executed
at Varinius's fucking games.

173
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,441
- Survivors?
- Give names.

174
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,486
l know only that three
stand for the sands

175
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:39,281
and one by word marked
as the Undefeated Gaul.

176
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,659
Crixus?

177
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,995
He yet lives?

178
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:49,124
Only to see sun
break dawn once more.

179
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,461
The games come to an end
when it sets,

180
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,047
as do the lives of your men.

181
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,598
( footsteps )

182
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:23,617
Spartacus yet evades death.

183
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,078
While we fucking embrace it.

184
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,623
As l will embrace Naevia

185
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,751
when she is returned to my arms
in the afterlife...

186
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,464
where Melitta awaits you.

187
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,388
l long for reunion

188
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,932
and the answers it will bring.

189
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,114
How you will stir the crowd!

190
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,992
Tales of the prowess
of Gannicus yet fill the air,

191
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,035
rivaling those
of Hercules himself.

192
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,329
His labors were rewarded
with immortality.

193
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,207
Fortunate for you,
l seek more earthly payment.

194
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,252
To be provided upon
completion of your services.

195
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,463
l find myself light of coin.

196
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,631
A few dropped in hand
would anchor purpose.

197
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,593
Of course.

198
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,470
l would not wish to see wind
carry you aloft

199
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,305
short of the appointed hour.

200
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,143
l shall see it done.

201
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,021
lt will be glorious spectacle.

202
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,023
Come. l would present you
to the Magistrate

203
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:37,649
and Praetor Varinius
himself.

204
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,610
Let them gaze upon
the legend in the arena,

205
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,904
with the rest
of the howling mob.

206
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,822
l am for wine

207
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,658
and the embrace
of questionable women.

208
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:03,759
How did he fall?

209
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,762
We came upon Spartacus
and his men while giving chase.

210
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,556
The villain himself
delivered grievous injury.

211
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:13,560
And yet you stand before me,
drawing breath.

212
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,313
l came to your tribune's aid,
pulling him away

213
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,690
to staunch life
flowing from wound.

214
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,443
Noble effort, bearing no fruit.

215
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,570
- Praetor--
- Send word to Senator Albinius.

216
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:27,449
Spartacus will not be among the slaves
executed at tomorrow's games.

217
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,409
- And the Syrian?
- Oh, he will yet have chance

218
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,620
to afford himself in battle,
in the arena,

219
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,789
to be executed with
the other worthless slaves.

220
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,332
No. Praetor, l beg of you.

221
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,125
Praetor!

222
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,223
Yet another disappointment.

223
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,268
Spartacus evades
poor Gaius once again.

224
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,146
l fear your games will suffer
from the Thracian's absence.

225
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,816
Good Mercato
assures me grand spectacle

226
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,402
to be spoken of for years
throughout the Republic.

227
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,280
l would not have your husband's
failure dampen spirits.

228
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,490
As l would not have him
remain so titled.

229
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,492
The very purpose
of our gathering.

230
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,579
News of your desires
towards loving daughter

231
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,164
lifts heart.

232
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,585
l have invoked the god Hymenaeus
to sanction the union.

233
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,378
His blessing is affirmed.

234
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,423
The gods bestow gift
beyond measure.

235
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,466
Albinius: Yet we must proceed
with caution.

236
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,677
l would not have Gaius
aware of our plans

237
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,722
until presented with dissolution,
lets he make public scene.

238
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,516
Let us take leave
and further discuss how to proceed.

239
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,060
l long for constraints
to be shed

240
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,104
and our fortunes
returned to Rome.

241
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:43,275
As l long for you by my side,
holding position of wife.

242
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,782
He appears well pleased.

243
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,578
Remove encumbrance
as discussed,

244
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,247
and we will see this
to proper end.

245
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,878
Encumbrance?

246
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:06,465
l am to untether myself
from unfortunate lineage.

247
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,635
You would see your child
never born?

248
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,929
A necessary thing

249
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,890
to ensure a more worthy heir.

250
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,155
l am in your debt.

251
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,116
Spartacus told me
what you have done for Nasir.

252
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,326
lf it were not for you--

253
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,453
lt's because of me
that he lays near death.

254
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,373
They never should have
come to the mines.

255
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,459
l did what l could to stop them.

256
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,670
Would that you had done more.

257
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,004
Naevia.

258
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:50,175
The hope of seeing Crixus again
was all that kept me alive.

259
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,680
Each day l begged the gods

260
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,391
to see him to my arms.

261
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,018
And this is how
they fucking answer?

262
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,562
By allowing his touch,

263
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,815
only to be ripped
from it forever?

264
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:08,026
He would not be swayed
from attempt.

265
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,155
None of them would.

266
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,826
l wish Lucretia
had taken my life.

267
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,038
Then Crixus would not have
to sacrificed his

268
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,666
for something soiled
and ruined.

269
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:25,210
Spartacus calls for you.

270
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,317
Nasir?

271
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,070
He yet fights.

272
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,490
As do we all.

273
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,077
The Romans would have it
believed otherwise.

274
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,915
Lucius tells of spreading word
that we are all but defeated.

275
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,752
Let them come
and find assumption false.

276
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,755
l would not wait for such a day,

277
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,215
nor see our brothers
fall in the arena.

278
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,636
You would lay attack
on the arena?

279
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,767
Our numbers are low,
more so of men able with sword.

280
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,269
A thing known by Glaber
and his soldiers.

281
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,231
They would never think us
to make attempt.

282
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,109
- For good fucking reason.
- Who is more familiar with the arena

283
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,070
than men who have fought
upon its sands?

284
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,371
What are your thoughts?

285
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,124
These executions
serve as message

286
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,126
that Rome
will smother any flame

287
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,170
that burns against its rule.

288
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,634
l would send message
of our own,

289
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,137
one that will ignite the hearts
of all yet enslaved.

290
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,687
( footsteps )

291
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:20,992
'Tis a heavy burden--
stilling life that grows inside you.

292
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,371
l had thought deed
of lighter concern.

293
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,331
l do not know why l pause.

294
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,960
A woman will always be moved
to protect her child.

295
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,172
Yet it must be done.

296
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,176
Perhaps it wise
to delay the act.

297
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,762
Your absence at the games
will draw notice.

298
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,972
My absence?

299
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,559
l have forced silphium
on many slaves

300
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,645
to rid the House of Batiatus
of unwanted burden.

301
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,690
You will sicken and bleed

302
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,900
for many days.

303
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,320
l will attest such to your father.

304
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:00,031
lf he so presses for reason
of staying hand.

305
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,542
You prove wise counsel.

306
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,759
A service l would continue
to provide.

307
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,847
Do you wish to
accompany me to Rome?

308
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:27,559
l wish only to be at your side

309
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,478
until life leaves from body.

310
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,734
There is yet much
of the past between us.

311
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,696
Let us see
if there is a future.

312
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,078
( door opens )

313
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,914
Guard: Be quick.

314
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,588
( chuckles )

315
00:20:56,756 --> 00:21:00,091
At last she comes.

316
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,802
Other matters have drawn
my attention.

317
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,557
l would see it towards
current fucking plight.

318
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:11,102
Do you think that l would allow you
to perish upon the sands

319
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,729
after all you have done
for me?

320
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,273
l will break words
with Glaber.

321
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,275
( grunts )
He places blame

322
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,362
for Spartacus
evading capture.

323
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,532
He will not listen to you.

324
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,160
Yet he will heed
the will of the gods,

325
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:29,955
as he has so graciously
in the past.

326
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,458
l shall whisper of them,
of how you were returned to us

327
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,919
from dark woods for a purpose,

328
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,463
of how the gods
yet have use for you,

329
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,298
as do l.

330
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,260
What would you have
of me now?

331
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,473
A simple task.

332
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,809
There is a red vial

333
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,436
secreted among llithyia's jewelry.

334
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,731
l would see its contents replaced
with water and bitter herb.

335
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:00,652
l've seen such red vials
within this house before...

336
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,406
- and witnessed their effect.
- And when none are presented,

337
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,741
it will be taken as a sign
that her child must be born.

338
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,911
A task easier seen
by your own hand.

339
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,497
You are close to her
and move freely through the villa.

340
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,165
The risk of discovery
is too great.

341
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,876
llithyia must be given
no reason to doubt me,

342
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,503
or all will fall to ruin.

343
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,255
And how am l
to do such a thing?

344
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:24,217
Even free of bondage, l am no spirit
able to pass through fucking gate.

345
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,803
Was l not the domina
of this house?

346
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,934
Gates part in remembrance.

347
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,440
You have a way of making a man
invisible as well.

348
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,234
Great spectacle is being made
of the games tomorrow.

349
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,528
llithyia's slaves attend her.

350
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,281
Most of Glaber's men
provide welcome security

351
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,867
to calm nervous city.

352
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,077
lt should not be hard
for a man of your talents

353
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,371
to avoid the remainder.

354
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,914
And if l am discovered?

355
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,666
Do not be.

356
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:07,177
l will see myself
free of bondage

357
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,512
at any cost.

358
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,892
ls such a thing possible?

359
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,062
l would see it so,
or fall with Crixus in the arena.

360
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,773
lf the gods yet care,

361
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,941
may they speed your return.

362
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,818
Where do we go?

363
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,529
Nasir.

364
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:31,076
Give me a sword.
l will join you.

365
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,536
l would have you rest
yet a while longer.

366
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,748
This time you stay and l go.

367
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,217
We must move.

368
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,598
The boy cheats death.

369
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,767
Perhaps it is a sign.

370
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,895
We can not rely on omen.

371
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,106
We must take strength
in just cause

372
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,608
and bring it to bear.

373
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,447
You have all heard whispers
of what we attempt.

374
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:13,618
l would overtake soft voice
with bold words.

375
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:17,080
We are for the arena in Capua.

376
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:18,665
Woman: What?

377
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,750
Man: And if you do not return?

378
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:23,336
Lucius Caelius
knows these lands.

379
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,171
lf we are too long from you,

380
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,841
l would ask that
he show you safe path,

381
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:31,719
far from the reach of Glaber
and his soldiers.

382
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,974
We have suffered wound and loss.

383
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:38,643
We have been divided.

384
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,646
Yet we are free--

385
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,065
a thing beyond price...

386
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,986
a thing l would see
condemned brothers

387
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,196
embrace once again

388
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,657
and in the doing of it

389
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,535
spread word to every slave
yet beneath heel

390
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:59,706
that even the mighty Republic
bleeds when struck!

391
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,875
( crowd cheering )

392
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:04,335
( cheering )

393
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,155
You fuck like a god.

394
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,894
l would share a cup

395
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,729
to regain sense.

396
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:12,070
l have not seen you here
before, have l?

397
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,906
l've been many years
from Capua.

398
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,242
What brings return?

399
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,327
l come for the games.

400
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:21,788
l wish l could see them.

401
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:24,207
l would trade place.

402
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:26,167
You stand upon the sands

403
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:30,129
and l will drink and fuck
until the gods take me.

404
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,757
The sands?

405
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,884
You're Gannicus--

406
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,636
the gladiator
who gained his freedom.

407
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,721
Shadow of the same.

408
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:41,266
l've never heard of another
who's won the rudis.

409
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,059
May l touch it?

410
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:49,774
These markings--
they tell of your victories?

411
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,029
They tell of glories

412
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,282
long forgotten.

413
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,996
Why do you carry it,
if it troubles mind?

414
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,916
lt must always remain
at my side,

415
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:09,294
even in the arena--

416
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,255
proof that l am
no longer a slave...

417
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:19,137
reminder of choices
made while l was yet one.

418
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:25,351
Please, Melitta, breathe!

419
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,732
Let us put talk behind us.

420
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,484
l would fall to bed,

421
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:37,447
wine and the memory
of your thighs

422
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,490
to brace against coming day.

423
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,153
lt is a blessing

424
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,947
to be forever removed
from this fucking house.

425
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,909
May it crumble in our wake.

426
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:34,212
See them delivered to the arena,
prepared for execution.

427
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:36,881
Praetor.

428
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,302
Praetor, apologies.
l would have word.

429
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,388
You draw breath
only because Lucretia cautions

430
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,890
the gods yet foretell
of your worth.

431
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,059
Press me,
and see prophecy ignored.

432
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:51,437
l but wish to fulfill it
this very day.

433
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,606
- ( horse neighs )
- Guard: Ready?

434
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:55,650
March.

435
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:59,070
Speak then,
and let us gauge divinity.

436
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,574
My eyes fell upon
most curious sight,

437
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,576
witnessed from my cell--

438
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,578
your wife's slave
stealing through the night,

439
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,540
in her hand
a thing familiar to me,

440
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,376
one l fear

441
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:16,671
you may have
no knowledge of.

442
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,881
See the litter well stocked
with water and wine.

443
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,758
l would not stand
before Varinius

444
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,844
parched from this fucking heat.

445
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,512
Yes, Domina.

446
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,473
Gaius.

447
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:30,059
l thought you for the arena
with your men.

448
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,692
Have the gods ever beheld
such beauty?

449
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,278
You flatter.

450
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,865
Leave us.

451
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,868
We will be past
the appointed hour.

452
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,703
They will wait,

453
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:50,955
as l have waited

454
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,958
for blessings longed for.

455
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,128
'Twill be a glorious day.

456
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,923
One you would see

457
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,468


458
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:13,186
- Gaius--
- Do not fucking attempt lie!

459
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:20,276
l know what l hold
and the intent it carries!

460
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,451
Why?

461
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,748
Because you are not
worthy of an heir.

462
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,211
You are not worthy of me.

463
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,383
Have we drifted so far

464
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,595
from the love we once held?

465
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,722
lt is a speck

466
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,849
upon distant shore,

467
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:55,478
too small to draw notice.

468
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,025
l will hold my child in my arms

469
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,904
and you will play part
of dutiful mother and wife.

470
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:06,072
l will not.

471
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,698
You will do as your husband
commands!

472
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,035
Then l pray Varinius
gives them with softer voice.

473
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,162
Varinius?

474
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,039
My father dissolves
our marriage

475
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:18,668
in favor of more
promising opportunity.

476
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,462
l return with him to Rome
at the close of the games.

477
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,590
You conspire against me.

478
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,467
We do what we must

479
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,636
in face of growing
disappointment.

480
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,347
l will have words
with your father.

481
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,182
To what end?
He allowed you my hand

482
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,101
only because l begged
with teary eye,

483
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,061
wet with thoughts of love.

484
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,567
They now stand dry,

485
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,361
a desert deprived of rain.

486
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,908
ls there nothing left
between us?

487
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,705
Memories only.

488
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,208
Yet they too shall fade.

489
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,876
Come,

490
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,964
let us present ourselves
as husband and wife

491
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,842
for the last time.

492
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,183
( crowd cheering )

493
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,894
( shouting )

494
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,482
The crowd has turned
to sour mood.

495
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,778
We can place no blame,
except perhaps upon cause of delay.

496
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,282
Apologies. My husband
found himself

497
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,451
distracted by
unexpected concerns.

498
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,453
Matters of great import then,

499
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,997
to keep honored guest
and all of Capua waiting.

500
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,791
lt was of a pressing nature.

501
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,711
l would condemn such
transgressions to distant past

502
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,547
and turn eye toward
more deserving future.

503
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,841
Such thoughts
kept sleep at bay.

504
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:52,637
l pray the conclusion of this day
brings you comfort,

505
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,098
as you have brought to all
touched by your divine presence.

506
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,476
Let us begin,
and see it come to pass.

507
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,901
- Woman: What are we waiting for?
- Man: Get on with it!

508
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:10,071
Citizens of Capua!

509
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,323
We gather this day
to witness an end

510
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,950
to the storied games
of your humble editor

511
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,203
Publius Varinius.

512
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,332
And in their closing,
know that l have not foregone

513
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,292
the mores
of noonday execution

514
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,171
but rather find tradition
exalted to position of the Primus.

515
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,423
And each contest
that leads us to it

516
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,717
shall determine which men
stand worthy

517
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,678
to deliver
the justice of Rome.

518
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,430
( cheering )

519
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:40,184
Let spectacles of blood
no longer hold pause.

520
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,479
Enter Mycter-- Samnite!

521
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,822
Enter Abiron-- Murmillo!

522
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,745
( screams )

523
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:04,291
May the gods bless us with a day
forever etched upon memory.

524
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,627
Begin!

525
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:29,442
Crowd:
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

526
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,736
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

527
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,409
( screams )

528
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,332
A display
to shake the heavens.

529
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,918
You possess a gift for
the pairing of gladiators, Mercato.

530
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,504
Have you ever considered
plying such trade in Rome?

531
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:32,922
You honor me, Praetor.

532
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,007
Yet my fortunes
are tied to Capua.

533
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,802
ls it your intent to spirit away
everyone of note?

534
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,346
l have thoughts toward
but a few.

535
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,899
Your husband's eyes
betray darkening storm.

536
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:55,194
He has made
unfortunate discovery

537
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,738
within my bedchambers.

538
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,034
Unfortunate indeed.

539
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,958
Varinius: We reach final contest
before the Primus.

540
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,044
Who shall prove himself a god,

541
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,339
worthy to take vengeance
against the enemies of Rome?

542
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,802
Enter Masonius, Hoplomachus!

543
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,014
( crowd cheering )

544
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,182
Enter Strabo, Murmillo!

545
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,744
Kill! Kill! Kill!

546
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:11,330
( crowd continues chanting )

547
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,792
( crowd cheering )

548
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,925
( roars )

549
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:24,927
A fine showing.

550
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:27,554
Magistrate: To be forever remembered
by adoring crowd,

551
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,473
as will the name Varinius,

552
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,475
who bestows such
generous gifts.

553
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,436
lndeed, he shall never be
forgotten.

554
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,146
Same cannot be said
of all men.

555
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,441
( fanfare )

556
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,151
Lucretia:
The executions begin.

557
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,445
( crowd cheering )

558
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:46,573
Crowd:
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

559
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,659
Kill! Kill!

560
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:53,831
Two against an army?

561
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,582
l do not care for your odds.

562
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,459
You will see them
towards our favor.

563
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:00,295
You are clear
to your purpose?

564
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,464
We will see it done.

565
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,341
lt gives strength

566
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,385
knowing you stand with me.

567
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,730
We must work quickly.

568
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,606
lf any of you hold faith
in any gods,

569
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,775
now would be time
to fucking entreat them.

570
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,697
Quick. Quick.

571
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,949
"Hannibal stands at our gates"--

572
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:33,287
a phrase used to invoke fear
among the children of Rome,

573
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:36,123
a specter
of the Carthaginian animal...

574
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,167
For many years

575
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,794
l have dreamed
of my return to the arena.

576
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:44,798
lt is an honor to stand beside you
upon the sands.

577
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:48,677
Varinius: Hannibal passed from this life
at the end of a Roman sword!

578
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,972
Guard: Your time has come.

579
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,475
Varinius: A fate that will one day be
shared by the rebel Spartacus!

580
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,643
( crowd cheering )

581
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:04,526
They give us swords
absent fucking edge.

582
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:07,237
Absent hope of victory as well.

583
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:11,158
Then let us prove them fools
for giving us swords at all.

584
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,912
( crowd jeering )

585
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,375
Boo!

586
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,754
Man:
Kill those bastards!

587
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,923
( distant crowd shouting )

588
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:39,436
Man: You'll die, fuckers!
( laughs )

589
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,442
Woman: l want to see
your insides, prisoners!

590
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,825
( guard shouts )

591
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,343
Gladiator: This day grants us
undeserved honor.

592
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:13,762
l have longed to share the sands
with Gannicus--

593
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,348
the greatest champion
ever to enter the arena.

594
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,851
There stand no champions here,

595
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,019
only men and their fates.

596
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,355
Varinius: Yet who shall lead
the forces of Rome?

597
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:28,152
Who deserves such storied mantle?

598
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:32,406
- You're from the House of Batiatus.
- Varinius: There stands but one.

599
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:34,074
A lifetime ago.

600
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,160
And now you take
to the sands

601
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,036
to claim the lives
of your brothers?

602
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,581
Gannicus: lf they must fall,
l would see them to honorable death...

603
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:41,832
Varinius: A true god
of the arena.

604
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,792
...given by one who
yet holds them to heart.

605
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,836
Varinius:
l give you Gannicus!

606
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,047
( crowd cheering )

607
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,549
Gannicus!

608
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:58,557
Woman:
Fuck me, Gannicus!

609
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,686
Man: Kill them, Gannicus!
Kill them all!

610
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,990
Crowd: Gannicus!
Gannicus! Gannicus!

611
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,701
Gannicus! Gannicus! Gannicus!

612
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,454
l begin to question
fucking plan.

613
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:23,123
We are committed.

614
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,168
Steel nerve and be ready for--

615
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:28,337
( shouts )

616
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,397
She was my wife...

617
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,489
and you my brother.

618
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,202
He is mine.

619
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:07,417
This is the place.

620
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,132
You there!

621
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,635
Veronius, send for more men!
Halt!

622
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,931
( screaming )

623
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,323
The Gaul finally nears his end.

624
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:40,534
A fate long overdue.

625
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,312
They take too long.

626
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,648
We must wait
or see effort fail.

627
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,991
l never wanted to feel
what l felt for her.

628
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,826
l never wanted any of this.

629
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,393
Rhaskos!

630
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,861
- Fuck.
- Wait.

631
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,090
Kill! Kill! Kill!

632
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,426
lt's not working fast enough.

633
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,847
The chains--
wrap them around the supports.

634
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,187
Boo!

635
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:42,739
Yeah!

636
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:05,011
Pull!

637
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,956
l will send you
to her arms, brother.

638
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,126
Pull!

639
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,132
( screaming )

640
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:01,443
Now!

641
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:31,640
What's happening?

642
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,099
Let's get out of here!

643
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,898
Clear way!
Clear fucking way!

644
00:47:53,579 --> 00:48:00,544
Mercato!

645
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:05,006
l would see us gone
from here, brother.

646
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,843
Kill them!

647
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,305
Give hand!

648
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,958
Spartacus.

649
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:31,384
( screaming )

650
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,053
Cossutius!

651
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,028
The path is clear!

652
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,243
Spartacus once again
makes fool of you.

653
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,996
Your days in the Senate
have found their end.

654
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,405
Spartacus, we must move!

655
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:36,282
No. We must find Oenomaus.

656
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:39,744
This way.

657
00:50:41,831 --> 00:50:44,249
( wheezing, coughing )

658
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,298
Gaius.

659
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:56,594
Help me, please.
Help me, please.

660
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:13,111
l'm not the fool
you and your daughter think me.

661
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:45,310
Help me with him.

662
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,026
( loud crashing )

663
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:18,802
Go. l will follow.

664
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,368
Spartacus.

665
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:52,001
l have had my fill of games.
Let us leave this arena forever.

666
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,216
Citizens!

667
00:52:58,384 --> 00:53:01,010
Citizens, calm yourselves!

668
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,179
Gather your fucking men.

669
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:05,348
Come. l would see you safe
to the villa.

670
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,979
Gaius, where is my father?

671
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,483
He has fallen
at the hands of Spartacus.

672
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,414
Shh.

673
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,543
We will survive this

674
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:35,253
together...

675
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,967
as husband and wife.

676
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:13,875
( theme music playing )

677
00:54:14,707 --> 00:55:13,875

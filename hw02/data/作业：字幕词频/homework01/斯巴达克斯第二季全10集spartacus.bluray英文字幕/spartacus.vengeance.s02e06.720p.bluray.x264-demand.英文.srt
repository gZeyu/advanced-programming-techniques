1
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,007
Gain your father's approval
to dissolve your marriage

2
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:12,220
and find me as wet with desire
as you now stand.

3
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:15,515
Albinius: News of your desires
towards loving daughter lifts heart.

4
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,558
Remove encumbrance
as discussed.

5
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,644
Lucretia: You would see your child
never born?

6
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:21,062
llithyia: A necessary thing.

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,563
Lucretia: There's a red vial.

8
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,233
l would see its contents
replaced with water and bitter herb.

9
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:27,276
Your wife's slave
stealing through the night,

10
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,737
in her hand
a thing familiar to me.

11
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:33,241
l know what l hold
and the intent it carries!

12
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,452
Let these men not fall here tonight
but in the arena.

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,205
We are for the arena
in Capua.

14
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,749
Varinius:
l give you Gannicus!

15
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,584
Gannicus: We at last face each other
upon the sands

16
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,253
as Melitta always feared.

17
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:46,963
- Did you lay with her?
- Oenomaus.

18
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,301
Spartacus: We will cover
this land in ash and blood

19
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,638
until Rome falls as a cinder
to scorched ground.

20
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,433
Spartacus.

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,685
Gaius, where is my father?

22
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:01,894
Help me, please.

23
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,106
Glaber: He has fallen at the hands
of Spartacus.

24
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,318
( theme music playing )

25
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:18,536
They live!

26
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,038
( crowd chattering )

27
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,208
- Woman: Get the medicus.
- Man: Quickly.

28
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,127
Get water and cloth
to tend wounds.

29
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:29,297
- What news?
- The arena is burned to fucking ground,

30
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,466
with many Romans
among the ashes!

31
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,051
What of Rhaskos?

32
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,803
He fell as all men should.

33
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,972
With sword in hand
and blood upon his thoughts.

34
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,766
( crowd cheers )

35
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,934
Nasir:
You suffer no wound.

36
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,771
The gods favor me,
little man.

37
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,857
Call me that again
and they shall turn from you.

38
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:54,489
Can he be healed?

39
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,157
Nasir had but a single wound.

40
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:59,285
This man-- beyond what should
warrant life.

41
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,121
His name is Oenomaus
and he is more than common man.

42
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,249
Let's pray the gods
hold him in equal esteem.

43
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,240
Do l yet dream?

44
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,660
lf so,

45
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,453
l would never
have you wake.

46
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,549
Then it began to collapse.

47
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,634
They screamed
and flailed like children

48
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,886
as the arena burned
around them,

49
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,389
the scent of smoke and death

50
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:05,059
carried by the winds
to the very heart of Rome!

51
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,565
Spartacus:
Lift troubled heart.

52
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,235
Oenomaus stands a titan,

53
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,612
one that shall live
to raise sword again.

54
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,948
To fight by your side?

55
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,410
lf he chooses to take up cause
against the Romans.

56
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,704
Cause?

57
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,456
You have cock to rival
Jupiter himself.

58
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,917
A few errant slaves
amounts to

59
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,128
flies circling a bull's ass.

60
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:35,840
Did he miss the part where we pulled
the arena down on his head?

61
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:38,926
Rome is propped up by more
than a few wooden beams.

62
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,637
lf your cause is
to see your lives cut short,

63
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,432
you march towards
certain victory.

64
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,602
Why did you choose to aid us,
if you believe such?

65
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,938
You mistake choice

66
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,065
for repayment of a debt,

67
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,109
one owed to Oenomaus.

68
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,778
Absent it,

69
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,531
we would not be
breaking words.

70
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,703
He is right.

71
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,413
We were mistaken--

72
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,707
to have placed faith
in his intentions.

73
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,834
Nasir once made attempt
on my life,

74
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,420
and yet now he stands
trusted among us.

75
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,341
Perhaps Gannicus
can be swayed as well.

76
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,678
Or perhaps you should have
killed him in the arena.

77
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,353
Man: The witnesses in Rome
also attest

78
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,397
the will grants
the family domicile in Rome

79
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,525
and the villa here in Capua.

80
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,237
ln addition, there is
the vineyard in Atella,

81
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,741
40 goats in the hills
of Pompeii,

82
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,284
20 head of cattle--

83
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,536
What is the worth
of the livestock?

84
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,750
9,000 denarii,
depending upon deal struck.

85
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,001
See them to market.

86
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,170
And post decree
announcing reward of the coin

87
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,464
for knowledge leading
to the capture of Spartacus.

88
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,175
Forgive me, Praetor,

89
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:04,553
but the law grants you
no such authority

90
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,639
to part with these assets.

91
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,726
You are only to oversee
Senator Albinius's holdings

92
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,270
until his heir comes of age.

93
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:17,316
Glaber: Laws must bend
toward greater purpose.

94
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,069
Spartacus is to pay
for what he has done.

95
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,029
- Praetor--
- Prattling on serves only

96
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:25,074
to inflict further wound
on grieving heart.

97
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,118
Man: Apologies.

98
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,954
The memory of your father
shall not soon fade.

99
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,790
All the Republic mourns his loss.

100
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,292
Leave us.

101
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:43,426
What moves your tears
the most--

102
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:48,014
a father forever removed
from loving embrace

103
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,890
or his tongue forever stilled

104
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,892
before commanding
to dissolve this marriage

105
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,894
in favor of Varinius?

106
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:59,608
l have made a grave mistake.

107
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:03,654
And the gods have punished me
by striking down my father.

108
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,490
lt is not enough.

109
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,909
- Gaius.
- The only reason

110
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,786
you have not joined
your father

111
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,581
is the child that grows
within you--

112
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,791
my child, my heir.

113
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,961
Protect him with your life...

114
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,714
or see it forfeit.

115
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,925
Man:
Workers, to the stockade!

116
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,094
Man #2:
Open the gate!

117
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:30,431
We must keep appearance

118
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,726
of mourning
for the prescribed days.

119
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,232
l would not have the stench of grief
slick upon you.

120
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,610
See yourself to a bath.

121
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,629
Give report.

122
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,216
100 more bodies
pulled from the arena.

123
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:11,680
This was found at wreckage.

124
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,478
Why do our numbers
stand so few?

125
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,147
Guard: More have been recalled
from Neapolis, to return by nightfall.

126
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:23,150
Yet many have taken to the wind.

127
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,736
They turn from their oath
to Rome?

128
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,531
Fear and panic grip the region,
and our men.

129
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,992
Many believe that Spartacus
unleashes the wrath of the gods.

130
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,537
Ashur:
A meaningless thing.

131
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,580
Legions could return
to swell rank

132
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,457
yet still fall to Spartacus

133
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,793
and his men.

134
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:44,463
Apologies, but as l warned
young Marcus

135
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,715
before life fled,

136
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,677
gladiators are far from
common slaves.

137
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,847
You'll not recall Spartacus facing
a clutch of your men

138
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,890
for exhibition in this very villa

139
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,685
and the result of such contest?

140
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,520
Not all fight as Spartacus.

141
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,772
Yet many are
of the Brotherhood.

142
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,527
Three of your men would not equal
one so trained...

143
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:07,862
( clears throat )

144
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,197
...despite their
eagerness to die.

145
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,200
No.

146
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,744
Did you not once stand

147
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,831
amongst the brotherhood...
( snaps fingers )

148
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,875
upon the sands?

149
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,544
A lifetime ago.

150
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,215
Glaber: Then give lesson,

151
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,384
prove boast.

152
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,886
Praetor, l--

153
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:35,055
Be quick.
l would not linger in this heat.

154
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,612
Man: The Syrian wants to taste
his own blood.

155
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,155
( men laughing )

156
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,407
Man:
The Syrian shit.

157
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,075
Get in there, come on.

158
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,411
( men jeering )

159
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,543
- Man: What's the matter?
- Come on!

160
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,711
Begin!

161
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,305
Come on.

162
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:41,205
Get him!

163
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,642
And l was considered lowest

164
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,186
among the brotherhood.

165
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:50,024
Would that l had an army
formed in your base image.

166
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,527
There are others
that share my reflection--

167
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:54,945
men in name only,

168
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:58,699
a word masking truer nature
of rabid animal.

169
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,744
Such a force
under my guidance

170
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,830
could prove useful
in these difficult times.

171
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,708
The Senate would frown upon
lowering standard

172
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,418
into muck and shit...

173
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,255
as they frown upon
many things

174
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,383
that ambitious men
must embrace.

175
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,152
Lucretia:
You leave these walls?

176
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,491
( sighs )
At request of the praetor.

177
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,244
He blesses Ashur

178
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,955
with well-deserved favor.

179
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,999
Would that he turn
such grace

180
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,168
toward grieving wife.

181
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:56,799
lt is a hard thing to have father
torn from breast.

182
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,636
l never knew mine.

183
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,601
Though l often wondered--

184
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:11,313
How did Glaber come to know
of the silphium in llithyia's chambers?

185
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,400
Perhaps the gods spoke to him.

186
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,236
You forget your place.

187
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,946
No, l secure it.

188
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,118
You secure nothing
without me,

189
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,412
you fucking Syrian.

190
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,623
Move against
my commands again--

191
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,419
You command shit and piss.

192
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,629
l am Glaber's man now.

193
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:39,550
A word from me how you knew
of his wife's intent

194
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,886
to rob him
of his unborn child

195
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,556
or how the gods
had nothing to do

196
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,307
with delivering Oenomaus--

197
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,355
You yet draw breath

198
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:57,860
because l have not whispered
your secrets into the praetor's ear.

199
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,695
No, Ashur. Ashur.

200
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,197
Shh. Consider it a kindness,

201
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,950
one that l shall see repaid.

202
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,078
( Lucretia sobbing )

203
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,671
No.

204
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,341
Does it hurt?

205
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,928
A few cuts and scrapes,

206
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,306
soon faded from memory.

207
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,854
Would that all scars
were so easily erased.

208
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,316
l see no scars.

209
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,702
You risked all

210
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,372
for pale shadow of the woman
you once loved.

211
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,292
Then let us ignite the sun

212
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,671
and strike darkness
with its warmth.

213
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,684
Stop.

214
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,352
Naevia.

215
00:14:57,272 --> 00:15:00,357
They have taken everything
from me...

216
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,571
even your touch.

217
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,972
l have heard tales
of your victories in the arena.

218
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,349
Days long past.

219
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,812
Mira tells you were
just upon its sands,

220
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,481
standing as executioner
for the Romans.

221
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,942
l stood for a brother,

222
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,653
to see him
to an honorable death.

223
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,115
And Rhaskos?

224
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,868
Did he find the same?

225
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,122
The man held
some meaning to you?

226
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,501
He elevated position.

227
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,004
l gave comfort.

228
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,677
lt appears that bargain
has come to an end.

229
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,515
l would see another struck

230
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,851
with a man of greater worth.

231
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,020
l hold no position
among these men,

232
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,230
nor do l seek it.

233
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,567
Yet you stand among them.

234
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,695
l seek only words
with an old friend,

235
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,697
nothing more.

236
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,055
We are here,
in the shadow of Vesuvius.

237
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,349
A single man
placed upon its crest

238
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,018
would have clear view
for many miles in all direction.

239
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,895
A Roman advance
easily spotted.

240
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,522
ls there a way
to its peak?

241
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,858
A single path,
narrow, but easily tread.

242
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,903
The rest is sheer rock,
impassable, absent wings.

243
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,407
We will choose three men

244
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,492
of years beyond
the taking up of sword,

245
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,661
each to command
a separate watch.

246
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,538
Mira: There's but one entrance
to the temple.

247
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,707
The Romans could
easily trap us inside.

248
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,917
Spartacus: Tunnels extend
below our feet.

249
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,919
Perhaps one can be dug
beyond these walls.

250
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,171
A few men with bows
would give the Romans pause

251
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,757
long enough to make use of it,
if walkway were built.

252
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,927
How many among you
shoot with purpose?

253
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,305
There is not much call
for arrows in the arena.

254
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,599
You no longer fight
upon the sands,

255
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,436
nor can you forge a sword
from a fucking tree.

256
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:46,356
Then we will fashion weapons
from what nature provides,

257
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,234
with practiced hand
instructing in their use.

258
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,445
We can train
until the gods take us.

259
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,822
House slaves
will never be gladiators--

260
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,032
something we are
in short supply of now.

261
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,034
We need fighting men.

262
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,127
Perhaps it is time to revisit plans
towards Neapolis

263
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,588
and its slaver ships
from foreign wars.

264
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:13,300
You would attack the port
with a few men?

265
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,594
We brought the arena down
with less.

266
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,638
Take two men
and what coin we have.

267
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,265
Weight palm in Neapolis

268
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,769
to loosen tongue
of ships soon to dock.

269
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,604
Do it quietly.

270
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,273
l would not have
intention known.

271
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,820
Apologies. l did not intend
to halt conversation.

272
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,826
Unless l can drink that,
it holds no worth to me.

273
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,828
l seek only wine.

274
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,997
We have none.

275
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,750
Then l truly am
among the damned.

276
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,131
For both of you?

277
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,009
( laughs ) l'm a whore,
not a fool.

278
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,928
- ( man shouts )
- ( woman screams )

279
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,083
l would have words.

280
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:29,835
Fuck your words.

281
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,878
( chuckles )

282
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,714
lt is not with you
that l seek them.

283
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,284
l have an offer to discuss,

284
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:06,246
one suited
to your particular talents.

285
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,083
( insects chirping )

286
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,055
Apologies.

287
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,975
l did not think
you would need the bath,

288
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,935
with days of mourning
yet left.

289
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,938
My husband commands it,

290
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,107
despite tradition.

291
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,236
Stay.

292
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,115
l would have your company.

293
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,134
Your eyes betray recent tears.

294
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:04,179
Events weigh heavy
on the heart.

295
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:07,057
To the point of crushing it.

296
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:11,144
Why did the gods not warn
of Spartacus's attack

297
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,355
or of my father's--?

298
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,775
Do they punish me--

299
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,947
a life, for the one
l had planned to take?

300
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,492
We both carry
the burden of our acts.

301
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:35,502
lf the gods
have cast us adrift,

302
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,171
we must together
discover the course

303
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,882
for return to the blessings
of their shores.

304
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:44,552
Varinius has turned from me.

305
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,680
Gaius-- l fear
not even the gods

306
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,932
could sway
his hatred of me now.

307
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,685
Resume appearance
of loving wife.

308
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,146
Submit to his will.

309
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,608
The day will come
when he will lose sight

310
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,986
of hateful intention--

311
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,905
a slip, however fleeting,

312
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,033
that we shall
take advantage of.

313
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,631
There was a time...

314
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:27,178
when all l dreamt of was
your throat beneath my hands.

315
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:36,146
Now your breath
is all that gives me life.

316
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,235
l shall not be moved
from your side

317
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:45,947
until my own husband
calls me to the afterlife.

318
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,208
( men chattering )

319
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,254
l have seen that look.

320
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,089
lt often fell upon me,

321
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,341
when we were yet
beneath Batiatus's roof.

322
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,260
Spartacus:
You knew Gannicus then,

323
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,429
years before my arrival.

324
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,266
What is your opinion
of the man?

325
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:17,270
He is a champion,
as we once stood,

326
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,105
a boon to your cause.

327
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,608
He has expressed doubts
toward it.

328
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,987
As have we all.

329
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:29,783
Yet you always find way
to convince otherwise.

330
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,086
We have done
the impossible.

331
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:46,174
We have brought down
the arena in Capua--

332
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,093
a monument of Rome

333
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,387
built upon
the backs of slaves.

334
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,099
We have struck a deep blow

335
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,976
to the very heart of our enemy.

336
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,604
Yet...

337
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,649
their numbers are vast,

338
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:05,068
as vast as their desire
to see freedom

339
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:07,403
crushed beneath heel.

340
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,656
One day,

341
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:13,827
perhaps soon,
they will strike back.

342
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,370
How do we avoid them?

343
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:17,163
l do not intend to.

344
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:18,706
ls that true?

345
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,793
Spartacus: lf we are to face
the might of Rome,

346
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,920
l would do it here,

347
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,797
in the shadow of Vesuvius,

348
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,550
upon terms that we set.

349
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,886
No hand will stand idle.

350
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,931
We must prepare ourselves
for what is to come.

351
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,100
- Well, what is to come?
- What is to happen to us?

352
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:39,561
Proper weapons
are in short supply.

353
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,313
Fashion what you can
from wood and stone

354
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,275
till more can be secured.

355
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,694
l would also see
the tunnels beneath our feet

356
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:50,613
further dug towards escape,
which we will need...

357
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,867
To set eyes again
upon your heart--

358
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,954
l understand now why a man
would risk all for such a thing.

359
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:00,957
lf it were not for you
and the others,

360
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,084
l would have fallen
in the arena,

361
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,879
never to gaze upon her face again
in this life.

362
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,798
lt is a thing l will not forget.

363
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:11,384
- Spartacus: Continue to hone skill.
- Nor the lie you told

364
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:14,554
that saw her stay in that place
another fucking day.

365
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:20,560
She is safe now.

366
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:23,605
All other things
fall to unimportance.

367
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,066
Do you think a few words
can change all that has happened?

368
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,110
You stand a larger fool
than l thought.

369
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,196
...than a thousand men.

370
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,573
Apologies.

371
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:36,326
The mistake was mine,

372
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,037
to offer comfort
to a fucking Gaul.

373
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,499
You offer shit.

374
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:46,085
- Regain yourself.
- Crixus.

375
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,591
l thought we had moved
past this.

376
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,302
Wounds still linger.

377
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,265
l move for Neapolis

378
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:02,018
and thoughts of swelling rank
with better men.

379
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,270
( Gannicus laughing )

380
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,356
You need not fear
the Romans.

381
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,942
Your own men make attempt
to kill each other.

382
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,779
You know what must be done.
See to it.

383
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:17,033
Gannicus,

384
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,785
l would have words.

385
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:22,330
You would have me fight?

386
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,249
l would have you hunt.

387
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,334
Everyone has been set
to purpose.

388
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,711
Ours is to provide meat.

389
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,639
You spoke of a debt
to Oenomaus.

390
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:43,476
Was saving his life
not repayment enough?

391
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,603
That is for him to decide.

392
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,523
You are a free man.

393
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:51,150
Your decision's your own,

394
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,986
as they were
when you stood in the arena

395
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,154
to strike down your brothers.

396
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,824
What moved your hand?

397
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:59,867
Honor, as you would have it,

398
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,619
or the promise of coin?

399
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,788
Never to be collected,

400
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:07,000
because l chose
not to kill you in the arena.

401
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,503
And now my rudis--
my freedom--

402
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,255
is forever buried
beneath its rubble.

403
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:15,591
Freedom is not
a stick of wood

404
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,927
to be presented as bone
to obedient dog.

405
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,013
lt is a thing all men deserve.

406
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,348
We are gladiators,

407
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:25,560
deserving only death
equal to the lives that we have taken.

408
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,862
lt was not always so for me.

409
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,282
l lived free once

410
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,577
in the lands of Thrace

411
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:44,662
with a wife,

412
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,540
promise of children.

413
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,043
What became of her?

414
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,628
Batiatus claimed her life.

415
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,507
l took his in return.

416
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,763
Then you have balanced scale.

417
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,183
lt was Glaber
who condemned us to slavery.

418
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,435
And l will not rest

419
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,020
while he yet draws breath.

420
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:13,232
This is the reason
you provoke the Romans--

421
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,234
for the memory
of your woman?

422
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,820
For love--

423
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,326
the greatest cause of all.

424
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,789
A thing that has dragged
many a man to ruin.

425
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,171
You have scared away
the game.

426
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:38,716
l would fare better alone.

427
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,038
Man:
Keep fucking sword up.

428
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:12,166
Let it drop,
and fall forever beside it.

429
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,835
Again.

430
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,968
Attack.

431
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,639
l would not have you expire
from the heat.

432
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,642
Donar: Attack.

433
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,436
Gratitude.

434
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,440
l would also not have you
at Agron's throat.

435
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,483
Donar: Again.

436
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:39,527
lf he had had his way,

437
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,446
he would have
left you in the mines.

438
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,322
Perhaps he was right.

439
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,783
Do not say such a thing.

440
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,286
Have you not thought the same

441
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:49,996
after last night?

442
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:52,165
lf such a thought
threatened,

443
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,585
l would rip it from fucking brain
with bare hands.

444
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,879
All that matters

445
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,298
is the woman l love

446
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:02,550
stands before me once again.

447
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,802
Does she?

448
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,556
Or is it but faint spirit

449
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,559
haunting the memory
of her body?

450
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,902
You have lost mind.

451
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,780
Hundreds dead, an arena destroyed,
and this is what you offer?

452
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,367
Lucretia to prostrate herself
in the market,

453
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:31,871
begging the gods to piss out
the flames that yet smolder?

454
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,706
Apologies.

455
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:36,876
Young Seppius is but moved
by passionate heart.

456
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,628
Glaber:
l'm sure the gods take notice

457
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,213
of his lack of faith.

458
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,799
Lucretia: We must humble ourselves
before the gods

459
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,385
in attempt to regain
their favor.

460
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,388
Glaber: Ritual will do much
to ease the people's fears.

461
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,391
Seppius: Better assuaged
by the capture of Spartacus.

462
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,812
My men sweep the countryside,
taking action in favor of prayer.

463
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,731
As they have for months,
to no result.

464
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,150
Yours have fared no better.

465
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,737
True.

466
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:08,366
The only one who benefits
from our divide

467
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:11,202
is the man
who causes us injury.

468
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,287
And most keenly felt.

469
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,416
Your father's guidance
and even hand

470
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,252
is deeply missed.

471
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,213
His absence
from this world

472
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:25,007
has set it upon end.

473
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,932
Seppia fell to similar heart

474
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,103
when our cousin Sextus
was snatched from life by Spartacus.

475
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:40,898
And she relives the moment
in Mercato's passing--

476
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:44,944
a family friend
since she was yet a child.

477
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:47,071
Glaber:
Too many have been lost.

478
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,449
l would see no more of note
to follow.

479
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:54,412
Let us set difference aside,

480
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,622


481
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,543
one which will overwhelm Spartacus
and his murdering horde.

482
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:02,920
Yes, for the good of the people.

483
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,797
The city will praise you both,

484
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:08,175


485
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,637
l would need to consult
with Varinius.

486
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,764
The very same man
who galloped back to Rome

487
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,309
while the stones of the arena
were yet falling?

488
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,687
Varinius moves
to distance himself

489
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,690
from all that has happened here,
including you.

490
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,821
Take my hand

491
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:33,618
and with it
see more lasting bond forged.

492
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,459
l will consider your proposal,

493
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:44,086
to give answer tomorrow.

494
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,672
Gallienus:
A night's rest--

495
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,759
Loving sister may sway a brother
where others fail.

496
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,386
Gallienus: --mind to be certainly
cleared by morning.

497
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:56,015
Seppius,

498
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:59,727
l would extend invitation
to your sister

499
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:02,355
in hopes that we may find
greater strength

500
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,607
in the beating
of two wounded hearts.

501
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:07,485
Gallienus:
A thoughtful offer.

502
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,820
There is no deeper solace
for a woman

503
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,573
than in the bosom
of her gender.

504
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,826
lt would come
as great comfort.

505
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,829
Gratitude.

506
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,040
l will arrange visit.

507
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,671
Your wife speaks
with swift thought.

508
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,882
Seppia will take words
to heart on the matter,

509
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,803
with Seppius to find them
better received from her lips.

510
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,013
Yes.

511
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:40,434
Your invitation may yet prove
to be welcome aid.

512
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,187
Come.

513
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,356
l would discuss
other matters with you.

514
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,073
Did l not tell you?

515
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,034
Together...

516
00:33:57,202 --> 00:34:00,663
we will see ourselves freed
from this abyss.

517
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:07,920
( crows cawing )

518
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:10,256
l do not see the man.

519
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,261
You are certain he lives?

520
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:17,763
There were four others
held with him at the bottom.

521
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,099
He did not care
for the company.

522
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:23,519
Their memory is carved
into his flesh,

523
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:26,731
joining the marks of the other souls
that he has taken.

524
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,107
( laughs )

525
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:30,484
What is it you seek
of such a beast?

526
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:34,447
What l seek of the Egyptian
is none of your concern.

527
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,784
l come under the authority

528
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:42,413
of Praetor Gaius Claudius Glaber.

529
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,540
A noble title.

530
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:48,461
Yet absent the man himself,

531
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,005
l cannot break my charge.

532
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:54,300
Of course.

533
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:58,345
lf you do not mind
waiting here with my men,

534
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,766
until l return with him...

535
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,728
Well, the day has been
long and hot.

536
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:08,481
l would have shade

537
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,525
and wine

538
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:15,321
to cool overheating concerns.

539
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,335
Let us see you to the light,
my friend...

540
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,589
and set hands to purpose.

541
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:48,979
( Mira chuckles )

542
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,149
You must keep
your left arm steady,

543
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,360
pull through to the cheek,

544
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:56,695
take breath and release.

545
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:01,200
Make attempt.

546
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,829
Pull through to cheek,

547
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,164
deep breath

548
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,999
and release.

549
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,675
Do not jerk from the string

550
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:21,262
but let it gently slip
from your fingers.

551
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:25,224
With practice, you will be
as the goddess Diana,

552
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:28,185
striking enemies from afar.

553
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,062
Donar.

554
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,022
l would accompany you.

555
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,149
l hold no interest in the bow.

556
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:37,820
We lay together once
and you expect us to never be parted?

557
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,323
You mistake me
for a fucking Gaul.

558
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,417
You seek
Donar's affection now?

559
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:54,545
l seek only my place
in this world.

560
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,756
Then seize it
with your own hands,

561
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,426
not by the spreading
of your legs.

562
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:07,016
ln two weeks time
a ship will dock here,

563
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,935
its hold laden with fighting men
captured by the Romans.

564
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,854
lf a few of us
dressed as merchants

565
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:13,564
could gain entry
before they're unloaded--

566
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,566
Such a thing is possible.

567
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,568
Your labors have born fruit.

568
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,236
Not all is sweet.

569
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,697
News carries
through the streets--

570
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:25,159
Glaber has raised the bounty
on your head to 9,000 denarii.

571
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,623
lt seems you have caught
nothing but Rome's attention.

572
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,292
You will find that a sour meal.

573
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,461
( laughs )

574
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,381
Were the Gauls
not fucking bad enough?

575
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:47,598
l have heard many tales
of the Undefeated Gaul.

576
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,145
A fine title.

577
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:58,651
Yet l recall you
absent victory

578
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:02,363
when we faced Solonius's men
in the opening of the arena.

579
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:07,993
True.
l was not awarded victory.

580
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:11,121
Yet l did not suffer defeat
in proper challenge.

581
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,666
( chuckles )

582
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,543
Perhaps we will yet have one.

583
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:18,879
Perhaps.

584
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:22,257
lt warms heart
to know that you were champion,

585
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,677
how much you desired it.

586
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:28,597
Yet it comes as a surprise

587
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:32,184
to see you here,
following a Thracian's lead.

588
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:35,354
Spartacus has opened my eyes.

589
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:37,648
We stand together.

590
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,984
Then why do you now sit

591
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,153
while he and the lumbering oaf
make plans that affect all?

592
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,449
l am taken
by other concerns.

593
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:53,288
Naevia is your woman now?

594
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:58,544
l remember her when she was yet
a flower untouched.

595
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:01,797
What led her
to be so rudely handled?

596
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,466
My affections

597
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:07,469
and discovery of them
by Lucretia.

598
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,389
The heaviest price is always paid
by those we love.

599
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:12,725
You should carry her
far from Spartacus

600
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,935
and his foolish cause

601
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,980
before he drags you all
to your end.

602
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,402
Oenomaus awakes.

603
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,168
l am here only for words.

604
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:47,468
Which do you think

605
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,511
could ever
hold meaning now?

606
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,765
That Melitta chose you.

607
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,895
That your heart was cherished
above all others.

608
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:02,441
Then why was she with you
the night she died?

609
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:06,904
To share a final drink
before l was to be sold to Tullius.

610
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,948
The only reason?

611
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:16,580
Whatever happened
between us,

612
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,791
l am to blame,

613
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,584
not her,

614
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,628
never her.

615
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,840
l loved you as a brother.

616
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,092
And l you.

617
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,135
No.

618
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:36,391
You are a man
that stands only for himself

619
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,811
and would betray the gods

620
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,313
to gain what he desires.

621
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:47,361
Perhaps l was a fool

622
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:50,572
to have ever believed
otherwise.

623
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:03,585
( Seppia crying )

624
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:06,213
l see it every time
l close my eyes--

625
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:11,176
Spartacus hurling his spear,

626
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:15,222
Cossutius's final
gasping breath.

627
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,018
And Mercato--

628
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,854
poor Mercato.

629
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:25,524
He will be sorely missed.

630
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,234
Apologies.

631
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,945
l babble on as if l am the only one
that has suffered loss,

632
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:32,030
and you grieve
a father's passing.

633
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:35,075
The heart is overwhelmed
by his absence.

634
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,494
You shall embrace him again,

635
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,329
as l shall Mercato

636
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,248
and beloved cousin Sextus.

637
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,585
Upon the shores of the afterlife,

638
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:48,130
where my husband Quintus
patiently awaits.

639
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,761
And with him

640
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,472
countless other Romans of note,

641
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,725
all snatched from this life
too soon

642
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:01,894
by common foe.

643
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:11,195
The years between you
far outweigh mine,

644
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,739
yet do not think me naive.

645
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:17,242
You extend invitation
not to counsel grief,

646
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,162
but to maneuver me
to sway my brother's position.

647
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,080
- Seppia.
- He's been clear in his desire

648
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,832
that he, and he alone,

649
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,752
will bring our common foe
to justice.

650
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,047
And his passions, when set,
are not easily moved.

651
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:33,550
You have uncovered
the veiled schemes of two old women.

652
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,471
But know attempt springs
from wounded heart,

653
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:41,642
one shared between us all,
regardless of age or experience.

654
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:48,232
l looked into his eyes

655
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,652
when Spartacus
stood down upon the sands.

656
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:55,155
They burned with a fire
that would consume the world.

657
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,866
Glaber: And it shall,

658
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:00,744
if good men fail
to set quarrel aside

659
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,412
and face Spartacus
as one.

660
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,250
As l have said to your wife,
my brother can be most difficult.

661
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,169
The fault is not his alone.

662
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:12,547
l regret not having taken
different path

663
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,717
towards more
agreeable solution.

664
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:20,222
But know that l place foot
firmly upon it now.

665
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,560
l will have words

666
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:28,647
and attempt to set him upon it
beside you.

667
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:32,693
Most welcome news,
is it not, Gaius?

668
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,194
Yes.

669
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,656
Most welcome.

670
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:42,953
You are a ray of light
in a house mired in shadow.

671
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,751
( footsteps )

672
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,753
Ah, forgive me.

673
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:58,719
Pressing matters
call my attention.

674
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:06,184
You are blessed
to hold such a man.

675
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:10,022
The gods grant
only what is deserved.

676
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:14,568
The men required
have been assembled.

677
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,864
Come then.

678
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,658
l would see if they are
all that you've promised.

679
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:27,205
( footsteps )

680
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:33,587
Gannicus's bounty
is being prepared.

681
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,382
Come, let us take food.

682
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,807
You have honed it
to fine edge.

683
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,895
Life would easily run
from veins,

684
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:51,980
if brought to bear
upon flesh.

685
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:53,398
Naevia.

686
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:55,817
That is a name
that holds no meaning.

687
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:02,032
She was a different girl,

688
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,912
young and foolish,

689
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,539
ripped from this world

690
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,918
by rough hands
and hot breath upon neck.

691
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:20,300
The things she was forced
to do to survive--

692
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:23,303
We will go from this place,

693
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:26,098
find a new life
on distant shores,

694
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,308
beyond the shadow of Rome.

695
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,272
There is no place
that memory would not follow.

696
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,738
l cannot run from this.

697
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:50,956
What would you have me do--

698
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:54,668
stand idle
and watch as you fade?

699
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:57,421
No, l would not
have you watch.

700
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:02,926
l would have you teach

701
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,970
how to breathe again,

702
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:07,347
how to live,

703
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,975
how to fight,

704
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:13,687
so that no man will ever
lay hands on me

705
00:46:13,855 --> 00:46:16,440
against my will

706
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,359
and the girl

707
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:23,280
whose name was robbed
may reclaim it.

708
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,200
We will have vengeance

709
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:30,245
for what the Romans
have done.

710
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:33,123
Together we shall
see them drown

711
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:35,542
in rivers of blood.

712
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,044
- ( men shouting )
- ( loud crash )

713
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,754
Man:
Where has it gone?

714
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:42,007
- Nothing.
- Nor here.

715
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,176
Spartacus:
Calm yourselves.

716
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,386
What moves to such fits?

717
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,805
Our remaining coin is missing.

718
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,348
Fuck the coin.
The map is gone--

719
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,642
our position,
plans towards Neapolis.

720
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,229
Someone seeks to betray us
for promise of Glaber's reward.

721
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:57,564
Spartacus.

722
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,400
Gannicus.

723
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:02,611
You leave without words?

724
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,196
( thunder rumbling )

725
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,947
l have had them
with Oenomaus.

726
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:07,991
What do you carry
with you?

727
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,409
Water.

728
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:11,328
Meat caught by my own
fucking hands.

729
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:12,913
Open it.

730
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,542
l am not one of your fools,

731
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,085
falling to command.

732
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,962
Our map takes flight
in your wake.

733
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,465
A thing l have seen
your gaze upon.

734
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:27,427
l am guilty of many things.

735
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:31,056
Betraying ill-fated cause
does not stand among them.

736
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,852
Remove yourself
from fucking path.

737
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,484
( thunder crashing )

738
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:49,324
( laughs )

739
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:52,619
l knew you would lead these men
to their deaths eventually.

740
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:54,246
ls this the day
you would do it?

741
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,540
They are but loyal--

742
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,293
a quality you seem
unfamiliar with.

743
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,806
No! Do not come
between us.

744
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:16,184
l would show him
what a man with cause is capable of.

745
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:18,395
Your sword.

746
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,736
You fight in the style
of Dimachaerus.

747
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,488
Trained by Oenomaus himself.

748
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:30,156
Let me pass,

749
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,659
or put skill to final test.

750
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:01,438
We must stop this.

751
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:03,690
Spartacus has made
his desire known.

752
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:05,108
We shall honor it.

753
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,701
Spartacus!

754
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,170
( people exclaiming )

755
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:08,755
Chadara!

756
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:11,257
Mira: She was trying to slip away
when all others stood fixed.

757
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,842
A fine shot.

758
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,347
l meant only to wound.

759
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,443
She took the map.

760
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:35,031
Why would she do
such a thing?

761
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:39,077
Mira: She felt she had
no place among us.

762
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:41,413
She sought to secure one
elsewhere.

763
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:52,841
Apologies.

764
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,801
Your words prove true.

765
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:57,387
lt has not always been so.

766
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:02,809
l would take to path now,

767
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:05,603
unless you would seek
further quarrel.

768
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,566
Go. Enough blood
has been spilled.

769
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:22,328
Do you stay?

770
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,248
We do.

771
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,585
Then l shall mourn
your passing.

772
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,550
ls it wise to let him go?

773
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:40,680
Every man has a right
to his own choice.

774
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:42,307
Gannicus has made his.

775
00:51:42,475 --> 00:51:44,768
And may yet prove a threat.

776
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:50,190
We have faced far worse.

777
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,109
( screams )

778
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:48,331
The Egyptian and your men
prove themselves.

779
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,583
As promised.

780
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:55,213
See the bodies of the slaves
properly attended.

781
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:57,006
Draw no attention.

782
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:12,981
Apologies.

783
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,732
l could not wait
till morning.

784
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,942
( moans )

785
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:18,778
You wish to give voice
to my offer?

786
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:21,322
l fear it comes too late.

787
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:23,741
S-S-Seppia.

788
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:27,954
l've seen how close
you hold her to heart.

789
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,211
Leave this life
knowing she's safe

790
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:38,047
beneath my roof,

791
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:42,051
my hands to comfort her
in days to come.

792
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,306
Words no longer hold meaning.

793
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:49,601
And l've had too many of them
by fools

794
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,936
presuming themselves
to be my better.

795
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:53,980
Such days are at an end.

796
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:58,484
Your men are now mine

797
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:02,363
and, with their addition
to my own,

798
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:04,407
clear path to the end

799
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,576
of Spartacus.

800
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,687
( theme music playing )

801
00:54:34,519 --> 00:55:34,687

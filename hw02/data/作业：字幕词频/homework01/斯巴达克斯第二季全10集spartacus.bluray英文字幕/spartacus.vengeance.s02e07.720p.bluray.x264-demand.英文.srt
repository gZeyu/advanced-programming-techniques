1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,506
My father dissolves
our marriage

2
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,508
in favor of more
promising opportunity.

3
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:11,928
- ls there nothing left between us?
- Memories only.

4
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:13,930
Agron: The arena has burned
to fucking ground...

5
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:15,098
( screams )

6
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,433
...with many Romans
among the ashes!

7
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,102
Spartacus:
Can he be healed?

8
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,521
Lucius: This man--
beyond what should warrant life.

9
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,107
Gannicus: His name is Oenomaus
and he is more than common man.

10
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,025
100 more bodies
pulled from the arena.

11
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,111
This was found
in the wreckage.

12
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,322
llithyia: The gods have punished me
by striking down my father.

13
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,032
- lt is not enough.
- Gaius.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,660
The only reason you have not
joined your father

15
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:37,495
is the child
that grows within you.

16
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,873
House slaves will never be gladiators.
We need fighting men.

17
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,793
Perhaps it is time to revisit
plans towards Neapolis

18
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:46,087
and slaver ships
from foreign wars.

19
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,172
( chuckles )
You would attack the port?

20
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,425
( theme music playing )

21
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,267
- ( rain pattering )
- ( thunder rumbling )

22
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,897
Man: l do not care
for the fucking rain,

23
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,233
nor disturbance
at unreasonable hour.

24
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:10,903
l would have you quickly removed
from such concerns...

25
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:14,115
and well compensated

26
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:17,410
for allowing eyes
upon your latest offering...

27
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,330
in advance of auction.

28
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,417
Man: You must have pressing needs,
to venture out on such a night.

29
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,628
l fear the rising sun
would dash hopes of them being met.

30
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,422
Short of time,
long of coin--

31
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,924
what form of slave
narrows your purpose?

32
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,844
Lucius: l have a desire
towards fighting men.

33
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,721
Man: Ah, gladiators.

34
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:39,348
l've supplied Rome with many
of its finest champions.

35
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,351
Sadly, with the arena
in Capua gone,

36
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,481
there is less interest in base men
of such talents.

37
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,524
Fortunate for my cause then.

38
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,903
Come, let us see
how you can further aid it.

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,473
Thick of the stench,

40
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:24,101
savages east of the Rhine
tend to favor their own shit.

41
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,355
l intended to have them scrubbed
and oiled before auction,

42
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:31,108
but l fear that would do little
to improve their natural odor.

43
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,610
And how do you find
the women?

44
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,946
As unpleasant
as their men.

45
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,533
l would not recommend
lustful...

46
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,319
( woman shouts )

47
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,046
Finish quickly. Release them.

48
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,769
You're not from our lands.

49
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,771
Yet l was once bound in chains

50
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,024
by the Romans, as you were--

51
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,193
a grievance l would see them
pay dearly for.

52
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,827
( men cheering )

53
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,746
This says they are with us.

54
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,176
A fortunate thing

55
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,428
that we liberate a ship
filled with your people.

56
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,597
The gods favor us.

57
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:28,434
No longer will we have to listen
to those fucking Gauls again.

58
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,061
( laughs )

59
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,938
( shouts )

60
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,281
Good Mercato
spoke highly of you.

61
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,866
A grave misfortune

62
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,868
that his tongue
has forever been silenced.

63
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,454
His passing cause
for my presence before you.

64
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,665
Passing?
( chuckles )

65
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,459
Too gentle a word for
how he was ushered from this life,

66
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,920
blood and brains staining
the pulvinus

67
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,964
as he thought to flee
Spartacus's wrath.

68
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,466
Gannicus: A thing that threatens
to consume many innocent lives.

69
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,802
Gallienus: We have thought you
but mangled corpse

70
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,471
and the sundered beams
of the arena your tomb.

71
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,266
The events of the day caused me
absent proper mind.

72
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,601
lt has since returned.

73
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,269
And you to our streets.

74
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,814
Mercato my purpose,
as l said.

75
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,233
There is the matter of coin

76
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,360
for services tendered
upon the sands.

77
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:23,072
You were secured to execute those shits
that follow Spartacus.

78
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,324
l do not recall any
falling to your sword.

79
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,576
lt would have happened,
had Spartacus not appeared.

80
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,537
And coin would have
materialized the same.

81
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,163
But the past
cannot be altered.

82
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,499
l am without coin, Magistrate.

83
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,334
l would not have returned
otherwise.

84
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,682
For your years of pleasing
the crowd in the arena.

85
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,809
Now follow

86
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,270
once noble monument,
and collapse from sight.

87
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,732
Magistrate, apologies.

88
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:02,069
My rudis was lost
when the arena fell.

89
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,363
- Without it--
- You press beyond reason.

90
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,115
Glaber:
lll wind has blown Capua

91
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,285
from once-steady course.

92
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,620
Take further matter
to Praetor Glaber.

93
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,290
Perhaps you can entice coin
from him as well,

94
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,208
if caught upon proper mood.

95
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,003
Glaber: ...and misfortune.

96
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,590
We have all suffered loss

97
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,925
of those closest to us.

98
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,387
Even a senator
of our great Republic,

99
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:33,184
a man my wife called father,

100
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,394
has been ripped
from this world

101
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,481
by Spartacus
and his mongrel hordes!

102
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,986
And now beloved Seppius

103
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,405
has fallen

104
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:50,076
to this festering disease
of rebellion,

105
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:54,205
murdered by his own slaves,

106
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,249
who even now
spirit themselves away

107
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,460
to join Spartacus
against us!

108
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,712
( crowd murmuring )

109
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
What?

110
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,758
Glaber: We must be ever vigilant
in these dark times.

111
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,010
We must bring to light

112
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,472
even dimmest shadow
of betrayal,

113
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,016
if it is revealed to us.

114
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,978
From this day forward,

115
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,147
any slave

116
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:23,275
who dares to whisper
the name Spartacus

117
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,361
shall be put to death...

118
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,238
( crowd murmuring )

119
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,998
...even those

120
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,793
owned by a praetor of Rome.

121
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,920
( crowd exclaiming )

122
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,463
Seize her.

123
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,174
( whimpering )

124
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,426
Dominus, l did nothing.

125
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,315
Dominus.

126
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,151
( whispers )
Do not speak against him.

127
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,986
Listen how she begs,

128
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,029
pleading with the very tongue

129
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:13,033
that only yesterday held praise
for Spartacus upon it,

130
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,161
praise for the slaves

131
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,163
that murdered Seppius,

132
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,249
praise most fortunate
to be overheard

133
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,501
by loyal wife.

134
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,217
Domina?

135
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,852
lt is true.

136
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,396
l heard her speak it.

137
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,773
( whimpering )

138
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,152
Would that she had
more than one life to take.

139
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,323
Let this serve as warning

140
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,241
to any slave

141
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,578
who would conspire
against us.

142
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,497
( snaps fingers )

143
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,166
( sobbing loudly )

144
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,753
( screaming )

145
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,114
( metal clanging )

146
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,765
Apologies.

147
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,103
None deserved.

148
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,896
lt was a foolish attempt.

149
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,982
You seek to part
head from shoulders.

150
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:12,111
There are blows that kill
with less effort.

151
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,947
Then l shall learn them.

152
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,785
He is never from her side.

153
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,204
Spartacus wanted him
towards Neapolis,

154
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,331
but he would not leave her.

155
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,294
Though perhaps it's best to keep
him and Agron parted.

156
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,505
Naevia's blessed
to be loved so deeply.

157
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,549
As are you,

158
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,426
by Spartacus.

159
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,144
Crixus.

160
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,114
l taught you

161
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:00,117
never to lower guard.

162
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,661
Now see Naevia
to same instruction.

163
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,830
Oenomaus.

164
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,501
l thought you
for the afterlife.

165
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,211
As l you.

166
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,257
Yet we did not escape
deep wounds.

167
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,052
A thing to be visited upon
the Romans a thousandfold,

168
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,013
now that Oenomaus
stands with us once again.

169
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,681
He was a fool

170
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,850
- to be gone so long from your side.
- ( gate opens )

171
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,935
Spartacus: Such things are
of the past.

172
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,523
Let us turn thought
towards future

173
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,859
and what joys
it may hold.

174
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,362
( people chattering, laughing )

175
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,624
You have done
the impossible.

176
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,503
Hey.

177
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,347
( crowd laughs )

178
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,564
- Our ranks swell.
- We will need more weapons--

179
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,650
a concern
that must be addressed.

180
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,363
l sense a deeper one.

181
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,741
These are all
fucking Agron's people.

182
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:27,663
Our forces have doubled
in a single day...

183
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,418
with people that are no stranger
to battle and blood.

184
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,504
And whom
will they follow?

185
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,219
( crows cawing )

186
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:50,436
l detected a hint of movement
in your hips this time...

187
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,940
a subtle thrust...

188
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,570
as l bore down.

189
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,948
You begin to enjoy
my cock inside of you?

190
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,285
l would have answer.

191
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,788
Yes.

192
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,374
Yes...

193
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,126
what?

194
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,881
Yes, Dominus.

195
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,512
Has a man ever heard

196
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,681
so sweet a sound?

197
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,476
Your voice,

198
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,312
your touch...

199
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,109
the warmth of your thighs--

200
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,156
little wonder Quintus fell
beneath your spell,

201
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,993
lavishing you
with affection and gifts.

202
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,915
You call me Dominus now
in his place.

203
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,127
lt is only just

204
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,963
that l present you
with something in return.

205
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,519
How did you come by
such bounty?

206
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,022
They were freely given
by the dead

207
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,107
who no longer have
need for them.

208
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,901
( chuckles )

209
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,530
When this chest is full,

210
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,617
its worth shall see Ashur
to even greater heights.

211
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,205
Yet...

212
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,875
for one such as you--

213
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,383
something purchased
with coin.

214
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,689
l know how fond Quintus was
of the color.

215
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,149
l would have you wear it...

216
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:07,239
so that l may look up to you
upon the balcony...

217
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,077
and know that you're mine.

218
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,921
Glaber: Heart has been
deeply wounded.

219
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,757
lf there is anything to offer as balm,
you need but voice it.

220
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,845
Did you take command
of his men?

221
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,763
l did.

222
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,975
Would that he had given them
freely in life,

223
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,269
Spartacus would be
a distant memory

224
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,271
and my brother
yet by my side.

225
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,441
lf only it had been so,

226
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,568
my father would yet
grace this world

227
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:48,447
and my slave would have had
no cause to be crucified.

228
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,283
( man shouting commands )

229
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,660
Your brother's men arrive.

230
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,245
- Come.
- Man: Open the gate!

231
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,205
Let us review them

232
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,959
and bind them to cause
with oath of loyalty.

233
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,178
Fall to attention!

234
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,474
( horse neighs )

235
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,315
Hold tongue.

236
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,983
Give attention.

237
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,989
Who stands forth
as your voice?

238
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,158
Octavius Tarsus.

239
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,619
l stand for them.

240
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,829
Your benefactor

241
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,708
has been ripped from this world
by the villain Spartacus.

242
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:45,504
Towards his end,
l conscript you and your men

243
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:49,383
into the army
of Gaius Claudius Glaber.

244
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,928
Recite the sacramentum
and commit loyalty.

245
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,939
l, Octavius Tarsus,

246
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,149
swear by
Jupiter Optimus Maximus

247
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,819
that l shall uphold
and defend the Republic.

248
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,114
l swear to have her enemies
as my enemies

249
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,907
and her friends
as my friends.

250
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,659
You've taken
to your old color.

251
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,452
Octavius: l pledge to defend
the Republic...

252
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,704
l fear it no longer
suits me.

253
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,706
Octavius: ...and her honor
with all my thoughts,

254
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,874
my words and actions.

255
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,001
l pledge my body and life
to the Republic

256
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,003
and to its army
under the leadership

257
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,214
of Praetor Gaius Claudius Glaber.

258
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,049
Will they be enough?

259
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,343
Added to my own troops, yes.

260
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,556
They will be enough
to bring Spartacus to justice.

261
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,142
l do not seek justice.

262
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,687
l seek vengeance.

263
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,815
The man who took the life of my brother
must die the same,

264
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,734
in blood and slaughter.

265
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,445
Octavius: ...have all those held
close to heart.

266
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,740
By Jupiter Optimus Maximus,
l so swear.

267
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,409
Soldiers:
By Jupiter Optimus Maximus,

268
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,244
we so swear.

269
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,747
Set camp
outside these walls.

270
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,208
Salvius will see you
to orders...

271
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,919
( quietly )
and the death of Spartacus.

272
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,629
Salvius: You are
Glaber's men now.

273
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,673
Gratitude for your kindness.

274
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,550
Salvius: Fall to attention.

275
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,260
Know that
l have treasured it.

276
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,053
Salvius: Move out.

277
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:22,350
Perhaps it would be best
if you made home here

278
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,935
beneath our roof.

279
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,105
l leave in the morning
for my uncle's villa in Pompeii.

280
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,940
l would not have you
upon the road

281
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,110
while the threat of Spartacus
still remains.

282
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,405
l'll send word to you uncle,
if you find solace in the thought.

283
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,126
Your presence
offers great comfort.

284
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:51,797
l am blessed
to find myself among you.

285
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,633
Come, let us
make arrangements.

286
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,693
Was it so recent
that l thought him weak?

287
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,157
l know gaze into his eyes

288
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,035
and tremble
at what lurks behind them.

289
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,039
Do not work yourself into
an unfortunate state.

290
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,290
Your child--

291
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,084
ls the only reason
l yet live.

292
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:33,505
Nothing l do pleases him.

293
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,924
He tortures me
for what l have done--

294
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:39,636
Decila crucified,
Seppia invited into our house,

295
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,304
the way he looks at her.

296
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,521
l would see myself over cliff

297
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,857
if this is all
fate now holds.

298
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,861
My heart would follow
to the rocks below.

299
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,656
l cannot live like this.

300
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,034
Nor l.

301
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,538
( people chattering )

302
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,463
The last of our meat.

303
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,966
l forgot how much my kind
devour upon a sitting.

304
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,344
Much seems to have
slipped mind of late.

305
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:29,060
You sent me to scout Neapolis
and report on opportunity.

306
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,396
That ship provided it.

307
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,399
Were there any others
that may have afforded the same?

308
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,026
Two--

309
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,446
one from Damascus,
the other Gallia.

310
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,072
News l would have cared
to know.

311
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,742
Would it have made difference?
Men from Damascus

312
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,577
are of low quality
and even lower trust.

313
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,495
And Gallia?

314
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,084
l would not have these ranks
filled with Gauls.

315
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,419
Crixus...

316
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,422
ls an honorable man.

317
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,594
l will take your brothers to hunt
when day breaks

318
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,096
to replenish supply,

319
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,098
gauge how we might
come together.

320
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,894
And tell those who are able
to speak in common tongue

321
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,396
so that all among us
may know their thoughts.

322
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,815
They will prove great asset.

323
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,152
l give you my word.

324
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,831
You fucking cunt.

325
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,167
Nothing is free.

326
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,808
l heard you were dead,

327
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,810
carried to the afterlife
with all the others

328
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,812
that fell beneath the arena.

329
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,772
l yet breathe.

330
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,692
My purse, however,
has suffered fatal blow.

331
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,820
l have no coin
to pry open thighs.

332
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:05,073
They may yet widen
of their own accord.

333
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:08,159
A miracle lacking profit

334
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,370
for you and your master.

335
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,585
Do you recall what it was like
to have one

336
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,212
before you gained
your freedom?

337
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,339
No man is ever truly free.

338
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,634
( whispers )
Except for Spartacus

339
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,970
and those who follow him.

340
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,015
Did you see him
when he attacked the arena?

341
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,434
What form of man was he?

342
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,519
You speak of dangerous things.

343
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,521
l'm not the only one.

344
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,691
There's talk among many of us
toward joining his cause.

345
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,568
There is no cause,

346
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:44,946
only the leading of innocent fools
to their deaths.

347
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,536
You have no coin then?

348
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,706
A few denarii for passage
away from this fucking city.

349
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,753
Strike Spartacus
from your thoughts

350
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,671
and come with me.

351
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,300
Ashur:
The mighty Gannicus.

352
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:07,844
( chuckling )

353
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,433
lt is joyous occasion

354
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,852
to find you yet alive,

355
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,147
with ripe offering
perched upon lap.

356
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,650
Apologies.

357
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,862
lt is unforgivable
to come between man and cunt,

358
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,074
yet l must have words
with my brother.

359
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,333
( exhales )

360
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,752
An enticing creature.

361
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,214
Of course you never lack
the attention of fine women.

362
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,883
lf you seek words,
break them and be done.

363
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,970
The years have not seen you
to better manners.

364
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,639
Nor you
to better company.

365
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,601
l would advise caution.

366
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:00,438
These men are the hand
of Praetor Gaius Claudius Glaber.

367
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,857
Oh, and what are you?

368
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,276
His cock or his ass?

369
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,821
( chuckles )

370
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,116
l am his will...

371
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,830
bound by duty
to restore order.

372
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,998
By nailing little girls
to the cross?

373
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,335
Any slaves who whisper
of Spartacus and his rebellion...

374
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,047
shall find place beside her.

375
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,133
l have no interest
in whispers,

376
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,552
nor the will
of your praetor.

377
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,889
Old words from a slave.

378
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,435
You mistake me.

379
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,646
l am a free man.

380
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,315
Yes.

381
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:48,111
l was there upon the sands
when you became

382
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,280
a god of the arena.

383
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:59,038
lt was a sight
never to be forgotten,

384
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:02,333
Gannicus besting
20 gladiators

385
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,919
in the primus
of the opening day.

386
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:14,053
And his reward--
the rudis,

387
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,848
a wooden sword carved
with the legend of his victories,

388
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:20,226
proof of freedom

389
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:23,396
demanded by adoring crowd.

390
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,857
Show them.

391
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,859
l am sure
they would be eager

392
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,653
to lay eyes
upon such rare marvel.

393
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:33,489
No?

394
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,450
You do not have it
upon you?

395
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,285
You know l do not.

396
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,497
As l know

397
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,708
the praetor
will be most pleased

398
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,877
with the presence
of your company.

399
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:59,807
l find it surprising
that you are still of this world,

400
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,268
more so that you did not
think it wise

401
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,729
to present yourself
at sooner convenience.

402
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,273
Apologies.

403
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,779
Gannicus has always been
a man of few words.

404
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:17,242
Yet he favors the magistrate
with whole sentences, l'm told.

405
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:21,829
l sought only
to conclude business.

406
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,331
You aim too low.

407
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:27,252
Spartacus brings the arena
down upon you,

408
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,586
and yet here you stand,

409
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:32,006
a phoenix
risen from its ashes.

410
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,760
The gods have truly
blessed him.

411
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,429
Glaber:
As they now bless me

412
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,598
with his presence.

413
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,103
l was moved

414
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,231
by the reaction of the crowd
when you stepped upon the sands,

415
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,984
the swell of their voices
heralding your name,

416
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,611
filling the air with hope.

417
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:58,074
Even tarnished by blood
and calamity,

418
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,451
such a thing

419
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,620
yet can hold value.

420
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,501
Your rudis.

421
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,296
And its price?

422
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,464
A simple oath

423
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,466
pledging yourself
to my command.

424
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,972
Lucretia

425
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,975
was also once thought
victim of Spartacus

426
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,394
yet now stands
a powerful symbol

427
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:29,480
used to calm
swelling concern.

428
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,983
l would add you as such--

429
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:35,278
a former slave
of the House of Batiatus

430
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:38,656
now sworn to bring
errant brothers to justice.

431
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,992
lt appears you already have
one of those.

432
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:46,080
Ashur's talents
are of the shadows.

433
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,624
l would present you
in glorious light,

434
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,376
at the front of my troops

435
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,046
to the roar of the crowd
once again.

436
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,507
And if l no longer crave
for such clamor?

437
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:11,898
You're a free man.

438
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,943
Your fate is your own.

439
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,873
l will send for you again
in a few days

440
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:32,835
and expect reasonable decision
to accompany you.

441
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,339
Praetor.

442
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,719
Forgive me, Praetor.

443
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,597
Gannicus cannot be trusted.

444
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,808
Same once said of you,

445
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,936
yet here you stand.

446
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,942
See one of your men
to follow.

447
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:00,196
lf Gannicus attempts
to leave Capua,

448
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,490
crucify him.

449
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,791
Perhaps Gannicus
was right.

450
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,586
Those closest are of greater concern
than the Romans.

451
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,589
Agron has aided cause
many times.

452
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,134
His sport of simple truth
less common.

453
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,846
"An angry young boy,
pissing on all those about him"--

454
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,681
were those not your words?

455
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,603
You know l hold Agron
in affection.

456
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,735
Yet we must always be
cautious.

457
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,781
Chadara is a lesson
not to be forgotten.

458
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,004
You did what you had to.

459
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:00,548
She left you absent choice.

460
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:06,053
l pray Agron presents you
better option.

461
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,309
ls there no other way?

462
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,352
Lucretia:
You were right about Gaius.

463
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,939
The man he was no longer peers
from behind his eyes.

464
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:22,195
He will not be swayed
by words or gentle touch.

465
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:27,575
Only blood
can set us free now.

466
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:30,620
Lucretia.

467
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,333
lt will hurt
but for a moment.

468
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,849
Lift your dress.

469
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,232
Neapolis?

470
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,568
A slaver ship was set upon, carrying
prisoners captured east of the Rhine.

471
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:05,196
Warriors to aid
Spartacus's cause.

472
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,697
An obvious conclusion.

473
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,741
Dispatch men to Neapolis.

474
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:12,203
Question anyone who may have seen
where they were headed after liberation.

475
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,871
Praetor.

476
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,417
Gaius.

477
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:23,214
Fetch the medicus, quickly!

478
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,842
Lucretia: llithyia?

479
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,389
What has happened to her?

480
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:34,058
lt is a sign from the gods,

481
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:38,020
one carried by the child
yet to breathe life.

482
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:39,188
And its meaning?

483
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:42,567
Your heir will die
if it remains in a city

484
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,819
cursed with blood and fear.

485
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:51,909
l will have her carried to Rome
as soon as she's able,

486
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:55,288
with trusted guard
to watch over her at all times

487
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,706
till my return.

488
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,125
l shall accompany her
and tend to her needs.

489
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,711
Shh.

490
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,171
Apologies, Praetor.

491
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,925
Lucretia's a dear friend
to your wife

492
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,344
yet offers greater comfort
to Capua.

493
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:13,139
l fear the people
will fall to despair

494
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:16,267
absent her divine presence.

495
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:19,020
Wise counsel.

496
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,814
Have your presence
known tomorrow in the market.

497
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,566
Ease mind of our city

498
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:25,359
and continue to assure them

499
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,778
the gods favor my efforts.

500
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,416
( birds chirping )

501
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,376
We have been training
those freed of bond,

502
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:45,463
yet none among us ever held
title of Doctore.

503
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:50,301
l have no knowledge
of soldiers and the war.

504
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,637
l know only
the ways of a gladiator.

505
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,139
l can think of no fiercer army
so instructed.

506
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,728
Open their eyes to what a man
can do given cause.

507
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:03,689
As you have opened mine.

508
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,489
l hunt with Agron
and his people

509
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,407
to better gauge them.

510
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,576
l will lend aid
when l return.

511
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,204
l fear you hunt alone.

512
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:20,831
Agron left with the others
before light broke.

513
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:27,004
( crowd chattering, laughing )

514
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:29,674
Spartacus: Agron.

515
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:36,681
You hunt without me...

516
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,518
when you knew
my intention.

517
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:43,688
They woke before the sun and were eager
to take advantage of freedom.

518
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,778
( laughter )

519
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:55,533
We hunt, catch meat.

520
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:57,535
And Roman drink!

521
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,620
( cheering )

522
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:04,125
l did not know this forest
was stocked with such.

523
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,960
Where did you come by this?

524
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:08,045
A wagon along the road.

525
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,256
You attack the road

526
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,717
so close to our position,
absent proper weapons?

527
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,389
No one see.
All dead.

528
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,110
( men laughing )

529
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,781
l'm glad l risked my life
for this lot.

530
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,491
They see us
to proper force.

531
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,744
They see us to nothing
but discovery.

532
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,370
Let the Romans come.

533
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,414
l tire of hiding
like fucking rabbits.

534
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,791
We are not ready
for a direct assault.

535
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,668
Something even a child
could see.

536
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:51,672
This child helped save you
from the arena

537
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,924
and filled our numbers
with warriors.

538
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,595
The pup has found himself nothing
but a pack of wild dogs.

539
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,432
Ones that will never follow
a fucking Gaul.

540
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:09,023
Apologies for leaving
without you.

541
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,783
l question the boy's sincerity.

542
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,912
Let us break meal
with our new brothers

543
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,080
and attempt to settle this.

544
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:34,423
May the gods bless you.

545
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,175
May the gods
bless you.

546
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,219
May the gods bless you.

547
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,147
Hold the crowd back.
l would have words with Gannicus

548
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,651
towards your praetor's desire.

549
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,671
Woman's voice: There's talk among
many of us toward joining his cause.

550
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:19,885
You knew her?

551
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,182
A foolish girl.

552
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,018
She spoke too loudly of things
she should not have.

553
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,900
The city is filled with ears

554
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,528
straining for whispers
of betrayal.

555
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,407
lt's filled with eyes as well.

556
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:51,584
Attempt to leave the city
and share a cross beside your friend.

557
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,711
( loudly )
l am not your slave.

558
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,797
And l will not bow
to your threats.

559
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,382
Nor would l see you.

560
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,386
The oracle of fucking riddles.

561
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,389
Come to plain words.

562
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,350
l saw something in your eyes

563
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:10,227
when you stood before Glaber.

564
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:14,398
l saw something beyond
a man weighing decision.

565
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:18,277
The gods bless you with the gift
to see into my thoughts now, do they?

566
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,029
More like her will die.

567
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,781
The guilty, the innocent--
there will stand no difference

568
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:27,077
when caught between Glaber's wrath
and Spartacus's vengeance.

569
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,705
And what would you
have me do?

570
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,791
Take up offer

571
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,920
and turn on those
that l once called brother?

572
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,755
No.

573
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:43,802
l would have you end the life
of Gaius Claudius Glaber.

574
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,941
He is desperate to claim
Spartacus's life,

575
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,734
so consumed
that he now stands

576
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,945
more a threat
than the Thracian himself.

577
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,947
And what difference
would it make?

578
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,366
Rome would only send another
to take his place.

579
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,160
Spartacus blames Glaber
for part in his wife's death.

580
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:10,955
Remove him from the world

581
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,248
and the scales of blood
will be balanced.

582
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:16,126
Spartacus will drift
from Rome.

583
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,796
No one's life will be lost
on either side.

584
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,801
Glaber's own wife

585
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,552
this very night
leaves for Rome,

586
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,138
taking with her
half his personal guard

587
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,516
to see her safely
from the city.

588
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:33,644
l could distract any that remain
posted to the villa entry,

589
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,188
giving opportunity
for a single man

590
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,816
to take Glaber's life
while he sleeps

591
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:42,277
and Spartacus
to receive the blame.

592
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,029
You have lost mind.

593
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:47,241
The whole world
has slipped from reason.

594
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:49,284
l seek only to restore it.

595
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,703
( men chattering )

596
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,371
Man: Move aside.

597
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,792
Rid yourself of Ashur's man.

598
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:01,839
When moon stands highest,
l will see path cleared.

599
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,051
Choose to set upon it...

600
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:11,181
or see legions fall
to pointless suffering.

601
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,193
( men chattering )

602
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,197
( cheering )

603
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,783
Yeah!

604
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,620
Your people-- they lift spirits.

605
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,833
Not all are so moved.

606
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,942
Perhaps they'll kill each other

607
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,111
and give proper cause
for celebration.

608
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,739
You are an impossible man.

609
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,033
Something you've always known.

610
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,202
And chose to ignore...

611
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,039
to better see the man
beneath his faults.

612
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,667
What if you had found
nothing of worth

613
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:03,794
when the veil was pierced?

614
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,134
( man singing )

615
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,349
( crowd singing )

616
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,023
Sing with me, my dark brother,
and share my women.

617
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,984
l know not your words.

618
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:28,777
Ah, Lugo will teach.

619
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:33,615
( crowd continues singing )

620
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:38,287
Mira: Oenomaus finds himself
assaulted.

621
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,040
They are a boisterous people.

622
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:45,294
Sometimes wine and foolishness
are needed

623
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,338
to forger stronger bond.

624
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:50,632
Sing with me.

625
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,468
Now is not the time
for such things.

626
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:56,889
ls it ever?

627
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:01,560
No.

628
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:06,607
l'll try and wrest a drink
from Lugo.

629
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,817
for us to share

630
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:11,028
and in the act

631
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,030
aid Oenomaus in escape.

632
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,035
( horses neigh )

633
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,804
l tried to convince him
to let you come.

634
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,431
He would not be moved.

635
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,434
lt's a thing of no matter.

636
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:53,570
What you have done for me.

637
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,156
Would that we were
never parted.

638
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:00,077
You shall find me again
to your arms...

639
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,455
sooner than expected.

640
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:07,918
l sway Gannicus to forever remove
Gaius from concern.

641
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,757
When it is done,
l will raise clamor

642
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,426
and see Gannicus follow
to the afterlife.

643
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,891
llithyia, it's time.

644
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,244
Gaius...

645
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,689
you shall be missed.

646
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,167
( crowd singing )

647
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,004
( women laughing, chattering )

648
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,312
Wine, we share.

649
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,523
Gratitude, but Crixus awaits.

650
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,359
Ah, the Gaul.

651
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:59,529
Yes, l see his eyes at me--

652
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,198
no love.

653
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,034
He needs time.

654
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:05,535
And drink.

655
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,289

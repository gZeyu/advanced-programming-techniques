1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,006
House slaves
will never be gladiators--

2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,342
something we are
in short supply of.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,094
We need fighting men.

4
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,012
Keys, quickly.
Release them.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,557
- Our ranks swell.
- We will need more weapons.

6
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,601
Gratitude for your kindness.

7
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,311
Know that l have
treasured it.

8
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:24,691
ls it true?
Did you lay with her?

9
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,192
- Oenomaus--
- ( screams )

10
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:31,864
l would have you end the life
of Gaius Claudius Glaber.

11
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,034
Glaber's own wife
this very night leaves for Rome.

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,708
Your men are now mine.

13
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,257
( theme music playing )

14
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:10,278
Where do you take me?

15
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,574
Please, l am with child.

16
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,952
( men chattering )

17
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,790
Someone approaches.

18
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,794
Follow fucking lead

19
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,921
and do not stray from it.

20
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,017
Come.

21
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,604
What brings you so far
from road, brother,

22
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,689
with one so ripe?

23
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,609
An ancient horse
gone to grass.

24
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,113
The woods offer shorter distance
for my wife to Pompeii.

25
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,325
Shorter by a lifetime,
if tread absent caution.

26
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:00,453
Spartacus and his fucks set upon a wagon
not far from here recently.

27
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,621
Spartacus?

28
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,956
Perhaps, we should be
on our way, my love...

29
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,044
unless similar misfortune
fall upon us.

30
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:10,463
lt appears it already has.

31
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,173
How did you come by that?

32
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,634
Our horse, when it fell.

33
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,637
On the road to Pompeii, yes.

34
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,806
You have business there?

35
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,724
Meat and bone
carved for coin.

36
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,768
A butcher?

37
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,770
Mm.

38
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,483
Fine dress for wife of such.

39
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,819
He's a gladiator.
l am the praetor's--

40
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,920
Apologies.

41
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,341
llithyia: Help me!

42
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,677
Somebody help me!

43
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,345
Help me!

44
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:02,265
Raise voice again,

45
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,685
and l will hack tongue
from fucking mouth.

46
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,695
Ask any price.

47
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,322
My husband will see it paid
for my return.

48
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,449
( chuckles )

49
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,910
l seek no ransom.

50
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,000
You are going to
rob me of my life?

51
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,044
No.
lt is not mine to take.

52
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,597
l could have speared him.

53
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,724
He was beyond your throw.

54
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,018
You know the distance better
than my own hand, do you?

55
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,646
l know many things regarding
the great and powerful Spartacus.

56
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,774
Great and powerful?

57
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,985
And kind and just.

58
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:58,905
l have peered
into your very heart

59
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,365
and know what it holds.

60
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,122
You would not have found
content so pleasing,

61
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,499
if you had chanced
upon me in my youth.

62
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,709
Mira: Huh.

63
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,836
l stood more animal
than man.

64
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,588
And what tamed
the wild beast?

65
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,012
Your wife, of course.

66
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,555
Apologies.

67
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,098
( footsteps )

68
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,476
( llithyia moaning )

69
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,608
Take the life
of Glaber's woman,

70
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,944
as he took the life of yours.

71
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,032
See end to vengeance

72
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,159
and with it
the suffering of all

73
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,120
caught between you
and such desires.

74
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,055
Lucretia:
l am to blame for her fate.

75
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,015
Had l not broken words
with Gannicus,

76
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,101
he never would have known
llithyia was on the road.

77
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,853
An unfortunate slip
of the tongue.

78
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,273
l thought only to convince
Gannicus of proper path--

79
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,484
to willingly follow
your command

80
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,361
and join the hunt
for Spartacus.

81
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,072
The man is probably in league
with the fucking Thracian.

82
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,992
They were both slaves
under your house, were they not?

83
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,411
Separated by a distance
of years.

84
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,454
They never have met
one another.

85
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,623
That we have knowledge of,

86
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,667
not that it is a thing
of matter now.

87
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,669
Gannicus now holds

88
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,714
my wife and unborn child!

89
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,882
lf she yet draws breath.

90
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,510
No, he would not have
risked all

91
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,722
to take her from the city
only to have her life.

92
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,516
She yet lives.

93
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,978
l feel her heart beating
as though it were my own.

94
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:57,648
Your men must scour the countryside
until she is found.

95
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,317
Such an area takes months to cover
with numbers at hand.

96
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,319
Then send message
to Rome for aid.

97
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:06,407
Word of this shall not spread
beyond these walls.

98
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,369
But llithyia--

99
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,247
Was snatched from grasp
of a praetor of Rome.

100
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:16,250
l will not have
the Senate whisper

101
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,961
of how l could not
protect my own wife.

102
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,338
A wise choice.

103
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,883
You must look
towards your future.

104
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,219
You talk of politics?

105
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,891
llithyia is valued friend
and wife.

106
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,895
She holds the blessing
of your child,

107
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,731
and with him slim tether
to Albinius's wealth,

108
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,733
one which will be severed
if she is not found.

109
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:44,236
Do not lecture on
what is at fucking risk!

110
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,489
Ashur: Praetor.

111
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,285
You have seen it done?

112
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,622
All trace of your wife's
misfortune has been erased.

113
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,249
No one will know of it.

114
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,585
Good.

115
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,378
Gather your men.

116
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,008
Seppia, l would have
a moment.

117
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,435
Ashur: l would not raise voice
in such manner with him again...

118
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,439
if you wish to keep purchase
in this world.

119
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,483
Absent llithyia's blessings,

120
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:26,237
it is a place that
l shall quickly tumble from.

121
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,618
l would never let you
fall so far, my love,

122
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:36,664
not while l yet
treasure your company.

123
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,932
Good.

124
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,976
Now keep eye on angle
of my shoulders.

125
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,978
lt will give clue
to my next--

126
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,704
You learn quickly.

127
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,956
l have advantage

128
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,792
of being taught by a god.

129
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,600
Again.

130
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,620
Oenomaus: Harudes,

131
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,081
you betray intent by bellowing
like a crazed goat.

132
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,380
( men laugh )

133
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,092
Nemetes, Saxa,
take position.

134
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,428
Are we to use wooden stick
in battle as well?

135
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,847
Close mouth
and heed Oenomaus.

136
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,808
l need no instruction.
l fucking know how to fight.

137
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,896
l instruct you not how to fight
but how to win,

138
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:27,524
so you do not find yourself again
enslaved by the Romans.

139
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,569
First position.

140
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,405
Attack!

141
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,450
Nemetes does hold argument,

142
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,370
towards lack of proper
weapons at least.

143
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,831
( crowd gasping, murmuring )

144
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,375
Fuck the gods.

145
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,921
You have taken Glaber's wife?

146
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,882
No. She has been delivered
into my hands.

147
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,926
And they will see her
to proper end.

148
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,262
Woman: Whore!
Beg for your life!

149
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,597
- ( crowd shouting )
Man: ...your fucking throat!

150
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,101
Woman: Whore!

151
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,228
( llithyia whimpering )

152
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,987
ls this our cause now--

153
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,698
falling upon a helpless woman
heavy with child?

154
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,534
Glaber held no pity
towards my wife--

155
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,577
a woman far more deserving
than the thing

156
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,288
that stands before you.

157
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,374
- ( crowd shouting )
- Man: Whore! Whore!

158
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,418
Man #2:
Fucking bitch.

159
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,477
Coin before cunt,
you worthless shit.

160
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,313
Now crawl from sight.

161
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,816
Man: Get up, you old cunt.
( laughing )

162
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,613
Linger yet a while,

163
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,657
my good man.

164
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,703
We'll have the pleasure
of your company.

165
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,497
What do you seek
of me now, Syrian?

166
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,791
Glaber: Gannicus.

167
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:13,047
A gladiator
of some renown in Capua.

168
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,009
He has been noted
to frequent

169
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,219
your establishment,
has he not,

170
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,013
partaking of wine
and whores?

171
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,848
Yes, Praetor.

172
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,683
l would have words
with the man.

173
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,352
He is not here.

174
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,482
Then there must be some
among you

175
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,400
who have had cause
to share drink

176
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,236
and other distractions
with him.

177
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,366
l would know
of what he spoke,

178
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,660
towards revelation
of where he secrets himself.

179
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,246
And l would hope
for another fucking drink

180
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,290
and a whore upon my cock.

181
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,795
( crowd murmuring )

182
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,468
Let me ask it of you again.

183
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:03,764
Who among you has spoken
with Gannicus?

184
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,607
Disappointing.

185
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,904
Wait. Wait.

186
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,949
l did see Gannicus
break words.

187
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,743
Who was privy to them?

188
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,538
My slave Marcia.

189
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,081
Where is she?

190
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,209
Your fucking Syrian
nailed her to a cross.

191
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:35,838
And l have yet to receive
fair compensation for loss incurred.

192
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,764
Gannicus has taken
something from me!

193
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:49,226
And l will see it returned.

194
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,576
Put all to question.

195
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,172
Please do not do this.

196
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,968
Were those same words
pleaded by my wife

197
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,971
before Roman blade
ripped her forever from my arms?

198
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,598
l did not know of her.

199
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,766
My hands are
unstained by the deed.

200
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,770
Your husband
cannot claim such.

201
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,482
He is the one
that condemned her to slavery.

202
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,358
She is gone from this world
because of it.

203
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,610
And l will have
equal vengeance.

204
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,778
You can not do this.
My child--

205
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,326
Sura and l often spoke
of children,

206
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,537
of the family
we would have,

207
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:54,333
now forever denied me,

208
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,752
as l now deny Glaber of his.

209
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,921
The child is yours.

210
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,014
You lie.

211
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,851
Would that my tongue
made false noise.

212
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,480
Yet it sounds bitter truth.

213
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:22,319
Monthly blood ceased after you
came to me in Batiatus's villa.

214
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,449
Lucretia had promised Crixus--

215
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,493
a cruel jest.

216
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,878
lt is a memory that lingers,
is it not--

217
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,589
of that night,

218
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,634
of you inside me?

219
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,483
Yes,

220
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:05,445
as does memory
of my hands upon your throat.

221
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,662
Then see to completion
what they began.

222
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:18,125
Take my life,
and that of your child.

223
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,919
And may your wife turn from you
for what you have done,

224
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,879
when she greets you
in the afterlife.

225
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,963
Oenomaus does not seem lifted
by your return.

226
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:08,216
l did not think
to be embraced as brother.

227
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,803
Nor l, or to lay eyes upon you
again in this life.

228
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,930
Yet here you stand.

229
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,142
Would that all things were
so easily done.

230
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,355
l have seen the bond
between you.

231
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,649
Whatever the cause
for disagreement,

232
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,609
it will pass.

233
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,737
l would do anything
to rise in his eyes again.

234
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,239
Capturing the praetor's bitch
is a fine start.

235
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,076
( both chuckle )

236
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,827
An impressive act,

237
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,664
sure to further ignite
our cause.

238
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,378
l seek only to end it.

239
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,385
lt is done then?

240
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,888
She yet lives.

241
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,018
l brand myself
fucking enemy of Rome

242
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,187
to deliver her to your hands,

243
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,940
only to find them
weak and trembling?

244
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,027
l am not Glaber,

245
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,946
able to strike a woman down

246
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:13,073
for his crimes
absent misgivings.

247
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:16,660
And what of the women crucified
in the streets of Capua,

248
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:19,496
tortured to death because
they dare whisper your name,

249
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:22,624
eyes bright with thoughts

250
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,544
of freedom and rebellion?

251
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,214
Take her life
and end this now...

252
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:34,219
or see countless more fall
in the name of your cause.

253
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,852
Lucretia: Prayer alone
will not provide guidance

254
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,729
through these dark times.

255
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,272
We must look inward

256
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,482
and find strength
in heart's resolve.

257
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,987
So the gods turn from you,
as they do from llithyia?

258
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,198
They are always with us,

259
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:59,327
their will felt
in every breath,

260
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,872
and every touch.

261
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,251
They guide our hands,

262
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:10,422
compelling us
toward proper course.

263
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,716
Gaius will be pleased
to hear of it.

264
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,510
lt is not Gaius

265
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,388
who holds the key
to llithyia's salvation.

266
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,641
l fear the gods
have led you far astray then.

267
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,185
l command no army,

268
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,645
nor can l conjure
Gannicus before us.

269
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,397
Yet message from you

270
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,983
would bring Varinius from Rome,
and with him--

271
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,943
Gaius was clear
on the matter.

272
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,196
We are to tell no one
of what has happened.

273
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,698
Words born of desperation.

274
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,993
He talks of shoring name

275
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:43,455
while life's foundation
crumbles beneath his feet.

276
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:49,503
Seppia.

277
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,339
You sought Praetor Varinius's
affections once.

278
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:55,967
Send message
and you could yet gain them.

279
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,929
Whims of a child.

280
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,722
Such thoughts
have been set aside

281
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,100
in favor of mature pursuits.

282
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,313
The day has been long.

283
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,524
l will see you
beneath the covers.

284
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,485
We will revisit the subject
with the morning sun.

285
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,821
Apologies.
l am not yet for bed.

286
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,573
l would check upon Gaius
and offer words of comfort.

287
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,494
Are words
all that you would offer?

288
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,331
l am his guest in this house
and wish only to pay tribute

289
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,750
to generous host.

290
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:32,170
lt's beneath you, Seppia.

291
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,130
The gods shall take ill notice.

292
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,008
Was it not their hands that saw
my brother struck from my side,

293
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,177
their providence
that sheltered me

294
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,804
beneath this very roof?

295
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,889
Do you not see it?

296
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:46,268
The gods have lead me
upon path to Gaius,

297
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,729
as their will has removed
llithyia from it.

298
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,951
A quivering woman,

299
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,036
and with child--

300
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,247
she does not appear
the deadly serpent

301
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,499
you give voice to.

302
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,961
She is wife of the fuck
that would see us all to grave.

303
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,671
Yet not the man himself.

304
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,301
Crixus speaks of how she took
Acer's life

305
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,220
as fucking amusement
of celebration.

306
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,892
Her heart is as venomous
as Glaber's or any other Roman shit's.

307
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,437
A familiar song
bleated from your fucking tongue.

308
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,314
You know my meaning,
Lucius.

309
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,566
And mostly share
in its low estimation.

310
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,485
Yet l would hold ourselves
to higher standard.

311
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:41,239
Food for deadly prisoner.

312
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,491
Shall l draw her
a warm bath as well?

313
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,578
Consider meal for the child,

314
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,623
unless you fear it shall
take up sword against you

315
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,125
- from fucking womb.
- ( Nasir chuckles )

316
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,294
( Nasir clears throat )

317
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,264
Faded years
soften wounded heart.

318
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,523
( gasps )

319
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,276
Calm yourself.

320
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,695
l intend no harm.

321
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,119
You are the one
that came to aid

322
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,080
when those animals

323
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,748
turned upon me
when l was brought in.

324
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,376
Do not clutch me to breast.

325
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:38,505
l shit with the rest
of those animals.

326
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:41,383
For child.

327
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,267
At least you will not die
of hunger.

328
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:01,194
You bear no brand.

329
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:04,114
You are a free man?

330
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,450
l am of the Republic,
as you and yours.

331
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,954
Yet you stand
with Spartacus against it?

332
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,706
l stand for what is just.

333
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,499
Just?

334
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:18,003
Spartacus moves to destroy
everything we hold of worth.

335
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,964
Then he moves too late
in my regard.

336
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:25,051
Sulla seized my lands
and those of my kin years ago,

337
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,345
slaughtering
any who resisted

338
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,597
and giving
what he stole as gifts

339
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,266
to his most loyal of men,

340
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:34,978
all of them fellow Romans.

341
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:40,358
Such a loss must weigh heavy
in the passing of years.

342
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,361
( men chattering )

343
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,493
l would see burden lifted.

344
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:53,079
( laughs )

345
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:56,249
And l mistake you for helpless,

346
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,543
yet you have power
to reverse the sun

347
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,046
and see past reformed?

348
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,506
My husband
is a praetor of Rome

349
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,508
and l of importance to him,

350
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,427
being prized daughter
of my clan,

351
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:10,555
my child heir to its lineage
and fortune.

352
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:14,350
Save vaunted words
for grander ear.

353
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,354
( quietly )
l cannot free you.

354
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,775
We would both be absent fucking head
before three steps could be taken.

355
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:25,403
No, l do not ask such a thing,
only that you carry message

356
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,364
imparting where
Spartacus holds me.

357
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:33,912
You do not have to
live this way.

358
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,374
All that was taken from you
can yet be restored

359
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,711
with but simple command
from my husband.

360
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,299
The sum of my loss

361
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,052
is no small thing.

362
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,595
He can see it paid,

363
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,014
your life returned to you

364
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:56,267
in exchange for mine

365
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,812
and the child l carry.

366
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,110
Mira:
She claims it yours?

367
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,612
With passion of certainty.

368
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:12,450
She is a deceitful
fucking snake,

369
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,120
truth split
by forked tongue.

370
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,789
Her words
may hold such in this.

371
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,627
Do you recall the night
in Batiatus's villa

372
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,379
when you aided in
transforming likeness

373
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,131
into golden Apollo?

374
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,591
To lay with
the Roman woman Licinia.

375
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,301
She wore
the mask of Diana.

376
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,433
Yet beneath
it was not Licinia.

377
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,480
llithyia?

378
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,816
Why did you not
tell me?

379
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,527
What purpose
would it have held?

380
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,365
None.

381
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:55,493
Nor should it hold
any for you now.

382
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,537
Even if true,

383
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,581
she tells you
only to stay your hand.

384
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,708
She's a fool,

385
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:05,879
knowing she carries heritage
forever denied my own wife.

386
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,182
See llithyia to her grave...

387
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:21,352
and tortured past
buried beside her.

388
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,899
To make Glaber suffer
as l have at his hand

389
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:29,694
is a thing l have craved
more than air and breath.

390
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:34,365
Yet in inflicting equal wound,

391
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,827
how do l not become
as the man himself...

392
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,999
a man my wife
would turn from?

393
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,305
l was not certain
you would desire this.

394
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:41,724
What man could not?

395
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,853
lt is not the offering
that gave concern,

396
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:49,774
rather your preoccupation
with unfortunate events.

397
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:53,444
The fate of my heir
does weigh mind.

398
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,447
And that of your wife's?

399
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,492
A thing of lesser notice.

400
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,371
ls the bond of marriage
really such a cold affair?

401
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,791
There was a time

402
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,502
the love between us
burned hot,

403
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,796
bright as noonday sun.

404
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,966
But day has turned to night...

405
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:20,263
casting golden memories
to shadow.

406
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,643
l would have you bask
in the light,

407
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,812
as a man of your worth
deserves.

408
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:34,319
Albinius did not hold me
to such esteem,

409
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,821
nor the rest of the Senate.

410
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:42,201
Gaze into their eyes
when you present Spartacus's head

411
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,537
and see estimation soar...

412
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,793
and my brother avenged.

413
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,593
Would that his death

414
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:01,512
did not pain you so.

415
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,433
The sting lessens
with each passing day

416
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,560
because of you.

417
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,729
And l would return favor

418
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:12,523
if your wife falls
prey to Spartacus,

419
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,401
as my brother fell.

420
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:43,346
Your chest overflows
with coin and blood.

421
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,974
Both well earned
by day's exertion.

422
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,561
What news of llithyia
did labors bring?

423
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,482
You have the praetor's ear.

424
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,234
Did he not already
fill yours?

425
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,736
His attentions
toward young Seppia

426
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,530
prevent me
from breaking words.

427
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,868
Ah...

428
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,496
the freshness of youth.

429
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:15,086
ls it a wonder he favors
the caress of her tongue

430
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,213
to the sound of yours?

431
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:20,383
Her bloom will wither
when llithyia returns.

432
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:24,095
You place great stock
upon uncertain future.

433
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,764
You have not found path
to Gannicus?

434
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,766
Sadly, it remains obscured,

435
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,727
though not through lack
of noble effort.

436
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,396
Where?

437
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:45,283
From there we moved
from place to place...

438
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:53,458
questioning with fist
and blade...

439
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:05,470
the answer always the same.

440
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,389
l will make sacrifice
to the gods

441
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,934
and entreat them
for more valued response.

442
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,689
Let us pray together

443
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:19,859
and seek divinity
in warm embrace.

444
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:23,779
llithyia and the child she carries
must be found.

445
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,365
- lf they are lost--
- What? Hmm?

446
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,494
Will the sun no longer move
across the sky?

447
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:33,164
Will ivory moon plummet
into frothing sea?

448
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,333
Strike the bitch
from fucking thought,

449
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,168
as Glaber
has already done--

450
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,519
l am not your slave
to lay fucking hand upon--

451
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,687
a lesson l had thought
already learned.

452
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,523
Apologies.

453
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:03,194
l question
sincerity of the word.

454
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,404
Speak it again.

455
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,699
Apologies.

456
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,953
- Again.
- Apologies. ( whimpering )

457
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,038
Your position in this house
continues to spiral.

458
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:17,166
Soon l will be all that stands

459
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,585
between you and dark abyss.

460
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,173
When that day arrives,

461
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:27,510
you shall greet
my breath upon your neck

462
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:29,971
as precious gift.

463
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,644
Do you understand this,
my love?

464
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,564
Yes.

465
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,066
A gift from the gods.

466
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,574
( thunder crashing )

467
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,270
Lucius.

468
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,314
Where do you go?

469
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,108
To clear troubled mind.

470
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,359
l would have the same.

471
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,778
Let us walk together for a moment
and break words.

472
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,880
The man unleashes wrath
upon wooden form

473
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:47,715
when l have risked all
for him

474
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,301
to seize vengeance
and end this.

475
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:54,847
You take risk only to lighten
weighted conscience.

476
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,934
l would not see more fall
to foolish cause.

477
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:02,021
And l would not
see my brother fall.

478
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,401
We no longer stand as such.

479
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,905
ls there no path
towards mended bond?

480
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:13,324
You cannot mend illusion.

481
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,825
Our brotherhood,

482
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,662
the trust l placed upon you--

483
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:21,332
a thing of lies and deceit.

484
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,459
Do you not think
a day passes

485
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,670
that l am not
consumed by it?

486
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:31,217
l would give my life
for Melitta to yet own hers.

487
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:32,885
And l would gladly take it.

488
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:35,846
Then what stays hand?

489
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,766
Do you and Spartacus
straddle same uncertain ground,

490
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,936
unable to take vengeance
when it is placed before you?

491
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:48,234
Your death would not
see her again to my arms.

492
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:51,112
lt would only serve as mercy,

493
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,198
releasing you
from what you have done.

494
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,410
Then l stand condemned

495
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,829
till the afterlife takes me.

496
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:07,002
You stand for nothing,

497
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,839
as you always have.

498
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,226
We must wait till Spartacus
relieves us of charge.

499
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,728
Time passes too slowly.

500
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,896
We must be quick then.

501
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:41,620
This is how you stand guard?

502
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,832
Apologies. We were--

503
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,542
Agron: Uh, we were--
we were--

504
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,669
- We--
- We were just-- we--

505
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,588
( both laugh )

506
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,590
Take to your bed.

507
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,842
l will assume watch
over llithyia.

508
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,935
- Gratitude.
- ( chuckles )

509
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,621
Please,

510
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,456
l would have more water.

511
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:29,168
lt is a terrible thing,
is it not,

512
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,462
to live in want and fear?

513
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,592
That is what it is
to be a slave.

514
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,844
Please,

515
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,971
for my child.

516
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,732
ls it true

517
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,609
what you told Spartacus?

518
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:57,321
l swear to the gods.

519
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,907
lf Spartacus takes my life,

520
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,660
the blood of his child
will forever stain his own.

521
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:06,205
He is a good man.

522
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,215
l will not let him
be destroyed by this.

523
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,635
l will not let him kill you.

524
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:22,096
You will help me?

525
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,476
Yes, l will help you

526
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,895
from this fucking world.

527
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,789
Have you lost mind?

528
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,337
l move only to spare you
from what must be done.

529
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:58,257
lf you take her life,
the deed will weigh every breath.

530
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:00,009
So you remove choice

531
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,219
and invite such fate
upon yourself?

532
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,724
l would embrace it, to see your heart
spared from the act.

533
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:09,810
You do not know my heart.

534
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,732
Spartacus.

535
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,692
Leave us.

536
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,246
l would have words now...

537
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,918
and see your time here
at an end.

538
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:02,738
You glow
like the morning sun.

539
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,240
You must have slept well.

540
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,534
Hardly at all.

541
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,954
lt's an unfortunate thing.

542
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,289
l would not deem it so.

543
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,753
l fear you shall.

544
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,007
Out.

545
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:29,556
l will not have you threaten
in such a manner.

546
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,059
l do not move to threats,

547
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:35,562
only to warning about the man
you turn affections towards.

548
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,607
Your words will not
turn me from him.

549
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:40,943
The time for them
has passed.

550
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,154
Come.

551
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,658
l have something more
tangible to show you.

552
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,159
Where is the praetor?

553
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,995
ln his chambers.

554
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,288
Lucretia:
What's happened?

555
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,958
A man comes with news
of llithyia.

556
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,675
You claim to have knowledge
of my wife?

557
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:07,720
More than claim.

558
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,847
She is being held
by Spartacus.

559
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,641
- She lives?
- For the moment.

560
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,226
How do you know this?

561
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:16,311
l have just traveled
from the rebel's camp.

562
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,273
You stand
as one of his men?

563
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:22,151
l am no fugitivus,

564
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:25,571
just a tired old man
seeking what little peace he can

565
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,990
before falling
to eternal slumber.

566
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:31,285
Well, tell me
where she's being held

567
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:33,370
and you will be seen
to great reward.

568
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:37,041
Your wife boasted
of your generosity

569
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,126
and promised
the return of my lands

570
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:42,546
seized by the bastard Sulla.
ls such a thing possible?

571
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,382
lt is within my power.

572
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:50,220
And what of my own wife,

573
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,514
my children,

574
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,224
my brothers and sisters,

575
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,602
all slaughtered
in the name of Rome?

576
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,229
ls it within your power
to return them to me too,

577
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,731
you fucking cunt?

578
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:04,985
Lay a hand on me
and your wife dies.

579
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:11,784
lf l do not return
within reasonable hour,

580
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,036
she dies.

581
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:16,205
Any attempts to follow me--

582
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,084
she dies.

583
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:26,256
What would Spartacus
have of me?

584
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,591
Gaius.

585
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,177
Speak.

586
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,181
You are to enter
the city of Atella on foot,

587
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,558
just before rise
of morning sun,

588
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,936
three of your men
allowed by your side,

589
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,771
Spartacus to hold the same.

590
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,106
And llithyia?

591
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,608
She will be returned
to you afterwards

592
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:48,153
in exchange
for a single wagon

593
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,739
heavily weighted
with armor and weapons.

594
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,534
Give arms
to the enemies of Rome?

595
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,286
That is his price.

596
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,956
And if your troops are seen
on the road to Atella,

597
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:00,749
Spartacus will not appear

598
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:03,127
and your wife
and the child she carries

599
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,296
will be lost to you forever.

600
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:16,390
Did l mention the part
about laying hands upon me?

601
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:20,352
Let him pass.

602
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,073
l do not trust this.

603
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,658
Nor l.

604
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,785
Yet action must be taken.

605
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,662
Prepare a wagon.

606
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,165
Praetor, we can not aid them

607
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,001
with means to forge
further war upon us.

608
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:46,837
What choice
has Spartacus left?

609
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,381
There are always choices.

610
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:53,010
No.

611
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:56,180
Spartacus leaves but one path

612
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,891
and l must travel upon it.

613
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,857
l am old but not a fool.

614
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,943
lt was much to ask--
entering the lair of the beast.

615
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:11,695
Oh, it was
a great pleasure

616
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,697
to piss in the face
of a fucking praetor.

617
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,866
Spartacus.

618
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,410
Glaber agrees to the terms?

619
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:22,039
l am for Atella,
to see it done.

620
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:23,582
Yeah!

621
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,835
Let us take his weapons
and his fucking life!

622
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,421
- Yeah!
- No.

623
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:32,049
lf we do not honor word,
we prove ourselves

624
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:35,469
no better than the Romans.
We shall hold to it.

625
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,058
lf three are all
that can be seen with you,

626
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,143
l would count myself
among them.

627
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:45,854
As would l,
despite the company.

628
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,732
l would join as well.

629
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,610
l would welcome no one
as warmly,

630
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:54,571
yet you have not healed
from ordeal in the arena.

631
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,740
l would stand in his place.

632
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:00,244
For a cause
you do not believe in?

633
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,829
Oenomaus believes in it.

634
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,415
Perhaps one day l shall too.

635
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,712
Return with proper weapons

636
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,422
and your lives.

637
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,094
lt is madness to place trust
in the words of Glaber.

638
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:22,599
l do not place it with him.

639
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,394
l place it with all those
l take with me.

640
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:31,066
We will see this done
together

641
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:33,402
and gain means
to strike Glaber

642
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,779
and his army
from this world!

643
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,448
( crowd cheers )

644
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,121
( clucking )

645
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,891
Spartacus!

646
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,169
The old man claims
you have my wife.

647
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:38,383
Cut from her dress,

648
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:41,178
her scent yet upon it.

649
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:56,234
A thing easily taken
from a body robbed of life.

650
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,904
My thoughts turned
toward such a thing--

651
00:44:59,072 --> 00:45:02,866
blade parting flesh,

652
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,994
her blood upon the ground,

653
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:09,456
as my wife's blood
was spilled.

654
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,252
Yet you do not claim
her life.

655
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,171
l am not you.

656
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:18,632
l will not strike down
a woman

657
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,885
for the foolish acts
of her husband.

658
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:26,515
You carved my name
into a dead man's chest,

659
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:29,768
make attempt against my life
in the streets of Capua

660
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:32,229
and then again
in the arena,

661
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:35,440
yet you turn from
most assured opportunity

662
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,067
to balance debt
between us.

663
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,444
l turn from nothing.

664
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:42,864
One day soon
l will have your life.

665
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:47,911
Bring the wagon forward.

666
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:53,375
l hold many regrets

667
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:58,046
since first we laid eyes
on each other a lifetime ago.

668
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:03,718
l pray this decision
does not stand amongst them.

669
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:15,230
You will hold your wife again.

670
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:17,315
And she will deliver you
an heir.

671
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,193
Yet when you gaze
into the child's eyes,

672
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:24,281
l will forever be
reflected there...

673
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:31,455


674
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,000
l fear you are right.

675
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:37,836
You are not like me.

676
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:41,214
Your wife was the heart

677
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:43,091
that beats within your breast.

678
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:46,261
You would have given all
to see her live...

679
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:52,100
while l would do the same

680
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:53,852
to see you dead.

681
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,032
Kill them!

682
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,388
Now!

683
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:25,443
Take cover!

684
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,326
Glaber: Salvius!

685
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:34,786
Give call!

686
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:38,290
( blowing loudly )

687
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,709
( several horns answering )

688
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,754
( several horns playing )

689
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,827
Spartacus:
Fall back.

690
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:27,005
You waited long enough
to give signal.

691
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:29,007
Spartacus:
l cling to honor ignored.

692
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:30,467
Quickly, before
they recover.

693
00:49:32,345 --> 00:49:34,888
Take to foot.
l would stay awhile.

694
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:37,015
Spartacus: Lucius.

695
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:41,478
Lucius: Go,
before l come to fucking sense.

696
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,002
At least it's not a fucking Roman
that takes--

697
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,719
Man: Do not let them
reach the woods!

698
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:16,721
Go! Go!

699
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,356
You never intended
to make trade?

700
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:29,651
l intended to send
Spartacus to his death--

701
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:32,153
deserved fate he yet evades

702
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:34,406
through treachery and deceit.

703
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,199
You will have him
soon enough.

704
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,909
At price of wife,

705
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:39,994
and the blessing
she carries.

706
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,539
l would gladly pay
the sum of the world

707
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:44,874
to have his throat
beneath my heel.

708
00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:48,920
llithyia must return
to this house.

709
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,547
The gods have--

710
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:51,756
( glass crashes )

711
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:53,883
The gods can descend
from their fucking heavens

712
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,802
if they wish
to see her live!

713
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:03,268
ln coming days l shall grieve

714
00:51:03,436 --> 00:51:05,186
the loss of wife and child

715
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:08,273
and the fortunes
carried upon her family name.

716
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:10,942
And we shall grieve
with you.

717
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:19,075
l would see myself to bath

718
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:22,412
and blood and troubled thoughts
of moment washed away.

719
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,707
Go. l will bring more wine
to aid endeavor.

720
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:42,849
( humming a tune )

721
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,856
Do you know
what he's done?

722
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:53,818
What he felt he must,
to see an end to Spartacus.

723
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:56,988
He has pulled the world
to ruin,

724
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:59,407
and with it
reason for living.

725
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:01,159
Your reason perhaps.

726
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:03,411
My heart yet beats.

727
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:05,246
And what of
your brother's?

728
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:08,666
Gaius moves
to avenge his death.

729
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:12,629
Then he should turn wrath
upon himself...

730
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:15,590
and see it done.

731
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:26,142
lt's your brother's, is it not?

732
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,770
l had thought his slaves
took it with his life.

733
00:52:28,938 --> 00:52:32,440
They stand blemished
by neither offense.

734
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:35,026
How did you come by this?

735
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:39,531
The gods
led me to the truth,

736
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,700
hidden amongst
Ashur's treasures,

737
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,577
stripped from the bodies
of those

738
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,746
who have died at his hand.

739
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,122
Ashur?

740
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,707
He must have been there
that night,

741
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,377
when your brother fell.

742
00:52:52,545 --> 00:52:54,671
Yet the villain moves
only upon command

743
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:58,842
of Gaius Claudius Glaber.

744
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,395
Glaber:
Much has been lost--

745
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:13,273
the ones we have loved,

746
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,485
the ones we thought
would forever be at our side.

747
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,281
But in their passing,

748
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,950
the chains that bound us
to desires not our own

749
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:26,411
have been struck.

750
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:29,539
And without such a blow,

751
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:32,083
we would not find ourselves

752
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:34,627
in each other's arms.

753
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:38,590
No.

754
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,842
We would not.

755
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,806
( llithyia whimpering )

756
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:51,102
Kneel.

757
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:55,148
Please.

758
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,403
Do you know what it is

759
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,989
to love,

760
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:06,993
to be filled
with light and hope,

761
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:10,955
to see that blessing
returned in kind

762
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:13,833
in the eyes of the only one

763
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,878
that could ever know
the true depth of your heart?

764
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:36,272
That is what your husband
took from me.

765
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:46,824
l would take the same
from him.

766
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:51,245
Yet...

767
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:54,415
he chose vengeance against me
over your life.

768
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,008
Taking it would balance nothing.

769
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:11,808
He does not love you

770
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:14,352
as l loved my wife.

771
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:25,863
You let me live?

772
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:31,327
Do not think it a kindness.

773
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:43,006
( sobs )

774
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,884
( theme music playing )

774
00:55:49,842 --> 00:56:46,884

1
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:07,256
Gannicus:
See end to vengeance.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,093
Take the life of Glaber's woman
as he took the life of yours.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,637
The child is yours!

4
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:15,765
Lucretia: You sought Praetor
Varinius' affections once.

5
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,601
Send message,
and you could yet gain them.

6
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:19,894
Do you not see it?

7
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,772
The gods have lead me
upon path to Gaius,

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,441
as their will
has removed llithyia from it.

9
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,360
Have you lost mind?

10
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,112
Lucretia:
lt's your brother's, is it not?

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,073
- How did you come by this?
- Hidden amongst Ashur's treasures.

12
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,284
Yet the villain
moves only upon command

13
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:39,122
of Gaius Claudius Glaber.

14
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,581
Crixus:
Glaber agrees to terms.

15
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,710
Spartacus:
l am for Atella. To see it done.

16
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,629
He chose vengeance against me
over your life.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,132
You let me live?

18
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,885
Do not think it a kindness.

19
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,599
( theme music playing )

20
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,650
( liquid splashing )

21
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,988
( sighs )

22
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:15,658
( blow strikes )

23
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,123
Lugo...

24
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,333
open fucking eyes.

25
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,127
To see what?

26
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:30,047
Wake when trees attack,
little man.

27
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,138
- ( grunts )
- ( grunts )

28
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:06,000
- Romans!
- Fucking Romans! Move!

29
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:08,211
- ( overlapping clamor )
- We're under attack!

30
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,225
My sword!

31
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,396
Enough!

32
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,023
( all gasping )

33
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,525
( woman speaks )

34
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,026
Stand down!

35
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:35,154
( man speaking )

36
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,871
Agron:
This was but fucking test?

37
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,540
lf it had not been,

38
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,167
you would all
be for the afterlife.

39
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:53,256
We will not be taken
unaware next time.

40
00:02:56,385 --> 00:03:00,721
l would see words
forged into action.

41
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,725
Rise, and take morning meal.

42
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,563
The day ahead of us
will be long.

43
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,964
lt causes worry

44
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:38,301
to stir and find you
gone from our bed.

45
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,220
l could not remain there.

46
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:46,142
The mind churns with thoughts
of those taken too soon from us

47
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,645
and the monsters who tore them
from loving embrace.

48
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,324
We have both suffered
immeasurable loss.

49
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:06,704
We must take comforts
from what we have found...

50
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,665
...in each other.

51
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:15,296
l have moved foolishly
and with regret

52
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:16,797
that l have denied
you opportunity

53
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,466
to properly
mourn your wife.

54
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,804
She is but fleeting memory...

55
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,476
one that shall fade...

56
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:34,523
as the night mist caressed
by morning sun.

57
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,582
( gasps )

58
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,167
llithyia.

59
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,102
( rushing water echoes )

60
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,484
( soft distorted speaking )

61
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,739
She lives.

62
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,242
She will survive it.

63
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,748
What of the child?

64
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,209
lt yet moves within her.

65
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,253
- ( normal sound resumes)
- She wakes.

66
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,592
Out.

67
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:49,890
Are you of this world?

68
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,435
Take hand...

69
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,771
and know that l am flesh.

70
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,690
Leave us.

71
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,279
l thought you
gone from this world.

72
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,531
As did l.

73
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,117
Yet the gods have seen me
returned to your arms.

74
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,119
lt is a blessing.

75
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,413
One shared by our child.

76
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,794
The warmth
of the life inside me,

77
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,630
it gave strength and comfort

78
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,299
when all seemed lost.

79
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,094
How did you escape?

80
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,346
l could not.

81
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,098
He let me go.

82
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,266
Spartacus released you?

83
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,186
He said that taking my life

84
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,104
would have no meaning.

85
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,647
And where were you held?

86
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,067
l do not know.

87
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,235
l was bound
and stripped of sight.

88
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,030
How did Gannicus
carry you to him?

89
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,115
By horse for part of a day.

90
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,368
By foot through woods
for hours more.

91
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,828
And you saw nothing
of their camp?

92
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,830
Only the dank hole
they kept me.

93
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,833
Dug into the earth
Or made of stone and wood?

94
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,752
What does it fucking matter?

95
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,839
lt was made of stone,

96
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,841
with beams of wood,

97
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,427
scribblings carved
into the rock.

98
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,513
- What did they say?
- l do not know.

99
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,848
They were faded
and broken.

100
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,433
ln what tongue
were they etched?

101
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,644
They appeared Greek.

102
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,858
Why am l not
in our bedchambers?

103
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,444
- llithyia--
- l thought it a dream.

104
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,660
Seppia in your arms?

105
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,537
Your hands upon her?

106
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,790
Spartacus was right.

107
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,460
My death would not
have held meaning.

108
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,550
You do not love me.

109
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,803
And you greet this
as revelation?

110
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,559
Time and again,
you tore my heart from my chest.

111
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,896
ls it a wonder it now
stands empty in your regard?

112
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,404
ls there nothing left
between us?

113
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,200
l once asked the same of you.

114
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,203
Do you recall your reply?

115
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,748
Have l not suffered
enough for it?

116
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,877
l would have life as it was,

117
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,588
with my husband beside me.

118
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,756
The man you speak of
no longer exists.

119
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,968
Then what stands before me

120
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,888
assuming his manner and form?

121
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,056
A monster...

122
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,603
rough-hewn
by unfortunate events...

123
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,523
and given breath
by necessity.

124
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,533
( overlapping clamoring )

125
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,453
We cannot defend the temple

126
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,163
if we are at odds
with one another.

127
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:00,956
Give Lugo a warrior
to share watch,

128
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,584
not little man
with little balls.

129
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,252
My balls did not allow breach.

130
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,589
Your eyes were closed
in pursuit of dreams.

131
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:09,882
You fell to slumber?

132
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,634
And you blame Nasir,
you lazy shit?

133
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,677
Turn effort
from defending your boy,

134
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:14,970
and look upon
your own failings.

135
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,347
Then let us relive the moment

136
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,514
and see different
fucking result.

137
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,600
The Romans will come.

138
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:20,976
( growls )

139
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,188
And if they find us divided,

140
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:25,940
we will fall before them.

141
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,525
- Words of meaning.
- She speaks the truth.

142
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,818
What would you have us do?

143
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,487
Try not to get
your head fucking bashed.

144
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,489
Bold words from one
who tumbled so quickly.

145
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,157
l was absent fucking sword!

146
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,701
Why does little man
have sword, and not Lugo?

147
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,328
We cannot face the Romans
with fucking sticks.

148
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,288
Then l will teach you the bow.

149
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,794
- ( laughter )
- We are from east of the Rhine.

150
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:50,130
- We fight with fucking steel.
- We must use what we have.

151
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,223
She asks why
you let llithyia go

152
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:00,849
when Glaber did not
trade weapons as promised.

153
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,643
A thing l have also wondered.

154
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:12,194
Taking her life would not
have gained us what we need.

155
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,364
lt would only have served
misplaced vengeance.

156
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,075
We are better than this.

157
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,536
We are better than the Romans.

158
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,246
Oenomaus,

159
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:25,165
Gannicus, see everyone
to guarded position.

160
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,543
We will train against assault
by light of day

161
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,546
and attempt to elevate
night's low defeat.

162
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,381
Let us see it done.

163
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:33,882
l have no need of aid.

164
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,926
Lugo, Nasir,

165
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,386
take position upon wall.

166
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,888
Donar, Nemetes,

167
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,225
Lydon, Saxa, fall to my side!

168
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:49,523
l fear result will be the same
in light of day.

169
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,400
We are not a fist,

170
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:55,070
but fingers twitching
absent single purpose.

171
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,655
Oenomaus:
Lugo, form one.

172
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,116
- My words crash upon ear...
- Begin.

173
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,576
...but fail to pierce heart.

174
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,745
Then we must stab deeper.

175
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,248
Perhaps punishment

176
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,625
for those who fail
in the day's training?

177
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,085
You cannot forge
trust and loyalty

178
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,129
at the ends of a whip,
as the Romans believe.

179
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,256
Then what would you use?

180
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,426
Soft kisses
and whispers of love?

181
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,349
Gather Fulco and Harudes.

182
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,267
There is a thing
l would have you do.

183
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,394
What are your thoughts?

184
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,108
To see fingers
joined in single purpose.

185
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,110
( laughs )

186
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,497
lt is a thing of much regret.

187
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,421
Lucius is no longer among us.

188
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,799
A loss keenly felt.

189
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,308
Yet we must move
from wounded heart,

190
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,769
turn towards
what must be done.

191
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,313
l would have
you train more archers,

192
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,482
as you suggested.

193
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,235
ls that all
you would have from me?

194
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,491
Gather your bow.

195
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,495
You have not slept by my side.

196
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,832
You do not speak,
unless to give order.

197
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,625
How long do you seek
to punish me?

198
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,627
lt is not my intent.

199
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:37,047
Yet result stands the same.

200
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,466
- You turn from me.
- You turned from yourself

201
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,844
when you made attempt
upon llithyia,

202
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,096
an act that would have
stained you forever.

203
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,682
l thought only to save you
from the same.

204
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,976
You thought to save
what we had.

205
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,646
Had?

206
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,194
Can you no longer
find comfort in my arms?

207
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,738
Can you find such in mine?

208
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,407
Yes...

209
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,995
if you would but give me
more of your heart.

210
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,046
l have given all that remains.

211
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,553
lt is not enough.

212
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,139
No.

213
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,725
lt is not.

214
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,695
l felt it

215
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,697
since the very start,

216
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,949
an absence in your touch,

217
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,910
no matter how warm,

218
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,245
an emptiness.

219
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,124
l turned from it,

220
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,877
certain one day
l would be able to fill it.

221
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:01,340
The gods themselves
would fail such effort.

222
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,594
Will it move you...

223
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,848
one day when you see me
in the arms of another?

224
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,393
l will know the sting of it...

225
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:19,316
yet l pray
you find in them...

226
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,029
what you could not
find in mine.

227
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,379
Let us see to training

228
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,297
and what must be done.

229
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,862
Spartacus' voice:
He does not love you.

230
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,491
- llithyia's voice: You let me live?
- Do not think it a kindness.

231
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,160
llithyia?

232
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,585
( sobs )

233
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,173
The gods have heard my prayers

234
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,176
to return you to my arms.

235
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,262
You alone offer such embrace.

236
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,182
l have not taken food nor rest
since you were torn from them.

237
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,892
Nor would l have,

238
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,228
until l had followed you
to suspected fate.

239
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:41,023
Would that all
held me as close to heart.

240
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,191
Well, you're the reason
that mine still beats,

241
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,528
you and the blessing you carry.

242
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,407
l have never
considered it as such.

243
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,202
Yet in that final moment,

244
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,204
when l thought life
was forfeit,

245
00:15:56,372 --> 00:16:00,834
l felt a great sadness,

246
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,544
not for myself,

247
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,880
but for innocent child,

248
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,883
doomed to suffer
for the mistakes of the mother.

249
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:12,179
We have both made many.

250
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,518
The child is Spartacus'.

251
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,024
He gave seed

252
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,860
the night you maneuvered me
into laying with him.

253
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,403
llithyia--

254
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,822
l no longer
lay blame at your feet.

255
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,868
lt was my hands that forced you
to seek vengeance,

256
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:38,413
my choices
that have cast me adrift...

257
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,793
clinging to a woman
l once hated

258
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,255
and a child l unreasonably
grow to love.

259
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:53,011
To feel such hope and such joy
blossoming within you,

260
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,847
that's the rarest
of all flowers,

261
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,933
regardless of why it blooms.

262
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,602
( footsteps )

263
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,938
Apologies, l--

264
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,315
l did not know you were--

265
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,359
Apologies.

266
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,657
She moves to assume
my place at Gaius' side.

267
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,413
One day, she will see him
for what he truly is.

268
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,790
Oh, her eyes
have already been opened.

269
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:27,212
Seppius was not murdered
by his slaves,

270
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,297
but by your husband.

271
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,133
Gaius?

272
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,634
A thing which l discovered

273
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,387
through most unfortunate manner

274
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,973
and shared only with Seppia.

275
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:42,018
Yet she stays
within this house...

276
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:46,148
body offered to the man
that so wounded her?

277
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,317
To leave now would only serve
to arouse suspicion.

278
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,823
Yet she burns with thoughts
of avenging her brother.

279
00:17:56,325 --> 00:18:00,287
l would see such embers
given breath...

280
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,332
and in resulting flames...

281
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,879
my child and l

282
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,883
to rise from the ashes
of ill-fated past.

283
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,218
They traveled by horse,

284
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:18,263
then on foot through forest
for several hours,

285
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,808
yet she does not know
what direction she traveled in.

286
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,018
Man:
Open the gates!

287
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:26,062
Spartacus has attacked
the mine of Lucania here,

288
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,898
the arena in Capua,

289
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,858
port of Neapolis,

290
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:33,612
and attempted to make trade
in Atella.

291
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,156
The curve
would suggest they move

292
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:39,201
outward from a central position,
this region.

293
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,036
Yet a vast area.

294
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,915
Did she mention anything more

295
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,751
that may be of use?

296
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,378
Only that she was kept
beneath ground

297
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,089
in a chamber
with faded lettering,

298
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,218
perhaps Greek in origin.

299
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,179
Hmm.

300
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,014
Apologies.

301
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,270
He's a Roman--
Lucius Caelius...

302
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,273
from Vesuvius.

303
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,818
( exhales, chuckles )

304
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,778
See yourself to wine and food.

305
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,613
His efforts bear fruit?

306
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:20,325
Plucked from Spartacus'
own garden.

307
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:27,457
His overly ripe friend
goes by name of Lucius Caelius,

308
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,959
known by those questioned

309
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,586
to frequent market
in Neapolis and Atella

310
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:34,673
and to dwell
in the shadows of Vesuvius.

311
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,716
Still too vast an area.

312
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,301
Made smaller by your wife's
discerning eyes.

313
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:41,847
There is a temple
near mountain's foot,

314
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,598
long abandoned,

315
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,142
erected many years past

316
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,272
by Greek hands.

317
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,568
Then we march at nightfall

318
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:58,572
and by dawn's light
see an end to Spartacus.

319
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,366
l would urge
no small amount of caution.

320
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,868
lf memory serve,

321
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,453
there's a wall
protecting this temple.

322
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,498
Spartacus and his men will
surely have fortified position.

323
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:12,502
Then we shall bring to bear
the fiery might of Rome

324
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,464
and see defenses fall
in advance of the man himself.

325
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,966
Prepare your men.

326
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,093
And l would have you
at my side

327
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,761
to share in glorious moment.

328
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:25,432
A great honor.

329
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:30,103
lt shames me
to seek reward beyond it,

330
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,481
yet hard desires
turn reason a fool.

331
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,858
You are many things, Syrian,

332
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,068
but do not expect me
to believe you a fool.

333
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,405
Give voice to your desire.

334
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:44,326
See it considered.

335
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,078
( yelling )

336
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,211
Nemetes,

337
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,631
you attack
before command is given.

338
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,716
We must remain hidden
until the Romans are drawn in.

339
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,217
You would see them
breach the wall?

340
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,844
We would see them trapped,
you simple fuck.

341
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,346
Like fish in a net.

342
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,139
Wagon approaches.

343
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,350
Nasir: Agron leads it.

344
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:13,104
He has attacked another one,
without command.

345
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,440
No. He acts upon my orders.

346
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,858
Towards what purpose?

347
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,361
To secure
what we desperately need.

348
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,529
( laughter )

349
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,497
l barely know the man
absent furrowed brow.

350
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,958
He is not a man
of drunken pursuits.

351
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,210
His brow may not reveal it,

352
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,379
but there is
yet intent upon mind.

353
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,048
lt lifts heart

354
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,842
to hear voices
raised in spirit...

355
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,720
to see us bonded...

356
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,222
( cheering )

357
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,391
...not by brand,

358
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,434
not by homeland,

359
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,938
but by an ideal

360
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,399
that every man...

361
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,236
every woman

362
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:04,239
should be born, should live,
and should die

363
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:07,117
with the taste of freedom
forever upon their lips.

364
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,202
- ( cheering )
- Yeah!

365
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:14,749
Yet if we are
to defeat the Romans,

366
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:17,168
we must put aside
our differences

367
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,837
and come together as one.

368
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:20,922
Let us have sport,

369
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,882
pairing those
of you with ill feelings

370
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,926
against your equals,

371
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,928
and let us see

372
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,639
if thirst for victory
triumphs petty quarrel.

373
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,808
lntent is revealed.

374
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,519
- Donar!
- ( cheering )

375
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:35,895
Nemetes!

376
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,690
- ( cheering )
- Spartacus: Take position.

377
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,736
- Lugo!
- Yeah!

378
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:46,114
Nasir! You will face them.

379
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:52,120
We win if you keep
out of way, little man.

380
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:55,790
- ( laughs )
- Don't fucking call me that.

381
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,751
( yells )

382
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:28,656
( laughs )

383
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,825
Begin!

384
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,621
lt is a thing of beauty,
is it not...

385
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,459
what a man
may accomplish

386
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:42,629
if mind is set
to purpose?

387
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,843
Yet there's something missing.

388
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,514
Freedom.

389
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,768
To see treasures put to use
absent constraint,

390
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,938
to live, knowing
each choice made...

391
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,149


392
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,318
( scoffs )

393
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:08,530
( laughs )

394
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:12,534
Spartacus and l stand together
in such desires.

395
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,036
Then you find yourself
in low company.

396
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:18,706
Soon to be elevated.

397
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,085
Ashur has done the impossible
and discovered

398
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,337
where the dreaded villain
secrets himself,

399
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,005
and in reward...

400
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:29,717
Glaber bestows
deepest wish...

401
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:32,887
upon me.

402
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,889
He sets you free?

403
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,725
After we take Spartacus
at Vesuvius.

404
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,979
Yet releasing me from bond

405
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:44,399
is but a taste of more...

406
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,153
sumptuous meal.

407
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:53,116
One which you
shall feast upon alone.

408
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,493
After Spartacus is defeated,

409
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:59,247
llithyia will return to Rome
with her husband,

410
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:02,250
and trusted friend
will be at her side.

411
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:05,128
l fear llithyia
must find a new one.

412
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:14,095
You will remain here

413
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:17,140
to assume mantle

414
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:19,559
of loving wife.

415
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,563
Glaber will not allow this.

416
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,064
He more than allows it.

417
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,317
He gives union blessing

418
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:31,279
and presents gift
of this ludus

419
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,948
in recognition
of honored service.

420
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,993
He gives you
my husband's legacy?

421
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,416
We shall forge a new one,
my love,

422
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,793
as husband and wife,

423
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,754
and together...

424
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,965
...we shall see the noble rise

425
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:55,470
of the House of Ashur.

426
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,057
( whimpers )

427
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:02,060
Have the men equipped,
ready to travel by sunrise.

428
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,020
See that it happens.

429
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:08,149
You were able to acquire
what is needed?

430
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,817
Move! Hup!

431
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,277
They are upon road
from Neapolis.

432
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,404
Meet them, and hasten arrival.

433
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,325
l will hold no delay
in marching south.

434
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,786
Varinius: l would advise
a different course.

435
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,755
l have been dispatched
with message from the Senate.

436
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,840
You are to cease
pursuit of Spartacus

437
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,342
and return to Rome immediately.

438
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,386
l am a praetor of the Republic.

439
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,389
The Senate holds no power
to make such demands of me.

440
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,224
True, they do not.

441
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:44,060
They have only the power
to recommend a path of action,

442
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:46,354
one only a man
with no intent to rise

443
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,773
above current position
would ignore.

444
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,858
And they send words
through the man

445
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,820
who conspires
to claim my wife?

446
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,078
l am hardly alone
in such ambitions, am l?

447
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:05,290
Troubling news
has lit upon ear

448
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,167
that Spartacus has seized
what l could not.

449
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,794
You do not know
of what you speak.

450
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,337
And you are
an incompetent fool

451
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,381
to allow your wife
to be taken by a slave.

452
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,800
llithyia: Taken?

453
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,221
llithyia?

454
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,976
lt appears
you have been misinformed.

455
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,936
l have been taken only to bed,

456
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,814
my child causing
unexpected discomfort

457
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,275
in waning months
of pregnancy.

458
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:34,569
Did it also cause
the bruise upon your cheek?

459
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,741
No, it did not.

460
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,701
( laughs )
The fault was mine.

461
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:45,747
A misplaced step
as l was coming from the bath.

462
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:49,917
You should choose footing
more carefully.

463
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,253
As you should choose
your words.

464
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,475
Return home, Gaius,

465
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,560
and tend to your wife

466
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,395
before yet another man
makes attempt upon her.

467
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,564
l shall take my leave
when Spartacus falls.

468
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,316
A task long overdue
in its completion.

469
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:15,193
Yet now within grasp.

470
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:18,112
l march to Vesuvius
and an end to the man.

471
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,448
Vesuvius?

472
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:23,117
ls that where he hides?

473
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,869
lt is of no concern to you.

474
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,454
The Senate believes otherwise.

475
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:27,955
l've been appointed
to assume your place

476
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,000
with an army of worth
and bring Spartacus to justice.

477
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,670
And if l refuse to step aside?

478
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,506
lt is a choice
you are free to make,

479
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,258
but one that would end
all hope of rising

480
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,803
from the shit
you have mired yourself in.

481
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,723
Save what little worth
your name yet holds,

482
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,810
and set path towards Rome.

483
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,489
Varinius!

484
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,867
Thank the gods
you received my message!

485
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,077
And l respond to it,

486
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,621
only to find llithyia
safely within these walls.

487
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:11,332
- Spartacus freed her.
- Why would he show mercy

488
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,167
to the wife of the man
that hunts him?

489
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:16,045
l make no attempt to understand
the mind of a slave.

490
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:19,048
Your time instead spent
inventing tales of abduction.

491
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:21,551
Does what you write of
your brother hold similar merit?

492
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,928
Everything l have
told you is true.

493
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,555
Gaius took the life
of my brother.

494
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,598
And what evidence do you claim

495
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,475
to dare place charge
against a praetor of Rome?

496
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,144
Seppius' bracelet,

497
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,604
a mirror of my own,
found hidden

498
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,356
among the belongings
of a man loyal to--

499
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:36,858
A fucking bracelet
is all you hold?

500
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,359
You stupid little girl.

501
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,695
Please do not turn from this.

502
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:42,530
Gaius must pay
for what he's done.

503
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,740
l hold no love for the man,

504
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,034
yet to make accusation based
upon the air and teary eye

505
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,537
would serve no purpose.

506
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,582
Nor will further words.

507
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,263
( cheering )

508
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:26,032
Yeah!

509
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,702
You lower guard
just before launching attack.

510
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,496
Advice gained too late.

511
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,709
- We lose.
- Yeah!

512
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:41,172
But little man
fight like giant!

513
00:30:49,848 --> 00:31:14,789
( laughs )

514
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,309
( cheering continues )

515
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,485
Drink and contest--

516
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:48,030
a clever strategy
to forge necessary bonds.

517
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,576
And l would see more follow.

518
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,372
Battle well fought.

519
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,207
( cheering )

520
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,626
Let us have new contest!

521
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,336
Agron!

522
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,005
( cheering )

523
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,172
Crixus!

524
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,425
( cheering )

525
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,057
Get him, Agron!

526
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:16,517
He's too fast for you, Agron!

527
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,811
Take position.

528
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:23,065
- ( murmuring )
- ( laughter )

529
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,068
Gannicus!

530
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:27,820
- Huh?
- ( cheering )

531
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,989
Oenomaus!

532
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,324
Stand against them.

533
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,658
- ( cheering )
- Yeah!

534
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:33,951
Yeah!

535
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:38,956
We can easily best them
if we fight as one.

536
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,375
Hold this, you fuck.

537
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:43,377
Do not drink it.

538
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,673
- Come...
- Come on, Oenomaus!

539
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,383
...and do what is necessary.

540
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:54,889
- ( laughs )
- Yes!

541
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:57,058
( cheering )

542
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,565
Ready?

543
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:17,745
Begin!

544
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:31,634
Naevia: Come on, Crixus!

545
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:34,053
Teach him who
the true champion is, Crixus!

546
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,597
lt astounds to witness
the change in you.

547
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,266
The world itself
can reverse course

548
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,103
when moved by loving hands.

549
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,106
A blessing...

550
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,984
to hold each other
in such regard.

551
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,778
As Spartacus holds you.

552
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,948
No longer.

553
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,250
( yells )

554
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:34,321
( laughs )

555
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,995
( cheering )

556
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,332
( laughs )

557
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,006
That was well put.

558
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,178
You almost had them.

559
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,346
Almost.

560
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,270
Agron.

561
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,523
You fought well

562
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:11,776
for a simple fuck
from the east of the Rhine.

563
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,487
As did you

564
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,697
for a shit-eating Gaul.

565
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,908
( both laugh )

566
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,536
Let us share drink
and balm wounded pride.

567
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,721
( laughter echoes )

568
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:44,058
Lucretia:
To suffer the sting of loss

569
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:47,895
absent course
to right what has been done.

570
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:52,066
l sent for Varinius,
as you prompted...

571
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:56,737
only to have him
shun word

572
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,405
and touch.

573
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,868
You are no longer a girl,

574
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:05,412
unblemished by the world.

575
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,041
You're a woman now.

576
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,545
And our hands
shape the fates

577
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,088
when those
of men tremble.

578
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:16,382
lt is l who tremble.

579
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,927
The thought of Gaius' hands
upon me.

580
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,429
( crying )

581
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,682
There, there.

582
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,767
Shh.

583
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,980
lt is such desire...

584
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,483
that presents opportunity.

585
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:40,990
You suggest the impossible.

586
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,992
l suggest only

587
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,453
that you consider the years
unfolding before you,

588
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,456
every moment swollen
with the knowledge

589
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,459
that Gaius Claudius Glaber

590
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:56,088
lives out his life
in the privileged lap of Rome...

591
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:02,177
while your brother
is forever denied breath.

592
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,679
lt should not be so.

593
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:06,140
lt should not.

594
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,853
Everything l held dear

595
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:13,772
was taken from me as well,

596
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,941
this house,

597
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:18,652
my husband,

598
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,779
promise of a child.

599
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,699
The things
that have been done to us

600
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,285
cannot stand unanswered.

601
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,996
To allow it...

602
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:33,375
would be to turn from those

603
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,669
we claim to have loved.

604
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,434
ls there no other course?

605
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:54,813
lf you wish to see
your brother's murder avenged...

606
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,734
blood must be spilled.

607
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,031
She is moved towards deed?

608
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,533
l believe it so.

609
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:49,326
Are you certain
this is what you desire?

610
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:52,621
lf Gaius is not moved
by pleading word,

611
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:55,374
then l will have
blood and death

612
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,710
and, in the bringing of it,

613
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,379
my life returned to me.

614
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,935
Seppia: ls it true?

615
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:16,770
That you depart for Rome?

616
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,647
l'm left with little choice.

617
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:22,151
lt is a terrible thing
to be stripped of such.

618
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:26,280
Made more grievous
by hand that removes it.

619
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:28,073
You speak of Varinius?

620
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,451
He once more makes attempt

621
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,619
to claim
what is rightfully mine.

622
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,788
As Spartacus claimed
my brother's life?

623
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,755
An unfortunate tragedy.

624
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,090
One that yet demands justice.

625
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,968
The Senate appoints
Varinius the task.

626
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:50,220
( metal jingles )

627
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,223
l do not have faith in him
to take the life of the man

628
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,517
responsible
for grievous injury.

629
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,646
Nor l.

630
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:05,694
Yet we must turn
from such thought

631
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:09,740
and seek comfort in the hands
of warm embrace.

632
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:26,465
Your fucking hands ripped
my brother from this world,

633
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,926
and mine shall see you from it.

634
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,109
Gaius.

635
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,238
l cast you aside.

636
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,616
Yet you save my life?

637
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,910
You are my husband.

638
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,582
We cannot be what we were.

639
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,419
Then let us be what we are.

640
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,381
We have done terrible things
to each other.

641
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,594
l would see such venom
turned outward

642
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,221
to those truly deserving of it,

643
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:58,265
Seppia,

644
00:41:58,433 --> 00:41:59,766
the Senate,

645
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,770
and the man they dispatch
to steal your glory.

646
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,776
You would move
against Varinius?

647
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:14,031
We are both monsters, Gaius.

648
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,783
Let us be so together

649
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:21,121
and seize the fucking heavens.

650
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:35,802
l shall march to Vesuvius,

651
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,471
see it done.

652
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:44,186
Pause but a moment.

653
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,983
l have been too long absent
you inside me.

654
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,597
Forgive me.

655
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,516
l lose myself in the moment.

656
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:24,184
No.

657
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:28,563
lt is l who have been lost...

658
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:40,367
and your touch
that guides me home.

659
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,385

666
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:16,611
♪ Lift fucking cup... ♪

667
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,239
l still believe you will see us all
to untimely end.

668
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,533
Man:

669
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:23,785
♪ Drain my cock. ♪

670
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:26,830
Yet it will be
a glorious fucking death.

671
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:29,916
( laughs )

672
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:34,212
The signal.

673
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:43,305
Glaber.

( overlapping chatter )

675
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,817
Glaber commands from the rear,

676
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:58,153
a coward's position.

677
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:01,114
He will advance his troops
in tight formation,

678
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:03,116
intending to overpower.

679
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:05,994
lt is the Roman way.

680
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:10,582
We will teach them ours.

681
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,626

00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:33,415
- There are too many!
- Move!

687
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,255
Praetor!

688
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:42,591
The rebels are in retreat.

689
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:48,138
( yelling )

690
00:46:50,099 --> 00:47:00,775
( neighs )

691

( neighs )

697
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:14,224
You are not the man l seek.

698
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:48,049
Lay down your arms!

699
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,969
Do it!

700
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:55,974
Now we have steel.

701
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:57,475
All: Yeah!

702
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,477

l owe you a debt of blood,
for Acer and Rhaskos.

706
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,739
And we shall see it paid

707
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,532
after answer is given.

708
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,993
Where is Glaber?

709
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:17,037
- ( catapult releases )
- Spartacus.

710
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:31,343
Fuck!

711
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,511

( groans )

724
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:55,445
Fall back! lnto the tunnel!

725
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:01,075
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

726

Go! We'll follow!

00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:24,641
Oenomaus!

00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:30,396
( screaming )

730
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:42,909
Move! Move!

731
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:47,664
Agron!

732
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,173
Move! Go!

733
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,066
- Move!

734
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:16,359
Move!

735
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:26,744
Go! Come on!

736
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,162
Quickly!

737
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:34,002
- Move!
- Keep moving!

738
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,713
( woman screams )

739
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:41,968
( rebels screaming )

740
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:44,637
No. There are too many of them.

741
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,682
The mountain pass! Hurry!

742
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,685
But there is no other path down.
We'll be trapped.

743
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,186
There's no choice!

744
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,355
We must move! Go!

745
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:56,357
( marching )

746
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:01,487
Crixus: Spartacus.

747
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:09,495
Go! Move!

748
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,081
This way! This way!

749
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:19,005
( wind blowing )

750
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:26,137
ls there no other way
to gain the mountain?

751
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:29,557
None, save for the narrow path
they escaped upon.

752
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:32,560
Scores of men were lost
in attempted pursuit.

753
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:35,396
Foolish endeavor.

754
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:37,190
They now hold the high ground.

755
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:38,691
We've lost advantage.

756
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,860
You would let them go free?

757
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,779
No.

758
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:45,198
l would let them feast...

759
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:49,202
on mud and rock.

760
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:54,499
And when hunger and madness
drive them from their perch...

761
00:54:56,085 --> 00:54:58,711
we shall kill them all.

762
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,715
( theme music playing )

762
00:55:05,714 --> 00:56:02,715

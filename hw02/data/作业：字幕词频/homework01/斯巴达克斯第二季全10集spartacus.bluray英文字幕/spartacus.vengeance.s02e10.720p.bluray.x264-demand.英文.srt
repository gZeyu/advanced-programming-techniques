1
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,297
We march at nightfall

2
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:09,801
and, by dawn's light,
see an end to Spartacus.

3
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,970
- Gannicus: The signal.
- Glaber.

4
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,140
Again!

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,979
( all yelling )

6
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,524
Spartacus: Fall back!
lnto the tunnel!

7
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,402
Move! Move!

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,824
The mountain pass! Hurry!

9
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:33,991
We'll be trapped.

10
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,493
There's no choice.
We must move!

11
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,662
Ashur:
You will let them go free?

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,832
No.
We shall kill them all.

13
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,877
( theme music playing )

14
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,470
( thunder rumbling )

15
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,749
- ( shivers )
- ( coughs )

16
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,917
The wood for fire
is almost gone.

17
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,880
Our food quickly follows.

18
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,923
We have stripped the mountain
of what little it had

19
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,009
ever since Glaber
forced us upon it.

20
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:39,056
A thing that should
not have happened.

21
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,059
You will find a way
to see us from this.

22
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,187
You always do.

23
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,649
As you always find words

24
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,401
to pull me
from darkest thoughts.

25
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,489
A talent l pray
your next woman holds.

26
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,202
Spartacus!

27
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,038
Nemetes and a clutch of fools
have taken afoot.

28
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:03,206
Towards what purpose?

29
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,540
They attempt
to breach the Romans

30
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,042
at the foot of the path.

31
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,921
( water splashes )

32
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,599
Give word next time.

33
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,810
Be mistaken as enemy.

34
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,394
Glaber summons you.

35
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,689
We only just finished dining
on the most succulent lamb.

36
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,109
There may yet
be few scraps left.

37
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,945
You overstep, slave.

38
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,114
l but place foot
where our praetor commands.

39
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,201
lf you do not care
where it falls,

40
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:43,037
you are free to take issue.

41
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,875
( men yelling )

42
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,500
l do not know your tongue

43
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,169
nor have cause to learn it.

44
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,629
( yells )

45
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,105
Spartacus: Pull back!

46
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,862
Go! Move!

47
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,208
( soldiers shouting cadence )

48
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,507
Gannicus: Spartacus!

49
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,101
Mira!

50
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,561
( men yelling )

51
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,611
( gasps )

52
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,237
( soldiers shouting cadence )

53
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,324
Advance! Hup!

54
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:47,995
We must go!

55
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,672
( thunder crashing )

56
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,883
Woman: Who is it?

57
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,385
( overlapping chatter )

58
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,261
- Mira.
- Mira!

59
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,431
We must seal her wound. Nasir!

60
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,934
Heat your sword in the fire!
Quickly!

61
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,854
( wind blowing )

62
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,859
Spartacus.

63
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,119
Was it worth it?

64
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,831
Was it worth her life

65
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,666
to make attempt
to save your own?!

66
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,835
( crowd murmuring )

67
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,128
( yells )

68
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,840
Stay your fucking ground.

69
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,512
She is gone from this world
'cause of you!

70
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,766
You were the mad fuck
that led us to our deaths!

71
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,147
At least she claimed hers
as a warrior,

72
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,524
not starving
and robbed of strength,

73
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,485
as the rest of us
are doomed.

74
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,535
You are right.

75
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,079
We will all perish...

76
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,331
( crowd gasping )

77
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,213
...if we do not stand together.

78
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,422
lt will make
no fucking difference.

79
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,383
Seize tongue,
and open fucking ears.

80
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,720
The cliffs of Vesuvius
are impassable.

81
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:15,518
The southern path holds the only
promise of making purchase.

82
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,353
We hold the higher ground

83
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,272
and, with it, advantage
over superior numbers.

84
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,025
Only if Glaber
is foolish enough to attack

85
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,361
before we are too weak
from hunger to fight.

86
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,572
A man is never too weak

87
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,575
or too wounded to fight...

88
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:37,873
if the cause is greater
than his own life.

89
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,255
Glaber and his army will come.

90
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,261
And when they do...

91
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,764
Vesuvius will be
forever stained

92
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,225
with the blood of vengeance.

93
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,312
( coughing )

94
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,279
He is all that was captured?

95
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,072
Several more lay dead.

96
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,533
A fortunate thing
you are not among them.

97
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,785
Had the Egyptian and l
not been present,

98
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,329
l fear position
would have been overrun.

99
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,290
The gods favor us then...

100
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,628
and turn from those
who would do us harm.

101
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,464
Tell me of Spartacus

102
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,800
and his thoughts
toward coming storm.

103
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,302
( coughs )

104
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,433
Can he form proper words?

105
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,935
He has yet to break them.

106
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,821
A most unpleasant tongue.

107
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,623
Conditions must be dire

108
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,499
to abandon the higher ground

109
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,877
and attempt at such foolish act.

110
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,005
One that did not appear
commanded by Spartacus.

111
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,882
You laid eyes upon the man?

112
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,383
Briefly, as he and his shits

113
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,844
gave opportunities
for others to retreat.

114
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,930
How did he appear?

115
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,681
Deadly.

116
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,309
Yet there was a look about eye,

117
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,810
one found reflected

118
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,313
in wild beast
when pressed to corner.

119
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,524
Such an animal

120
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:31,862
never greets the afterlife
absent desperate blood.

121
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,785
Vesuvius is not Ceres' horn,
offering endless bounty.

122
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,663
There cannot be much
in way of nourishment

123
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,206
left upon barren peak.

124
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,042
We shall stay our hand
yet a while longer.

125
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,087
And when hunger and despair

126
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,923
are the only taste
upon his lips,

127
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,550
Spartacus shall kneel
before Rome

128
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,178
for the final time.

129
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,265
( horse neighs )

130
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,572
We should not be upon road.

131
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,409
Let us turn back.

132
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,077
No.

133
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,205
l will not sit idle in Capua as
weeks threaten unwelcome months.

134
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,749
All will soon come to an end.

135
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,751
l would see the day hastened

136
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,463
and my child born in a city
befitting the heir of a praetor.

137
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,466
The glorious occasion
is almost upon us.

138
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,093
To risk the journey to Rome--

139
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,886
There is yet time

140
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,389
if my husband is moved
to bring siege against Spartacus

141
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,057
to early conclusion.

142
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,518
The reason we are for Vesuvius.

143
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,438
A fraction of it.

144
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:53,569
The whole of the truth
encompassing greater need.

145
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,325
Has heart returned
so fiercely in such regard?

146
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,077
Gaius and l share but one now,

147
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:07,249
his absence leaving chest
but half filled.

148
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:11,503
To find yourself in the arms
of a husband thought lost...

149
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,799
that's a blessing
beyond measure.

150
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:22,014
A happiness l would share
with treasured friend.

151
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,974
You will come with me
to Rome.

152
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,642
l will entreat Gaius
towards dowry

153
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,978
in honor of your service...

154
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,775
and you shall again find
comfort in title of wife.

155
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,447
Your husband would not
have me follow with you.

156
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,699
You have been invaluable
to his cause.

157
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,452
He believes another more so.

158
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,456
l have been promised
to Ashur.

159
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
Ashur?

160
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,251
My hand and house
in payment

161
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,587
for blood spilled
in your husband's name.

162
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,674
Why have you not told me this?

163
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,094
l would not have such thoughts
weigh mind and body

164
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,762
with your day so close at hand.

165
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:06,350
l will seize opportunity
at Vesuvius

166
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:09,520
and attempt
to rid myself of burden.

167
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,862
Reveal intentions...

168
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,325
and see them embraced.

169
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,206
( metal tapping )

170
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,467
We sit here waiting to die,
and he tends to fucking weeds.

171
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,386
He tends to his heart,

172
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,471
as any man should.

173
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,728
There is not enough wood
to build a pyre.

174
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:56,233
The ground is too hard
to lay her beneath it.

175
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,152
He can only grieve

176
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,446
and bind her in his cloak.

177
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,365
Blessing then...

178
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,076
that we shall all be dead

179
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,911
before she turns overly ripe.

180
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:12,082
( man coughs )

181
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,751
( overlapping conversations )

182
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:24,261
Nemetes and his kind
grow ever more restless.

183
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,101
l fear they're not alone.

184
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,769
l cannot lay blame.

185
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,064
Yet our only chance of survival

186
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,858
is to hold fast to sound tactic.

187
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,777
Like attacking the arena
with a handful of men?

188
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:47,201
l once thought you
reckless fool.

189
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,119
Now l see bold strategy

190
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,455
is the only reason
you are not already dead.

191
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,040
l have been but fortunate

192
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:57,044
to have seized opportunity
the Romans would consider mad.

193
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,213
There stand none left to us now,

194
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,881
absent wings to fly from cliff.

195
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,973
The day comes when we must
face Glaber and his army

196
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,809
in open battle.

197
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,360
lf l am to die,

198
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,154
at least l shall die
among brothers.

199
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:32,538
( laughs )

200
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,508
We share a bond

201
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,553
forged not upon the sands,

202
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,556
but upon grander stage
of battle,

203
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,140
and when it ends,

204
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,434
as all conflict must,

205
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,853
l will gain
Batiatus' ludus and villa

206
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,147
as reward for loyal service.

207
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,358
lt will become
the noble House of Ashur,

208
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,777
where l shall train
the mightiest gladiators

209
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,863
in all the Republic.

210
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,700
l would count you
among my first recruits.

211
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:14,246
You will become
gods of the arena,

212
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,540
showered in wine and women.

213
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,419
l ask but for your oath,

214
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,713
- pledging--
- Open the gate!

215
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,681
Wait here...

216
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:37,144
and see
weighted heart lifted.

217
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,072
There's been
no further movement?

218
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,699
We have taught Spartacus
the futility

219
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,160
of attempting breach.

220
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:56,872
You cannot school rabid dog
not to bare teeth.

221
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,373
llithyia.

222
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,875
( laughs )

223
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,883
You should not have come.

224
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,426
Yes, l know the rules.

225
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,094
Women are forbidden
in the encampment.

226
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,262
Oh.

227
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:18,185
My concern is only for you
and the life you carry.

228
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:21,021
l would not have you travel
in such condition.

229
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,856
l have never felt stronger

230
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,318
and would travel
a greater distance still.

231
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,613
You wish to return to Rome.

232
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,615
With my husband beside me.

233
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:35,452
The rebels become desperate.

234
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,788
ln a few more weeks,
when starvation--

235
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,831
A few more weeks,
and your heir will be born

236
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,750
in a house tainted
with blood and shit.

237
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,674
End Spartacus' life,

238
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:53,011
and let us return home to ours.

239
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,138
He holds the higher ground.

240
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,392
lt cannot be taken yet
without severe loss of men.

241
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,269
Yet...

242
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,607
it can be taken?

243
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,281
Await me in Capua...

244
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:18,495
and prepare to celebrate
the birth of our child

245
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,997
in the arms of mother Rome.

246
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,880
You truly stand a titan,

247
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,924
threatening the very heavens.

248
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,676
Go,

249
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,595
and know that you
are in my thoughts.

250
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,189
l would linger
but a moment longer.

251
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,404
What is this?

252
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,574
A warning from the gods.

253
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,207
How did this come to you?

254
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,002
l uncovered it while
cleansing trace of Seppia,

255
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,879
secreted among her things.

256
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:13,550
My slave Amana recalls seeing it
pressed into Seppia's hands

257
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:17,137
by the Syrian toad.

258
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,890
That is how she knew
her brother's true fate

259
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,851
and why she moved against you.

260
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,104
But it holds no sense.

261
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,064
Ashur's fortunes
are tethered to my own.

262
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,816
He is a serpent,

263
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,402
forever seeking the heat
of power and position.

264
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,781
When yours
was threatened by Varinius,

265
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,866
is it a wonder

266
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,869
he sought to slither
towards warmer clime?

267
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:44,414
A venomous creature to the last.

268
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,666
One no longer holding worth.

269
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,922
He is not alone in such regard.

270
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,302
Serpent and oracle
have both served purpose.

271
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,264
You speak of Lucretia?

272
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,599
l speak of a woman

273
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,268
who knows secrets
l would not have revealed.

274
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,732
You would ask me
to do such a thing?

275
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:16,905
l would put unfortunate
past behind us...

276
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,285
and seize glorious future.

277
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,630
You are my husband...

278
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,013
and l, dutiful wife.

279
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,991
l have missed
your delicate scent...

280
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:08,790
among other offerings
of more personal nature.

281
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:16,840
lt lifts spirits
to find you close again.

282
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,634
l stay but a moment.

283
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,179
A thing of low importance

284
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,931
when set against the promise

285
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:29,185
of a lifetime
held in loving embrace.

286
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:35,191
Do not shed tear when we part.

287
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,862
Know that campaign soon
draws to inevitable close...

288
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:44,784
and Ashur
to deserving reward.

289
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,383
l long to greet the day.

290
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,356
( gate clanks )

291
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,900
( Ashur chuckles )

292
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,653
Syrian.

293
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,575
Do you think me the fool?

294
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,745
Praetor?

295
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:39,923
l do not understand.

296
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,591
Do you deny taking it?

297
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,178
l take many things
from the fallen.

298
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,722
l thought l had
your blessing to do so.

299
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,309
And did you also
seek Seppia's blessing...

300
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,981
before she made attempt
on my life?

301
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,691
Seppia?

302
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,070
l've never broken words
with the girl.

303
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,865
l have had my fill
of serpent's tongue.

304
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,787
Wait! Wait.

305
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,794
l do not know what you
have been told,

306
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:20,088
but l fear you have made
a grave error.

307
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:23,633
No, l fear
you have made the error

308
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:27,345
in attempting to maneuver
beyond your station.

309
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,557
Unfortunate end

310
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,892
to profitable association.

311
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:37,814
Perhaps it best my men and l
quietly take leave,

312
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,650
absent further disagreement.

313
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:43,653
Oh, l would make better offer.

314
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:48,783
Land and a thousand denarii
to each of you,

315
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:52,120
in return for faithful service.

316
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,814
You fucking cunts.

317
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:27,322
Hold.

318
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:37,999
You once swore to me,

319
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,877
"Your will, my hands."

320
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,671
An oath that has not wavered.

321
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,968
l swear it to you, Praetor.

322
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,888
l would test such vaunted words

323
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,016
and the depths of your loyalty.

324
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,721
Spartacus!

325
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,390
There's movement upon the path.

326
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,227
Take position.

327
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,271
( overlapping chatter )

328
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,377
Ashur.

329
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:10,508
l come bearing a message
from Glaber.

330
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,760
Speak it.

331
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,640
He has grown weary
of this conflict

332
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:21,686
and would return home
to see his child born in Rome.

333
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,856
A thing of no interest.

334
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,232
( laughter )

335
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,906
Perhaps the lives
of your people hold more.

336
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,618
He offers terms of surrender.

337
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,497
Lay down your arms,

338
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,999
you'll be allowed to live.

339
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,460
( crowd murmur )

340
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,339
Spartacus: As slaves?

341
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,633
Beneath the heel
of the Republic?

342
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,636
Yes, as slaves.

343
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,098
Yet you will have your lives!

344
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,558
Refuse,

345
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,853
and Glaber has sworn
torturous death upon the cross

346
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:07,815
for all that survive
the taking of the mountain.

347
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:16,199
And what of Spartacus' life?

348
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:19,869
The cost of the bargain.

349
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:22,705
( crowd murmurs )

350
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,417
l for one do not wish
to die this day...

351
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,544
( crowd murmuring )

352
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,676
...yet if it is
to be fucking so,

353
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,178
l shall do it as a free man!

354
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:38,388
( cheering )

355
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,723
Woman:
Fuck the Romans!

356
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,517
Man:
No surrender!

357
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:43,726
Syrian cunt!

358
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:46,062
( laughter )

359
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,193
You have your answer.

360
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,990
Very well.

361
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,078
l shall deliver it
to waiting ears.

362
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:11,587
l would not have us
part so quickly.

363
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,969
Glaber awaits.

364
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:21,931
l must return with a reply.

365
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,518
Your head
would serve equal purpose.

366
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:32,275
Spartacus?

367
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:33,943
l find no fault
with his reasoning.

368
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,449
( laughter )

369
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:48,291
The mighty Crixus,

370
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:53,296
forever intoning
of the honor of a gladiator.

371
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:55,465
Where stands such now

372
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,592
in the cutting down
of a defenseless man?

373
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:00,470
Give him a sword.

374
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:09,896
Crixus: You once dreamt
of honor upon the sand.

375
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:13,316
Make this your final arena.

376
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:16,319
You stand a champion...

377
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,989
and l gravely wounded.

378
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,325
There is yet no honor
in such contest.

379
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,619
To shit with honor.

380
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:26,037
No!

381
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:32,043
l will not have you soil name

382
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,878
to gain vengeance in mine.

383
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,046
Naevia.

384
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,839
l shall take it myself.

385
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:40,635
No one has been
more wronged by Ashur...

386
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,431
and no one has greater claim
on his fucking life.

387
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,438
l will see him fall...

388
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,192
and with him,

389
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,946
memories that haunt
darkest nights.

390
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,536
See it done.

391
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,380
Are you certain of this?

392
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,550
l am far removed.

393
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,436
Very well.

394
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,857
lf Ashur must die today,

395
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,400
at least he will
see Crixus' bitch

396
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:39,861
to the afterlife before him.

397
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,746
( overlapping chatter )

398
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,040
Take it off!
Rip his head off!

399
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:09,932
Delicate flower
has grown thorns.

400
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:14,437
Get that cunt!

401
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:17,523
Sharpened by
the Undefeated Gaul.

402
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:21,194
l fear it will not help.

403
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,114
( laughter )

404
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:26,616
Yeah!

405
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,485
She fades,

406
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:05,988
as all beautiful things do.

407
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,470
Naevia!

408
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,807
Naevia: No!

409
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,436
He is mine.

410
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,700
Stay back!

411
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:56,581
l will have his life
for what he did to me.

412
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,093
Or die in attempt!

413
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,053
Yeah! Come on!

414
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,443
Do you recall this,

415
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,237
my body pressed against yours?

416
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,407
You trembling helpless,

417
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:33,576
as you tremble now?

418
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:44,378
( yells )

419
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:50,259
l am far from helpless.

420
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:09,487
You think
this makes difference?

421
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:12,031
( coughs )

422
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,451
My death...

423
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:19,789
will not heal
the scars you bear.

424
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:26,629
Nor erase memory
of my cock inside of her...

425
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,965
or all those that followed.

426
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,593
( laughs )

427
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,261
( gasps )

428
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,057
No...

429
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,560
it will not.

430
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,316
But it is a fucking start.

431
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:50,653
( yelling )

432
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,945
You were right.

433
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,449
lt is no easy task...

434
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,702
to cleave a man's head
from his shoulders

435
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,203
in a single blow.

436
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,882
Then l will teach you.

437
00:34:58,388 --> 00:34:59,722
Donar! Lydon!

438
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,017
See Ashur's head upon the path
as reply to Glaber.

439
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,770
You send a clear one.

440
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,731
lt will be nail and cross
for those who live.

441
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:11,400
Glaber would have seen
us all to such fate,

442
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,902
regardless of answer carried.

443
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,403
Nemetes: So we are
dead either way.

444
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:17,239
Pity there are not enough vines
for all our corpses.

445
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,074
Close fucking mouth.

446
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,828
No.

447
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,747
Nemetes is right.

448
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,376
There are not
enough vines for us all.

449
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:36,217
But perhaps
there's enough for a few.

450
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,594
Your words carry no meaning.

451
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,262
They carry
the weight of the world,

452
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,181
braced by your own advice.

453
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:48,229
Glaber expects us to defend
the higher ground,

454
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,648
as any reasonable leader would.

455
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:53,234
Yet perhaps
there is another course,

456
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,277
a bold one,

457
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:58,072
that the Romans
will never see coming.

458
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:06,622
And what madness
does the Bringer of Rain

459
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,832
contemplate this time?

460
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,459
That we shall sprout wings

461
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,545
and do the impossible.

462
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,424
Man: Head off.

463
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,593
( thunder crashing )

464
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,390
Praetor.

465
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,312
They have given reply.

466
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,443
Spartacus makes expected choice.

467
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,948
Tell the men to eat well
and gather sleep.

468
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:44,785
Dawn's first light,
we take Vesuvius

469
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:48,956
and the lives of all those
who stand in defiance of Rome.

470
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,711
Soon we shall leave this place,

471
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,212
never to return.

472
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,716
What your friendship
brings me...

473
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,595
there are no words
to express gratitude.

474
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:48,057
You have returned the favor
many times over.

475
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:52,144
The debt l owe far exceeds
modest repayment.

476
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,982
You drew me
from the depths of madness.

477
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:00,235
You gave me strength
and purpose

478
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,113
to live beyond the tragedy
which betided this house.

479
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,240
Such things are of the past.

480
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:12,039
Let them give you
no further pain.

481
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,835
l have tried to put it from me.

482
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:21,382
The memory
of all l have lost,

483
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,592
it fills the very air,

484
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,804
choking each breath
with the sting of loss...

485
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,432
and binding my heart
in chains.

486
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,941
You stand upon precipice
of release.

487
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,820
Because of you.

488
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:45,698
You're my savior, llithyia.

489
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,994
And you mine.

490
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,627
You have given me hope

491
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:01,422
of a life l thought denied me
when my husband fell.

492
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:03,841
Know that such a gift

493
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:06,552
shall be eternally treasured.

494
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,644
( gasps )

495
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,400
The child.

496
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,822
lt comes too soon.

497
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,658
This is a sign from the gods.

498
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,118
( gasping )

499
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,828
lt must be born
within these walls.

500
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,705
( groaning )

501
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,915
Come.

502
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,501
Let us see their will be done.

503
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,685
We have used every vine
we could gather,

504
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,062
enough for four men.

505
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,731
( thunder crashing )

506
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,029
Agron, Crixus, Gannicus,

507
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:09,031
l would have you by my side.

508
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,660
Naevia: Crixus.

509
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,921
We will be reunited soon

510
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,381
in this life or the next.

511
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:44,108
l know fear wells
within your breast,

512
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,569
and it does so
with great cause.

513
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:51,949
The Romans hold numbers
far outweighing our own,

514
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:57,538
yet they have revealed
time and again fatal flaw,

515
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:02,543
that they believe the Roman way
is the only one...

516
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,420
just as they believe

517
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,757
that there is only one way
to leave this mountain.

518
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:14,721
We shall teach them
that we forge our own paths

519
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:18,642
and nothing in this world
is impossible

520
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,104
when heart and mind
are put towards it.

521
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:25,607
( cheering )

522
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:27,943
Brace rope.

523
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,120
Let us begin a lesson
forever remembered.

524
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:39,621
( thunder continues )

525
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,300
Agron: The sound
will mask descent.

526
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,303
The gods bless us
with good fortune.

527
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,722
Free men create their own.

528
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:01,852
We are all gods this night,

529
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,314
and the Romans
shall feel our wrath.

530
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,317
( cheering )

531
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:52,194
( thunder continues )

532
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,202
- ( rock clatters )
- Agron: Fuck.

533
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,876
( grunting )

534
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,476
lf we but fought as an army,

535
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,770
like the Romans.

536
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,190
They hold only
advantage of number.

537
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,244
One we shall see evened.

538
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,256
Prepare yourselves.

539
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:55,799
When signal comes,

540
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,093
death shall quickly follow.

541
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:02,472
( grunts )

542
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:05,767
( gurgles )

543
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,396
Spartacus:
We must move quickly,

544
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:12,232
before deed is discovered.

545
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,122
The hour is late.

546
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,124
Sleep will not come.

547
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,294
All l see when eyes close,

548
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:34,171
it is the end of Spartacus...

549
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,799
and with him,

550
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:40,802
reason for being
so long absent from Rome

551
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,221
and more important matters.

552
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:48,393
You will be victorious
where Varinius failed...

553
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:52,064
a great advantage
within the Senate.

554
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,274
To be used towards elevation.

555
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:59,905
One day l shall rise
above all others...

556
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:03,909
the light of accomplishment
giving warmth

557
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:06,995
to loving wife
and cherished heir.

558
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,833
Raise alarm.

559
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,502
- Praetor!
- Gather the men to formation!

560
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:14,669
Awake the men!

561
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,671
Fire!

562
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:25,847
The signal!

563
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:28,016
( all yelling )

564
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,479
( Romans yelling )

565
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,651
( neighs )

566
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,072
( screams )

567
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,365
( wails )

568
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,575
Where the fuck is the medicus?!

569
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:46,910
He had gone to town,

570
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,328
the child
not expected for weeks.

571
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:51,373
l have sent
the guards to fetch him.

572
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:53,583
( gasping )

573
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,085
Something is wrong.

574
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,670
lt claws at me,

575
00:45:56,838 --> 00:46:00,257
not wanting to leave womb to be
born in this place. ( wails )

576
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:03,760
l will find something
to ease the pain.

577
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,262
Do not leave me.

578
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:09,057
Know that l will return,

579
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:12,936
and together we will see
this blessing into the world.

580
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,864
Again!

581
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:29,119
( yelling )

582
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,834
l need help over here!

583
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:40,505
Relocate ammunition.

584
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:42,799
Advance on rear position!

585
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:45,385
Kill anyone
who stands in your path!

586
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,398
Halt!

587
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:06,990
A glorious death.

588
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,659
( laughs )

589
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:15,832
Kill them!

590
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,792
( all yelling )

591
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,512
( laughs )

592
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,640
( rebels yelling )

593
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,374
( groaning )

594
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,047
( woman screams )

595
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:06,091
( objects clatter )

596
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:10,971
l thought l heard a cry.

597
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:14,140
( thunder crashing )

598
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,352
What have you done?

599
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,480
What was always intended,

600
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:24,359
to see curse
upon this house lifted.

601
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:34,494
( screaming )

602
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,747
Shh.

603
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,634
( gasping )

604
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,845
There.

605
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,681
No one left to come between us.

606
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:16,620
Fall back.

607
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,371
- Fall back!
- Fall back!

608
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,459
Press advantage,
and see victory ours!

609
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,136
Stop.

610
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:36,097
Please.

611
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:39,517
We are friends, are we not?

612
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:42,729
The very best.

613
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:45,231
Then why would you do this?

614
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:49,152
Why would you take my life
and that of my child?

615
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:51,863
Your child?

616
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:55,158
You are but a vessel

617
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,410
carrying a gift
from the gods

618
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,287
to the House of Batiatus.

619
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,209
Now then...

620
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,921
let us see it unwrapped.

621
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,761
( screams )

622
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:17,681
( yelling )

623
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,542
l owe you pain.

624
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:02,225
Oenomaus!

625
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:31,337
Oenomaus.

626
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:41,514
l go to my wife's arms.

627
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:48,938
We shall greet you

628
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:53,067
in the afterlife, my brother.

629
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:11,377
( gate clanks )

630
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,879
Secure the perimeter!

631
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,964
Signal all men
to defend this position

632
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,175
Mark your stations!

633
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:19,511
Romans, ready!

634
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,179
( yelling )

635
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,908
( baby crying )

636
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,507
Lucretia!

637
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,056
( baby crying )

638
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,892
Hush now, little one.

639
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:52,103
You are safe now.

640
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:53,897
You are loved

641
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,900
and shall be forever.

642
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,290
Please.

643
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:57,043
Quintus always wanted a son.

644
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,338
Because of you...

645
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,341
we shall have one.

646
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,763
No.

647
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:59,939
( child laughing )

648
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:16,539
l will not die

649
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:21,210
at the hands
of a fucking slave.

650
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,259
l am a free man.

651
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:43,775
The Roman finally
learns his place before us...

652
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,493
on his knees.

653
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:02,960
You've won nothing.

654
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:13,262
Rome will send legions
in my wake,

655
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:19,102
and one day soon you shall fall
to deserved end.

656
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,943
( gasping )

657
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:32,532
Perhaps.

658
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,826
Yet it is not this day.

659
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:43,042
( screams )

660
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:28,629
Let Rome send their legions.

661
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:31,257
We will face them

662
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:34,927
and see all
follow Glaber in death.

663
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:37,430
- Yeah!
- ( cheering )

664
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:58,701
Now we will become an army.

665
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:05,666
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

666
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:08,377
( cheering )

667
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:11,505
Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus!

668
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:13,549
Spartacus!
Spartacus!

669
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:15,676
Spartacus! Spartacus!

670
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:19,263
Spartacus! Spartacus!
Spartacus!

672
00:59:22,263 --> 01:59:25,061

1
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,880
The Cape of Good Hope.On Africa's southerly tip.

2
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,430
Here two great seas meet,

3
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,960
one,the warm Indian Ocean,

4
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,820
the other the chilly Atlantic.

5
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,180
And as they mingle,so they create a billowing cloak

6
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,340
that drapes the summit of Table Mountain.

7
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,600
Spectacular though this is,

8
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,665
the mountain's cloudy covering is only a hint of the profound influence

9
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:28,910
that these two very different oceans have on the fortunes of life here.

10
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,040
And not just here at the Cape

11
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,000
but across the length and breadth of Southern Africa.

12
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:55,190

13
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,050

12
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,270
Two thousand miles north from the Cape,

13
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:09,450
beneath this sandy beach,new life is stirring.

14
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,006
Hundreds of baby green turtles emerge like a torrent,

15
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:31,250
from the safety of their nest.

16
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,000
Each one,just seven centimetres long,

19
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,850

17
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,960
From the moment they hatch,

18
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,640
they're driven by an instinctive urge to run to the sea.

19
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:30,950
Few creatures start life with the odds for success so heavily stacked against them.

20
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,380
Yellow billed kites.

21
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,490
Pied crows.

22
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,150
But so many of these hatchlings appear together,

23
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,730
that predators can't catch them all.

24
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,810
Last out,this baby might seem doomed.

25
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,490
But struggling out late could just give her a chance.

26
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,600
The crows seem insatiable.

27
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,340
Even those that reach the sea aren't safe.

28
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,720
This female has to make a dash for it.

29
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,660
She's still in danger and not just from above.

30
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,390
A Ghost crab may be smaller than the hatchling,

31
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,820
but it has the strength to drag her into its lair.

32
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,310
Not this time.

33
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,670
At last, the sea.

34
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,810
She has to catch a breath if she's not to drown,

35
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,450
but the pounding waves make it desperately difficult.

36
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,050
Beyond the surf,calmer water,

37
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:50,070
but even here the hatchling is not out of danger.

38
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,320
She dives.

39
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,630
Just in time.

40
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,550
Only one hatchling in a thousand will survive to adulthood,

41
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:41,490
but if she does,she may live for 80 years.

42
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,200
For now,the ocean is there to be explored.

43
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,040
As the hatchling disappears into the deep blue,

44
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:10,070
she swims into the waters of one of the planet's most powerful currents:

45
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,870
the Agulhas.

46
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,020
The Agulhas sweeps south towards the Cape,

47
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,840
transporting a hundred billion gallons of warm water every day.

48
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,130
These tropical seas are so warm,

49
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,230
they evaporate on an enormous scale.

50
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,000
Water vapour rises until at altitude it cools

51
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,600
and condenses into clouds.

52
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,990
As the clouds drift inland,,

53
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,310
they bring rain to one of the least explored corners of our planet.

54
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,510
The mountains of Mozambique.

55
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,700
This the wettest place in Southern Africa.

56
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:55,710
Decades of civil war have kept travellers away from this little known land.

57
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,320
It was satellite mapping

58
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,170
that revealed the full extent of the forest that grows here,

59
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,530
so now it's known to outsiders as the "Google" rainforest.

60
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,010
It could also be called the butterfly forest.

61
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:27,370
After the rains,butterflies have emerged together in huge numbers.

62
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,442
As soon as their wings dry out,

63
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:31,220
they will take to the air.

64
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,640
Their goal,to find a mate.

65
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,740
But how?

66
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,460
There may be thousands close by but the foliage is so thick,

67
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,330
it's difficult for them to find each other.

68
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,720
They have a remarkable solution.

69
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,800
They follow rivers upstream and travel to higher ground.

70
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:19,260
The journey can take hours of determined flying.

71
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,690
Eventually,they emerge into the only open space there is.

72
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,750
The treeless peak of Mount Mabu.

73
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,990
Up here,free from the confines of the forest,

74
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,820
they hold a butterfly ball.

75
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,230
Now the butterflies have all the space they need for their aerobatic courtship.

76
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,580
The male's strategy is simple:

77
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,660
fly higher and faster than the competition

78
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,350
and just maybe you'll win a virgin female.

79
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:45,770
This spectacular gathering unseen by outsiders until now,

80
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,920
happens for just half an hour each morning

81
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,110
and for just a few weeks in the year.

82
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:07,250
Once mated,the females descend back to the rainforest to lay their eggs.

83
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,394
A forest that only exists,

84
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:16,580
because of moisture rising from the warm Agulhas current,

85
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,440
hundreds of miles away in the Indian Ocean.

86
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:53,800
The rainwater now flows southwards from Mozambique's highest peaks,

87
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,150
to the lowlands of the Eastern Cape.

88
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,315
And where the land flattens,

89
00:14:02,315 --> 00:14:03,420
rivers slow,

90
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,290
creating a vast swamp 50 miles across.

91
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,170
This is Gorongosa.

92
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,140
Here all kinds of creatures come to catch fish.

93
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,830
Whiskered catfish work as a team.

94
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,182
They take a gulp of air at the surface and then belch it out underwater,

95
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:50,760
to create a net of bubbles.

96
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,470
And that traps little fish.

97
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,550
There are fish for everyone.

98
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,920
And each species has its own technique for catching them.

99
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,070
It's all very well having a big beak but you've still got to know how to use it.

100
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,640
This young pelican has a lot to learn,

101
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,370
and not long to do so.

102
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,240
Maybe,like the catfish,teamwork is the answer.

103
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,520
It's certainly working for the flock

104
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,460
and this pelican seems to be getting the hang of it.

105
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,620
But surely,he can't swallow that catfish?

106
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,690
Trying to was a mistake.

107
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,820
The rainwater,briefly held in Gorongosa's swamp,

108
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,470
has now been enriched with silt and sand.

110
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,720

109
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,400
the Zambezi,the Limpopo,the Save

110
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,840
drain back to the sea,

111
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,170
and there they meet the Agulhas current.

112
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,340
And what happens to all that sand?

113
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,770
Over the millennia,the Agulhas has worked it

114
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,240
into a complex underwater landscape.

115
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,710
This vast sand sculpture is the Bazaruto Archipelago,

116
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,840
the oldest of its kind in the world.

117
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:33,570
It may look like paradise but living here is not easy.

118
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,866
For a hundred thousand years,the Agulhas Current

119
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:53,760
has battered these submerged dunes with underwater sandstorms.

120
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,820
But where the water is deep enough to escape these storms,

121
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,930
nutrients carried from Africa's interior

122
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,960
fuel an explosion of life.

123
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,150
A rare oceanic hunter rules here.

124
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,890
Giant kingfish.

125
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,240
As big as a man and weight for weight,

126
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,940
one of the most powerful fish in the sea.

127
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,610
Despite their size,they're extraordinarily agile when hunting.

128
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,560
Normally, kingfish are solitary,

129
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,730
but for just a few weeks each year,

130
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,180
they gather at places like Bazaruto

131
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,460
and prepare for an extraordinary journey.

132
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,970
One that will take them far inland.

133
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,490
The Mtentu River.

134
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:08,220
The king of kingfish leads them upstream.

135
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,940
As they travel further into freshwater,

136
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:19,930
they seem to change from aggressive hunters into dedicated pilgrims.

137
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,060
Now,many miles from their natural home,

138
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,610
and in response to an unknown cue,

139
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,610
they stop and begin to circle.

140
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,850
Other marine fish that migrate upriver

141
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,870
usually do so in order to breed,

142
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,350
but there's no evidence that these kingfish spawn up here.

143
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,910
Neither do they hunt.

144
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,990
So,what are they doing?

145
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,810
In truth,the purpose of this strange behaviour is still unknown.

146
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:32,170
Within a few weeks,they will retrace their journey back to the ocean.

147
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,710
The lives of kingfish,

148
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:46,190
like those of turtles and butterflies and pelicans,

149
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,090
are influenced by the Agulhas Current.

150
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,420
But that influence can only reach so far,

151
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,120
and this is why.

152
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,660
The Drakensberg Mountains.

153
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:24,670
Here,local people say that the vultures soar so high,

154
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,380
they can see into the future.

155
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,900
These sheer cliffs,rising to over 3,000 metres,

156
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,350
hold back the advancing rain clouds

157
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,380
and as a result,the land beyond them is starved of water.

158
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,310
This is the greatest expanse of sand in the world.

159
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:21,990
A seemingly endless desert that is the vast parched centre of Southern Africa.

160
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,290
Thousands of miles to the west,

161
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:38,140
where this desert meets the Atlantic Ocean,

162
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,450
another current prevails.

163
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,430
But the Benguela Current,surging up the west side of Africa,

164
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,070
has a very different character.

165
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,320
It's extremely cold,full of nutrients

166
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,920
and it's thronged with life.

167
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,960
A great white shark.

168
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,810
They can raise their body temperature

169
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:21,480
to 10 degrees above that of the surrounding sea.

172
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:30,730

170
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:40,470
So,this is a great bonanza for them,the body of a dead whale.

171
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:53,070
The carcass will draw in every great white for miles around.

172
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:59,560
And here,off Cape Town,that means a lot of sharks.

173
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,630
Instead of feeding in a frenzy,

174
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:16,180
these sharks have rather refined table manners.

178
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:30,920

175
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,640
Then,each takes its turn.

176
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:46,610
This female is the biggest so she eats first.

177
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,930
The next only feeds when she gives way.

178
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,280
The waters of the Benguela are so rich,

179
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:57,690
they support more great white sharks than any other seas on the planet.

180
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,800
And they are so cold,

181
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:15,210
they attract some surprising creatures to these African shores.

182
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,230
Penguins.

183
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,470
African Penguins.

184
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,180
This female is returning to relieve her partner.

185
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,110
Of course,there's no ice here

186
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:44,150
but these rocks can be almost as slippery.

187
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:23,120
But there are more serious obstacles than the slippery rocks awaiting them.

188
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,970
It's his turn to feed

189
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:39,450
so he leaves her to look after their eggs.

190
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,860
Now,she must tackle a problem faced by no other kind of penguin.

191
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:59,560
For the next 10 days,she must protect her eggs from the African sun.

192
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:18,100
A dense coat of feathers that keeps her warm in cold seas now stifles her.

193
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,830
On these exposed rocks,

194
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:26,990
she must shade her eggs instead of keeping them warm.

195
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,070
Everything here seems the wrong way round.

196
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:53,340
For some,the soaring temperature is too much.

197
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,540
A neighbour deserts his nest.

198
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
His egg will not survive.

199
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,530
He's not the only one to give up,

200
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,710
some years,not a single chick is reared.

201
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:43,260
Penguins are adapted to withstand temperatures of 40 degrees below zero

202
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,670
not 40 degrees above.

203
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:05,620
Now,at the hottest part of the day,the very worst time,

204
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,820
her chicks are hatching.

205
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,610
Just when they need her most,

206
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,900
she's reaching the limit of her endurance.

207
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,020
After 10 days of intensive fishing,

208
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:44,110
the chicks' father comes back to take his turn at the nest.

209
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,600
But will he be too late?

210
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:08,800
He greets his young for the very first time.

211
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,410
The coolness of the Benguela Current brought the penguins here

212
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:28,480
but that very coolness is a great disadvantage

213
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,340
because it generates little rain.

214
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:42,040
It can,however,produce moisture in a different form.

215
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:52,280
A thick blanket of fog rolls in from the sea

216
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:56,100
and condenses on this thirsty land.

217
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:09,050
And each year,the desert bursts into life with a dazzling display.

218
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:21,250
Water is so scarce that this show will not last long

219
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,440
so plants compete to attract their pollinators,with colour.

220
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:42,600
Here in Namaqualand,a 600-mile strip of coastal desert

221
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,760
becomes carpeted with blooms.

222
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,580
The morning sun opens a Namaqua Daisy

223
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:09,130
and reveals a male monkey beetle asleep inside.

224
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:17,954
Nights here are so cold

225
00:35:17,955 --> 00:35:22,410
that monkey beetles shelter within the closed up petals of the daisies.

226
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,680
The habit brings benefits to both sides.

227
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,730
The beetle is kept warm and the flower gets pollinated.

228
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:41,250
But now the beetle has urgent business.He must find a mate.

229
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,790
As he searches,he hops from bloom to bloom pollinating each in turn.

230
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,770
At last,he spots a potential mate.

231
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,750
A golden princess.

232
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,060
But here comes trouble.

233
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,240
A rival.

234
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,410
There's no time for introductions.

235
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:40,330
But he's been too slow.

236
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:50,360
The rivals immediately begin to brawl.

237
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:58,420
The female will only mate inside the daisy

238
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,040
so they wrestle for possession.

239
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,852
They're so engrossed in fighting,

240
00:37:21,852 --> 00:37:23,870
they've pushed her off.

241
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,610
The challenger is ejected.

242
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,810
The winner wastes no time before getting back to business.

243
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,440
At last!

244
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:38,150
Now,there will be a new generation of monkey beetles

245
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,250
to pollinate these Namaqualand flowers.

246
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,950
For most of the year,

247
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,610
this land is desperately dry

248
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:59,260
but just occasionally,brief,violent storms sweep in from the cold ocean.

249
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,900
Springbok have been roaming this desert for many months,

250
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:19,990
searching for one of these rare and highly localised downpours.

251
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:46,200
The grass is sprouting.

252
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,930
And that is worth celebrating.

253
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:08,065
If you're a springbok,

254
00:40:08,065 --> 00:40:09,970
that means pranking.

255
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,260
We still don't know exactly why they do this.

256
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:43,430
The simplest answer is that they're dancing for joy.

257
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:07,820
Africa's most southerly tip.

258
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,250
This is where the two great ocean currents,

259
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:15,120
the warm Agulhas and the cold Benguela,

260
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,130
crash into one another.

261
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:26,680
And this collision in itself draws in life in abundance.

262
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:45,390
A super pod of hunting dolphins 5,000 strong.

263
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,410
And shadowing them,

264
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,270
Africa's biggest predator.

265
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,980
A Bryde's whale.

266
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:17,010
This female is 15 metres long

267
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,640
and weighs more than a whole family of elephants.

268
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:37,930
The dolphins are in pursuit of sardines,millions of them!

269
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:43,230
But these cold water fish are heading towards

270
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:46,070
an impenetrable barrier of warm water

271
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:50,180
that they will not cross,the Agulhas Current.

272
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,010
They're trapped.

273
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,490
And that gives the whale her chance.

274
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,600
But the sardines are so speedy

275
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:29,230
that the whale only catches a few with each pass.

276
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,620
More and more hunters arrive.

277
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:52,680
The whale needs the other hunters to push the fish upwards,

278
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,260
forcing them against the surface.

279
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,670
Now,they have nowhere to escape.

280
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:28,310
With each lumbering turn,she loses precious time,

281
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:31,300
time that favours the more nimble.

282
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,550
The Bryde's whale probably knows

283
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:55,760
that this opportunity will last less than five minutes

284
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:59,870
and with the last few lunges,

285
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:01,790
she finally cashes in.

286
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:59,080
The forces that triggered this great event have also shaped the fortunes

287
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,460
of life far beyond this particular battleground.

288
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:09,380
Without these currents,Southern Africa would be a desert.

289
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,495
But combined,the very different powers of the Agulhas and the Benguela

290
00:47:19,496 --> 00:47:24,540
have transformed the Cape into a land where life can flourish.

291
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,125

292
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:45,750

291
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:51,860
The Comoro Islands of Africa's east coast

292
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:55,020
are a haven for green turtles.

293
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:02,370
Every year,a million turtles hatch on these beaches,

294
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:07,590
but the chances of any one of them surviving is tiny.

295
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,390
The Africa team came here to try and capture the dramatic

296
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:23,540
first few minutes in the lives of these baby turtles.

297
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,870
It was to be both a technical,

298
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:29,140
and surprisingly emotional challenge.

299
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,350
It's only when you get down on the eye level of the baby turtle

300
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,180
that you realise what an enormous journey it's got to make

301
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,510
down over the beach,and it really is quite epic.

302
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:52,560
That's fine.Oh,yeah,that's lovely.

303
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:56,160
It's using all these complicated,heavy bits of equipment

304
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,830
which hopefully will enable us to get into the world of

307
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,820

305
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:01,170
a turtle which is just a few inches long.

306
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:14,670
As they break out of all the soft sand,they hit the hard sand

307
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:16,610
and that's where the real sprint takes place.

308
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,130
They must be desperate to hit that water,

309
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,990
because you can see the sea's just over the horizon.

310
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,400
We're following them all the way down

311
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:26,710
and you do kind of get involved with them and cheering them on.

312
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,310
OK,slow down a bit.Slow down.

313
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:37,810
And suddenly all these crows come flocking in

314
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:39,460
and start picking them off

315
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:42,470
and you just think,that's just so unfair.

316
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,160
Lots more coming in.Just loads coming in now.

317
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,400
I do,God,I feel for them.

318
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,870
You know it's really quite upsetting

319
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:54,830
and particularly when you're looking through the camera

320
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:58,080
and I'm just filling frame with a turtle running down the beach,

321
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,290
then suddenly from nowhere,

322
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:01,800
a beak comes in and whoosh,that's it.

323
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:05,270
That turtle's no more.

324
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:14,170
The turtles that escape the perils of the beach

325
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:17,530
still have to face pounding surf.

326
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:26,470
But,at last,they're in their element.

327
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,910
More than can be said for the crew.

331
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:36,410

328
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,750
It's a bit embarrassing.

329
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:42,110
Beaten by something that's less than a day old.

330
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,630
When you see hatchlings get off the beach and going in the white water,

335
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:50,230

331
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:50,230
you'd think they'd just get obliterated.

332
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,140
They just punch through the water; they do get flung around

333
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,550
but then they just right themselves,

334
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:00,560
keep on swimming and they're ahead of you,

335
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,570
coming out the back of the wave

336
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:04,700
and it's amazing.

337
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:08,270
You're seeing all these baby turtles getting picked off,

338
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:11,220
left,right and centre,but they just keep going.

339
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,590
They are just so resilient.

340
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:23,610
And that made what happened next so distressing.

341
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,160
A particularly high spring tide flooded the beach.

342
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,120
Any baby turtles still in their nests

343
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,130
would be lucky to survive.

349
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:39,400

344
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,880
It means that basically anything below that line's going to be gone.

345
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,624
Let's hope and pray it's not,

346
00:51:46,624 --> 00:51:46,850
but...

347
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:50,900
As you say,we don't know,let's wait and see.

348
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,410
All across the world,turtles are in decline.

349
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:06,050
Their eggs are stolen,

350
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:08,670
the adults are hunted for their flesh

351
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:11,180
and they drown in fishing nets.

352
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:16,070
But here in the Comoros,they have friends.

353
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:19,280
It's amazing here in Itsamia.

354
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,840
It's just a really heartening story of

355
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,720
how the local people are doing everything they can

356
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,670
to protect sort of what they think of as their turtles.

357
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:33,190
And some of the baby turtles have survived the flood tide.

363
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,770

364
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:37,990

365
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,780

366
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,810

367
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,780

368
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,840

369
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,770

370
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:58,760

358
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,230
The whole village comes to help the hatchlings.

359
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:08,390
But the most important effort is to protect the adults

360
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:11,610
from outsiders who would hunt them for their meat.

361
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:18,270
They've taken it upon themselves to really police the beaches around here

362
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:21,390
and make sure that poaching is kept to a minimum.

363
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:27,670
The selfless protection these people provide means

364
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:29,940
that this is one of the few places in the world

365
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,670
where turtle numbers are actually increasing.

366
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:38,900
And remarkably,here in Itsamia,

367
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:43,080
the population has in fact doubled in the last decade.

368
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,430
As the shoot was coming to the end,

369
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:54,010
cameraman Kevin Flay noticed that

370
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:59,310
some of the turtles that made it through the surf faced one last danger.

371
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:01,870
I'm getting shots of a kite which is flying down

372
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:04,200
and taking turtles off the water surface.

373
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:07,700
That was a part of the story we had to tell.

374
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:16,050
The aim is for us to be underwater,looking straight up as this happens,

375
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:20,170
and that's actually really quite hard.

376
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:25,470
OK. Three, two, one...

377
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,400
Undeterred,the crew got into position.

378
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:38,250
There we go,the kite's up.

379
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:53,340
You can't see where you're going

380
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,160
because my head's glued to this viewfinder,

381
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:58,170
so I'm banging into rocks and things like that.

382
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:01,940
I'm really just trying to keep the turtle in shot.

383
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,430
Something came in then.

384
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:22,920
She came in and swooped down over the water's surface.

385
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:24,230
And you could see the kite from underwater?

386
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:26,260
I could see it,I could see the shape.

400
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,280

401
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,730

387
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,540
Probably that's the best of both worlds,

388
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,750
because we got our lovely underwater shot of a kite

389
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:39,450
and the turtle gets away!

390
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:44,970
This lucky hatchling isn't the only one.

391
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,990
With the help of the village of Itsamia,

392
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:52,220
thousands more have a chance to make it to the open ocean.

393
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,880
It's only really local populations that can actually support

394
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,700
and sustain this conservation work.

395
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,880
If it comes from the roots upwards,

396
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:01,440
then it's got a chance of success.

397
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:03,690
You know,I think it's amazing,I really do,

398
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:05,660
the fact that they do this and you know

399
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,770
we should see it more often around the world.

400
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,410
It's hard not to admire these extraordinary little creatures

401
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:16,950
as they battle against such odds.

402
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,730
This baby turtle won't touch land again

403
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:30,380
until she returns to the very same island to lay her own eggs.

404
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:32,900
With luck,she'll find the beach

405
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:36,940
still protected by the people of Itsamia.

406
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,440
Next time,the vast cauldron of the Sahara Desert.

422
00:56:56,490 --> 00:57:01,930

407
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:09,800
To survive here,life is stretched to its very limits.

408
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,320
Simply being tough isn't enough.

409
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:21,060
Only the most extraordinary creatures will triumph.

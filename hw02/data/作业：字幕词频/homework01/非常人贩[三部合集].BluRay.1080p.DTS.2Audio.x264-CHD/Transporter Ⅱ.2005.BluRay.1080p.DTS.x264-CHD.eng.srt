1
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,780
I'm so sorry. Can you help me? My tire...

2
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,490
Sorry. I have an appointment. I don't like to be late.

3
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,200
Well, would you rather be late or dead?

4
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,960
-You don't want to do this.        - Step out of the car.

5
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,500
Whoo! Let's go, fellas!

6
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,560
Come on, baby! Yes!

7
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,040
Take it easy. The car's brand-new.

8
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,230
-No problem, buddy. I got this.        - Baby, let's ride. Time to go.

9
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,650
-Your parents know the company you keep?        - Shut up.

10
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,790
-This shit ain't working.        - It's coded.

11
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,840
-What's the code?        - I can't give you that.

12
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,220
We'll have to beat it out of you. Get out the car.

13
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,310
Come on, man. What you got for me?

14
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,240
Kick your ass!

15
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,690
Hold on.

16
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,160
It just came out of the dry cleaner's.

17
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:20,230
Hands up. Stop moving or I will shoot you.

18
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,910
Don't you have homework to do?

19
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,180
-Why don't you go and do it?        - OK. I'm sorry.

20
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,260
Late.

21
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,660
Hey! Hey!

22
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,620
-The game, the game, the game!        - What's the first rule on entering a man's car?

23
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,480
-Respect a man's car, a man respects you.        - Rule number two.

24
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,790
-Greet the man. Good afternoon, Frank.        - Good afternoon, Jack.

25
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,520
-Can we play the game?        - I should think you'd be tired after school.

26
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,340
-You're afraid I'm gonna win.        - You'll be too worn out to do your homework.

27
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,410
-It's Friday. I don't have any homework.        - In that case, the game.

28
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,980
-Yes!        - But first, what's the third rule of the car?

29
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,110
Good.

30
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,170
Five points. I'm white, I'm round, but I'm not always around.

31
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:43,180
-A tennis ball?        - Tennis balls are yellow.

32
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,770
Four points.

33
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,670
Sometimes I'm half, sometimes whole. Sometimes a slice is all you know.

34
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,050
-A loaf of bread?        - No.

35
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,060
Three points. Sometimes I'm light, sometimes dark, Sometimes both.

36
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,060
-I know. A light bulb.        - No.

37
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,430
-A pizza!        - No.

38
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,590
Audrey! Stop walking away from me.

39
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,840
Listen, we've got to finish this conversation.

40
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,100
Where's he going?

41
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,900
OK, look at me. Last clue for all the points.

42
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,440
Everyone wants to walk on me, but only a happy few ever have.

43
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,570
Take your time.

44
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,830
-Hey, bud.        - Mom, it's the game. I'm trying to think.

45
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,900
-Sorry. Hey, Frank. How are you today?        - Well, Mrs Billings.

46
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,930
-Can I team up with Mom?        - I don't know. It's not in the rules.

47
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,970
Come on. What's the point in having rules if you can't bend 'em?

48
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,030
-OK. Just this once.        - Yeah!

49
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,800
All right. Give me some clues.

50
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:17,310
It's round, but not always around. It's light sometimes, dark sometimes, or both.

51
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,940
Everyone wants to walk on it, but only a happy few ever have.

52
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,550
-That is a hard one.        - Tell me about it.

53
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,180
-The moon!        - Correct.

54
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,470
Good job. All right. Come on.

55
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,060
-See you Monday.        - Bye, Frank. Thanks.

56
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,500
-Keep your snacks in the kitchen.        - Bye, Mom.

57
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,960
Hey, he's really taken to you in the month you've been with us.

58
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,980
-Likewise.        - Too bad you can't stay on when Tony's back.

59
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,310
It was just a favor. I don't usually do this sort of ajob.

60
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,490
I thought you were a professional driver.

61
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,630
A different kind of driving.

62
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,820
Well, we're all gonna miss you when you're gone.

63
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,090
And

64
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,780
thank you for what you did.

65
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,030
For what?

66
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,340
For turning the car around so that Jack wouldn't have to see us fighting.

67
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,190
-You really know kids, don't you?        - I know fighting.

68
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,810
He hasn't seen Jack in months,

69
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,060
and when he gets back, all I hear is what I'm doing wrong.

70
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:35,650
You'd think that after being separated for a year that he would...

71
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,440
I'm sorry. You don't have to hear this.

72
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:46,230
It's OK. For what it's worth, I think you're doing a greatjob with Jack.

73
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,640
Thank you.

74
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,610
Any time I can be of help, if there's anything you need.

75
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,620
That's really sweet of you, Frank.

76
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,580
I might have to take you up on it.

77
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,480
I almost forgot. I'm supposed to take Jack to the doctor tomorrow morning for a checkup,

78
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:11,320
but I'm organizing a party for him, even though his birthday's not until next week.

79
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,530
So, while I decorate and his friends arrive, I was thinking, if you wouldn't mind...

80
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,740
-I'll take him.        - I feel funny cutting into your weekend.

81
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,960
I'm just picking up a friend at the airport later on in the day.

82
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,280
-That's nice.        - What is?

83
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,540
The guys on security say you're a bit of a Ioner.

84
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:36,290
-So it's just nice to hear you have a friend.        - He's not really a friend.

85
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,580
He's French.

86
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,400
I'll call you back.

87
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,610
Audrey, I'd like to finish our conversation.

88
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,290
If anything comes up before then, you have my cell.

89
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:58,080
-Nothing will come up, Mrs Billings.        - Audrey.

90
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,860
Audrey.

91
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,620
-Yeah, hello?        - Confirmed for tomorrow. 9am.

92
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,050
Tomorrow, 9am. Only change -the driver'll be taking him, not the mother.

93
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,420
Even better.

94
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,470
Vasily?

95
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,560
-Is it stable?        - Yes, it's stable.

96
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,190
And the antidote?

97
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,220
See you tomorrow.

98
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,030
The drug-enforcement ministers of six Latin American countries

99
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,280
arrived in Miami for a summit meeting...

100
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,560
Yeah... Martin, Frank. 1156 Palmeadow.

101
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:26,550
I'm waiting for an express delivery. That's what you told me 45 minutes ago.

102
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,490
I don't need anything else. Just get me the pizza.

103
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,180
-I'm not paying for that...        - Hi.

104
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,270
Hi.

105
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,860
So, it's one medium pie, no mozzarella, extra olives and extra anchovies,

106
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,160
which amounts to $11.95.

107
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,850
-I hope you're hungry.        - You have no idea.

108
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,180
I apologize for the delay, sir.

109
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,810
Mrs Billings.

110
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,760
Audrey.

111
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,690
-What are you doing?        - What does it look like I'm doing?

112
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,960
-Have you been drinking?        - A little.

113
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:12,180
You said if I needed anything.

114
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:16,280
-I can't.        - Why? Because of who I am?

115
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,810
Because of who I am.

116
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,960
I feel so lost, so confused.

117
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,380
Who isn't?

118
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,560
Thank you, Frank.

119
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,100
For the time and...

120
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,870
your respect.

121
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,860
I think it's what I needed the most.

122
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,420
Bye.

123
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,730
-Am I gonna get a shot?        - I don't know.

124
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,730
-Jeez. We're not open yet.        - I need to see the doctor immediately.

125
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,150
Right. Dr Koblin, if you'll come out here, please. We have an issue.

126
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,550
You'll have to state the medical problem.

127
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,820
Actually, my problem's not medical. It's psychological.

128
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,390
Yes, Laura. What seems to be the problem?

129
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,000
Me.

130
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,980
I hate shots.

131
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,870
Number one, there's no guarantee you're getting a shot.

132
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,820
There's no sense getting worked up over something that might not happen.

133
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,990
-Give me the good news.        - Doctor said I'm cured.

134
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:48,570
-Frank, it hurts a lot.        - I'd never let anyone hurt you a lot.

135
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,500
-Promise?        - You know my fourth rule?

136
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,760
Never make a promise you can't keep. Come on.

137
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,820
Close the door.

138
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,310
Come on.

139
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:19,110
-May I help you?        - Jack Billings to see Dr Koblin.

140
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,420
He's out sick today. He'll be seeing Dr Tyberg.

141
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,230
-I like Dr Koblin.        - Don't worry. Dr Tyberg's very nice.

142
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,960
Just take him into room 3.

143
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,800
-Where's Laura?        - Who?

144
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,500
-You're standing at her desk.        - That Laura. She's out sick too.

145
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,520
There's a lot of flu going around. Now, come on. Doctor's got a busy day.

146
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,740
Come on. It'll be over before you know it.

147
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,290
I'm Dr Tyberg.

148
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,430
Can't I wait for my doctor?

149
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,720
Your doctor was called away on an emergency.

150
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,730
-The nurse said he had the flu.        - That was the emergency.

151
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:03,120
He came down with flu, very quickly. So, the sooner we start, the sooner we finish.

152
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,590
Come. I show you something very cool.

153
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:10,170
I'm sorry. Doctor-patient privacy in room.

154
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,460
You can wait in reception area, or glass of water, or...

155
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,730
Hey, trust me. I am doctor.

156
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,850
Please. It's phone.

157
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:28,370
-Yeah?        - Allo, allo. Frank? I am here.

158
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,270
-You're early.        - Yeah, we had fantastic tailwinds.

159
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,960
Put two hours on my vacation, just like that.

160
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,820
From now on, it's the only way I'm flying. Tailwinds or nothing.

161
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,720
Glad you made it.

162
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:47,140
Sorry, Dr Dunietz is not in today. Call back Monday.

163
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,390
I'm a little tied up. You mind taking a cab? You have the address, yes?

164
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:03,500
Oh, thank you. I heard the fish down here is fantastic. I could make us a bouillabaisse.

165
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,280
You like bouillabaisse, no?

166
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,450
I gotta go.

167
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,660
Frank!

168
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,430
Maybe we'll wait for his regular doctor.

169
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,810
It's important that he receives immunizations.

170
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,670
-I'm sure. But a week won't make a difference.        - No, we're doing it now.

171
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,990
Get going, Jack!

172
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,280
Look at me.

173
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,340
-Remember my promise?        - Yes.

174
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,430
-It's me!        - Get out!

175
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,660
Frank.

176
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,560
Shit.

177
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:15,050
The patient's not cooperating. Prep the vehicle.

178
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,440
Come on, hurry.

179
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,090
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be OK.

180
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,520
Freeze! Put your guns on the ground!

181
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,020
-Si.        - They got away.

182
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,860
-Cazzo!        - Plan B?

183
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,080
Yes. Plan B.

184
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,440
You made it.

185
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:43,170
-Oh, what's that?        - Jack's birthday present.

186
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,530
Baseball uniform, cleats, glove and a bat.

187
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:52,570
-It's his favorite sport.        - It was. Last year.

188
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,550
He's on a soccer team now. He's actually really good.

189
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:59,080
-You know, you should see him sometime.        - Hello.

190
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:03,470
-Mr and Mrs Billings! They're coming!        - Hide, everyone. Hide!

191
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,780
-Yes.        - Good morning, Mr Driver.

192
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,570
-Who is this?        - Look in your rear-view mirror and you'll see.

193
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,430
I know what you're thinking. Bulletproof glass.

194
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:25,740
So tell me, in your experience -which, judging from your performance at the office,

195
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:30,090
goes way beyond just driving children to school -

196
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,080
does bulletproof glass stop a 7.62 armor-piercing round?

197
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,570
Frank, why have you stopped the car?

198
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,040
Don't look, they are triangulated over 300 feet away.

199
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,450
Frank, pick up.

200
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:49,790
You screwed up my plan, so I am going to tell you how to set things right.

201
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,490
Someone is going to appear in a few seconds.

202
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,640
Let her in.

203
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,050
Driver.

204
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,460
Good boy.

205
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,380
Hi.

206
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,290
Leave it on.

207
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,990
Personally, I hate kids. I don't know what your feelings are on the subject,

208
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,500
but if you ever want to have any, make no moves but the moves I tell you to make.

209
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:46,330
You're in her hands now. They can be gentle hands, but they can be the hands from hell.

210
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,870
-Trust me on this one.        - Trust him on this one.

211
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,870
Now, drive.

212
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,670
Make a left.

213
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,440
I said left.

214
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:03,870
Listen, we keep doing this your way, they're gonna catch us.

215
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,100
-Do this my way, no one gets hurt.        - Where's the fun in that?

216
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,360
Let's save the fun for later.

217
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,290
Not bad.

218
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,980
Didn't your mother teach you to say thank you?

219
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,150
She tried, and failed miserably.

220
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,050
-I think we lost them.        - Think again.

221
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,400
Thought complete. Let's go.

222
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:54,520
You can't find him? He's one man in one car. He's a chauffeur, for chrissakes.

223
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,960
Not exactly, sir. There's a possibility he was in on it.

224
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:00,940
-That's impossible.        - How would you know?

225
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:05,160
He could have been setting this up the whole time, and you wouldn't have known.

226
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,300
-And you are an expert on knowing people.        - His background.

227
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:14,760
He's ex-Special Forces. Headed a commando unit. Specialized in search and destroy.

228
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:19,160
Been in and out of Lebanon, Syria, Sudan. The man is a hunter.

229
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,880
I don't care what his skills are or where he's from.

230
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,060
This is not a war zone, this is an American city!

231
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,260
Where's my son?

232
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,970
Last stop. All out.

233
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:04,570
You're quite a guy. Another time, another place -

234
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,460
you and me, baby, the pleasure we could have.

235
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,980
Beauty.

236
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,290
Frank.

237
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,580
Frank!

238
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,880
Frank!

239
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:31,070
Not what you expected when you reported for work this morning, is it, Frank? No?

240
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,210
Is that what passes for wit in this circle?

241
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:38,020
In this circle, my friend, wit is not a requirement of the job.

242
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,880
Brutality, yes. An ability to inflict pain, absolutely.

243
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:47,330
A certain psychotic, moral ignorance, blind obedience, all required.

244
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,490
-But not wit. How was it?        - Fun.

245
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:53,100
Only the beginning, my love.

246
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,300
-What's this all about?        - A timely question.

247
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,300
Max...

248
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,730
Pardon me.

249
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,190
Put me on the speaker so you don't have to repeat the instructions.

250
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,180
In the next two hours, you'll get five million dollars in $100 bills.

251
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:22,070
Put them in a waterproof suitcase, go to the Bayfront Park -personally.

252
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,620
There will be a blue Chrysler parked there. Place the suitcase in the trunk, and leave.

253
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,720
I don't know if I can get five million dollars in two hours.

254
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,790
I read the newspapers. When you were appointed to your current position,

255
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:38,890
your net worth exceeded 100 million dollars, so you won't even feel the bite.

256
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,680
What guarantee do I have that you won't harm my son?

257
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,830
"Guarantee"? Mr Billings, I am not a car dealer.

258
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:50,390
Don't let the charming accent and my impeccable syntax mislead you.

259
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:54,130
I live in the jungle, and in the jungle you either eat or be eaten.

260
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:57,050
But, in the spirit of business, here is the guarantee.

261
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:01,740
Ten minutes past the deadline, if the money doesn't arrive, I send a finger.

262
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:05,560
20 minutes, a hand. 30 minutes, a foot.

263
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,340
Sounds like we have a deal.

264
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,740
You have a deal.

265
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,780
Could we please speak to our son?

266
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,950
Mommy!

267
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:24,040
You have two hours, Mr Billings. Starting now.

268
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,600
-Just get my son!        - All right.

269
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,570
Frank, you promised you wouldn't let anybody hurt me!

270
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:37,870
-You promised!        - Never make promises you can't keep.

271
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,250
I don't. It's one of my rules.

272
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,660
Wow.

273
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:49,210
Bravo. A man who leads his life by rules. In my world rules are meant to be broken.

274
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:54,300
-Not mine.        - You're gonna have to make an exception.

275
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,390
Go.

276
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,350
Prego.

277
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,750
-Go.        - Hey, driver!

278
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:48,960
No, no, wait, wait. A little distance between us isn't a bad thing.

279
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,530
Andiamo!

280
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,870
Now.

281
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,450
-Hello.        - It's me.

282
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:44,620
-You son of a bitch.        - Look, I had nothing to do with this.

283
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,240
-One scratch on his head...        - Let me speak to who's in charge.

284
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,620
-This is US Marshal Stappleton.        - Act fast. There are three boats.

285
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,910
-Tell us where you are.        - Get a plane. They're heading north.

286
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,970
-Tell me where you are.        - Just tell us where you are!

287
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,900
Hello, Frank?

288
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,550
Got it.

289
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,990
-Allo.        - Tarconi, it's me. Get out of the house.

290
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:38,260
-I was just putting the madeleines...        - Forget the madeleines, just get out.

291
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,790
-And go where?        - Anywhere. Go to the beach.

292
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,330
Oh, the beach. The famous Miami Beach.

293
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,400
Oh, my dream. I would love to go to the beach.

294
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,260
Maybe not.

295
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,910
-Freeze! Who the fuck are you?        - I'm the cook.

296
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,600
This is a mistake. A terrible mistake.

297
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:10,190
Why we can't all just get along, you know?

298
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:29,440
-Hello.        - It's Frank. Pretend it's someone else.

299
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,460
Hi, Susan.

300
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,240
No, I'm just here at home.

301
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,320
I didn't do it, Audrey. She had a gun on Jack. I had no choice.

302
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:45,330
Yeah, I saw that. What do you know?

303
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:48,230
-It's more than a kidnapping.        - They asked for a ransom.

304
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:54,250
The doctors were fake. They were trying to give Jack a shot. When I interrupted them...

305
00:37:55,910 --> 00:38:02,160
I promised Jack I wouldn't let anyone hurt him. I'm not gonna break that promise.

306
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,410
-Frank.        - I'll call you back.

307
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,340
Audrey.

308
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:15,450
-Is everything all right?        - That's a pretty stupid question to ask, Jeff.

309
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:25,580
All right. So tell me again, Inspector Tarconi,

310
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:31,210
why you didn't immediately identify yourself as a police officer.

311
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:37,430
I was overwhelmed by the effectiveness of your operation,

312
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,680
the sophistication of your equipment.

313
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:46,170
You know, I work in a small office in a small town. We only have small crimes.

314
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:50,030
-I was a little insecure.        - You and Frank Martin are friends, right?

315
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:56,020
A friend? I wouldn't say exactly a friend. I know him, we have a relationship.

316
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,160
A long relationship?

317
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,890
-Not so long.        - They found you cooking in his house.

318
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,330
-I'm French!        - So?

319
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:07,390
We don't need to know someone a long time in order to cook for them. It's an icebreaker.

320
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:12,300
Take, for example, this sandwich and coffee you so graciously offer me.

321
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,030
Well, pardon me to think so, but it's not very good.

322
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,800
What has that got to do with anything?

323
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,010
Do you have a kitchen?

324
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:53,630
Don't move. Smith!

325
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,710
Drop it.

326
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,470
-Is this safe?        - Look over your shoulder.

327
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,080
We got you covered.

328
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:55,570
As my mother used to say, a meal is only limited by your imagination.

329
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,130
-Creme brulee et croque monsieur.        - Cream brulee?

330
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,460
-Cock?        - Croque monsieur.

331
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,540
-Oui?        - Where are you?

332
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:08,870
-Cooking.        - Cooking. Can you talk?

333
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,130
-Oh, speak of the devil. My mother.        - Mom.

334
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:15,430
Please, do you mind?

335
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,950
Thank you.

336
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,040
Oui, Maman. Je suis tres bien arrive.

337
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:23,070
Oui, tres tres bien, merci. Oui. Ah, oui, c'est une tres jolie ville.

338
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:28,680
-May I ask who you're cooking for?        - For the US marshals.

339
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:34,070
Once they found my badge, they were very polite. They gave me a coffee and a sandwich.

340
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:36,830
You wouldn't believe what passes for food here.

341
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:42,230
I am correcting the situation while they wait for my chief to call and confirm everything.

342
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:47,010
Of course, that might take a while. He's never there.

343
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:50,380
-Anything about me?        - They are very interested about you.

344
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:54,320
They want to know where you are. Where are you?

345
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:57,500
Nowhere for very long. Listen, hold on.

346
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,020
Do you have access to a computer?

347
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,740
Easier than having access to something decent to eat.

348
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:30,620
-Oh, handsome fellow. Who is he?        - Do they have an ID program?

349
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:36,440
Forgive me. I'm not so used to this system. At home, there is one computer for ten of us.

350
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,240
So, how is it with you, Frank?

351
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,470
-It's a complicated story.        - Ah, you mean you are in the shit?

352
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:44,980
-You might say that.        - In other words, your natural state.

353
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,550
Voila.

354
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:53,140
A Russian biologist with advanced degrees from the state laboratory.

355
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:58,810
-Do we have an address?        - Miami, Boca West, King Street, number 11.

356
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,090
Get out!

357
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,330
-What are you doing?        - Trying to catch a bus.

358
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:23,780
Come on.

359
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:43,940
What are you doing, driver? Not so good on the water, hey?

360
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,560
Stop it!

361
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,390
-OK. OK.        - Tell me about the doctor's office.

362
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,880
-What doctor's office?        - Where you tried to stick the kid with this.

363
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:29,100
You want to tell me?

364
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,560
Do you know what you have done?

365
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:46,620
Obviously something not conducive to your good health, which is all I needed to know.

366
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:49,290
Have a good life...

367
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:51,610
what's left of it.

368
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:11,990
-Outpost to base. The ransom is still there.        - Thanks.

369
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,970
-The ransom hasn't been picked up.        - What does that mean?

370
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:17,350
-Right now, that means nothing yet.        - What if it's notjust a kidnapping?

371
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:21,920
-I've worked on many kidnapping cases.        - If they don't take it I won't get my son back.

372
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,940
Don't make this any more complicated than it is.

373
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:28,930
I'm not making this complicated, Jefferson. It's because of yourjob.

374
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:32,820
-What does my job have to do with this?        - It has everything to do with it.

375
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,240
Because you became famous, we became the targets.

376
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:41,950
No matter what you think, the only one who's out there trying to get Jack back is Frank.

377
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,560
-The chauffeur?        - You spoke to Frank Martin?

378
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:50,150
-What the hell are you doing talking to him?        - He's the last person who saw Jack alive!

379
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,170
We've found the boy.

380
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,160
Hard drive blew.

381
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,210
-Get another one in there.        - Yes, sir.

382
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,830
-How long is it gonna take?        - Ma'am, we're going as fast as we can.

383
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,320
-He can suffocate in there.        - Stay calm.

384
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:31,450
-It's my son!        - Let them work.

385
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:34,510
-Are you gonna sit and do nothing?        - They're experts.

386
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:38,290
Everyone is an expert! I've had it with all of you!

387
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:39,780
Audrey!

388
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,440
Audrey!

389
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,250
Audrey!

390
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,290
Audrey!

391
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,910
Mommy!

392
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,330
Jack!

393
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:05,140
Are you OK?

394
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,770
There you go, little buddy.

395
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,840
Breathe. Come on, breathe.

396
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:25,330
-You're the devil.        - I wish.

397
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:08,220
-Shit! Dimitri, you scare shit in me.        - Where is Sonovitch?

398
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:11,150
-In chamber.        - I need to speak with him.

399
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:15,250
Sit down! Listen Panasonic. Is rap music, is good.

400
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:57,530
-What was that?        - I don't know.

401
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,350
Shit!

402
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:02,510
-What are you doing here?        - I need antidote.

403
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,610
The driver, he inject me with virus. Look!

404
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,920
-Dimitri, where would he get the virus?        - The one we left in doctor's surgery.

405
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,890
Please, I need antidote. I am sick.

406
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:16,990
Calm down. You're not sick. You have four hours before the virus is active.

407
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,360
You know that. You worked on creating it.

408
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:22,860
-Open fridge.        - I'm telling you...

409
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:28,690
Izvinite. Open fridge. Open the fridge!

410
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:32,870
Yes. Insurance policy. How many you have?

411
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,250
Two doses. Enough for Tipov and myself.

412
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:43,040
Tipov's policy canceled. There is one for me.

413
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,120
And I want it now. Come on.

414
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:50,060
Come on. Let's do it!

415
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,880
-Let's not.        - Who are you?

416
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,120
-There is enough for two of us.        - You don't need it.

417
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,790
-But you injected me.        - With water.

418
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:01,480
-I'm not sick.        - You're not sick.

419
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,320
-Water.        - Water.

420
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,210
Son of bitch!

421
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,730
Good. Our problem is solved. One dose for each of us.

422
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:17,760
-It's not for us.        - One for you and one for the child. Touching.

423
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,900
My patience is about to run out.

424
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,690
-Tell me about the virus.        - OK. What do you want know?

425
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:30,960
Everything. What is it?

426
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,790
It is A recombinant retroimmune double-polymorphing effluent.

427
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:38,670
The child will die. Anyone he breathes on will die, and then it's over.

428
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:43,220
-What do you mean, "It's over?" -The virus goes inert after 24 hours.

429
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:47,070
Thanks for the lesson. Now give me the vials.

430
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:52,740
You really want to play superhero, don't you? Well, let's see if you can fly.

431
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,420
-You OK?        - I'm OK.

432
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:42,020
There's nothing to worry about. It's just a simple viral infection combined with stress.

433
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:45,800
It should pass in a day or two. I gave him something to help him sleep.

434
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:50,180
-Call me if anything arises.        - Thank you, Doctor.

435
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:55,400
You know, Audrey, all this has...

436
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:59,300
well, it's made me realize what a fool I've been.

437
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:01,630
With Jack...

438
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,370
and with you.

439
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:11,570
-Are you OK?        - Mr Billings, we're running late.

440
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:16,800
I'll be right out. I'd like to come by after the conference,

441
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:21,420
check on Jack.

442
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:23,720
Check on you.

443
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,410
Good. I'll see you soon.

444
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,660
They're here if you need them.

445
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:47,390
-Are you all right, ma'am?        - I'm fine.

446
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:53,580
-Hello.        - It's me.

447
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,510
-Are you OK?        - Go to your bedroom.

448
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,680
Hi, Susan. How are you?

449
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:03,390
I'm alone. Where are you, Frank?

450
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,680
Turn around.

451
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,230
Frank, you were wrong. It was a kidnapping. Jack is fine.

452
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:24,490
Jack's been infected with a virus. Anyone who comes into contact with him will die.

453
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:28,370
What are you telling me?

454
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:33,000
-Are you telling me my son is gonna die?        - No, he's not.

455
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:39,270
Once incubated, the virus becomes airborne, so anyone he breathes on gets infected.

456
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:42,120
Your son was a weapon. The target is his father.

457
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:47,180
-Jefferson? Well, why?        - The conference. It's the only logical answer.

458
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,360
Every drug-enforcement agency in one room.

459
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:53,460
Your husband breathes, the room dies.

460
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:03,130
You gotta trust me, Audrey.

461
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:12,370
Can you get to him?

462
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:15,380
-What are you gonna do?        - Find the guy responsible.

463
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:18,850
He has more of this. For you and everybody else.

464
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,900
For you now.

465
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:41,130
We have a guest.

466
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:46,120
-You're burning up.        - I'm OK.

467
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:48,530
You gotta go. Go.

468
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:53,030
Don't move!

469
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,680
-Is the governor here?        - Everybody's here.

470
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:43,900
The governor, delegates from all over the world.

471
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:47,440
-Just a second. Hello.        - Jefferson, you can't go to the conference.

472
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:50,930
-Is everything all right? ...to give him a deadly virus...

473
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:54,070
-I can't hear you. I'm inside.        - I've got it, and so do you.

474
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,690
-I can't hear you.        - Their plan is to infect everyone there.

475
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:00,590
-I'm gonna have to call you back.        - Jeff!

476
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,770
Mr Billings, are you all right?

477
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:09,150
-I'm all right. Come on, let's go.        - You sure?

478
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:33,750
-Allo.        - You still a guest of the government?

479
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:38,860
They gave me the five-star accommodation. Let me guess -you need my help.

480
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:41,340
Are you near the computer?

481
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,840
It's practically my pillow. So, how do you want to start?

482
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:51,310
-I don't know. I have nothing.        - My favorite type of investigation.

483
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:54,330
Let's see. Alors.

484
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:58,160
I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce you to my delegates...

485
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:02,780
Breathe. That's right, breathe, my friend, breathe.

486
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:06,200
Once these bastards are out of the way

487
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:12,630
and their agreements are dead and buried, you know what the biggest problem will be?

488
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:16,360
-What?        - Counting the money.

489
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:23,400
I can't wait for tomorrow.

490
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,710
Gianni Chellini.

491
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:35,500
Hires himself out to anyone looking to make trouble -Red Brigade, Shining Path.

492
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:41,080
Someone accessed a database on the 15th floor.

493
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:45,150
That's Gonzalez. He's on vacation.

494
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:50,010
He was behind the hostage-taking of the OPEC ministers in Geneva.

495
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:53,560
It was a nice piece of work.

496
01:02:57,790 --> 01:03:00,070
-Give me an address.        - Miami, East Highland,

497
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,400
Pelican Drive, number 26900.

498
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:05,420
-We've found the car.        - You're one great cop, Tarconi.

499
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:09,400
Thank you for the compliment. Now I'm going back to sleep.

500
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,430
Maybe not.

501
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,770
-Bumbaclaat, man! Move out the way!        - Move over.

502
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:21,980
I'll do ya!

503
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:32,890
Mommy.

504
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:38,350
-Honey. You feeling better?        - A little bit.

505
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,740
Why don't you try to go back to sleep, OK?

506
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:49,570
Ma'am, are you all right?

507
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,910
Jefferson, are you OK?

508
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:10,050
OK, do it.

509
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:26,050
-What are you doing?        - You know, last night got me thinking.

510
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:28,620
How do we transport the antidote safely?

511
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:32,170
We need something that won't break or can't be stolen.

512
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:36,180
Something totally secure. Me.

513
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:46,420
Impressive. Get dressed.

514
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:49,030
Stop him.

515
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:54,490
-These your friends?        - Not yet.

516
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:06,440
-Where'd they go?        - The garage.

517
01:06:07,850 --> 01:06:09,690
-I'm out of ammo.        - Me too.

518
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:11,860
-So am I.        - Where are the reloads?

519
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:13,440
The garage.

520
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:17,330
Check the house. Go, go, go!

521
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,160
Get him!

522
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:03,310
-What d'you want me to do?        - Keep the meter running.

523
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:09,940
Bye. Don't worry, baby. You're safe now. You're safe.

524
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:13,930
You're so beautiful. Remind me of my yellow poom-poom rider.

525
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,500
Don't move.

526
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:34,670
-Oh, Mr Driver.        - I'll blow you into tomorrow.

527
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:38,660
Then, I'd bleed what you came for all over the floor. You wouldn't want this.

528
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:42,380
Not after you worked so hard trying to get to the antidote.

529
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,960
Take a good look, Frank Martin.

530
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:48,580
I'm a cure for what ails you. I'm the only cure for what ails you.

531
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:51,830
I am the antidote.

532
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,140
Nice try. I'm impressed. I didn't give you enough credit.

533
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:59,200
-It took more than a driver to figure this out.        - I haven't figured it all out yet.

534
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,690
Perhaps I can help you. What part are you a little thick on?

535
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:05,990
You. Why?

536
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:13,480
That's the easy part. It's a business deal, pure and simple. I'm for hire to the highest bidder.

537
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,260
In this case, the highest bidder was the Colombian cocaine cartels

538
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:20,630
that wanted these pesky lawmen off their backs.

539
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:24,040
You think killing politicians will make things easier for them?

540
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:27,540
That's not my problem. I was hired to do ajob.

541
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:32,120
I did the job, like you. Just my pay is better.

542
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:35,950
My hair and my suit, too.

543
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,890
Oh, Lola.

544
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:43,380
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a plane to catch.

545
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,600
Kill him.

546
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:48,370
Ciao, ciao.

547
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,520
-Don't even blink.        - What's in this for you?

548
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:56,610
Pleasure...

549
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:01,880
in killing you.

550
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:42,070
We're coming live from the Key Biscayne causeway

551
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:46,160
where at least ten police cars are in hot pursuit of a stolen red pick-up truck.

552
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:53,560
Oh, my. This is just nuts. Jim, are you getting that?

553
01:12:53,650 --> 01:12:58,300
There's another car that is swaying past the police, as if they were standing still.

554
01:12:58,390 --> 01:13:02,120
-Son of a bitch can drive.        - Yes, he can.

555
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:51,310
We have clearance for take off.

556
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:56,330
Sit back, enjoy your flight, and we will be in Colombia before you know it.

557
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:43,690
We have a problem with the landing gear. I need to land.

558
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:46,180
-Can we fly with the problem?        - Theoretically.

559
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:49,960
Then you'll land when we get to Colombia.

560
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:52,650
Go and see if you can lift it manually.

561
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:56,230
Sorry for the inconvenience. Nothing to worry about.

562
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:03,510
Sorry, flight's been canceled.

563
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:07,130
I'm sorry to inform you that you have been canceled.

564
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:10,220
Have a seat.

565
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:14,360
Relax.

566
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,450
Drink something. Let's get to know each other.

567
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:20,910
I think I know everything I need to know.

568
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:09,350
Shit.

569
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:53,070
Five points. What has eyes but no ears, skin but no hair,

570
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,160
it's white inside and brown outside?

571
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:57,090
-Mom?        - A worm?

572
01:18:57,180 --> 01:19:00,870
-Wrong. Dad?        - A caterpillar.

573
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,720
-Wrong.        - A potato.

574
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:11,620
-May I help you?        - I was just leaving.

575
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,880
-Coconut.        - Wrong.

576
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:20,540
-A snake.        - Wrong.

577
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:23,800
-A peanut.        - Yuck!

578
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:26,090
-A hot dog.        - Wrong.

579
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,730
-That was fast.        - Yeah.

580
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:47,200
-Didn't want you to miss your plane.        - That's very thoughtful of you.

581
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:57,160
Check it out, my man.

582
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:03,110
You won't believe what happened to me last night.

583
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:14,090
I have something for you. Since you never got to the beach.

584
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:19,440
Oh, you know, water's water, sand is sand. Here, there -it's all the same.

585
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:24,670
Thank you, Frank. It was an interesting vacation.

586
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:27,970
-What more could one ask for?        - Ah, yeah.

587
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:32,590
-Au revoir, Frank.        - Au revoir, my friend. Have a good flight.

588
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,980
I doubt it. They said it is all headwinds.

589
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:39,880
I guess we can't have everything we wish for, can we?

590
01:20:40,490 --> 01:20:42,810
No, we can't.

591
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:58,250
Yeah.

592
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:01,190
I'm looking for a transporter.

593
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:06,180
I'm listening.

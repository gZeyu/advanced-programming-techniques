1
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,759
Go, go! Move it, move it!

2
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:36,402
Let's go.

3
00:03:37,412 --> 00:03:39,539
- Let's go!        - There's four of you.

4
00:03:39,614 --> 00:03:43,744
- You can count. I'm impressed. Drive.        - Rule one: Never change the deal.

5
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:48,119
Deal was transportation for three men with a combined weight of 254 kilos.

6
00:03:48,223 --> 00:03:50,919
Yeah? Well, this is a new deal.

7
00:03:50,992 --> 00:03:54,621
An extra 80 kilos means we won't make it on the gas I allotted.

8
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:57,823
- We'll stop for more gas.        - Every stop we make exposes us.

9
00:03:57,933 --> 00:04:00,834
Every exposure increases the risk of getting caught.

10
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:04,303
An extra 80 kilos means the shock absorbers I installed for this job

11
00:04:04,406 --> 00:04:08,399
won't allow us to outmaneuver any police that might be chasing us,

12
00:04:08,476 --> 00:04:11,968
which means, if there is a chase, we lose our advantage,

13
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,571
increasing the chance of getting caught.

14
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:18,642
I don't want to get caught. You don't want to get caught.

15
00:04:18,753 --> 00:04:21,085
Drive the car or catch a bullet to the brains!

16
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:23,818
- Then who drives?        - Shoot this asshole! I drive!

17
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:27,417
Not without the ignition code you won't.

18
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:37,335
Three men, 254 kilos. That was the deal.

19
00:04:44,212 --> 00:04:49,616
- Three men. 254 kilos.        - Seat belts.

20
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:34,687
See what I mean about the shocks?

21
00:05:40,235 --> 00:05:42,066
Now it's time.

22
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:53,574
Look out! Get out of the way!

23
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,012
Wrong way!

24
00:06:01,056 --> 00:06:02,614
Stop, Marcel, stop!

25
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,053
Move away!

26
00:06:26,448 --> 00:06:28,939
Yes!

27
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:33,149
Go, go, go!

28
00:06:33,888 --> 00:06:35,321
Oh, merde.

29
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:49,796
Shit.

30
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:23,930
If you don't mind, I just conditioned the leather back there.

31
00:07:25,707 --> 00:07:28,505
- Take us to the drop point.        - Not yet.

32
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:48,025
The cops!

33
00:07:48,563 --> 00:07:51,828
What are you doing? Don't stop now! Do something!

34
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,959
- Come on!        - What are you thinking?

35
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,798
Go! Go! Go!

36
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:02,143
Do it! Now!

37
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:28,393
Your gun, please.

38
00:09:20,288 --> 00:09:24,054
Police! Stop! Stop! Police!

39
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,519
- You gave me too much.        - I need you to take us to Avignon.

40
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:04,356
The deal was this far, no further.

41
00:10:04,465 --> 00:10:06,865
The deal is the deal. Rule number one.

42
00:10:06,968 --> 00:10:09,459
- Rules are meant to be broken.        - Not mine.

43
00:10:12,807 --> 00:10:15,275
Let's go.

44
00:10:15,343 --> 00:10:19,939
Get in the car. Come on! Hurry! Move it!

45
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,324
Where's your yellow card?

46
00:11:08,396 --> 00:11:11,695
I must've left it back in Nam, at the base.

47
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:14,667
They all say that. Left it in Nam on the base.

48
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:17,864
Let me show you what we do to people who forget it.

49
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:20,339
Oh, no, please let go of me.

50
00:11:20,408 --> 00:11:24,401
You gotta be punished for this. It's a fate far worse than death.

51
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:28,573
Oh, hell. What could be a fate worse than death?

52
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:37,291
The Argentinean government commits to meeting the IMF's target this year.

53
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:42,022
Yesterday in Nice, four men robbed the Alliance Investment Corporation.

54
00:11:42,096 --> 00:11:46,931
One man died on the sidewalk. The others were apprehended this morning

55
00:11:47,035 --> 00:11:50,368
when they took a wrong turn on a one-way street in Avignon

56
00:11:50,438 --> 00:11:52,633
and ran into a taxicab.

57
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,402
Police said, were it not for the poor driving,

58
00:11:55,476 --> 00:11:57,103
the 20 million euros in bearer bonds

59
00:11:57,211 --> 00:12:02,444
would have been cashed and gone by this afternoon. In other news...

60
00:12:05,486 --> 00:12:11,391
I always say, the way a man treats his car is how he treats himself.

61
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:14,661
I'd say that's probably true, Inspector.

62
00:12:14,762 --> 00:12:17,663
You have a good sense of humor for a foreigner.

63
00:12:17,765 --> 00:12:20,233
Like the French. Sly wit.

64
00:12:20,301 --> 00:12:24,397
Just the right amount of flavor. Been out driving?

65
00:12:24,472 --> 00:12:28,670
Till they pass a law says I can't. Want to come in for a coffee?

66
00:12:28,776 --> 00:12:31,802
Thank you, but I have a lot of stops to make.

67
00:12:31,913 --> 00:12:35,781
- 88, to be exact.        - That's a lot of stops.

68
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,184
A lot of 1999 black BMW 735s

69
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:43,951
with 0-6 in the license plates to check out.

70
00:12:44,025 --> 00:12:48,860
It's a very popular car with a certain type down here. You've seen them.

71
00:12:48,963 --> 00:12:52,194
They come over from Italy in very expensive suits,

72
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,929
and young, pretty girls with big jewelry and too much makeup.

73
00:12:56,003 --> 00:12:59,131
Very... Mafia.

74
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,165
There was a robbery. A getaway.

75
00:13:03,177 --> 00:13:06,044
Some very fancy driving.

76
00:13:06,147 --> 00:13:10,777
Was someone in a 1999 black BMW 735?

77
00:13:10,852 --> 00:13:13,446
With 0-6 in the plates.

78
00:13:14,555 --> 00:13:17,888
- Have you been to the city lately?        - Not for a while.

79
00:13:17,992 --> 00:13:22,326
I love Nice. The food, the way they grill fish.

80
00:13:22,397 --> 00:13:25,730
No place else in France does it the way they do in Nice.

81
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,165
And the women...

82
00:13:28,236 --> 00:13:30,568
I prefer the women there.

83
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:34,334
They are more... complicated

84
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:38,641
than the local variety, don't you think?

85
00:13:39,981 --> 00:13:44,475
- I don't particularly like complicated.        - You like to keep it simple.

86
00:13:44,552 --> 00:13:47,521
- Why are you so interested?        - Oh, you know,

87
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:52,082
ever since I'm a little boy, military people have intrigued me.

88
00:13:52,193 --> 00:13:56,220
- I'm ex-military.        - I am an ex-little boy.

89
00:14:02,603 --> 00:14:05,265
Sure you don't have time for a coffee?

90
00:14:05,373 --> 00:14:09,036
Everything's always so neat with you, Monsieur Frank.

91
00:14:11,345 --> 00:14:14,872
- Nothing ever out of place.        - I'll take that as a compliment,

92
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:18,407
coming from a man who pays attention to every detail.

93
00:14:20,421 --> 00:14:23,390
Maybe I'll come back later for that coffee.

94
00:14:25,593 --> 00:14:27,754
Door's always open to you.

95
00:14:39,774 --> 00:14:41,969
- Hugo gave me your number.        - Be brief.

96
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:44,544
- I need a transporter.        - I'm listening.

97
00:14:51,252 --> 00:14:53,482
- One bag, that's it.        - Dimensions?

98
00:14:55,723 --> 00:14:58,817
- Be specific.        - One meter 50 by a half meter.

99
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,092
- Weight.        - 50 kilos, not more.

100
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:08,226
- Destination?        - 24, rue de Luxembourg.

101
00:15:08,302 --> 00:15:12,466
- You're delivering to Mr...        - Rule two: No names.

102
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:19,610
- Time of pickup?        - Seven in the morning, at the front door.

103
00:15:21,682 --> 00:15:26,244
A package. 150 by 50, 50 kilos, 250 kilometers.

104
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,757
Traveling within the speed limit, one stop for refreshments: 40,000.

105
00:15:30,825 --> 00:15:34,921
Half now, half on delivery. Delivery will be at noon. If no one's there,

106
00:15:34,996 --> 00:15:37,294
I'm not responsible. I'll leave the package.

107
00:15:37,365 --> 00:15:41,096
Once we make a deal, it cannot be changed or renegotiated.

108
00:15:41,168 --> 00:15:44,695
- Another rule?        - That's rule number one.

109
00:15:45,206 --> 00:15:47,299
Do we have a deal?

110
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,544
- You're very precise.        - Transportation is a precise business.

111
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,372
Flat.

112
00:19:22,523 --> 00:19:24,013
Hi.

113
00:19:28,229 --> 00:19:32,029
Don't move. I won't hurt you, I'll just make a hole so you can drink.

114
00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:34,857
Please. Please, come on.

115
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:50,576
Come on. Drink.

116
00:19:54,088 --> 00:19:55,715
Slowly.

117
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,259
OK, OK, that's enough.

118
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,594
Good girl.

119
00:20:51,512 --> 00:20:56,176
I'll take the tape off. If you scream, I'll have to kill you. Understand?

120
00:20:57,351 --> 00:20:59,444
I have to pee.

121
00:21:00,454 --> 00:21:02,854
You want me to do it in your car?

122
00:21:06,594 --> 00:21:08,619
OK.

123
00:21:17,104 --> 00:21:21,666
I'm gonna take my knife out, so don't scream, OK? It's to cut you free.

124
00:21:25,512 --> 00:21:28,106
You don't need your mouth to pee.

125
00:21:35,022 --> 00:21:37,115
You have one minute.

126
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:45,530
55, 54, 53, 52...

127
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:54,167
Breaking the rules, Frank.

128
00:21:54,241 --> 00:21:56,334
Not good to break the rules.

129
00:22:04,585 --> 00:22:06,485
15!

130
00:22:09,857 --> 00:22:11,324
Seven.

131
00:22:14,395 --> 00:22:17,523
Two. Time's up.

132
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:23,231
Don't make me drag you out.

133
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,611
Shit!

134
00:23:22,229 --> 00:23:24,720
No, please! No.

135
00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:29,266
Rule three: Never look in the package.

136
00:23:29,336 --> 00:23:33,295
Hope you enjoyed your pee cos it's your last on this trip.

137
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:05,332
See what comes of breaking the rules?

138
00:24:47,381 --> 00:24:50,714
- You're late.        - Ran into a little problem.

139
00:24:52,086 --> 00:24:54,179
Nothin' serious?

140
00:24:57,925 --> 00:25:00,018
Nothin' serious.

141
00:25:12,372 --> 00:25:16,672
- You open the package?        - Rule three: Never open the package.

142
00:25:17,878 --> 00:25:21,336
I like that. Rules.

143
00:25:21,415 --> 00:25:24,748
You can't get anything done in a world without rules.

144
00:25:24,852 --> 00:25:29,414
You're a foreigner, right? Nice little thing you've got going for yourself.

145
00:25:29,523 --> 00:25:32,617
High class... good reputation.

146
00:25:33,927 --> 00:25:37,727
- I didn't get your name.        - Rule two: No names.

147
00:25:38,265 --> 00:25:39,755
Of course.

148
00:25:52,312 --> 00:25:54,405
You don't count it.

149
00:25:54,948 --> 00:25:57,109
Why? Should I?

150
00:25:57,217 --> 00:26:00,812
- No, no.        - That concludes the deal.

151
00:26:05,592 --> 00:26:09,221
You know, I was wondering

152
00:26:09,296 --> 00:26:13,096
if you wouldn't mind transporting something for me.

153
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:17,798
That's what you do, right? You deliver, no questions asked.

154
00:26:21,975 --> 00:26:23,840
Why not?

155
00:26:26,914 --> 00:26:28,973
Weight?

156
00:26:31,118 --> 00:26:34,281
- Maybe a kilo.        - Destination?

157
00:26:34,354 --> 00:26:38,256
Grenoble. 306, rue de Lac. A Mr...

158
00:26:39,526 --> 00:26:43,326
Oh, right. I forgot. Rule two.

159
00:27:03,684 --> 00:27:05,777
I like him.

160
00:28:39,913 --> 00:28:41,608
What the f?

161
00:29:13,113 --> 00:29:14,978
Where is he?

162
00:31:41,127 --> 00:31:43,925
You're like dogshit. You're everywhere.

163
00:31:43,997 --> 00:31:48,593
Yeah. I know you wanna pee. All you wanna do is pee.

164
00:32:16,263 --> 00:32:18,595
Useless piece of shit!

165
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:49,013
I ask the questions, you answer them.

166
00:33:49,089 --> 00:33:52,183
No long speeches, just keep it simple. Got it?

167
00:33:55,562 --> 00:34:00,795
- Who are you?        - My name is Lai. I come from Jap...

168
00:34:01,801 --> 00:34:06,067
I ask the questions, you answer them. Nothing more, nothing less.

169
00:34:06,139 --> 00:34:08,630
You wanna try again?

170
00:34:12,445 --> 00:34:14,811
- What kind of shit am I in?        - Deep shit.

171
00:34:14,914 --> 00:34:18,577
Very deep shit. Those guys... Sorry. I won't say any...

172
00:34:49,315 --> 00:34:51,977
Bon appetit.

173
00:34:52,085 --> 00:34:55,486
- Where are you going?        - To bed.

174
00:34:55,588 --> 00:34:59,854
Can't think straight when I'm tired. Good night's sleep, I see things better.

175
00:34:59,959 --> 00:35:02,154
- Can I leave?        - Be my guest.

176
00:36:57,477 --> 00:37:01,573
Hey. Are you comfortable?

177
00:37:02,982 --> 00:37:05,143
- Boss...        - Sh. Save your strength.

178
00:37:06,286 --> 00:37:08,914
Just tell me: Who did this?

179
00:37:10,757 --> 00:37:14,784
- The transporter.        - The transporter's dead.

180
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:17,988
He's not.

181
00:37:22,635 --> 00:37:24,728
You believe me?

182
00:37:26,472 --> 00:37:28,440
I believe you.

183
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:32,069
And the police... they were here?

184
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,416
- You told 'em nothing, right?        - Right.

185
00:37:37,483 --> 00:37:39,815
Of course.

186
00:37:40,987 --> 00:37:43,512
You couldn't talk.

187
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:46,782
Yeah.

188
00:37:50,129 --> 00:37:52,256
Let's keep it that way.

189
00:38:51,524 --> 00:38:56,518
I picked them from the garden outside. I hope you don't mind.

190
00:38:57,597 --> 00:39:01,089
I didn't know if you like coffee or tea, so I made both.

191
00:39:14,948 --> 00:39:19,408
I hope you like... madeleines.

192
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:22,351
Try one.

193
00:39:25,024 --> 00:39:27,356
Careful. It's hot.

194
00:39:31,197 --> 00:39:33,256
Good?

195
00:39:38,271 --> 00:39:39,738
Let me.

196
00:39:41,307 --> 00:39:46,370
- I like it quiet in the morning.        - Yes, quiet in the morning. Me too.

197
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:50,109
I'm the same way. I like very quiet.

198
00:39:52,251 --> 00:39:54,151
Sorry.

199
00:40:00,626 --> 00:40:03,390
Are you looking for milk?

200
00:40:03,463 --> 00:40:07,490
- There's milk at the door.        - Stay, stay. I'll go.

201
00:40:13,506 --> 00:40:15,599
Hi.

202
00:40:17,777 --> 00:40:20,974
- And you are?        - The new cook.

203
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,173
Is Monsieur Frank in?

204
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:26,517
Ah, Monsieur Frank.

205
00:40:27,153 --> 00:40:31,749
- Is your invitation for coffee still open?        - Sure, come on, please. Sit.

206
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,521
- Madeleine?        - Homemade?

207
00:40:36,629 --> 00:40:39,291
Yes. I'll bring some more.

208
00:40:41,534 --> 00:40:44,196
My mother made fresh madeleines every morning.

209
00:40:44,303 --> 00:40:48,603
I smell them and my whole childhood comes back in one big flood.

210
00:40:48,674 --> 00:40:51,973
Like Proust. You ever read Proust, Monsieur Frank?

211
00:40:52,045 --> 00:40:56,675
- No.        - It's fantastic. Memory like a steel trap.

212
00:40:56,783 --> 00:40:59,513
He would've been a great cop. Real determined.

213
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:01,678
- Milk?        - Please, milk.

214
00:41:02,789 --> 00:41:04,848
Thank you.

215
00:41:06,692 --> 00:41:10,492
I used to have a memory like Proust, like a filing cabinet up there.

216
00:41:10,563 --> 00:41:13,293
I'd see something and remember it like that.

217
00:41:13,366 --> 00:41:15,800
Like license plates. I could see a plate

218
00:41:15,868 --> 00:41:20,134
and it was printed in my head. Now I need all the help I can get

219
00:41:20,206 --> 00:41:23,232
remembering whose plate goes with whose car.

220
00:41:23,342 --> 00:41:26,072
Like this one.

221
00:41:28,848 --> 00:41:32,011
- That's mine.        - Ah, memories.

222
00:41:32,085 --> 00:41:36,351
- So? Where's the rest of the car?        - I was hoping you could tell me.

223
00:41:36,422 --> 00:41:38,083
- It was stolen.        - Stolen?

224
00:41:38,191 --> 00:41:40,091
I went to Frejus to pick up a few things.

225
00:41:40,193 --> 00:41:44,425
- When I came out of the market, it was...        - Gone. Did you report it?

226
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:47,260
It was the first on my list of things to do today.

227
00:41:47,366 --> 00:41:50,858
It's a long walk from Frejus. How did you get home?

228
00:41:50,937 --> 00:41:53,531
I brought him.

229
00:41:54,073 --> 00:41:56,837
I saw him walking along the dark road.

230
00:41:56,909 --> 00:42:00,504
A risky thing, picking up a stranger on a dark road.

231
00:42:01,781 --> 00:42:04,215
He had a kind face.

232
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:09,954
- I didn't see a car outside.        - It's in the garage.

233
00:42:10,055 --> 00:42:12,387
May I see it?

234
00:42:34,113 --> 00:42:36,240
Pretty nice car for a cook.

235
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:40,780
Some people have a problem with the Germans.

236
00:42:40,886 --> 00:42:44,378
They are too aggressive, they take up the best beaches in summer,

237
00:42:44,456 --> 00:42:46,822
they can't cook worth a damn.

238
00:42:49,928 --> 00:42:54,297
I say, anyone makes such great cars can't be all bad.

239
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,803
I would say you should work out very well for Monsieur Frank.

240
00:42:59,405 --> 00:43:01,600
Work out for both of us.

241
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,774
My intuition says this is probably a good time for me to go file my report.

242
00:43:12,851 --> 00:43:17,686
- Where's the rest of my car?        - Oh, yes, I almost forgot.

243
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:20,850
It was blown to pieces at a rest stop.

244
00:43:22,027 --> 00:43:24,325
What's left of it is down at the lab.

245
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:31,165
They are trying to separate what was left of the two cops in the trunk from the rest of it.

246
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:34,205
But you wouldn't know anything about that?

247
00:43:34,306 --> 00:43:37,275
- No.        - Sorry to interrupt.

248
00:43:37,342 --> 00:43:41,472
- Thank you for the coffee and the memories.        - Come back anytime.

249
00:43:41,547 --> 00:43:45,313
- Would you mind walking me?        - No.

250
00:43:45,384 --> 00:43:52,051
You have always been very quiet about your business. I appreciate that.

251
00:43:52,157 --> 00:43:56,321
This business at the rest stop, it's not very quiet.

252
00:43:56,395 --> 00:44:00,627
Would you like to tell me something besides the stolen-car story?

253
00:44:00,699 --> 00:44:02,291
If I had one, I would.

254
00:44:02,367 --> 00:44:06,963
May I suggest that when the two of you show up in my office after lunch,

255
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,635
that you have one - a better one than you currently have.

256
00:44:18,517 --> 00:44:21,213
You are the one he wants to see, not me!

257
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,849
- Quiet! Please. I have to think.        - You were supposed to think last night.

258
00:44:26,925 --> 00:44:29,655
Last night I had nightmares.

259
00:44:29,728 --> 00:44:33,596
About a girl who came into my nice, quiet life, screwed it all up.

260
00:44:33,699 --> 00:44:38,102
Everything she touched broke and every move became a catastrophe.

261
00:44:38,203 --> 00:44:40,501
OK, sorry.

262
00:44:42,207 --> 00:44:46,576
I'm still wondering if I want to know everything or nothing about you.

263
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,521
- What?        - It's the quiet.

264
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:00,455
I thought you liked quiet.

265
00:45:04,062 --> 00:45:06,292
Not this quiet.

266
00:45:26,251 --> 00:45:27,149
You OK?

267
00:45:27,252 --> 00:45:29,413
- No.        - Good. Let's go.

268
00:45:39,264 --> 00:45:41,095
Go, go, go!

269
00:45:53,612 --> 00:45:54,943
No, don't stay there!

270
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,461
Give me your hand!

271
00:46:53,292 --> 00:46:54,384
Come on!

272
00:46:56,562 --> 00:46:58,120
Come on, get in!

273
00:46:58,998 --> 00:47:00,124
Get in!

274
00:47:03,169 --> 00:47:07,367
Lai, look, hang on. Do you wanna die? Get in!

275
00:47:30,997 --> 00:47:34,865
Calm down, OK? Don't worry. You OK?

276
00:47:36,235 --> 00:47:39,693
- Stay here. I'll be right back.        - No. Wait! Wait!

277
00:47:53,185 --> 00:47:55,244
Put it on.

278
00:47:57,123 --> 00:48:02,026
You OK? Sure? OK, let's go.

279
00:49:41,393 --> 00:49:44,954
Frank? Is this your house?

280
00:49:49,835 --> 00:49:51,803
Yeah, I guess.

281
00:50:03,315 --> 00:50:06,512
I should mind my own goddamn business.

282
00:50:08,087 --> 00:50:11,079
Simple rule, simple little rule.

283
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:15,559
There's gotta be some dry clothes in this house.

284
00:50:16,262 --> 00:50:18,890
"Don't open the package."

285
00:50:18,998 --> 00:50:23,162
Nothin' but trouble, you open the goddamn package.

286
00:50:23,235 --> 00:50:24,167
Frank?

287
00:50:29,008 --> 00:50:32,739
- What are you doing?        - Making up for the trouble.

288
00:50:37,917 --> 00:50:41,409
- Wait, wait. Why are you making...        - No more questions.

289
00:50:44,023 --> 00:50:47,015
Wait. I don't like it when things get complicated.

290
00:50:47,092 --> 00:50:51,756
You like things simple. Very simple.

291
00:51:07,713 --> 00:51:14,209
I'm not so clear about the house. Could you explain one more time? After I left...

292
00:51:14,286 --> 00:51:17,119
We walked on the beach, had a swim.

293
00:51:17,223 --> 00:51:18,918
- Where?        - Past the point.

294
00:51:18,991 --> 00:51:23,325
- Anyone else swimming?        - No. Did you see anybody else swimming?

295
00:51:23,429 --> 00:51:25,488
No, no one.

296
00:51:25,598 --> 00:51:28,465
So, you took a walk,

297
00:51:28,567 --> 00:51:32,264
had a swim on a beach where no one else was swimming,

298
00:51:32,338 --> 00:51:37,401
past the point where you can't see or be seen from the beach on either side,

299
00:51:37,476 --> 00:51:40,343
which makes witnesses a little hard to come by.

300
00:51:40,446 --> 00:51:44,849
That's the point of a romantic swim. Who wants witnesses?

301
00:51:47,586 --> 00:51:50,919
- And then?        - We came back to the house, found it on fire.

302
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:54,084
- Just like that? On fire?        - Yes.

303
00:51:55,094 --> 00:51:59,087
The 5,000 rounds of spent ammo my men found all around the house?

304
00:51:59,164 --> 00:52:02,361
- Maybe they had the wrong house.        - Monsieur Frank,

305
00:52:02,468 --> 00:52:05,198
people with this kind of firepower

306
00:52:05,304 --> 00:52:09,206
do not make mistakes about who they visit.

307
00:52:09,308 --> 00:52:12,869
- Who would want you this dead?        - I don't know.

308
00:52:13,279 --> 00:52:17,215
- Any problems with a client?        - I don't have clients. I'm retired.

309
00:52:17,316 --> 00:52:19,944
I live on my army pension, you know that.

310
00:52:20,019 --> 00:52:22,715
You've had the facts of who I am and who I was for years.

311
00:52:22,821 --> 00:52:25,790
Any enemies you can think of? People from the past?

312
00:52:25,858 --> 00:52:28,793
I left the past behind when I moved here.

313
00:52:28,861 --> 00:52:32,456
A past like yours you never leave behind.

314
00:52:34,466 --> 00:52:39,403
- Commissaire?        - I'll just be a moment. Don't leave.

315
00:52:54,053 --> 00:52:56,647
- What are you doing?        - Computers know everything.

316
00:52:56,722 --> 00:52:58,883
- You just need a password.        - Are you nuts?

317
00:52:58,991 --> 00:53:02,256
- We're in a police station.        - You always complain,

318
00:53:02,361 --> 00:53:06,195
except when we make love. Then you say nothing.

319
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:33,724
Hello. See?

320
00:53:52,544 --> 00:53:55,240
- So, where will you be staying?        - I don't know.

321
00:53:55,314 --> 00:53:58,147
Well, my cousin has a small hotel.

322
00:54:00,085 --> 00:54:04,317
- Thanks, but we'll manage.        - Without money? It will be hard.

323
00:54:04,423 --> 00:54:08,223
Here. It's not much, but at least you won't go hungry.

324
00:54:08,293 --> 00:54:10,158
Thank you.

325
00:54:22,608 --> 00:54:24,769
- Where are you going?        - To see that guy.

326
00:54:24,843 --> 00:54:27,334
- Good luck.        - One moment.

327
00:54:27,446 --> 00:54:30,108
- You're not coming?        - No.

328
00:54:30,182 --> 00:54:33,151
- But he blew up your car.        - I'll buy a new one.

329
00:54:33,252 --> 00:54:35,846
- He burned your house.        - I'll rebuild it.

330
00:54:35,954 --> 00:54:39,117
- He tried to kill you.        - As far as he knows, he succeeded.

331
00:54:39,191 --> 00:54:44,151
Some advice... I don't know what you're into, but whoever wanted you dead thinks you are.

332
00:54:44,263 --> 00:54:50,099
You have a free pass to start over. Here's the advice: Start over!

333
00:54:55,174 --> 00:55:01,477
There are 400 people dying in a container on a ship.

334
00:55:04,716 --> 00:55:06,980
My father.

335
00:55:07,052 --> 00:55:09,213
My sisters.

336
00:55:09,321 --> 00:55:11,983
The ship arrives today.

337
00:55:12,357 --> 00:55:15,292
They will make my father a slave.

338
00:55:16,495 --> 00:55:21,990
The only one who knows the container number is that guy.

339
00:55:22,835 --> 00:55:26,032
- You're very good.        - What do you mean?

340
00:55:26,138 --> 00:55:30,632
From the moment you saw those pictures in my house, you set me up to get involved.

341
00:55:30,709 --> 00:55:36,978
Breakfast, giving the excuse to the cop to help me, one lie after another.

342
00:55:37,049 --> 00:55:41,179
- Not everything is a lie.        - Name one thing that isn't.

343
00:55:44,156 --> 00:55:48,354
What happened in the house between us,

344
00:55:48,427 --> 00:55:50,827
that was not a lie.

345
00:55:54,266 --> 00:55:58,396
You were a soldier. Yourjob was to save people.

346
00:55:58,504 --> 00:56:01,337
- Past tense.        - What does that mean?

347
00:56:01,406 --> 00:56:04,398
I got tired of seeing my best efforts turned into bullshit

348
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:07,240
by the same people who pay me to do the job.

349
00:56:07,346 --> 00:56:12,181
- No one cared.        - This time, I care.

350
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:30,759
Thank you.

351
00:56:40,412 --> 00:56:42,107
- Bonjour.        - Bonjour.

352
00:56:42,214 --> 00:56:44,808
No phone calls for half an hour?

353
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,275
Hello. Surprise!

354
00:56:54,293 --> 00:56:56,386
Sit.

355
00:57:07,673 --> 00:57:10,506
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

356
00:57:10,609 --> 00:57:13,009
Before we get to the heart of the matter,

357
00:57:13,111 --> 00:57:15,636
I have a question: Why'd you try to kill me?

358
00:57:15,747 --> 00:57:18,739
You lied to me. You opened the package.

359
00:57:18,817 --> 00:57:21,081
You broke the rules, your rules.

360
00:57:21,153 --> 00:57:24,350
Did you expect me to recommend you for anotherjob?

361
00:57:28,293 --> 00:57:30,625
What's the ship number?

362
00:57:32,598 --> 00:57:35,795
Mr Transporter, we can both agree.

363
00:57:35,867 --> 00:57:39,769
I answered your first question politely. I won't answer any more.

364
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:42,966
So I suggest you kill me right now.

365
00:57:44,343 --> 00:57:46,538
And go screw yourself.

366
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,474
I can't find anything.

367
00:57:57,556 --> 00:58:00,184
Oh, poor Frank. What'd she tell you?

368
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:02,852
We're smuggling people in containers?

369
00:58:02,961 --> 00:58:06,897
- Lai's the perfect name for her.        - Mr Kwai's on the way up.

370
00:58:06,999 --> 00:58:10,162
Your father's here. He'll get a kick out of this.

371
00:58:10,235 --> 00:58:14,069
- I thought your father was in a container.        - Yes. I mean, no.

372
00:58:14,172 --> 00:58:17,198
There are 400 people in that container.

373
00:58:17,309 --> 00:58:22,178
- Stay where you are!        - She's a real heartbreaker, isn't she?

374
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:28,411
Ten seconds, two choices. The information, or your brains on the desk.

375
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,388
- Now tell me I'm lying! Nine... eight...        - Lai, give me the gun.

376
00:58:32,491 --> 00:58:35,255
I don't know what you're talking about.

377
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,852
Five... four... three... two...

378
00:58:39,398 --> 00:58:41,525
One. Shoot.

379
00:58:45,871 --> 00:58:47,168
Lai.

380
00:58:53,845 --> 00:58:58,680
- Liar?        - Would I kill my own daughter, Lai?

381
00:59:00,952 --> 00:59:04,786
Come on now. Put it down.

382
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,888
We'll talk.

383
00:59:10,962 --> 00:59:15,023
She thinks we're smuggling people in containers.

384
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:18,126
- Where do you get these ideas?        - Stay away!

385
00:59:22,874 --> 00:59:28,540
- Could you kill your own father?        - Please, I am begging you.

386
00:59:28,613 --> 00:59:32,049
- Stop what you are doing.        - I do what I do.

387
00:59:32,117 --> 00:59:34,415
I am who I am. I'll never change.

388
00:59:34,486 --> 00:59:38,081
So if you're going to kill me, kill me.

389
00:59:38,457 --> 00:59:41,585
But if you don't, get this gun out of my face.

390
00:59:45,764 --> 00:59:48,460
- Give me.        - No!

391
00:59:48,567 --> 00:59:51,900
I know he's innocent. Oh, you have such a good heart.

392
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:57,101
Always interested in saving innocent people. Well, here's your big chance.

393
00:59:57,175 --> 01:00:00,770
Drop your gun and you will save one.

394
01:00:06,485 --> 01:00:08,316
- Kill him!        - No!

395
01:00:10,789 --> 01:00:12,848
- The police are coming.        - What now?

396
01:00:12,958 --> 01:00:15,426
Take her.

397
01:00:16,328 --> 01:00:20,128
Send in Leo. I need him to wrap something up.

398
01:00:35,781 --> 01:00:38,841
There were 400 people in that container.

399
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:41,544
Only 395 made it here alive.

400
01:00:42,854 --> 01:00:44,617
Frank!

401
01:00:47,993 --> 01:00:52,362
- Inspector. Am I glad you're here.        - What is this?

402
01:00:52,464 --> 01:00:56,161
This man used my partner's daughter to try and blackmail us.

403
01:00:56,234 --> 01:00:59,635
Luckily my security got the drop on him.

404
01:00:59,704 --> 01:01:03,231
I want to press charges: Kidnapping, extortion, assault.

405
01:01:03,341 --> 01:01:06,242
- I know this man.        - I suppose in your business,

406
01:01:06,344 --> 01:01:08,869
you have to know all types.

407
01:01:10,816 --> 01:01:14,513
- Now should I call my lawyer?        - We'll handle it.

408
01:01:19,524 --> 01:01:22,925
I'll expect all of you at my office for your statements.

409
01:01:23,028 --> 01:01:28,022
As soon as I contact my lawyer, we'll be more than happy to oblige.

410
01:01:46,518 --> 01:01:48,748
The doctor said you'll have a headache,

411
01:01:48,854 --> 01:01:52,017
- then you'll go back to normal.        - Where are they?

412
01:01:52,090 --> 01:01:57,084
I think you should be more concerned with where you are.

413
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:02,090
What got into you? You were always so careful.

414
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:06,432
- I've got to get out of here.        - The charges are filed.

415
01:02:06,538 --> 01:02:10,372
You will not be getting out for a very long time.

416
01:02:10,442 --> 01:02:14,378
Assaulting a distinguished member of the business community,

417
01:02:14,446 --> 01:02:17,882
kidnapping his daughter, extortion...

418
01:02:17,949 --> 01:02:21,976
I'm sorry, Frank. I would like to help you.

419
01:02:22,087 --> 01:02:26,956
But if you continue with the same old story: I'm retired, living on a pension...

420
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:32,055
I need fresh, Frank. I need new.

421
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:34,291
For once, I need the truth.

422
01:02:37,636 --> 01:02:42,471
OK. They're smuggling people, from Asia,

423
01:02:42,574 --> 01:02:45,441
through Marseilles, in containers.

424
01:02:47,279 --> 01:02:50,146
- You know this for a fact?        - The girl told me.

425
01:02:50,815 --> 01:02:52,976
- You believe her?        - Yes.

426
01:02:53,084 --> 01:02:56,815
In French, we have a saying: Never believe the cook.

427
01:02:58,256 --> 01:03:03,159
- She's not the cook.        - Oh. I suspected.

428
01:03:03,261 --> 01:03:06,697
- No one is perfect.        - You're saying you'll do nothing.

429
01:03:06,798 --> 01:03:10,700
I'm saying I'm going to start an investigation.

430
01:03:10,802 --> 01:03:13,703
400 people could be dead already.

431
01:03:13,805 --> 01:03:16,774
But what am I supposed to do? There are laws.

432
01:03:16,841 --> 01:03:20,504
- Sometimes you make your own law.        - Like you do?

433
01:03:20,612 --> 01:03:22,842
It doesn't take me 12 months to do the job.

434
01:03:22,948 --> 01:03:26,884
Oh, yes, I know. That's what I admire about you.

435
01:03:26,985 --> 01:03:30,887
All that army training, all that sneaking around...

436
01:03:30,989 --> 01:03:34,652
A man like you could probably resolve this case in how long?

437
01:03:34,726 --> 01:03:37,854
- 12 hours?        - Less.

438
01:03:37,963 --> 01:03:41,524
Less. Impressive.

439
01:03:41,633 --> 01:03:43,863
You'd be the perfect man for the job.

440
01:03:43,969 --> 01:03:49,635
- Yes. If I were out.        - Yes. If you were out.

441
01:04:10,095 --> 01:04:12,757
Anybody moves and I kill him.

442
01:04:48,867 --> 01:04:53,395
If this is how you transport, I'm amazed you get any work at all.

443
01:04:53,471 --> 01:04:55,564
Come on, give me a hand.

444
01:05:04,482 --> 01:05:08,782
- Maybe I should go with you?        - Thanks, but I'm better alone.

445
01:05:10,555 --> 01:05:13,319
That is a very small boat to fight a very big war.

446
01:05:13,425 --> 01:05:17,122
Yeah. But it's a good boat.

447
01:05:17,228 --> 01:05:19,287
Frank, here.

448
01:05:20,265 --> 01:05:22,233
You'll need it.

449
01:05:25,003 --> 01:05:26,800
Or maybe not.

450
01:06:54,759 --> 01:06:57,387
Shipment is cleared. Here's the paperwork.

451
01:06:57,495 --> 01:07:00,328
Take the highway all the way to the first exit, Lyon.

452
01:07:00,398 --> 01:07:04,698
Go straight to the warehouse. We'll be right behind you, just in case.

453
01:07:21,085 --> 01:07:23,053
OK, we are ready to go.

454
01:07:29,794 --> 01:07:31,785
Lai, dear...

455
01:07:39,404 --> 01:07:43,534
I spent thousands of dollars for you to go to school and learn English.

456
01:07:43,608 --> 01:07:47,135
- The least you can do is speak it.        - I hate you.

457
01:07:50,882 --> 01:07:53,214
I'm still your father.

458
01:07:55,053 --> 01:07:57,544
Get her out of here!

459
01:08:16,241 --> 01:08:17,731
Give me a minute.

460
01:08:45,136 --> 01:08:47,195
Keep him alive.

461
01:09:29,747 --> 01:09:31,214
Let's go!

462
01:10:28,806 --> 01:10:30,865
No, don't!

463
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:33,368
Let's go!

464
01:17:00,664 --> 01:17:02,529
Bitch!

465
01:17:46,977 --> 01:17:50,538
Good morning. You lost?

466
01:17:50,648 --> 01:17:55,244
- I'm lookin' to do a little sightseeing.        - This plane is not for tourists.

467
01:17:56,887 --> 01:17:59,185
I'm not a tourist.

468
01:18:22,246 --> 01:18:24,544
Call this guy and tell him to meet me.

469
01:18:24,615 --> 01:18:26,708
Sure. Where?

470
01:18:28,586 --> 01:18:30,850
Down there.

471
01:18:58,716 --> 01:18:59,740
Here!

472
01:19:51,468 --> 01:19:53,333
Move up.

473
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,291
Now.

474
01:22:09,339 --> 01:22:11,398
Get closer.

475
01:22:15,746 --> 01:22:17,270
- Steady.        - No, Dad, no!

476
01:22:21,819 --> 01:22:23,116
Get away!

477
01:23:49,039 --> 01:23:51,098
Down!

478
01:24:01,852 --> 01:24:05,083
Hands on your head. Move!

479
01:24:08,225 --> 01:24:12,525
Watch her. If she moves or I don't return, shoot her.

480
01:24:15,465 --> 01:24:18,628
- To the water.        - I'm really not in the mood for a swim.

481
01:24:19,036 --> 01:24:20,936
March!

482
01:24:22,873 --> 01:24:26,138
So how did a lowlife like you end up with my daughter?

483
01:24:26,243 --> 01:24:30,646
- Found her in a bag, where you left her.        - You know nothing. Move!

484
01:24:34,985 --> 01:24:37,818
You got involved with the wrong girl, you dumbshit.

485
01:24:37,921 --> 01:24:41,379
The delivery will be made, my daughter will get over it.

486
01:24:41,458 --> 01:24:44,723
If I'm lucky, maybe she'll see the light.

487
01:24:50,467 --> 01:24:53,095
If she's lucky, maybe you'll get hit by a truck.

488
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:56,833
- What do you know?        - She'll never stop being who she is.

489
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:59,101
She'll never be you or anything like you.

490
01:24:59,176 --> 01:25:02,907
She'll come around. But you won't be here to see it.

491
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:04,004
No!

492
01:25:13,857 --> 01:25:17,418
I guess she won't be coming around after all.

493
01:25:20,197 --> 01:25:23,098
- Turn around!        - I'd rather see it coming.

494
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:25,862
Makes no difference to me.

495
01:25:50,727 --> 01:25:55,164
He was a bastard, but he was still my father.

496
01:26:09,413 --> 01:26:12,007
Pretty impressive timing, Frank.

497
01:26:15,352 --> 01:26:17,877
I guess I underestimated you.

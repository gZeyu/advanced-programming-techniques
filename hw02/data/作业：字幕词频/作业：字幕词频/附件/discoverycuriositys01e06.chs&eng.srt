00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,010
A boulder like this slows the river water down,
像这样的岩石减缓了河流的速度

105
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,440
creating a low pressure system behind it.

106
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,490
And when gravel fills in around it,
当碎石填满岩石周围的缝隙时

107
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,480
it sucks and holds the gold in behind boulders like that.
就会将金吸进并储存在岩石后

108
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,370
So this is the ideal situation to find gold.
所以这里是淘金的最佳地点

116
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,500
This is gold panning.

晃一晃

119
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,410
and what this does is
这么做是为了

120
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,440
settle the heavier gold down to the bottom of the pan.
使重的金子沉在盘底

121
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,250
If you pan it too fast,

122
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,810
you run the risk of losing the gold.

495
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,260
What we got right here is the banded iron formation.

496
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,650
It is a lot harder.
它们要坚硬的多

497
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:45,920
It wears our bits out,

498
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,760
takes longer to drill.
使钻探时间更长

杰夫・比尔斯  钻工

500
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:53,520
so we don't lose track of what depth we're at.

00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,930
This is ground zero,
这里是世贸中心遗址

654
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:41,300
site of the new World Trade Center -

657
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,900
will soon support seven soaring towers.

661
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,510
Right now,we are about 74 feet below sea level.
现在我们大约在海平面下74英尺[23米]

So we're standing on a rock excavation,
我们正站在岩层开挖处

663
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,140
and the natural bedrock was probably 10 or 15 feet higher
而天然的岩床比我站的地方

664

666
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:24,260
It was originally soft,sedimentary rock

672
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:41,490
that allows us to put these building loads on top of it.
从而使其能够承载我们的建筑负荷

673
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:45,340
There's no question there would have been a settlement here,

674
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,740
and probably a city,

675
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,690
but not this city -

676
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:53,200
not without its natural platform for building up.
就不是现在的纽约了

00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,950
I grew up here,I live here,it's great.
我在这里成长  居住  这里很棒

you know,it's where it all started.

They're all sitting on bedrock.
它们都建造在岩床上

693
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,310
But Manhattan's bedrock isn't totally flat.

694
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,050
In some places it curves downward,

696
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:43,470
with softer, younger rock.

1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,190
The U.S.A.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,910
Richest nation on earth.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,420
Hard work and ingenuity

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,170
earned us that title.

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,200
But we also got lucky.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,220
This country has natural resources to spare.

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,260
How they came to be here is an ancient story,

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,560
and an unbelievably violent one.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,040

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,380

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,380

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,370
I'm in California

10
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,860
where we get an occasional jolt to remind us

11
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,720
that this country is not built on solid ground.

12
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,600
Down there under my feet,

13
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,550
there's a fiery world of chaos,explosions,

14
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,740
collisions, contortions, upheaval

15
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,440
all on a scale we can hardly imagine.

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,520
How did the extreme subterranean forces

17
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,060
and cataclysmic climatic events above ground

18
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,320
shake the Continent?

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,280
How did grinding sheets of ice miles thick

20
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,270
flatten the middle of the country?

21
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,400
What great pressures belched metals

22
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,690
to the surface from below?

23
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,840
How are entire mountain ranges

24
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,150
thrust up by colliding tectonic plates?

25
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,010
And how did all that violence give us the raw materials

26
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,820
to ultimately build this land of power and bounty?

27
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,860
Because it did just that.

28
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,930
It built our cities,our rich farmland,

29
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,960
our waterways, our factories

30
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,070
and lots of the things they make.

31
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,950
We're going to take you across America

32
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,290
from the newest land here in the Pacific

33
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,920
to some of the oldest land near the Great Lakes

34
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,240
and along the Atlantic seaboard.

35
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,140
We're going to find out

36
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,960
just how this country's savage geological past

37
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,190
made it great.

38
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,090
First stop, Hawaii,

39
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,730
where the same geological forces that created America

40
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,930
are still bubbling and exploding today.

41
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,680
They're building the most dangerous volcano in America.

42
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,470
This 14,000 foot mountain

43
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,500
is constantly growing.

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,680
Molded by forces that shaped and reshaped the earth

45
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,420
over the last four and a half billion years.

46
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,840
As heat rises up from deep inside the earth,

47
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,970
it melts rock and blasts it through the crust.

48
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,420
When it cools,it hardens into a black basalt crust

49
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,530
that builds up over time,layer upon layer.

50
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,530
It has created almost a thousand acres of new land

51
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,450
in less than a half century.

52
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,850
Two and a half thousand miles to the east

53
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,360
on the mainland is much older land,

54
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,190
long,dormant volcanoes have left golden riches

55
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,110
buried in the California rocks.

56
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,450
California is the richest state in the U.S.,

57
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,080
and its good fortune began with its gold.

58
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,950
Todd Bracken has been seeking and finding that gold for 20 years.

62
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,320

59
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,190
This is the most exciting part of my gold mining yet,

60
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,260
this is a 43 gram natural California gold nugget.

61
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,880
A nugget worth a cool  2,500.

62
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,360
California's gold is as old as her hills.

63
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,180
It's been here over 100 million years.

64
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,810
It was forced up to the surface

65
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,720
when the entire continent was on the move.

66
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,100
California rests on top one of

67
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,730
seven massive tectonic plates that make up the earth's crust.

68
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:56,040
Blazing heat from the earth's core,up to 10,000 degrees

69
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,130
keeps those plates in constant motion.

70
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,490
150 Million years ago,

71
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,930
the North American and Pacific Plates Collided.

72
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,900
The force of that impact pushed up a chain of volcanoes

73
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,100
along what is now the west coast of the United States.

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,030
And the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range was born.

75
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,420
This process had another effect.

76
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,700
It seeded rocks throughout California with treasure.

77
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,110
When tectonic plates smash into each other,

78
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,490
things get hot,

79
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,550
and turn solid rock into magma.

80
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,880
Water,super heated by the magma

81
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,380
rip upward through the cracks in the California crust,

82
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,710
carrying gold from deep within the planet.

83
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,330
When the liquid cooled,

84
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,390
the gold solidified into flakes and nuggets

85
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,720
inside the quartz rich veins of the Sierra Nevada.

86
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,570
Good news for California and for this modern day prospector

87
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,960
who is also a jeweler.

88
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,110
Many people like the idea of buying my jewelry

89
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,240
because they know that

90
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,570
it is mined right out of the ground here in California,

91
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,730
and handmade right here in California.

92
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:44,710
Todd prospects for gold in the shadow of the original 49ers.

93
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,990
The California Gold Rush lasted only 15 busy years.

94
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,800
300,000 Prospectors from all over the world

95
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,940
scooped up more than 70 million ounces.

96
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,070
At today's prices,

97
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,030
their total haul would be worth  130 billion.

98
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,170
California gold helped the union win the war.

103
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:18,390

99
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:18,390
It also founded the Hearst and Stanford Dynasties.

100
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,830
So how exactly do you find the gold?

101
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,320
The power of water erodes the rock,

102
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,060
freeing the imbedded gold

103
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,460
and sweeping it downstream.

104
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,010
A boulder like this slows the river water down,

105
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,440
creating a low pressure system behind it.

106
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,490
And when gravel fills in around it,

107
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,480
it sucks and holds the gold in behind boulders like that.

108
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,370
So this is the ideal situation to find gold.

109
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,610
Two years ago

110
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,990
we found 16 ounces

111
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,900
in the course of about six weeks.

112
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,480
Six weeks of work.

113
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,150
A  27,000 pay day.

114
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,510
Todd's prospecting methods haven't changed from

115
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,420
those used by the 49ers.

116
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,500
This is gold panning.

117
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,070
First,you pour the material into the pan

118
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,020
and you give it quite a few shakes,

119
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,410
and what this does is

120
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,440
settle the heavier gold down to the bottom of the pan.

121
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,250
If you pan it too fast,

122
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,810
you run the risk of losing the gold.

123
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,960
Gold.

124
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,450
One, two, three.

125
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,830
That's a nice piece.

126
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,230
The geological forces that

127
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,280
shot gold into the Sierra Nevada's

128
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,510
gave America more than mineral riches,

129
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:57,060
they built our magnificent landscapes,too.

130
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,440
800 Miles east

131
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,870
and 80 million years later,

132
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,930
they created the greatest mountain range in the U.S.

133
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,530
For tens of millions of years,

134
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,950
the North American Plate

135
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,690
continued to grind up and over the Pacific Plate.

136
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,350
That relentless force contorted and buckled the land,

137
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:26,400
thrusting up the Rocky Mountains,5 miles into the sky.

138
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,910
The American Rockies run for 1,500 miles,

139
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,340
from Canada to New Mexico.

140
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,740
To the east,they towered above

141
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,530
what would become the Powder River Basin in Wyoming.

142
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,890
Now a dry prairie,

143
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,180
this was once a feted swamp.

144
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,820
The surprising source of another one of America's natural treasures.

145
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,950
Coal.

151
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,420

152
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,420

146
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:12,090
This ever restless planet possesses awesome power.

147
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,880
It can move mountains,

148
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,480
divert the course of mighty rivers,

149
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,850
and transform millions of square miles of dry land

150
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,410
into a vast,simmering swamp.

151
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,430
How did millions of years of rotting vegetation in just such a swamp

152
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,500
turn into America's most abundant source of fuel?

153
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,670
Coal fuels half of the power stations in America.

154
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,020
Almost half of all that coal

155
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,290
comes from a single valley in Wyoming.

156
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,260
The powder river basin.

157
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,620
It covers over 20,000 square

158
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,360
miles of flat,dry prairie.

159
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,420
Coal from the powder river basin

160
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,600
yields enough electricity for

161
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,540
one in five American homes.

162
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,680
It is nice to be able to help

170
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,870

163
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,950
millions of people out in their daily life.

164
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,360
So they can see at night

165
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,000
alarm clocks can go off in the morning.

166
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,610
They can fix their breakfast.

167
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,990
Dennis Rogg operates a shovel

168
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,890
that loads the mine's gargantuan trucks.

169
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,970
Each one holds 250 tons.

170
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,160
There's about 35 ton of coal in that bucket.

171
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,660
About seven bucket fulls in a truck.

172
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,320
And it goes up in silos,through

173
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,690
crushers into the silos,then

174
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,200
they load it out on the trains from there.

175
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,400
Lynn Huskinson drives one of

176
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,370
our largest loaders in America.

177
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,410
It is as high as a two-story house.

178
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,790
Actually the shovels are more efficient than the loader,

179
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,850
but the loader can get into a tighter place

180
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,180
because it has articulation.

181
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,110
Next step,you need a mile-long train

182
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,400
to put the coal in.

183
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,380
Lots of coal.

184
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,230
Like sometimes five,six,seven trains,

185
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,370
110 coal cars.

194
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,020

186
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,420
That's a good day I think.

187
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,220
I love my job.

188
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,060
I guess I have kind of taken it for granted,

189
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,600
because this is something I've always done.

190
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,300
I started when I was 19 years old.

191
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,950
I'm a native of Wyoming.

192
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,490
It's a beautiful state.

193
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,370
Coal was created here.

194
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,390
55 million years ago.

195
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,620
Back then,this place looked very different.

196
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,150
It was a giant bowl,surrounded

197
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,280
on all sides by mountains.

198
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,500
The climate was radically different then,too.

199
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,260
Subtropical, like Florida.

200
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,710
Warm and wet.

201
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,010
Rivers draining the newly formed.

202
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,010
Rockies drowned the land.

203
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,020
The basin filled up and

204
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,360
it turned into a swamp,teaming with life.

205
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,030
You won't find them in Wyoming today,

206
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,570
but back then,there were

207
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:15,340
alligators, flamingos, and the

208
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,500
ancestors of today's redwood trees.

209
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,730
When trees and plants die and

210
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,610
fall into a swamp,they can't

211
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,060
decompose,and instead turn into peat.

212
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,220
Over millions of years,

213
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,370
the peat compacts to form coal.

214
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,630
This piece of coal that I picked up here

224
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,370

215
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,350
actually is has a piece of ambrite in it,

216
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,090
which is fossilized tree resin.

217
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,300
About one foot of coal takes about 7 to 10

218
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,510
feet of peat to do that.

219
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,500
We have approximately 100 feet of coal here

220
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,350
that derive from that peat

221
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,640
that accumulated in the swamp over those years.

222
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,600
And this whole deposit the Powder River Basin

223
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,580
there's billions of tons of coal.

224
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,820
Blasting is an easy way to

225
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:05,020
get at these unusually shallow coal bins.

226
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,580
They cover an area twice the

227
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,390
size of New Jersey.

228
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,800
A legacy from the earth that

229
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,290
keeps America's lights on and

230
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,040
appliances and computers humming.

231
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,360
Enough here for at least another 100 years.

232
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,840
And that's not the only fuel we've got under our American feet.

233
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,440
We've also got

234
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,430
oil.

235
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,110
From Alaska to Texas,

236
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,340
California to Pennsylvania.

237
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,430
But this time the raw ingredients for the fuel

238
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,090
were not dead plants,but dead animals.

239
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,860
360 Million years ago,

240
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,590
three-quarters of the American.

241
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,280
Continent was under a shallow sea.

242
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,510
The ancient sea swarmed with life.

243
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,810
As trillions of these sea creatures died,

244
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:08,110
their remains build up as thick organic sludge

245
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,960
on the seabed.

246
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,880
When the sludge was buried by

247
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,850
layers of sediment and pressure-cooked

248
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,940
for millions of years inside the earth,

249
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,810
it was transformed into oil.

250
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,920
Heading further east,

251
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,890
we reach the fastest growing oil region in the U.S.

252
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,500
North Dakota.

253
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,330
Here at the Bakken Oil Field,

254
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,260
there are 5400 wells,

255
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,230
each with around 100 workers.

256
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:47,620
I think it is great,

257
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,120
putting American citizens to work.

268
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,980

258
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,670
It is millions of people that

259
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,190
are having jobs from this,and

260
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,520
doing our economy great.

261
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,160
Derek has worked on oil rigs for the last 20 years.

262
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,830
Once you get mud in your blood,

263
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,960
it just doesn't come out.

264
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,110
Hopefully I get to teach my

265
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,420
children this trade and they

266
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,840
enjoy it as much as I do.

267
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,550
The oil here is trapped

268
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,620
inside porous rock that's more than two miles deep.

269
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,170
When the drill penetrates the oil-rich layers

270
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,300
the rock is shattered by small explosions

271
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,980
and oil is forced up to the surface.

272
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,110
With such heavy and dangerous equipment,

273
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:37,560
teamwork helps keep the men safe.

274
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,360
Best part of the job is

275
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,830
the people you work with.

276
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,290
Everybody on a rig is important

277
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,160
because no matter what,if that

289
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,830

278
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,920
one person makes a mistake,

279
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,610
it could jeopardize somebody's life

280
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,630
somewhere else on the rig.

281
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,390
Anything there gets loose,if

282
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,050
it hits you,it's gonna hurt.

283
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,370
Depending on the size,

284
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,290
may permanently injure you,may kill You.

285
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,070
The oil reserves beneath North Dakota

286
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,890
will keep these guys in work for at least 50 years.

287
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,330
It really makes you feel good

288
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,400
going home at the end of the day,

289
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,020
and knowing that you've done something good for your country,

290
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,900
and trying to supply for them and

291
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,310
a good day's work.

292
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,580
Oil is turned into a vast range of products,

293
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:25,620
none more essential than gas for our cars.

294
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,860
American cars and trucks swallow.

295
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,150
378 million gallons of gas a day.

296
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:40,100
That's more than a gallon for each American citizen.

297
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,730
Every man,woman,and child.

298
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:50,870
Gold, oil, and coal.

299
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,750
All valuable natural resources

300
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,580
that lie beneath America.

301
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,150
As our eastward trip continues,

302
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,320
we'll find another lucky break.

303
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,400
The super fertile soil of the mid-west.

304
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,630
Midwest,where this nation of

305
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,880
farmers found the perfect land.

318
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,960

319
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,960

306
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,630
Stretching from Kansas to

307
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,490
the Dakotas,Iowa to Ohio is

308
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,680
what's called the fruited plain

309
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,600
in America the beautiful.

310
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,670
The nation's bread basket.

311
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,850
Kevin Ames farms his Ilinois

312
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,850
land like his father and grandfather before him.

313
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,910
Well,it's interesting living

328
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,600

314
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,980
out here and farming for a living.

315
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,060
My family has been doing it over a hundred years.

316
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,320
There is great abundance here.

317
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,180
The fine-grain prairie soil

318
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,300
is perfect for wheat,corn,and soy beans.

319
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,960
Well,this soil is very highly productive.

320
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,460
It's a silty clay-loam soil.

321
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,630
It's probably five or six

322
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,920
percent organic matter.

323
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,670
Has great water-holding ability.

324
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,310
This soil is very dark

325
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,790
and just grows great crops

326
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,330
to help feed illinois and the world.

327
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,940
There's a two-million-year-old

328
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,850
secret behind the richness of this soil.

329
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,850
Right around then,the Great Ice Age arrived.

330
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,610
85% Of the area we now call the

331
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,980
midwest was cloaked in ice.

332
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,300
Glaciers up to a mile high moved

333
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,810
relentlessly across the land.

334
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,270
They ripped up rock and

335
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,230
pulverized anything that stood in their way.

336
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,540
This bulldozing effect ground

337
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,850
the rock into dust.

338
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,170
Almost two million years later

339
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,550
when the ice sheets finally retreated,

340
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,030
they exposed what they crushed.

341
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,770
Rock dust,rich in minerals,

342
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,500
was blown across the land.

343
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,190
And that's why the midwestern

344
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,500
soil is so very fertile.

345
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,420
We had several glaciers come through this area

346
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,030
that helped level the soil,

347
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,940
and grind the stones into soil.

348
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,560
The giant glaciers had a further beneficial effect.

349
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:34,220
The heavy ice flattened and leveled the landscape.

350
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,930
To work these flat expanses,

351
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:42,330
American ingenuity created mega machines.

352
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,150
This increased productivity by leaps and bounds

353
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,910
to feed our ever growing population.

354
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,940
I think as a farmer,

355
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,570
a lot of times we take the land for granted,

356
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,920
but we're very fortunate

357
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,090
to live in this rich,

358
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,840
fertile part of the country.

359
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,400
It's something that is a blessing.

360
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,320
The legacy of the Great Ice Age

361
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,260
didn't end with these flat,fertile fields.

362
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,900
When the glaciers melted,

363
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,290
they unleashed billions of gallons of Water.

364
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,650
It surged across the land.

365
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,890
The torrents rerouted ancient Rivers,

366
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:35,140
eventually creating one mighty river.

367
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,480
The Mississippi.

368
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:46,220
Today,it's a critical commercial thoroughfare.

369
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,230
The Mississippi connects the agricultural,

370
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,190
industrial,and resource rich northern

371
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,300
and central states to the gulf of mexico.

372
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:04,660
Water from 31 states flows into this river.

373
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,270
Its million-square-mile watershed

374
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,860
drains 40% of the U.S.

375
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,320
30,000 Barges work the river.

376
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,220
Each year,they transport more

377
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,660
than  20 billion of American goods and commodities.

378
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:31,680
Steel,cement,coal,and wheat.

379
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,910
Products going all over the World.

395
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,990

380
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,040
It's good for America,you know.

381
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,220
If it comes out of america

382
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,370
and it goes somewhere else,

383
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,130
then it's good for America,

384
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,390
and I'm all for that.

385
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,410
Longer than the ill fated.

386
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:51,260
Titanic and more than a little tricky to navigate,

387
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,950
Each barge stretches 1,000 feet

388
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,590
or more from bow to stern.

389
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,360
For twenty eight days straight

390
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,640
the barges are home sweet home

391
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,250
to the men that work them.

392
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,900
Our boat is like -- it's a pride thing,you know.

409
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,070

393
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,220
We take care of each other.

394
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,350
Actually,as we love each other.

395
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,600
Yeah, a family thing.

396
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,600
We eat at the dinner table together,

397
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,990
spend Christmas together,Thanksgivings together.

398
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,090
It is a lifestyle.

399
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,460
I love it right now.

400
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,450
You see pleasure boats,

401
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,250
people waving,we wave back.

402
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,760
August this year will be.

403
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,350
13 Years that I been on the river.

404
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,990
Right now,the crew of the virginia Ingram

405
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,110
is navigating the upper reaches of the.

406
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:38,150
Mississippi,north of st.Louis,Missouri.

407
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,980
A fully laden barge like this

408
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,540
needs an 18-man crew.

409
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,890
We're the eyes and ears of the pilot,you know.

410
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,000
He can't see where he's at,

411
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,550
especially these covered tops,

412
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,290
they can't see the corners.

413
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,970
The lock is 110 wide,

414
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,420
and tow is 105 wide.

415
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:01,560
So what I see are relate to him on the radio.

416
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,960
He has to trust me.

417
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,720
If he don't trust me,you have catastrophe.

418
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:10,540
We're a little cog in a big wheel,but,you know,

419
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,390
We try to do our best,work safely,

420
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,370
and keep things going like they should.

421
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,890
Navigating the river on a

422
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,540
mega barge takes enormous skill.

423
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,610
In 1996,

424
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:27,430
a barge this size lost its steering

425
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:30,480
and demolished a riverside shopping mall.

426
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,700
Pushed a lot of tonnage.

427
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,960
We've got about 28,000 tons that

428
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,500
we're shoving up through the river system.

429
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:39,960
And right now,

447
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:43,180

430
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,480
probably about 1,000 feet to stop.

431
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,350
I like my job.

432
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,970
I like being around the water for some reason.

433
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:51,540
I don't know,

434
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,490
I always liked it since I was a kid,

435
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,520
being around Water.

436
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,840
It is a cheap means of transportation.

437
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,180
It is what helped build this country.

438
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,480
When these cargos reach their destination,

439
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,610
they're offloaded,bound for other parts of the U.S.

440
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,260
And the rest of the world.

441
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,920
All made possible by melting glaciers.

442
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,360
Off the river and heading east again,

443
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,540
the next stop is michigan.

444
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,110
It's a state endowed with what

445
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,860
is arguably America's greatest natural resource.

446
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:31,970
Iron.

447
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,960
Michigan's iron drove America's industrial revolution

448
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,550
and literally built modern America.

467
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,210

468
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,210

449
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,000
America has a backbone of solid steel.

450
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,110
It's built our bridges,

451
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,840
railroads, ships, tanks,

452
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,180
factories, cars, and aircraft.

453
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,610
For centuries,

454
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,170
we have dug,carved,blasted

455
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:06,980
great bands of iron ore out of the ground.

456
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,290
But what made American iron so accessible and

457
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,180
how did it get there in the first place?

458
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,870
The story of america's iron

459
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:22,060
begins 11 billion years ago.

460
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,790
Earth did not exist.

461
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,610
But iron rich dust left behind

462
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,850
from an ancient exploding star

463
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,900
began to circle and collide in space.

464
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,510
Five and a half billion years later,

465
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,270
our planet was formed.

466
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,540
Heavy elements,which included most of the iron,

467
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:48,040
sank to form the Earth's molten core.

468
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,210
But some iron remained topside,

469
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,880
trapped in rock in the crust of the ancient planet.

470
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:03,200
A rich concentration of these rocks is here

471
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,760
in Michigan's upper peninsula.

472
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:11,970
Michigan mines produce a quarter of America's iron ore.

473
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,720
Driving down the road in an active mine,

494
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,560

474
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,730
so a lot of the rocks in this area

475
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,480
have already been extracted out.

476
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,590
Like our underground stores of oil,

477
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,800
the iron deposits here date back to

478
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,420
when much of our continent was covered in water.

479
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,830
You would have to go 1.85 billion years.

480
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:43,310
At that time,there would have been a shallow sea in this area.

481
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,900
So we would be under water right now.

482
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:52,600
The ancient sea ebbed and flowed for a billion years.

483
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:01,710
Over that time,iron from deeper in the Earth's crust

484
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:06,810
came up through cracks in the sea bed,carried by super-heated steam.

485
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:11,870
The iron particles sank and settled on the ocean floor,

486
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,060
mixed between layers of sand.

487
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,850
These are the red banded iron deposits

488
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,200
found in this Michigan mine today.

489
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,060
We know from exploration drilling

490
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,780
that we have at least 3,000 feet

491
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,800
of continuous iron formation.

492
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,800
And in most of the areas here,

493
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,100
we actually have not drilled down

494
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,580
to the bottom of that iron formation yet.

495
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,260
What we got right here is the banded iron formation.

496
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,650
It is a lot harder.

497
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:45,920
It wears our bits out,

498
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,760
takes longer to drill.

499
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,930
The numbers tells us how deep we are in the hole,

521
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:52,520

500
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:53,520
so we don't lose track of what depth we're at.

501
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,760
This is Dearborn, Michigan.

502
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,840
The site of Henry Ford's original steel plant.

503
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:14,230
Here iron mined from the banded iron ore

504
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,480
is transformed into steel.

505
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,350
24 Automobiles can be made from one single slab of this steel.

506
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,420
Turning iron into steel is not for the faint-hearted.

507
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:39,190
Carbon and other elements need to be added at extreme temperatures--

508
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,180
up to 3,500 degrees--

509
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,150
seven times hotter than a home oven.

510
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,990
That's why we wear aluminized jackets,

533
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,710

511
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:49,680
shrouds, spats.

512
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,000
Lt can be pretty frightening at times,

513
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,910
because we have sparks shooting at you,

514
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:59,940
sometimes you may get a drop of iron coming your way.

515
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,370
You have to really pay attention to what you're doing.

516
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,930
Nothing to play with.

517
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,510
Iron is one of Earth's heaviest metals.

518
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,670
It's so heavy,

519
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,890
it sinks to the bottom of the furnace,

520
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,300
leaving the impurities which are lighter behind.

521
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,520
We have a lot of pressure on the furnace,

522
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,140
and the iron is heavy.

523
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,530
And so when you open the hole,

524
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,530
iron is the first thing that comes out.

525
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:29,860
More than 11 billion years after its creation,

526
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,200
the iron is returned to its liquid state.

527
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,370
Then the workers add metal alloys to produce steel,

528
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:41,520
which is much stronger and more malleable than pure iron.

529
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:46,220
I feel very fortunate that America has given us

553
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,960

530
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,050
all the great resources of iron to make steel,

531
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,520
so we can give them to the rest of the world.

532
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:55,960
Henry Ford started this a hundred years ago.

533
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:58,330
We still have some of the original building.

534
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,670
I have great pride to be able to work in this place

535
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,840
that Henry Ford started.

536
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,840
From the iron ore beneath our feet,

537
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,230
American steel has found its way

538
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,400
into millions of automobiles.

539
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,390
Iron has been used to make everything

540
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,940
from skyscraper girders to fire hydrants.

541
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,440
Actually,it's kind of funny.

542
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,400
We'll drive down the road,

543
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,410
and I know that we made a part for that vehicle

544
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,750
or we made steel for that appliance,

545
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,460
and I can say that I was part of that.

546
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,100
As we continue heading east,

547
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,470
we come to a mountain range that,

548
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,790
like the Rockies,

549
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,980
stretches down the entire length of the continent.

550
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,700
Only these mountains are much older

551
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,330
and were much taller.

552
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,970
They were a critical factor

553
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:51,400
in the success of the earliest European settlers.

554
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,350
The Appalachians.

579
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,040

580
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,040

555
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,890
America,the most powerful land on Earth.

556
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,790
Solid as a rock,right?

557
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,200
Wrong.

558
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,410
Go back a few hundred million years,

559
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,380
and this continent was being battered,bent

560
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,950
and shunted around by forces almost impossible to imagine.

561
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,900
What knocked our continent into

562
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,100
the shape we know today

563
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,960
and created the oldest mountains we have?

564
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,940
It all happened 300 million years ago

565
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,300
when the ancient continents of Europe and North Africa

566
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,540
smashed into the forerunner of North America...

567
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,740
And formed a new super continent -- Pangaea.

568
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,660
The impact was even greater than the geological collision

569
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,390
that formed the Rockies.

570
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,400
It forced up one of the tallest mountain ranges

571
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,870
that has ever been,

572
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,950
although you wouldn't know it today.

573
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,750
The ground here is still moving,

574
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,310
shifting along fault lines left over

575
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,310
from that primeval collision...

576
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,490
and occasionally creating earthquakes,

577
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,050
like the one in Virginia,

578
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:17,960
felt over much of the eastern U.S.In August,2011.

579
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,800
When they were first formed,

580
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,290
the Appalachians were jagged and higher

581
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,690
than the Himalayas.

582
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,500
Like all old mountains,

583
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,250
they have eroded down to gentler slopes,

584
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,990
little more than hills

585
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,850
running 2,000 miles

586
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:38,020
from Alabama to Canada.

587
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,000
They may be old,

588
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,970
but they still yield natural riches.

589
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,200
The northern end of the range

590
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,560
dominates the interior of Maine.

591
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,590
Here, the worn-down mountains

592
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:01,850
are shrouded in 17 million acres of forest.

593
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,870
Trees cover 80% of the state.

594
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:09,570
Dick Slike manages the forest.

595
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,040
If you look at the state of Maine

596
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,980
and think of its geologic history,

597
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,650
of course,the mountains were built ages ago.

598
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,830
They're ancient,ancient mountains,

625
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,200

599
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,470
and the bedrock is granite.

600
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,680
Over time, that rock

601
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,890
that rock has eroded

602
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:27,230
and donated its valuable minerals to the forest soil.

603
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,920
And,of course,then you have the trees dropping the leaves,

604
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,190
which becomes humus.

605
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,420
And so the soil becomes a thin layer of inorganic soil

606
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,240
topped by a thick layer of leaves and needles

607
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,880
and things that become an organic component.

608
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:46,790
Maine's logging industry is worth  4 billion a year,

609
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:52,780
and it has been important economically for hundreds of years.

610
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,290
My father was a logger.

638
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,850

611
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,500
His father before him was a logger.

612
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,520
His father before him was a logger.

613
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,260
They basically started logging

614
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:06,550
when they came over here from Scotland and England,

615
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,160
so it goes back a long ways.

616
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,460
The forests that grow on the Appalachian slopes

617
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,770
up and down the eastern U.S.Were a vital resource

618
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:19,740
for both Native Americans and early settlers from Europe.

619
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,250
I think when people came across on the wooden ships,

620
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:26,190
instantly people that had worked wood in Scandinavia or Europe

621
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,460
saw the potential.

622
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,160
They built their homes out of the wood.

623
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,760
It was a basic building block that got people started.

624
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:37,360
The first Europeans arrived in Maine in 1609.

625
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,300
The Appalachian forest gave them

626
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,700
not only the means to survive,

627
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,070
but to expand.

628
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,200
[Sandian]Started to build,

629
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,960
they took the trees down all over the state of Maine,

630
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,490
pushed them down the rivers to Bangor and those places,

631
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,280
sawed them into boards,

632
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,900
and basically built America with those boards.

633
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:00,280
Boards from Appalachian timber are still used

634
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,430
to build American homes,churches,and railroad ties.

635
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,200
And Maine's logging industry supports more than 50,000 jobs.

636
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,000
I honestly believe that you couldn't live without logging

637
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,860
because you basically build your houses out of it,

638
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:23,630
a lot of people keep warm by it,and it's real important.

639
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,710
I think the forests of Maine will definitely help give America

640
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,670
its future and its shape.

641
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,340
There's always going to be vast forest production here.

642
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,090
Appalachian rock underpins more than just economic success.

643
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:48,790
It's the solid platform that allowed New York City

644
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,450
to reach for the sky.

673
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:54,740

674
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,740

645
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,840
Along the Atlantic coast,

646
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,510
mountains are so eroded

647
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,740
that you would hardly know they're there.

648
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,170
But the bedrock remains

649
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,570
and plays a surprisingly important role.

650
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:20,200
It gives a solid base for the skyscrapers of Manhattan.

651
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,570
The higher these buildings rise into the sky,

652
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,610
the more they have to be rooted into the earth beneath.

653
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,930
This is ground zero,

654
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:41,300
site of the new World Trade Center -

655
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,520
the biggest civil engineering project in America.

656
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:48,350
Here,the hard,eroded bedrock of the Appalachians

657
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,900
will soon support seven soaring towers.

658
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,210
The first - 52 stories high - has already been built.

659
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,420
Engineers have dug over 100 feet down

660
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,690
into the ancient bedrock.

661
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,510
Right now,we are about 74 feet below sea level.

692
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,800

662
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,370
So we're standing on a rock excavation,

663
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,140
and the natural bedrock was probably 10 or 15 feet higher

664
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,190
than where I'm standing right now.

665
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,450
It's actually a very hard rock.

666
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:24,260
It was originally soft,sedimentary rock

667
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,530
and was transformed into hard,crystalline rock

668
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,680
when the continents collided.

669
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,990
The heat and the pressure changed the rock

670
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,510
from the original components

671
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,060
into this crystalline rock that we have now

672
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:41,490
that allows us to put these building loads on top of it.

673
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:45,340
There's no question there would have been a settlement here,

674
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,740
and probably a city,

675
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,690
but not this city -

676
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:53,200
not without its natural platform for building up.

677
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,950
I grew up here,I live here,it's great.

709
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:59,790

678
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,420
But,you know,just think of the history of Manhattan,

679
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,630
you know,it's where it all started.

680
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,810
America began,yeah,the pilgrims came to other parts,

681
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,570
but they all came to New York

682
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,160
because it was a great place to build a city.

683
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,910
The hard bedrock meant that

684
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,570
some of the first-ever skyscrapers were built here.

685
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,180
And today,

686
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,980
the city has the most famous skyscrapers in the world.

687
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,040
You've got the Chrysler Building,

688
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,180
and then,of course,we've got the Empire State Building.

689
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,100
That's,you know,everyone thinks of New York,

690
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,520
they think of the Chrysler Building

691
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,900
and the Empire State Building.

692
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,070
They're all sitting on bedrock.

693
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,310
But Manhattan's bedrock isn't totally flat.

694
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,050
In some places it curves downward,

695
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,950
and the depressions have been filled in

696
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:43,470
with softer, younger rock.

697
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,950
Under Greenwich Village,

698
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,120
a dip in the bedrock below is mirrored above ground

699
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,220
by a dip in the skyline.

700
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,880
In Midtown,where the bedrock is nearer the surface,

701
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,920
the skyscrapers reappear.

702
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,820
A 21st-century American city

703
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:08,820
built upon foundations created 300 million years ago.

704
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,800
When the Appalachians were thrown up,

705
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,100
they were the greatest mountains on Earth.

706
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,980
100 Million years later,

707
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,130
the supercontinent,Pangaea,split apart.

708
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,300
North America,

709
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,350
in more or less the same shape we know it today,

710
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,680
was born.

711
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:36,850
In our journey across America,

712
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,530
we've found tremendous riches

713
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:41,170
that have come from beneath our feet -

714
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:47,180
volcanic outpourings of lava in our most western state...

715
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:54,920
gold that helped create California's wealth...

716
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,980
coal and oil from living plants and animals

717
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:05,150
that once thrived in ancient seas and swamps...

718
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,800
iron from which we have built our cars,bridges,and railroads...

719
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,040
timber to build our houses...

720
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:22,270
and the rock foundations of our mighty skyscrapers.

721
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,720
Over billions of years,the land that was to become the U.S.A.

722
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:33,250
Was endowed with greater geological riches

723
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,450
than any other nation on Earth.

724
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:38,520
It's taken centuries of invention,industry and skill

725
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:43,090
for us to dig,blast,and tease those resources -

726
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:45,370
what lies beneath America - out of the ground.

727
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:50,870
Nature's raw power and the courage of the American people

728
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,720
have been the unstoppable forces

729
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,460
that made us the rich and powerful nation we are today.

762

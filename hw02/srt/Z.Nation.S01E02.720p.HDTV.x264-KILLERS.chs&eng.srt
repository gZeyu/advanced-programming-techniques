20
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,430
太好了  威尔森山  这里是北极光
Yes! Mount Wilson, you have Northern Light.

21
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,570
我们被一大群四级僵尸病毒感染者攻击

我们的防御已被突破

23
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,350
四周有通高压电的围墙  大家逃不出去
Our escape has been blocked by a high voltage fence.

24
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,210
你从这里能到达电源网格的地方吗
Can you access the power grid from your location?

25
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,270
不可能  我们这里通往断电器的路上
Negative. There are too many Zs between us

26
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:58,860
有太多的僵尸了
and the breakers.

27
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,650
好的  我在这里应该可以做些事情
All right. I might be able to do something from my end.

28
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,870
如果我可以进入到你们实验室的网络系统
If I can access anything on your lab network

29
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,240
它和外墙共用一台发电机
powered by the same generator

30
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,770
我可以让它过载断电
I might be able to overload it,

31
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,160
这样就可以切断围墙上的高压电了
knock out power to the fence.

32
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,750
我不知道密码

Uhhh, Mount Wilson.

38
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,550
我们随时可以进行过载断电操作了
We are ready to execute overload.

39
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,350
但是我看到你们的主机和基因序列
But I'm showing your mainframe and gene sequencer

40
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,990
都在同一个网络里
on the same network.

41
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,450
如果我进行过载操作  很有可能主机里
That means any vaccine files that you have on that mainframe

42
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,920
所有的疫苗文件都会毁掉
are likely to be destroyed.

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,160
收到请指示
Please advise me.

44
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,730
威尔森山  我已准备好过载  请指示
Mount Wilson, I'm ready to execute overload. Please advise.

45
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,680
如果我这么做  你们的努力将付之一炬
If I do this, I'm going to fry your work.

46
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,970
你们有备份吗
Do you have a backup?

47
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,460
-威尔森山  -这里僵尸太多了
- Mount Wilson?  - There's too many!

48
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,090
你现在就得把我们
You've got to get us

49
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,110
从这里弄出去

00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,900
我踹他一脚会损害抗体吗
Would it hurt the antibodies if I kicked him in the nuts?

145
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,740
孩子  你叫什么
So what's your name, kid?

146
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
一万
Ten Thousand.

147
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,000
这不是名字  是个数字
That is not a name. It's a number.

148
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,010
这是我的名字  我自创的
It's my name. Made it up myself.

149
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,820
想必也是
Well I suppose you'd have to.

150
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,660
有什么深意吗
Does it mean anything?

151
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,810
是我要消灭的僵尸的数量
How many zombies I'm going to kill.

152
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,730
这可不是小数目呢
Well that's a whole lot of zombies.

153
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,060
我已经灭掉1055个了
Already on 1,055.

154
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,250
靠
Damn!

155
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,620
杀够一万个又怎样呢
So what happens when you get to 10,000

156
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,850
改名字呗
Change my name.

157
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,740
改成什么  两万吗
To what? Twenty thousand?

158
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,440
杰夫
Jeff.

159
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,110
我喜欢杰夫这个名字
I like the name Jeff.

160
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,540
闭嘴吧
Ah, shut up.

161
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,140
大家都去哪了
Where did everybody go?

162
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,140
我看不见任何生还者  除了那两个车手
I haven't seen a survivor except for those two bikers.

163
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,700
黑色夏季  人都饿死了
Black Summer. Everybody starved to death.

164
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,640
黑色夏季时我在费城
I was in Philly for Black Summer.

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,950
那时很惨  我瘦了30磅
It was bad. I lost thirty pounds.

166
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,530
我以为自己要死了
Thought I was dead.

167
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,050
那你怎么活过来的
How did you survive?

168
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,670
为了生存我什么都做尽
Did what I had to do.

169
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,960
别开枪  不是僵尸
Hold on. It's not a Z.

170
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,910
别激动  我没被咬
Peace. No bites here.

171
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,250
绝对是正常人
100 percent alive.

172
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,900
你那哥们呢
What happened to your friend?

173
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,920
搞了半天他还有个缺德朋友
Turns out he had other friends of low morals.

174
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,060
把我车抢了
Took my ride.

175
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,570
偷人座驾  该枪毙
Horse thieves should be shot.

176
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,420
怨你交友不慎
You should choose better friends.

177
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,730
多谢指点
Good advice.

178
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,630
我们不想生事
What can we do for you?

179
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,080
你一个路人来找我们想做什么
One peaceful group of humans to a lone traveler?

180
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,200
最好能载我一程
Could use a lift.

181
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,560
一个人可没法在外面过夜
Sure don't want to spend the night out here alone.

182
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,950
抱歉  我们不是做租车生意的
Sorry. We ain't running a taxi service.

183
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,240
你这是要去哪
Which way are you headed?

184
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,920
只要不往回走就行
Any direction but back.

185
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,460
谣传说在纽约南边
Word is there's a horde on the move

186
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,940
有一大群僵尸正在移动
south on the New York side.

187
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,370
我瞧见你们到处找汽油
I see you're scrounging for gas.

188
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,180
好比那句老话  搭车掏钱  没钱滚蛋
You know like we used to say, ass, gas or grass.

189
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,080
意思是搭车得给人好处
Nobody rides for free.

190
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,860
我知道你们在哪能找到汽油
I know where you could fill up.

191
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,920
你最好现在就告诉我们
Now would be the time to share that information.

192
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,990
那地方叫泽西恶魔精炼厂  大概五里地远吧
Place called Jersey Devil Refinery, maybe five miles off,

193
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,180
一下高速就是
just off the turnpike.

194
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,790
你怎么知道那有汽油
How do you know there's gas there?

195
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,950
僵尸爆发第一天那里就被血洗了
Got overrun day number one.

196
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,520
所有油罐都是满的
All the tanks are still full,

197
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,220
放在那等着变质
just rusting away.

198
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,260
那好  带我们去精炼厂
All right, take us to this refinery.

199
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,890
如果真如你所说有汽油
And if there's gas there like you say,

200
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,970
我们会把你带到下一个安全点
you can ride with us to the next outpost.

201
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,310
你们肯定不会白去
You won't be sorry.

202
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,230
这你可说对了
You got that right.

203
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,220
咱们出发
Let's get out of here.

204
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,400
新人跟我和沃伦一辆车
New guy's gonna ride with me and Warren.

205
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,860
其他人上卡车
Everybody else load up in the truck.

206
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,520
是不是以后每次停车  我们都要让
So are we just gonna pick up every sketchy loser

207
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,190
这些个废物搭便车
at every place we stop?

208
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,020
我们这不是就让你搭上车了么
Well we brought you along, didn't we?

209
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,150
再说了  也没人问我有没有意见
Besides, nobody consulted me.

210
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,010
我们不会真要跟这家伙去加州吧
We're not really going to California with this guy, are we?

211
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,300
世界末日就跟戒毒似的  小子
You know the Apocalypse is a lot like rehab, kid.

212
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,880
过一天是一天
Just take it one day at a time,

213
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,170
该做什么做什么
and then do the next indicated thing.

214
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,540
眼下  该做的就是找汽油
In this case, that means get more gas.

215
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,300
找完了汽油  谁知道呢
After that, who knows?

216
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,310
我们完蛋了
We're doomed.

217
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,890
不出所料
Well there you have it.

218
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,440
彻底没油了
We're officially on E.

219
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,980
还有多远
How much further?

220
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,250
近在眼前了
Spittin' distance.

221
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,900
{\an8}泽西恶魔精炼厂

222
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,990
这哪里是精炼厂
That's not a refinery.

223
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,840
简直就是个僵尸工厂
That's a zombie factory.

224
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,890
该死的僵尸
Frackin' zombies.

225
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,400
他们貌似非常迫切地想拿到那边的什么
They seem to want something in there real bad.

226
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,680
是那个声音
It's that sound.

227
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,960
就像蜜蜂闻见花香
Like bees to honey.

228
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,520
或者僵尸闻见尸臭
Or Zs to shit.

229
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,990
你知道是这幅景象吗
Hey, you know about this?

230
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,500
反正你们在别处也找不着汽油了
Hey, all the easy gas is gone.

231
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,980
那你们有什么高见啊
So what's the brilliant plan?

232
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,770
死翘翘  被僵尸啃  早早回老家吗
Die, get eaten, go home early?

233
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,100
这是什么味儿
What's that smell?

234
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,790
僵尸的臭气和汽油味
The undead and gasoline.

235
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,840
都非常易燃
Both highly flammable.

236
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,060
所以绝对不能开火
So no firearms of any kind.

237
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,220
那你打算怎么处理
So how do you want to handle this?

238
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,380
首先我们得想法子让那声音停下来
Well first we got to shut off whatever's making that noise.

239
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,800
可能是油泵之类的
Okay, it's probably some kind of pump.

240
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
但是在哪
But where?

241
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,760
跟着僵尸走就是了
Follow the zombies.

242
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,970
他们貌似都朝着油罐架的最上边移动
They all seem to be headed for the top of that catalog.

243
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,990
我们爬上去查查看
We'll get up there and check it out.

244
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,650
我们需要用某种声音把僵尸从气泵那里引开
Then we got to have a sound that draws the Zs away from the pump

245
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,990
这样我们才能取到汽油
so we can get to the gas.

246
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,050
抱歉  我把吉他留在蓝天营了
Sorry, I left my guitar back at Camp Blue Sky.

247
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,400
车喇叭声可以吗
Car horns?

248
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,410
不行  这会把它们都吸引到这个地方来
No, they'll all just head this way.

249
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,560
还有所有能听见这声音的僵尸
And so will every other dead head within earshot.

250
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,620
我有办法
I have something.

251
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,350
僵尸都喜欢高音调的声音
Zs like high-pitched sounds.

252
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,910
越动听的声音它们越喜欢
The more musical the better.

253
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,400
真是每天都能学到新知识
Wow, learn something everyday.

254
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,260
好极了
That's great.

255
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,210
你就是我们的诱饵
You're our decoy.

256
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,100
我跟她一起去
I'll go with her.

257
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
我不需要他帮忙
I don't need his help.

258
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,880
不  你需要掩护  跟他一起去
No, you need cover. Take him.

259
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,280
走到架桥的小道上面  再开始放音乐
And start the music when you get to the top of that catwalk.

260
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,880
你们两个  到另外架桥的那一侧
You two, get to the top of the other side

261
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,800
看看能不能关掉那声音  明白了吗
and see if you can kill that noise. Got it.

262
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,850
那孩子去哪了
Where'd that kid go?

263
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,960
一分钟前他还在这里呢
He was here a minute ago.

264
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,930
还有  他的名字是一万
Oh and his name is Ten Thousand.

265
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,230
他最好能在我们动身之前回来
Well he better be back by the time we're ready to go.

266
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,210
如果我们能发动那辆油罐车
Hey, if we get that tanker started

267
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,760
我们就可以从那里加油了
and we could fill it up from the main tank,

268
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,080
这么多油够我们跑到加利福尼亚了
that much gas would get us to California.

269
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,520
我喜欢你这个想法
I like the way you think.

270
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,520
那等下你们都快被烧死的时候
So what should I be doing

271
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,590
我应该做点什么呢
while you all are getting incinerated to death?

272
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,630
好吧  你为何不带卧底先生
All right, why don't you take Mr. Congeniality here

273
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,280
和这辆萨伯曼SUV到安全地带去呢
and the Suburban and get back to a safe distance,

274
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,480
以防万一
just in case.

275
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,890
那如果  你知道的  僵尸回来了怎么办
What if... you know... zombies?

276
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,660
如果我们都不幸出事了
If this all ends in tears,

277
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,240
你一定要带他到加利福尼亚去
you got to get him to California.

278
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,180
我会的
Sure.

279
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,000
没问题
No problem.

280
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,760
稍等一下  朋友  稍等  我会帮你
Wait one second, buddy. Wait one second. I got you.

281
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,860
我们到了
There you go.

282
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,910
很好  让我帮你暖和一下吧
All right, let's warm you up.

283
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,560
外面冷极了  对吧
Oh yeah, it's cold outside, isn't it?

284
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,180
好的  好孩子  好孩子
Yeah. Good boy. Good boy.

285
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,080
你真是疯了
You're crazy.

286
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,970
森夏恩  等等
Sunshine! Hold up!

287
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,720
慢点
Hey! Slow down!

288
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,190
你会把我们俩都害死的
You're gonna get us both killed.

289
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,700
其实只有一个人会死
Actually just one of us.

290
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,080
我知道你想做什么
I know what you're trying to do.

291
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,340
这没用的
It is not gonna work.

292
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,980
你一点也不了解我
You don't know anything about me.

293
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,310
我了解托拜亚斯
I know Tobias

294
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,910
其他家庭成员也不会让你走的  森夏恩
and the rest of the family is never gonna let you leave Sunshine.

295
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,660
我不会再回去了
Well I'm never going back.

296
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,230
还有  我不是森夏恩
And my name isn't Sunshine.

297
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,260
那个女孩早就死了
That girl died a long time ago.

298
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,600
你不明白
You don't understand.

299
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,710
没有你  我不能回去
I can't go back without you.

300
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,990
这可不是对家人该有的态度
That's no way to treat family.

301
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,250
艾迪
Addy.

302
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,600
听着  我就是不相信摩菲
Look, I just don't trust Murphy.

303
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,140
带着那混蛋一起走绝对是个错误
It's all wrong with that dick.

304
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,830
他不只是疯癫而已
He's more than just a little crazy.

305
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,100
这整个任务都疯癫
This whole mission is insane.

306
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,930
沃伦和加内特可不会这么想
Warren and Garnett don't think so.

307
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,440
哈蒙德为了保护他而死
Hammond died trying to protect him,

308
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,560
还有很多人为他而牺牲
and so did a lot of other people.

309
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,880
你也想这样吗
You want to do the same?

310
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,500
不
No.

311
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,290
万一这是真的呢
What if it's true?

312
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,510
万一摩菲真如他们所说的那样
What if Murphy's who they say he is

313
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,660
万一我们真有机会制造出疫苗呢
and there's a chance for a vaccine?

314
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,300
世界已面临末日  没机会补救了  艾迪
You don't get a do-over on the end of the world, Addy.

315
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,560
-已经太晚了  -哪怕只有一丝机会
- It's too late. - If we have the slightest chance

316
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,540
能够唤醒我所熟知的世界
of waking up in the world I remember...

317
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,930
让死者安息
Where dead things stay dead...

318
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,460
我也要抓住这个机会
That's a chance I'm gonna take.

319
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,160
因为那是个希望  麦克
Cuz that's hope, Mack.

320
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,060
你知道我已经有多久没有这样的感觉了吗
You know how long it's been since I've felt something like that?

321
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,420
那不是希望  那是谎话
It's not hope. It's a lie.

322
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,030
这谎话会害死我们的
And it's gonna get us both killed.

323
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,020
那我也情愿因相信这个谎话而死
Well then I'd rather die believing in a lie

324
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,940
总好过没有信仰地苟且活着
than live believing in nothing.

325
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,180
天哪  你说大道理的时候真性感
Damn, you're sexy when you get all philosophical.

326
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,390
继续转啊
Keep cranking.

327
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,560
转出来的能量都能给一座小城市供电了
Cranking enough to light up a small city.

328
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,820
好了
Here.

329
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,860
试试
Try it.

330
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,020
好啦  快点  这车快没油了
Okay, hurry up. It's almost running out of gas.

331
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,880
不用等很久
Not for long.

332
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,270
噪音一停我们就准备走
Get ready to go as soon as they kill that noise.

333
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,980
快点
Come on.

334
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,390
好酷啊
That was cool.

335
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,100
没错  这个坏家伙就是问题所在啊
Yeah. This bad boy's the problem all right.

336
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,970
火跟噪音都是僵尸的最爱
Nothing zombies like more than fire and noise.

337
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:50,700
是啊  还有人脑
Yeah, except brains.

338
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,990
我们怎么才能关掉这个
How do we turn it off?

339
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,220
制动按钮坏了
Well the stop button doesn't work.

340
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,610
可能是因为压强太大了
Must operate on pressure.

341
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,480
这好像是个减压阀什么的
Like some kind of relief valve or something.

342
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,350
或许我们可以卡住它
Maybe we can jam it up.

343
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,100
那这么高的压强怎么办  从哪儿排出来
Well what about the pressure or whatever it's venting?

344
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,110
我们没工夫四处找原因
Yeah, we don't hang around to find out.

345
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,050
加上油就赶紧跑
Get the gas and get out of dodge.

346
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,840
我们得找根棍子什么的卡住它
We just need something to jam it up with like a pole or something.

347
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,640
不行  这是我的最爱
No! I love this thing.

348
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,210
想别的办法
Figure it out!

349
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,420
喂  那些僵尸
Hey, what happened to all the

350
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,460
爬上来之后发生什么了
zombies that have been coming up here? Huh?

351
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,710
好吧
Okay.

352
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,370
他们成功了
They did it.

353
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,650
行了  准备好
All right. Get ready.

354
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:53,960
好的
Okay.

355
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:54,980
我们得走了
We should go.

356
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,870
嗯
Yeah.

357
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,680
小心
Watch out!

358
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,170
太好搞定了
That was handy.

359
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,400
现在总算知道那些僵尸发生什么了
Now we know what happened to the zombies.

360
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,350
好吧  真的该走了
Okay, it's really time to go.

361
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,880
不知道那边怎么样了
Wonder how it's going?

362
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,680
还没听到什么爆响声
Haven't heard anything blow up.

363
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,780
目前为止
Yet.

364
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,720
八
Eights.

365
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,740
抓牌吧
Go fish.

366
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,350
动手
Do it.

367
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:21,070
好了  行了  现在必须得走了
Okay. Okay. Now it's really time to go.

368
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,000
这儿  宝贝
Here, boy!

369
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,970
你去哪儿了  小家伙
Where did you go, fellow.

370
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:37,570
嘿  宝贝
Hey, boy.

371
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,500
你在哪儿
Where are you?

372
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,480
过来  狗狗
Come here, doggy.

373
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,120
来吧
Come on.

374
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,930
找到你了
There you are.

375
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,380
你还好吧  宝贝  你想喝点水吗
How are you, boy? Do you want some water?

376
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,710
渴不渴  渴吧
Are you thirsty? Yeah.

377
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,720
来这儿  喝点水
Come here. Let's get some water.

378
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,790
好吧
Yeah.

379
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,130
你渴吗
Are you thirsty?

380
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,670
你是个口渴的小狗狗吧
Are you a thirsty boy?

381
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,490
喝吧
There we go.

382
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,330
这就对了  都喝光  伙计
Yeah, that's right. Drink up, buddy.

383
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,230
喝光光
Drink up.

384
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:31,990
狗狗
Dog!

385
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,950
狗狗  回来
Dog, come back!

386
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,260
狗狗
Dog!

387
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,880
干得漂亮  上面有什么
Nice job. What was up there?

388
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,330
有个类似于压力控制阀的东西
Some kind of a pressure valve thing.

389
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,930
不过罐里面都是僵尸粘液  都快装满了
But that tank is full of zombie goo, like to the top.

390
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,430
美极了  不过撑不了多久  伙计们
Beautiful. It ain't gonna hold, guys.

391
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,960
放音乐
Start the music!

392
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:53,910
让我们一齐舞动吧
Let's dance.

393
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,930
我会受到诅咒的
I'll be damned.

394
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,520
我来拿软管
I got the hose.

395
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,490
这儿  给我
Here. Give me that.

396
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,500
准备好了吗
You ready?

397
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,280
启动
Firing up.

398
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,730
我头一回见到有人连打牌都作弊
First time I've ever seen anybody cheat at go fish.

399
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,990
这可是一种天赋
It's a gift.

400
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,800
怎么要搞这么久
What the hell is taking so long?

401
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,610
现在的服务大不如前啊
Full service just ain't what it used to be.

402
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,630
放松点
Relax.

403
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,570
加内特和沃伦心里有数
Garnett and Warren know what they're doing.

404
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,830
这附近僵尸太多了  怪吓人的
Too many Zs around here. It's freaking me out.

405
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,530
我有恐惧症
I got a phobia

406
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,330
你知道的  就是自从我被咬了以后
you know ever since I got bit.

407
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,960
我一直想问你这个  那些咬伤...
I've been meaning to ask you about that. So these bites...

408
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,750
等等  你到底是什么医生
Wait. What kind of doctor are you anyway?

409
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,640
不算是医生  更像个业余药理学家吧
Not really a doctor, more of an amateur pharmacologist.

410
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,570
你呢
What about you?

411
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,780
你怎么会成为人类的救世主的
How'd you get to be the savior of the human race?

412
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,070
你真想知道
You really wanna know?

413
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,220
事实是  对于一个蒙冤的人来说
Truth is for a guy who's been wrongly convicted,

414
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,960
我其实很热心
I'm actually very civic-minded.

415
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,470
我是自愿的
I volunteered.

416
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,490
你们抓错人了  我什么都没干
You got the wrong guy. I didn't do nothin'.

417
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,310
伙计们  正规程序不是这样的
Look, I'm being denied my due process, man!

418
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,510
放我走
Come on. Let me go.

419
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,080
我是无辜的
I'm innocent, man.

420
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,400
放开我
Let me go.

421
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,960
虽然很不好受  但是总有人得挺身而出
It wasn't easy, but somebody had to do it.

422
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,700
天  除非他们把我打个半死
Man, they would have to beat me senseless,

423
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,100
再绑起来  我才会让他们
strap me down, before I'd ever let anybody inject me

424
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,450
把僵尸病毒注射到我身子里
with a live zombie virus.

425
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,500
这不是我个人的问题
Yeah, well it wasn't about me.

426
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,090
你得做你该做的事
You know you do what you got to do.

427
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,630
为了孩子们
For the kids...

428
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,820
所以你注射了疫苗以后
So you... you got the vaccine

429
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,350
再被咬了吗
and then you got bitten?

430
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,480
被咬了八次
Eight times.

431
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,860
天哪
Good God.

432
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:31,890
非要数的话
If you say so.

433
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,760
肯定很可怕
That must have been horrible.

434
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,890
是啊
Must have been.

435
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,310
幸运的是我晕过去了  什么都记不得了
Luckily I blacked out, so I don't remember any of it.

436
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:43,490
然后哈蒙德不知怎的就把我救了
Somehow Hammond rescued me.

437
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,660
我想迟来总比不来好
Better late than never, I guess.

438
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,100
后来就一直徒于奔命
And been on the run ever since.

439
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,720
现在哈蒙德也死了
Now Hammond's dead, too.

440
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,440
是啊  死得真是时候
Yep. Good times.

441
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,070
好像来了点鼻子很灵光的伙计
We got some nosey neighbors.

442
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,710
呼叫其他人
Call the others!

443
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,590
你在把它们引过来
You're attracting them!

444
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,340
我们快走
Get us out of here!

445
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,320
闭嘴
Shut up!

446
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,360
好样的
This is great.

447
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,870
你朋友把这灌满
Your friends tank up,

448
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,310
我们再把它拿走
and we take it from them.

449
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,670
没有什么"我们"
There is no we .

450
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,470
我不会回去的
I'm not going back.

451
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,690
只要我还有一口气
Not alive.

452
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,660
你为什么非要作对呢
Why do you keep fighting this?

453
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,450
你知道他不可能让你走的
You know he's never gonna let you go.

454
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,540
我什么都做得出来
I will do whatever I have to do.

455
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,400
你要做什么
You'll do what?!

456
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,840
告诉你的新朋友我的身份吗
Tell your new friends who I am?

457
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:35,410
要是我告诉他们你是谁的话会怎么样
What happens when I tell them what you are?!

458
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,960
不  天哪
No! God!

459
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,660
天哪  兄弟
Good grief, dude.

460
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,590
摩菲  好吧
Murphy, all right.

461
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,190
摩菲  摩菲
Murphy. Murphy.

462
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,210
看着我
Look at me.

463
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,550
看着我的眼睛
In my eyes.

464
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,200
你在这里很安全
You're safe in here man.

465
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,800
他们抓不到你
They can't get you.

466
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,710
做几个深呼吸  伙计
Now just try to breathe through it, man.

467
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,280
深呼吸
Breathe.

468
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,260
就在那里  就在那里
Right there. Right there.

469
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,790
够了  这只有两个僵尸而已
All right, that's enough. Look, there's only two of them.

470
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,700
伙计  我现在就出去
Look man, I'm gonna go out there.

471
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,140
我会把它们赶走
I'm gonna draw them away

472
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,720
一个个都干掉
and I'm gonna mercy them.

473
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,590
现在你给我冷静下来
Now you just... just chill out.

474
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,780
为什么事事都要大费周章
Why is nothing ever easy?

475
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,650
行了  跟我来孩子们
Okay, follow me boys!

476
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:24,770
快来
Come on!

477
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,840
鲜肉哦
Fresh meat.

478
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,860
真厚道啊
Oh, nice guy.

479
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,440
你感觉到了吗
Did you feel that?

480
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,920
你听
Listen.

481
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,060
回卡车里去
Get in the truck!

482
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,780
动作快
Come on!

483
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,350
小狗
Hey, boy!

484
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,060
妈的
Damn it.

485
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,860
蠢货
Hey, stupid!

486
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,060
你不会想要他的
You don't want him.

487
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,930
他已经快被咬烂了
He's all chewed up already.

488
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,260
来吧  伙计  来吧
Come on, friend. Come on.

489
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,170
快张嘴来吃你的老朋友多克
Raise your chin for your ol' pal Doc.

490
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,890
撑住  摩菲  它们够不着你的
Hang in there, Murphy! They can't get you!

491
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,920
一千零五十八
One thousand fifty eight.

492
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,920
让它们走开
Get them off!

493
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,130
让它们走开
Get them off!

494
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,180
一千零五十九
One thousand fifty nine.

495
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:59,920
一千零六十  射得好  小哥
One thousand sixty! Nice shot, kid!

496
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:01,930
摩菲
Murphy!

497
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,000
罗伯塔
Hey, Roberta.

498
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,810
我没法把这个该死的油管弄下来
I can't get this damn hose off.

499
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,730
我们得快点撤
We got to get going.

500
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,760
快下去  快下去
Get off! Get off!

501
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,870
快下去
Get off!

502
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,830
那是摩菲吗
Is that Murphy?

503
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,150
很不幸  是他
Unfortunately, yes.

504
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,740
快从这里撤退  撤退  快走
Get out of here. Get out of here! Go!

505
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,420
快
Come on!

506
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,220
等一下  你准备做什么
Wait a minute. What are you gonna do?

507
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,860
我要救摩菲  快走  你快撤
I got to save Murphy. Come on. Get out of here.

508
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,030
滚开  特拉维斯
Get out of my way, Travis.

509
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,210
不要逼我杀你
I don't want to have to kill you.

510
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,260
这当然没问题
That's not gonna be a problem.

511
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,250
是时候回老家了  森夏恩
It's time to go home, Sunshine.

512
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,540
你忘了
You forget.

513
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,110
我早就习惯了
I'm used to it.

514
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:14,820
懦夫
Coward!

515
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,630
妈的
Shit!

516
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:45,970
不要
No!

517
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,410
不要
No!

518
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,810
不要
No!

519
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,710
放开它你这只死狗
Get off of him you bastard!

520
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:11,920
停下
Stop!

521
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,310
你不能杀了我这一年来
You're not gonna kill the only living thing

522
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,730
唯一见过的一个活物
I've seen in a year!

523
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:34,890
快下车
Got to get out of here.

524
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:35,870
不行  僵尸太多了  我不能下车
No! There's too many! I can't!

525
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,140
-快点  -你不懂
- Come on! - You don't understand!

526
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,070
我不下车  我不行
I can't. I can't.

527
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:38,810
不行
I can't.

528
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,990
你行的  没时间了
Yes! It is not the time!

529
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,780
不  不要  我不行
No! No! I can't!

530
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,680
这里要爆炸了
This is gonna explode!

531
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,260
你不明白  我不行
You don't understand! I can't!

532
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,230
电影里要来的轻松得多
This works easier in the movies.

533
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,800
一千零六十二
One thousand sixty two.

534
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,920
快走
Come on.

535
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,320
我还活着
I'm alive?

536
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,130
你  你竟然还活着  难以置信
You're... you're still alive. No way.

537
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,850
你还活着
You're still alive.

538
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,850
我还活着
I'm still alive.

539
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,360
吃我一木条  疯狗
Yeah! Yeah, take that Cujo!

540
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,060
我说到做到
That's what I'm talkin' about!

541
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,680
我们成功了小狗  我跟你  我们办到了
We did it, pup. Me and you, we did it.

542
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,650
我们还活着
We're alive.

543
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,700
我们还活着
We're alive.

544
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,450
只剩下你和我了  小狗  只有你和我
It's just you and me, pup. Just you and me.

545
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,520
好  我有汉堡排和牛肉三明治
Okay. I've got beef patty and sloppy joe.

546
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,810
我觉得你更喜欢牛肉
You look like a beef eater to me.

547
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,320
好  给你
Okay. Here we go.

548
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,610
这绝对是我最棒的首次约会之一
This is actually one of the best first dates I've ever had.

549
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,130
给  很好  看起来很好吃是吧
Here we go. Oh yeah, doesn't that look good?

550
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,750
慢点吃  伙计
Whoa. Slow down, dude.

551
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,680
我只有十年的储备食物
I only have ten year supply.

552
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,540
伙计
Dude?

553
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,040
这不算什么好名字  对吧
That's not a very good name, is it?

554
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,350
我们来起个更好  行吗  叫"花花公子"怎么样
Nah, we can do better than that, can't we? What about "the dude"?

555
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,160
我很喜欢那部电影
I really like that movie.

556
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,300
不要吗  我们可以想出更好的
No? Yeah, we can come up with something better than that.

557
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,190
好  乖孩子
Yes. Good boy.

558
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,470
那是什么
What is that?

559
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,040
看起来好像有人在玩火柴
Looks like somebody's been playing with matches.

560
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,670
那是哪  是炼油厂吗
What is that? Is that a refinery?

561
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,540
我们拿到汽油了吗
So did we get the gas?

562
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,980
太好了  刚才谁引起的爆炸
Great. Who screwed that up?

563
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:57,820
抱歉
Sorry.

564
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,090
你的朋友哪去了
So where's your friend?

565
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:06,720
他没能生还  而且他也不是我的朋友
He didn't make it. And he wasn't my friend.

566
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,860
喂

近一点
Closer?

582
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,670
抱歉中士  没有近一点的地方

583
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,540
我能跟你的上司说话吗

589
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:06,850
长官
Well, sir.

590
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,960

你最好快走  中士
You'd better get moving, Sergeant.

我以为再也见不到它了呢
Never thought I would see this thing again.

607
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,230
等等  那孩子来了
Wait! Here comes the kid!

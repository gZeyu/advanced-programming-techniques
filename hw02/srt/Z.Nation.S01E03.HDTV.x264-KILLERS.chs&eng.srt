《僵尸国度》前情提要
Previously on "Z Nation".

18
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,750
我就是不相信摩菲好吗
I just don't trust Murphy, okay?

19
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:03,910
那家伙肯定有古怪
There's something wrong with that dude.

20
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:04,640
万一这是真的呢
What if it's true?

21
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,970
万一摩菲真如他们所说的那样
What if Murphy's who they say he is

22
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,040
万一我们真有机会制造出疫苗呢
and there's a chance for a vaccine?

23
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,550
不可能的
It's not.

24
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,020
那是个谎话  而且这谎话会害死我们的
It's a lie, and it's gonna get us both killed.

25
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,670
那我也情愿因相信这个谎话而死
Well then I'd rather die believing in a lie

26
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,160
总好过没有信仰地苟且活着
than live believing in nothing.

27
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,470
为什么会有人把你关在笼子里不管你死活
Why would somebody lock you in a cage and leave you to die?

28
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,050
我用不着为自己辩白
I don't have to justify myself.

29
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:17,910
也许你需要
Maybe you do!

30
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:23,460
要是我告诉他们你是谁的话会怎么样
What happens when I tell them what you are?

31
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,810
懦夫
Coward!

所以...
So...

34
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,690
到底是什么风把你吹来费城了  宝贝
What brings you to Philly, baby?

35
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,430
想来做点小买卖而已
Looking to do a little bartering.

36
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,070
你的名字真叫"阳光"吗
Your name really Sunshine?

37
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,360
有关系吗
Does it mater?

38
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,920
我想没有
I guess not.

39
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,790
我已经很久
It has been a long time

40
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,560
没见过女人的胴体了
since I saw a woman's body.

41
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,650
至少是个鲜活的女人
At least a living woman.

42
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,800
你在颤抖
You're shaking.

43
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,220
没事的  宝贝  只不过有点冷
It's nothing, baby. Just the cold.

44
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,630
那看看我们能否帮你暖和起来
Well let's see if we can warm you up.

45
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,460
你是不是忘了该拿出点什么  亲爱的
Are you forgetting something, lover?

46
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,840
好的
Right.

47
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,630
这玩意我还能搞来更多呢
And there's plenty more where that came from.

48
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,300
我们开做吧
Let's do this.

49
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,370
臭婊子
Crazy bitch!

50
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,890
你想偷我东西是吧
You trying to rip me off?

51
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,200
让我来教育教育你
I'll teach you.

52
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,070
我好像告诉了你不准有暴力行为
Thought I told you no rough stuff?

53
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,760
那是你找错了人
You picked the wrong mark.

54
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,470
有些人就是不听话
Some people just don't listen.

55
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,860
快去搜他的外套
Go check his jacket.

56
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,150
看来有人可以去嗨趴体喽
Somebody likes to party.

57
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,160
给我
Give me that.

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,100
去查查看他有没有武器
Make sure he doesn't have any weapons.

59
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,970
你怎么搞的
And what happened to you?

60
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,510
你忘了我怎么教你的了吗
You forget everything I taught you?

61
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,340
我试着按你教我的来对付他
I tried to do it exactly like you showed me,

62
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,710
可是他太壮了
but he was too strong.

63
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,960
我下次会努力地  我保证
I'll do it better next time. I promise.

64
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,610
你不能畏首畏尾
You can't be afraid.

65
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,420
片刻的犹豫会让你死无葬身之地
Hesitation will get you killed.

66
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,140
你知道我爱你  阳光
You know I love you, Sunshine.

67
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,860
就像我爱我所有的孩子们一样
Like I love all my children.

68
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,380
把手给我
Give me your hand.

69
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,610
为何我们要走这条路  费城是个死城了
Why are we going this way? Philly's a dead zone.

70
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,480
但愿我们能在不过于深入城市的情况下
Hopefully we can scavenge something

71
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,380
找到点有用的东西
without going too deep into the city.

72
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,590
如果我们能找到好用的无线电
If we find a working radio,

73
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,810
我们就能试着去联系那个Z家伙
we can try to contact that Z guy again.

74
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,840
费城
Philadelphia.

75
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,370
充满手足之情的都市
Ah, the city of brotherly love.

76
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,200
那不会是我认为的那东西吧
Is that what I think it is?

77
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,010
不可能
No way.

78
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,160
{\an8}费城独立厅的大钟  1776年7月4日鸣钟宣布美国独立

79
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,160
那真的是独立钟吗
Is that really the Liberty Bell?

80
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,880
"在此宣告所有土地
"Proclaim liberty throughout all

81
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,270
以及所有的公民获得自由"
the land and unto all the inhabitants thereof."

82
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,720
是啊  是它
Yeah, that's it.

83
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,500
僵尸大灾变三年以来
Three years of zombie apocalypse,

84
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,860
你以为自己什么都见过了
you think you've seen everything.

85
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,110
当实事每况愈下时
Well when everything went bad,

86
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,750
可能有人还想拯救一些历史文物
they probably tried to save a little history.

87
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,000
话是没错  不过这些人应该知道
Yeah, well they should've known

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,280
乱世中  你能拯救的只有自己
the only thing you can save is yourself.

89
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,540
我们走吧
Let's go!

90
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,890
等等
Hang on.

91
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,260
如果这辆车还有汽油  果然有
If this thing still has fuel, and it does...

92
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,390
如果我们开始这样做
If we get this thing started,

93
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,760
他们就不必毫无保护地坐在露天车后斗了
they won't have to ride out in the open like that.

94
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,490
我完全赞成
Well I'm all for that.

95
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,900
我去拿跨接电缆
I'll grab the jumper cable.

96
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,480
上帝保佑全人类
God bless the human race.

97
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,640
百分之九十九都阵亡了
99% of them dead.

98
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,880
但还有一个拿着喷雾罐的混蛋活着
But there's still one jackass alive with a spray can.

99
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,640
一千零七十五
One thousand seventy-five.

100
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,990
好了  发动试试
Okay, give it a shot.

101
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,130
没问题  我们走吧  摩菲
All right, that's it. Let's go, Murphy.

102
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,410
你进去跟我和沃伦一起坐
You get in here with Warren and me.

103
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,990
其他人  坐进我们捡来的那辆车
Everybody else, follow in the pickup.

104
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,070
跟紧了
Stay close.

105
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,450
你不必把僵尸赶尽杀绝  留几个活口
You know you could try to miss some of them instead.

106
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,090
为什么  杀一个少一个
Why? One less zombie to kill.

107
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,000
给那个叫两千的神经病小伙留几个
Leave some for Psycho-Boy Two Thousand.

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,850
-人家叫一万  -一万
- Ten Thousand. - Ten Thousand.

109
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,780
一万吗
Ten Thousand?

110
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,400
看来现在的年轻人还有点追求  不错
It's good to know kids today still have some goals.

111
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,170
我们不是真的要一路护送那个叫摩菲的人
We're not really going all the way to California

112
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,550
去加利福尼亚吧
with this Murphy guy, are we?

113
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,800
我们计划这样去做
That's the plan.

114
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,060
这太疯狂了
That's crazy.

115
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,270
他到底有什么与众不同的地方
What's so special about him anyway?

116
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,380
他的血液
His blood.

117
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,390
你悠着点  你就剩那么点水了
Hey, take it easy there. That's the last of your water.

118
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,790
其实  那是她的水
Actually it's the last of her water.

119
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,870
我的水在这里
Mine's right here.

120
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,120
给我
Give me that.

121
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,270
虽然我们要把你活着送到加利福尼亚去
Just because we got to get you to California alive

122
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,000
但我在路上依然可以揍你
doesn't mean I can't kick your ass between here and there.

123
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,030
当心
Look out!

124
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,870
上帝啊
God!

125
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,350
太爽了  我愿意花钱再看一遍
Yeah! I'd pay money to see that again.

126
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,220
车的轴承坏了
The axel's broke.

127
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,970
好了  大家都上那辆车
All right, everybody get into that truck.

128
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,560
我们走  摩菲  走吧
Let's go, Murphy. Come on.

129
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,610
下车  我来开
Get out. I'm driving.

130
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:49,490
北极光
美国国安局作战指挥中心

131
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,490
看上去还不错吧  小狗
Lookin' good, eh pup?

132
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,220
两块二十盎司的T骨牛扒  陈年佳肴
Two twenty ounce T-bone steaks aged to perfection.

133
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,490
你说什么
What's that?

134
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,300
你那块要三成熟吗
You like yours rare?

135
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,450
我也是哦  咱俩在这点上达成一致了
Well me too. We've got that in common.

136
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,540
存放这些牛排的地方还有很多存货
Oh and there's plenty more where this came from.

137
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,160
确切的说  还有半吨
Half a ton to be exact.

138
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,860
不只是T骨牛扒哦
And that's just the T-bones.

139
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,230
我们还有纽约牛排  牛腰肉
We got New York strips, sirloins,

140
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,630
甚至还有菲列牛排
and even some filet mignon.

141
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,270
这些牛排和即食餐是供给
Between that and MREs to feed

142
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,930
一个军队半年的口粮
a division for six months

143
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,740
我敢说  只有咱俩在僵尸大灾变时期
I'd say you and I are gonna be the only two getting fat

144
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,900
长胖了
for the apocalypse.

145
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,290
上菜了
Here you go.

146
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,160
请慢慢享用这块牛排
Enjoy that beef.

147
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,690
多少人会为了这样的牛排不惜大肆杀戮
There are people out there that'd kill for that steak.

148
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,100
外面可是弱肉强食[狗咬狗]的世界哦
It's a dog eat dog world out there, man.

149
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,580
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

150
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,660
用词不当  应该是人肉尸食的世界
Wrong word choice. It's more of a zombie eat man world.

151
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,330
在一起享用我们的劳动成果之前
As we share in the fruit of our labor,

152
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,090
有一点我们必须牢记在心
let it remind us now more than ever,

153
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,850
我们要互相依靠
that we need each other.

154
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,990
我们需要家庭
We need family.

155
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,470
虽然我带领大家挺过了黑色夏季
As I led us through Black Summer,

156
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,650
但大家都曾动摇过
you all had doubts.

157
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,840
连我也动摇过
Even I did.

158
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,430
但我们作为一家人团结在一起
But we pulled together as a family

159
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,050
艰苦奋斗生存下去
and did what we had to do.

160
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,760
千百万人像野兽那样饿死在街头
Millions died starving in the streets like animals.

161
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,440
但我们挺住了  我们作为一个大家庭挺住了
But we survived. We survived as a family.

162
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,710
我们美丽的母亲为我们指明了道路
Our beautiful mother showed us the way.

163
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,690
教会了我们如何成为一家人
Taught us what it meant to be a family.

164
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,680
但我心中还是有缺憾
But there is a hole in my heart.

165
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,750
我们这个家庭还有缺憾
A hole in this family.

166
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,820
我们的"阳光"不见了
Our Sunshine is missing.

167
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,550
只要她不在我们中间  这个家就不完整
And until she returns to us our family's not complete.

168
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,540
这个保卫大家的集体就有了缺口
The circle that keeps us safe is broken.

169
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,430
阿门
Amen.

170
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,560
阿门
Amen.

171
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,120
太好了
Excellent.

172
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,130
你可以多吃一份  干得漂亮
Get yourself an extra serving. You did good.

173
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,390
各位  好消息来了
Good news, everyone.

174
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,950
阳光已经找到了  我们的集体不再有缺憾
Sunshine has been found. The circle will not be broken.

175
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,300
好好享受吧  这是最后的干粮了
Enjoy. That's the last of the food.

176
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,890
我的天  饿得我肚子里大肠吃小肠
God, I'm so hungry my big guts are eating my little guts.

177
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,120
你吃不下了吗
You gonna eat all of that?

178
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,680
自私的小混蛋
Selfish little bastard.

179
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,140
我们必须分头寻找食物和水
We need to split up and look for food and water.

180
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,870
对了  如果能找到双向无线电
Oh, if we can find a two way radio or

181
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,610
哪怕是卫星天线盘都行
even like a satellite dish,

182
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,970
我就能试着联系那个市民Z
I can try and contact that Citizen Z guy.

183
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,880
非常好  你和麦克去找这个
That's good. Okay, you and Mack do that.

184
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,480
剩下的人去找补给
And the rest of us will look for food.

185
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,220
多克  你  卡桑德拉还有一万是一队
Doc, you take Cassandra and 10K.

186
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,310
沃伦  我和摩菲是一队  大家别走散了
Warren and I will take Murphy. Stay close.

187
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,930
一小时后在这会合
Meet back here in an hour.

188
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,220
好  出发
All right, let's go.

189
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,740
{\an8}宾夕法尼亚州  费城

190
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,130
那里的无线电能用
I want that radio.

191
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,850
行  僵尸警长怎么办
Yeah, what about Officer Zombie?

192
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,170
你还记得皮克斯基尔那次吗
Do you remember that time in Peekskill?

193
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,860
那招挺好  你在上还是我在上
Yeah, that's perfect. Top or bottom?

194
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,820
我吧
Top.

195
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,050
你  就是你
Hey, you. Yeah.

196
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,840
漂亮
Oh, baby.

197
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,840
我要是哪天需要人"施以仁慈"
You know if I ever need mercy,

198
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,900
我真心希望你来动手
I really hope it's you.

199
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,010
来  我要看看这无线电还能不能用
Come on. I want to see if that radio works.

200
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,630
好  快点  我去捅几个当地市民去
All right, hurry up. I'll pike some locals.

201
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,300
我勒个去
Jesus Christ.

202
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,080
好吧
Okay.

203
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:28,930
小子
Hey, kid.

204
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,020
能不能上来帮个忙
Give me a hand with this, will ya?

205
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,950
我不明白为什么非要在费城停留
I don't know why we stopped here in Philly.

206
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,540
我们应该继续往前走
We should've kept going.

207
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,630
走哪去
Going where?

208
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,640
我们需要跟那个市民哥们联系上
We need to find a way to communicate with that Citizen dude.

209
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,000
我觉得这个天线盘艾迪用得上
And I think Addy can do something with this dish.

210
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,420
谁知道 没准运气好还能收着毛片频道呢
Who knows, maybe we'll get lucky and pick up porn.

211
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,170
从没看过毛片
Never seen porn.

212
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,720
你从没看过毛片吗
You never seen porn?

213
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,110
不会吧  从来没看过吗
Really? Never?

214
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,830
我还没到年龄嘛
Before my time.

215
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,640
好看吗
Is it good?

216
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,230
-当然好看  -还行吧
- Yeah. - Meh.

217
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,160
阳光
Sunshine!

218
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,910
我居然被自己恶心到了
That even disgusted me.

219
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,290
因为只有我自己在这里恶心
'Course I'm the only one here to disgust.

220
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,050
除了你
Except for you.

221
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,610
可是你只是条狗  你才不在乎
But you're a dog. What do you care?

222
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,390
对不起
Sorry.

223
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,180
我的阳光去哪里了
Where's my Sunshine?

224
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,730
那婊子居然从我手中溜走了
Bitch gave me the slip.

225
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,970
你在说的是你妹妹
That's your sister you're talking about.

226
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,400
我们很快就会找到她
We'll find her soon enough.

227
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,680
同时  有块肥肉送上门来了
Meanwhile, another opportunity has presented itself.

228
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,110
求救  求救
Mayday. Mayday.

229
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,020
呼叫任何能接收此频率的人
Calling anybody on this frequency.

230
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,680
{\an8}信号输入

231
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,880
接收到一个发自费城的射频信号
Picking up some kind of RF signal out of Philadelphia.

232
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,760
好像是警察用的信号
Looks like something on the police band.

233
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,610
求救  求救  我是三角洲X光小队的
Mayday. Mayday. This is Addison Carver

234
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,270
艾迪生·卡弗

听到吗  完毕
Do you copy? Over.

239
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,570
我听得非常清楚  听到我说话吗
I'm picking you up loud and clear. Do you copy me?

240
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,470
听得非常清楚  市民Z
Copy you loud and clear Citizen Z.

241

三角洲X光小队  请回复

00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,820
有人吗  你没事吧
Anybody. Are you all right?

247
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,840
请汇报情况  三角洲X光小队
What is your status, Delta-Xray?

248
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,630
三角洲X光小队  请回复
Delta-Xray, please respond.

249
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,690
三角洲X光小队  听到吗
Delta-Xray, do you copy.

250
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,730
那里发生什么事了
Hey, what's going on down there?

251
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,850
包裹还安全吗
Is the package safe?

252
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,110
重复  包裹还安全吗  听到吗
Repeat, is the package safe? Do you copy?

253
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,090

Addy? Addy Carver, do you copy?

256
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,600
好吧
All right.

257
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,650
那就试着用老方法
Let's go old school here

258
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,070
看看能否用三角定位出信号来源
and see if we can triangulate where that signal came from.

259
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,530
哪些小伙伴们还在费城活跃呢
What assets are hot in Philadelphia?

260
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,730
信号频率好像是...警察用的
Signal frequency looks like... the police band.

261
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,510
费城不可能还会有警察活着的
There can't be any cops left in Philly.

262
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,960
那里在两年前就已经是死城了
It's been a dead zone for like two years.

263
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,280
也许他们开启了警察的对讲机
Maybe they hot-wired a cop's walkie.

264
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,970
我想念爱德华·斯诺登和僵尸出现前的日子了
I miss the ol' days before Edward Snowden... and zombies.

265
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,160
那时我们多了不起
We were such badasses.

266
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,220
艾迪  好使吗  艾迪  艾迪
Addy, did it work? Addy? Addy!

艾迪
Addy.

272
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,510
你不是艾迪
You're not Addy.

273
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,070
她在哪里
Where is she?

274
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,530
艾迪
Addy!

275
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,330
三角洲X光小队

我们在这  我们在这
We're here. We're here.

279
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,290
三角洲X什么的  我们听到
Delta-X whatever, we copy.

280
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,630
明白  三角洲X光小队
Gotcha, Delta-Xray.

281
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,900
请问说话的是谁

282
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,180
马克·汤姆森  但这不是重点
Mack Thompson, but that doesn't matter right now.

283
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,830

288
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,700
她有没有  有没有告诉你她要去哪
Did she... did she tell you where she was going?

289
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,070
不清楚她的位置
Negative on her location.

290
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,410
我们只说了几句话
We only talked for like a second.

291
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,250
好像发生了什么事
Something happened.

292
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,350
该死的僵尸们
Goddamn Zs.

293
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,090
也许不是僵尸
Maybe not.

294
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
我听到了声音  人类的声音
I heard voices. Human voices.

295
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,410
还有挣扎的声音
And then some sort of struggle.

296
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,000
人类吗
Humans?

297
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,090
是这样的
Roger that.

298
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,210
该死的人类吗
Goddamn humans?

299
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,820
包裹怎么样了
What about the package?

300
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,680
什么包裹
What package?

301
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,920
莫菲  零号病患
Murphy. Patient Zero.

302
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,170
咬痕研究所  他还活着吗
Operation Bite Mark. Is he still alive?

303
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,840
是的  臭得要命  活得挺好

304
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,480
至少  一小时之前他还活着

305
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,540
好的  听着

306
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,550
-我需要你  -我该走了
- I need you... - Got to run.

307
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,630
等一下
Wait!

308
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:51,360
X光小队  X光小队
Delta-Xray... Delta-Xray.

309
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,310
X光小队
Delta-Xray.

310
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,290
该死
Damn it.

311
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,880
我真受够这样了
I can't take much more of this.

312
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,430
没关系  你现在安全了
It's okay. You're safe now.

313
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,600
你现在很安全  没人会伤害你
You're safe. No one's going to harm you.

314
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,570
再碰我一下我就杀了你
Touch me and I'll kill you.

315
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,680
甜心小宝贝  不要这样
Sweet child. That won't be necessary.

316
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,230
拜托  我们不会伤害你的
Please, the last thing we want is to harm you.

317
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,950
我的朋友们会来找我的
My friends are looking for me,

318
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,350
当他们找到我的时候就会杀了你
and when they find me they will kill you.

319
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,820
他们会把你们都杀了
They will kill all of you!

320
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:40,920
我知道了
I get it.

321
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,290
你不相信我
You don't trust me.

322
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:42,810
你怎么可能相信我
Why should you?

323
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,770
我知道你不会接受 但是我还是要说
I know you're not ready to hear this, but I'm going to say it anyway.

324
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,150
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

325
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,620
你是谁  你想要我做什么
Who are you? What do you want with me?

326
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,090
问得好
Fair questions.

327
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,830
如果我被强行绑过来我也会生气
I'd be angry too if I were brought here against my will.

328
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,720
对不起  我不想让你感到害怕
Please, I don't want you to be afraid.

329
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,460
我必须为过分热情的伙伴们的所作所为道歉
I... I must apologize about my overzealous companions.

330
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,440
他们都是好人
They're good men,

331
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,680
但是有时候我们不得不采取暴力手段
but sometimes we have to resort to less than civilized means.

332
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,470
我们生活在一个文明已经不复存在了的世界
We live in a less than civilized world.

333
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,770
这点你我都知晓
You know it. I know it.

334
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,730
所以  当我们遇到陌生人的时候
So... when we encounter strangers

335
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,410
整个家庭都要采取  必要的防范措施
the family needs to take... necessary precautions.

336
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,980
什么家庭
What family?

337
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,000
我们的家庭
Ours.

338
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,890
这里是我们的家
This is our home.

339
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,620
我有责任维持他们的幸福生活
And I am responsible for their well-being.

340
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,260
我是托拜亚斯?坎贝尔
I'm Tobias Campbell.

341
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,820
我猜你会觉得
I guess you can say

342
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,410
我在我们这个小家庭里扮演父亲的角色
I'm like a father to our little family.

343
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,590
但是在一个家庭里  我们互相照顾对方
But like a family, we take care of one another.

344
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,700
人人为我  我为人人
Everyone contributes. Everyone benefits.

345
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,900
这就是我们这三年来的生活写照
It's how we've survived the last three years.

346
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,380
这也是我们能继续生存下去的唯一方法
It's the only way we'll survive in the future.

347
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,330
你赞成吗
Don't you agree?

348
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,380
你一定饿了  请用吧
You must be hungry. Please eat.

349
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,860
我们还有很多可以分享
We have plenty to share.

350
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,750
我不饿
I'm not hungry.

351
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,600
你会饿的
You will be.

352
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,080
在那之前  你不如跟着月影和暴风
Until then, why don't you go with Moonshade and Stormy.

353
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:04,880
女士们
Ladies,

354
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,610
麻烦费心给我们的新成员找些新衣服
be so kind as to find some fresh clothes for our newest member.

355
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,000
我可没说要加入你的...  家庭
I didn't say anything about joining your... family.

356
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,030
对不起
Oh, I'm sorry.

357
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,880
不是我狂妄
I don't mean to be presumptuous.

358
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,990
只不过大家一看到
It's just that once people see

359
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,150
我们分享的友爱和慷慨
the love and bounty that we share

360
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,840
他们就不想离开了
they never want to leave us.

361
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,030
女士们
Ladies?

362
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,860
等等  所以这个叫洛基的家伙决斗输了吗
Wait, so this Rocky dude loses the fight?

363
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,350
是的  虽然看起来输了  实则是他赢了
Yeah. Yeah, but see in losing, he wins.

364
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,950
很有禅意
It's very zen.

365
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,190
我想看洛基跟僵尸决斗
I'd like to see Rocky fight a Z.

366
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,630
他输了就会被吃掉
If he loses, he gets eaten.

367
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,750
没事吧
Hey, is everything okay?

368
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:52,320
没事
Fine.

369
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,410
时间差不多了
It's about time.

370
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,160
怎么了  艾迪呢
What's wrong? Where's Addy?

371
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,090
失踪了
Missing.

372
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,820
她是被...
Is she...?

373
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,460
不是
No.

374
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,080
被活捉了
Taken alive.

375
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,160
什么
What?

376
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,550
被人抓走了
By humans.

377
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,280
谁
Who?

378
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,450
我们觉得你可能会知道
We thought you might know.

379
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,580
我  为什么我知道
Me? Why would I know?

380
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,650
你认识这些人吗
You recognize these guys?

381
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,000
不认识  为什么我会认识
No. Why would I?

382
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,930
左边这家伙是在泽西的两个车手之一
Creep on the left was one of those two bikers back in Jersey.

383
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,320
跟你朋友特拉维斯一起的
With your friend Travis.

384
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,860
我跟你说过  我不认识那家伙
I told you, I didn't know that guy.

385
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,180
我也不认识他们
And I don't know them either.

386
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,250
你现在就跟我说实话
You are gonna start telling me the truth right now

387
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,730
-不然我就在你身上打洞  -麦克
- or I am going to start blowing holes  - Mack.

388
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,830
-打到你说为止  -麦克
- in you until you do. - Mack.

389
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,960
听懂了没有
Do you understand me?

390
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,750
麦克  把枪拿开  把枪拿开
Mack. Put the gun away. Put the gun away.

391
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,570
你现在就把你知道的所有情况都告诉我们
You're gonna tell us everything you know about these guys right now.

392
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,110
不然我就毙了你
Or I'll shoot you.

393
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,050
我不能回去
I can't go back!

394
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,010
回哪里
Back where?

395
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,300
哪里  哪里  她在哪里  她在哪里
Where? Where? Where is she?! Where is she?!

396
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,150
该死
Shoot.

397
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,540
你看上去真漂亮
You look beautiful.

398
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,260
我就像一个末日的脱衣舞女  活见鬼
I look like a post-apocalyptic stripper. Jesus.

399
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,600
不如说是诱饵
More like bait.

400
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,510
快看看呐
Look at you.

401
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,670
妈妈会很高兴的
Mother will be so pleased.

402
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,060
晚饭很快就会好了
Supper will be ready soon.

403
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,710
摆好桌子
Set the table.

404
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:25,400
在妈妈旁边给我们的客人设个上座
And set a place of honor for our guest next to Mother.

405
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,560
麦克你在哪
Where are you Mack?

406
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,730
够了
Enough!

407
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,790
好了  卡桑德拉  别再废话
All right, Cassandra! No more bullshit.

408
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,350
赶紧告诉我们你知道的事
Tell us what you know. Now!

409
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,950
好吧  我认识他们
All right. I know them.

410
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,930
他们来自一群幸存者  叫大家庭什么的
They're part of a group of survivors. A family of sorts.

411
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,510
但其实更像是一群信徒
But more like a cult actually.

412
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,690
头领是一个叫托拜亚斯·坎贝尔的男人
Led by a man named Tobias Campbell.

413
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,150
我不能回去  我不会回去的
I can't go back there. I won't go back.

414
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,560
我们让你做什么你就做什么
You'll do whatever the hell we need you to do

415
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,810
把艾迪找回来
to get Addy back!

416
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,930
你们不知道  他们是危险人物
You don't know these people. They're dangerous.

417
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:02,990
我们也是
So are we.

418
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,000
那不一样
Not like they are.

419
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,530
托拜亚斯那群人比僵尸还可怕
Tobias and the others are worse than Zs.

420
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,630
我以为我逃离他们的魔掌了
I thought I'd gotten away from them,

421
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,980
但之后特拉维斯发现我和你们在一起
but then Travis spotted me with you.

422
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,390
你为什么要怕他们
Why are you so afraid of them?

423
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,860
你不懂
You don't get it.

424
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,360
你不能选择和谁一起生存
You don't pick who you survive with.

425
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,940
一开始我以为自己很幸运
At first I thought I was lucky.

426
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,290
他们起初和常人一样
They started out like everybody else.

427
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:28,390
托拜亚斯既聪明又强壮  他救了我们
Tobias was smart. He was strong. He saved us.

428
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:31,180
但黑色夏季来后  一切都变得如地狱般
But then Black Summer came, and everything went to hell.

429
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,590
有天在路上他就失去了理智
Somewhere along the way he lost his mind,

430
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,970
之后我们失去了灵魂  我不会回去
and... and we lost our souls. And I am not going back there!

431
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,660
他们会对艾迪怎样
What are they gonna do to Addy?

432
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,440
托拜亚斯会用奇怪的方式控制着家庭成员
Tobias has this weird control over people.

433
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,070
他会强迫你做些丧心病狂的事
He can make you do terrible things.

434
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,430
你的意思是  强奸她吗
What do you mean? Rape?

435
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,380
不  他会利用她做诱饵
No, he'll use her as bait.

436
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,750
诱饵吗  他们去抢劫吗
Bait? What, do they rob people?

437
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,700
不只是抢劫
Not just rob.

438
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,470
还杀人吗
Murder them?!

439
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,930
不  不是强奸或杀人
No! Not rape. Not murder.

440
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,300
他们不仅杀人  比这还要可怕
They don't just kill their victims. It's worse.

441
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,940
希望我们吃的不是狗肉
Well hope we are not eating dog.

442
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:40,540
天呐  不会吧
Oh God! Oh no! Oh God! Oh no! No!

443
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,990
晚饭好了
Supper's ready!

444
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,950
从前有一个农夫
There was this farmer.

445
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,500
他有只世上最聪明的猪  名叫阿诺德
Had the smartest pig in the world, Arnold.

446
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,450
这只猪能阅读会算数
This pig could read and do math.

447
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,550
阿诺德很有名
Arnold was famous.

448
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,050
有一天  农夫的朋友来访
And then one day, the farmer's friend, he comes over

449
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,900
他看到阿诺德用三只腿走动
and he sees Arnold tripping around on three legs.

450
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,850
他对农夫说  "可怜的阿诺德怎么了"
And he says to the farmer, "hey, what happened to poor Arnold?"

451
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,900
农夫说
And the farmer says

452
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,170
"像它这么聪明的猪  可不能一次就把它吃完"
"Smart pig like that, you don't eat him all at once."

453
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,750
怎么了啊  嫌故事太短吗
Oh, what? Too soon?

454
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,970
我们开始并不吃人
We didn't start out as cannibals.

455
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,450
吃人肉吗  这怎么可能
Cannibals? How is that even possible?

456
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,440
所有东西都染上了僵尸病毒
Everything's infected with the zombie virus.

457
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,220
如果你杀了吃了他们  你们也会感染 
If you kill it and eat it, you get the live virus.

458
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,530
但是吃活肉的话...
But if you eat it alive...

459
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,700
我们只是一群想要求生的人
We were people just trying to survive.

460
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,800
托拜亚斯先从僵尸中救了我
Tobias saved me. First from the Zs.

461
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,560
救我与水深火热之中
Then from the worst of humanity.

462
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,860
他是个好人  之后他妻子病了
He was a good man. Then his wife got sick.

463
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,340
她没挺过去
She just couldn't take it anymore.

464
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,840
之后他就变成了另一个人
And he was never the same after that.

465
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,260
当黑色夏季来临
When Black Summer came

466
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,430
世界上所有人都在挨饿时
and everyone else in the world was starving,

467
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,360
他发誓会尽其所能保全大家
he swore he would do whatever it took to keep us alive.

468
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,340
他做到了
And he did.

469
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,200
我要回去找艾迪
I'm going back for Addy.

470
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,760
等等  麦克
Hang on, Mack.

471
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,470
加内特  别想拦住我
Garnett, do not try to stop me.

472
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,930
没人会拦你  我们都回去
Nobody's gonna try to stop you. We're all going back.

473
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,090
只是我们需要个计划
We just need a plan.

474
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,990
你们不懂  他们比僵尸还丧心病狂
You don't understand! These people are worse than Zs!

475
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,270
他们会把你们全杀了
They'll kill all of you!

476
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,610
她说得对  我们要为大局着想
Yeah, she's right. We need to look at the big picture.

477
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,670
闭嘴
Shut up!

478
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,260
你知道他们的据点吗
Do you know where they've taken her?

479
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,360
你可能觉得我们是禽兽  惨无人道
I know you think we're monsters. Inhuman.

480
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,580
我们一开始也这么想
We all did too at first.

481
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:41,430
但是饥饿最后总能改变一个人的想法
But hunger has a way of changing one's mind.

482
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,630
道德感会消失殆尽
Morality is stripped away.

483
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,170
只剩下想要生存下去的念头
And all that remains is survival.

484
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,760
我知道  你还需要适应一下
I know, this takes some getting used to.

485
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,840
也许这样会更合你的口味
Perhaps this will make it more palatable.

486
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,600
别这样  小花
Please, Little Flower.

487
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,330
你肯定饿坏了
You must be starving.

488
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,160
就吃一口补充点体力吧
Just a bite to keep your strength.

489
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,720
这可是我为你精心特制的
I made it special for you.

490
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,500
你这样惹得妈妈不高兴了
Now you've upset Mama.

491
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,820
我明白你一时还难以接受
I know this is a big adjustment.

492
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,540
但是身处乱世  不是吃人就是被吃
But in times like these, it's eat or be eaten.

493
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,370
请快快享用吧  妈妈爱你
So please. Mama likes you.

494
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,830
让她高兴点
Make her happy.

495
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,900
有鲜肉上门
Fresh meat.

496
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,850
你们俩把这块肉端回厨房
You two, get this meat back in the kitchen.

497
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,460
然后准备就位
Then get in position.

498
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,340
午安  朋友
Afternoon, friend.

499
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,590
如果你是来找女性伴游
If it's female companionship you're looking for,

500
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,460
那你就来对地方了
you've come to the right place.

501
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,450
事实上我是来找我朋友的
Actually I'm looking for my friend.

502
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,790
红发
Red head.

503
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,740
叫做艾迪
Goes by the name of Addy.

504
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,290
艾迪  艾迪  我不认识什么叫艾迪的人
Addy? Addy? Don't know anybody named Addy.

505
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,100
要是有我一定会记得
Sure would remember if we had one.

506
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,900
我们迷人的月影和暴风合你口味吗
Oh hey, how about the lovely Moonshade or Stormy?

507
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,450
今日特惠买一送一
We got a two for one special today.

508
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,050
听着  小混混
Listen, scumbag.

509
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,000
我知道她在你们手上
I know you got her.

510
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,490
十秒之后你把她送出来
You send her out here in the next ten seconds

511
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,800
否则小心你们这里遭殃
or a lot of bad shit is gonna start happening.

512
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:47,840
矮油  还挺难搞的嘛
Oooh, tough guy.

513
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,390
这只是脑袋一枪
That was a head shot.

514
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,670
我们对你朋友还算是客气的
We showed your friend some mercy.

515
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,800
对你就不一样了
I'm not gonna do the same for you.

516
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,210
下一枪会贯穿你的心脏
Next shot is going through your heart.

517
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,680
除非你想早早变成僵尸
So unless you want to be prematurely zombified,

518
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,410
否则还是把我朋友交出来
you get my friend out here.

519
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,010
赶紧的
Now.

520
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,640
你就不怕我先毙了你
Not if I blow you away first.

521
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,660
你不会这么做的  你会把艾迪还给我
You're not gonna do that. You're gonna get me Addy.

522
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,020
要是你动作够快  你还可以趁热吃了你朋友
And if you're quick about it, you can still eat your friend.

523
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,780
不必了
That won't be necessary.

524
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,440
加内特
Garnett!

525
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,960
还不到时候  还不到时候  别急
Not yet. Not yet. Come on.

526
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,940
显然你已经和我的阳光谈过了
Apparently you've been talking to my little Sunshine.

527
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,360
加内特  把我弄出来  这伙人疯了
Garnett, get me out of here. These people are insane.

528
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,710
再敢说一句我就吃了你的心脏
Say that again and I will eat your heart.

529
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,780
显然我们手里各有对方想要的人
Apparently we both have something the other wants.

530
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,310
不如我们做个交易
Perhaps we can make a deal.

531
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,880
把阳光还给我  你就能换回你的宝贝艾迪
Give me back my Sunshine, and you can have your precious Addy.

532
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,190
想得美  我不会和食人族谈判的
Nah, I'm not gonna negotiate with a cannibal.

533
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,750
你把艾迪交给我  我们就走
You're gonna give me Addy. We're gonna walk away.

534
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,720
你爱吃谁吃谁
And you can eat anybody you want.

535
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,000
你要知道谈判首要规则就是
You know the first rule of negotiation is

536
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,920
手握筹码最多的人赢
the person who wants it least wins.

537
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,750
要是你伤害她  我们就把你们一个个都干掉
If you harm her, we'll kill every one of you.

538
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,920
放马来
Kill away.

539
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,570
老实说几乎所有僵尸灾变的风浪我都挺过来了
Frankly I've had about all the zombie apocalypse I can take.

540
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:04,540
不过当然了  你和这姑娘会是第一个死的
But of course, you and the girl will be the first to die.

541
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,170
这样才对嘛
That's what I thought.

542
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,080
你知道谈判第二规则是什么吗
Do you know the second rule of negotiation?

543
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,330
什么
What?

544
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,440
手上有五十口径自动步枪的人赢
The guy with the 50 caliber machine gun wins.

545
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,470
听起来不怎么妙啊
That didn't sound good.

546
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,170
你究竟是想把我的阳光还给我
You gonna give me back my Sunshine?

547
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:39,090
还是想在这儿继续废话
Or do we continue this conversation in hell?

548
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,080
-别去  麦克  -不行  要死的话
- No, Mack. - No, no, if we're going to hell,

549
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,060
我也要带上这个王八蛋一起死
I'm going all the way and I'm taking this bastard with me.

550
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,380
-等一下  -你想干嘛
- Wait! - What do you want?!

551
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,240
我去
I'll go.

552
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,190
住手
Stop!

553
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,050
放了她  托拜亚斯
Let her go, Tobias.

554
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,500
你这是做什么
What are you doing?

555
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,680
做我一开始就该做的事
What I should have done in the first place.

556

We're not... we're not leaving her there, are we?

Addy. She lied to us. It almost got you killed.

我们不能这么做
We can't do that.

572

我们不能就这么扔下她

Yeah, she's a freakin' cannibal, and she got what she deserved.

579
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,430
她为了活命才迫不得已做那些事
She did what she had to do to survive.

580
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,270
所有人都会那么做
And you of all people would have done the same.

581
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,940
好了  艾迪说的没错
Come on, Addy is right!

582
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,310
我们不能把她扔在那里
We cannot leave her back there!

But we're not gonna beat a 50 caliber machine gun.

588

It's gonna tear us to pieces before we get to the fence.

{\an8}{\pos(228.267,57.0297)}.

{\an8}{\pos(150.4,193.188)}.

17
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,590
Previously on "Z Nation".

18
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,750
I just don't trust Murphy, okay?

19
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:03,910
There's something wrong with that dude.

20
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:04,640
What if it's true?

21
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,970
What if Murphy's who they say he is

22
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,040
and there's a chance for a vaccine?

23
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,550
It's not.

24
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,020
It's a lie, and it's gonna get us both killed.

25
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,670
Well then I'd rather die believing in a lie

26
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,160
than live believing in nothing.

27
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,470
Why would somebody lock you in a cage and leave you to die?

28
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,050
I don't have to justify myself.

29
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:17,910
Maybe you do!

30
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:23,460
What happens when I tell them what you are?

31
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,810
Coward!

33
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,180
So...

34
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,690
What brings you to Philly, baby?

35
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,430
Looking to do a little bartering.

36
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,070
Your name really Sunshine?

37
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,360
Does it mater?

38
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,920
I guess not.

39
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,790
It has been a long time

40
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,560
since I saw a woman's body.

41
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,650
At least a living woman.

42
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,800
You're shaking.

43
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,220
It's nothing, baby. Just the cold.

44
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,630
Well let's see if we can warm you up.

45
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,460
Are you forgetting something, lover?

46
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,840
Right.

47
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,630
And there's plenty more where that came from.

48
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,300
Let's do this.

49
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,370
Crazy bitch!

50
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,890
You trying to rip me off?

51
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,200
I'll teach you.

52
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,070
Thought I told you no rough stuff?

53
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,760
You picked the wrong mark.

54
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,470
Some people just don't listen.

55
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,860
Go check his jacket.

56
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,150
Somebody likes to party.

57
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,160
Give me that.

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,100
Make sure he doesn't have any weapons.

59
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,970
And what happened to you?

60
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,510
You forget everything I taught you?

61
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,340
I tried to do it exactly like you showed me,

62
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,710
but he was too strong.

63
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,960
I'll do it better next time. I promise.

64
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,610
You can't be afraid.

65
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,420
Hesitation will get you killed.

66
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,140
You know I love you, Sunshine.

67
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,860
Like I love all my children.

68
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,380
Give me your hand.

69
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,610
Why are we going this way? Philly's a dead zone.

70
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,480
Hopefully we can scavenge something

71
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,380
without going too deep into the city.

72
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,590
If we find a working radio,

73
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,810
we can try to contact that Z guy again.

74
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,840
Philadelphia.

75
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,370
Ah, the city of brotherly love.

76
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,200
Is that what I think it is?

77
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,010
No way.

79
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,160
Is that really the Liberty Bell?

80
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,880
"Proclaim liberty throughout all

81
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,270
the land and unto all the inhabitants thereof."

82
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,720
Yeah, that's it.

83
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,500
Three years of zombie apocalypse,

84
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,860
you think you've seen everything.

85
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,110
Well when everything went bad,

86
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,750
they probably tried to save a little history.

87
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah, well they should've known

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,280
the only thing you can save is yourself.

89
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,540
Let's go!

90
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,890
Hang on.

91
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,260
If this thing still has fuel, and it does...

92
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,390
If we get this thing started,

93
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,760
they won't have to ride out in the open like that.

94
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,490
Well I'm all for that.

95
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,900
I'll grab the jumper cable.

96
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,480
God bless the human race.

97
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,640
99% of them dead.

98
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,880
But there's still one jackass alive with a spray can.

99
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,640
One thousand seventy-five.

100
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,990
Okay, give it a shot.

101
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,130
All right, that's it. Let's go, Murphy.

102
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,410
You get in here with Warren and me.

103
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,990
Everybody else, follow in the pickup.

104
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,070
Stay close.

105
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,450
You know you could try to miss some of them instead.

106
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,090
Why? One less zombie to kill.

107
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,000
Leave some for Psycho-Boy Two Thousand.

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,850
- Ten Thousand. - Ten Thousand.

109
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,780
Ten Thousand?

110
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,400
It's good to know kids today still have some goals.

111
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,170
We're not really going all the way to California

112
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,550
with this Murphy guy, are we?

113
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,800
That's the plan.

114
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,060
That's crazy.

115
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,270
What's so special about him anyway?

116
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,380
His blood.

117
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,390
Hey, take it easy there. That's the last of your water.

118
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,790
Actually it's the last of her water.

119
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,870
Mine's right here.

120
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,120
Give me that.

121
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,270
Just because we got to get you to California alive

122
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,000
doesn't mean I can't kick your ass between here and there.

123
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,030
Look out!

124
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,870
God!

125
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,350
Yeah! I'd pay money to see that again.

126
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,220
The axel's broke.

127
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,970
All right, everybody get into that truck.

128
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,560
Let's go, Murphy. Come on.

129
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,610
Get out. I'm driving.

131
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,490
Lookin' good, eh pup?

132
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,220
Two twenty ounce T-bone steaks aged to perfection.

133
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,490
What's that?

134
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,300
You like yours rare?

135
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,450
Well me too. We've got that in common.

136
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,540
Oh and there's plenty more where this came from.

137
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,160
Half a ton to be exact.

138
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,860
And that's just the T-bones.

139
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,230
We got New York strips, sirloins,

140
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,630
and even some filet mignon.

141
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,270
Between that and MREs to feed

142
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,930
a division for six months

143
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,740
I'd say you and I are gonna be the only two getting fat

144
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,900
for the apocalypse.

145
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,290
Here you go.

146
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,160
Enjoy that beef.

147
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,690
There are people out there that'd kill for that steak.

148
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,100
It's a dog eat dog world out there, man.

149
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,580
Oh, sorry.

150
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,660
Wrong word choice. It's more of a zombie eat man world.

151
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,330
As we share in the fruit of our labor,

152
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,090
let it remind us now more than ever,

153
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,850
that we need each other.

154
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,990
We need family.

155
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,470
As I led us through Black Summer,

156
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,650
you all had doubts.

157
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,840
Even I did.

158
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,430
But we pulled together as a family

159
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,050
and did what we had to do.

160
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,760
Millions died starving in the streets like animals.

161
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,440
But we survived. We survived as a family.

162
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,710
Our beautiful mother showed us the way.

163
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,690
Taught us what it meant to be a family.

164
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,680
But there is a hole in my heart.

165
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,750
A hole in this family.

166
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,820
Our Sunshine is missing.

167
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,550
And until she returns to us our family's not complete.

168
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,540
The circle that keeps us safe is broken.

169
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,430
Amen.

170
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,560
Amen.

171
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,120
Excellent.

172
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,130
Get yourself an extra serving. You did good.

173
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,390
Good news, everyone.

174
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,950
Sunshine has been found. The circle will not be broken.

175
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,300
Enjoy. That's the last of the food.

176
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,890
God, I'm so hungry my big guts are eating my little guts.

177
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,120
You gonna eat all of that?

178
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,680
Selfish little bastard.

179
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,140
We need to split up and look for food and water.

180
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,870
Oh, if we can find a two way radio or

181
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,610
even like a satellite dish,

182
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,970
I can try and contact that Citizen Z guy.

183
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,880
That's good. Okay, you and Mack do that.

184
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,480
And the rest of us will look for food.

185
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,220
Doc, you take Cassandra and 10K.

186
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,310
Warren and I will take Murphy. Stay close.

187
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,930
Meet back here in an hour.

188
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,220
All right, let's go.

190
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,130
I want that radio.

191
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,850
Yeah, what about Officer Zombie?

192
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,170
Do you remember that time in Peekskill?

193
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,860
Yeah, that's perfect. Top or bottom?

194
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,820
Top.

195
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,050
Hey, you. Yeah.

196
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,840
Oh, baby.

197
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,840
You know if I ever need mercy,

198
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,900
I really hope it's you.

199
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,010
Come on. I want to see if that radio works.

200
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,630
All right, hurry up. I'll pike some locals.

201
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,300
Jesus Christ.

202
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,080
Okay.

203
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:28,930
Hey, kid.

204
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,020
Give me a hand with this, will ya?

205
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,950
I don't know why we stopped here in Philly.

206
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,540
We should've kept going.

207
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,630
Going where?

208
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,640
We need to find a way to communicate with that Citizen dude.

209
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,000
And I think Addy can do something with this dish.

210
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,420
Who knows, maybe we'll get lucky and pick up porn.

211
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,170
Never seen porn.

212
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,720
You never seen porn?

213
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,110
Really? Never?

214
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,830
Before my time.

215
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,640
Is it good?

216
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,230
- Yeah. - Meh.

217
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,160
Sunshine!

218
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,910
That even disgusted me.

219
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,290
'Course I'm the only one here to disgust.

220
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,050
Except for you.

221
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,610
But you're a dog. What do you care?

222
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,390
Sorry.

223
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,180
Where's my Sunshine?

224
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,730
Bitch gave me the slip.

225
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,970
That's your sister you're talking about.

226
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,400
We'll find her soon enough.

227
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,680
Meanwhile, another opportunity has presented itself.

228
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,110
Mayday. Mayday.

229
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,020
Calling anybody on this frequency.

231
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,880
Picking up some kind of RF signal out of Philadelphia.

232
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,760
Looks like something on the police band.

233
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,610
Mayday. Mayday. This is Addison Carver

234
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,270
with Delta-Xray-Delta.

235
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,500
Trying to contact Citizen Z. Come in, Citizen Z.

236
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,660
Mayday. Mayday.

237
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,010
Delta-Xray-Delta, this is Citizen Z.

238
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,180
Do you copy? Over.

239
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,570
I'm picking you up loud and clear. Do you copy me?

240
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,470
Copy you loud and clear Citizen Z.

241
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,280
Delta-Xray-Delta, come in.

242
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,370
Delta-Xray-Delta, what is your status?

243
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,240
Delta-Xray-Delta.

244
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,510
What is your status?

245
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,390
Delta-Xray.

246
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,820
Anybody. Are you all right?

247
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,840
What is your status, Delta-Xray?

248
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,630
Delta-Xray, please respond.

249
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,690
Delta-Xray, do you copy.

250
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,730
Hey, what's going on down there?

251
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,850
Is the package safe?

252
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,110
Repeat, is the package safe? Do you copy?

253
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,090
Please respond.

254
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,290
If you're alive, please respond.

255
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,880
Addy? Addy Carver, do you copy?

256
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,600
All right.

257
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,650
Let's go old school here

258
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,070
and see if we can triangulate where that signal came from.

259
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,530
What assets are hot in Philadelphia?

260
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,730
Signal frequency looks like... the police band.

261
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,510
There can't be any cops left in Philly.

262
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,960
It's been a dead zone for like two years.

263
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,280
Maybe they hot-wired a cop's walkie.

264
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,970
I miss the ol' days before Edward Snowden... and zombies.

265
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,160
We were such badasses.

266
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,220
Addy, did it work? Addy? Addy!

267
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,460
Addy! Where are you?

268
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,520
Oh Jesus, baby. Baby, no, no, no, no, no!

269
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:45,480
Addy.

270
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,010
Addy.

271
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,900
Addy.

272
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,510
You're not Addy.

273
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,070
Where is she?

274
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,530
Addy!

275
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,330
Delta-Xray-Delta.

276
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,230
Delta-Xray-Delta, come in.

277
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,000
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

278
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,840
We're here. We're here.

279
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,290
Delta-X whatever, we copy.

280
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,630
Gotcha, Delta-Xray.

281
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,900
Who am I speaking to?

282
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,180
Mack Thompson, but that doesn't matter right now.

283
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,830
There was a woman here. Did you talk to her?

284
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,520
Roger that.

285
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,450
I made contact with someone named... Addy?

286
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,880
Yeah, Addy! Addy, yeah. Yeah, you talked to her, okay.

287
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,150
Is she okay?

288
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,700
Did she... did she tell you where she was going?

289
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,070
Negative on her location.

290
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,410
We only talked for like a second.

291
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,250
Something happened.

292
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,350
Goddamn Zs.

293
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,090
Maybe not.

294
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
I heard voices. Human voices.

295
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,410
And then some sort of struggle.

296
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,000
Humans?

297
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,090
Roger that.

298
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,210
Goddamn humans?

299
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,820
What about the package?

300
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,680
What package?

301
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,920
Murphy. Patient Zero.

302
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,170
Operation Bite Mark. Is he still alive?

303
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,840
Yeah, weasel breath, he's fine.

304
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,480
He was, he was alive an hour ago at least.

305
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,540
Okay, listen.

306
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,550
- I need you... - Got to run.

307
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,630
Wait!

308
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:51,360
Delta-Xray... Delta-Xray.

309
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,310
Delta-Xray.

310
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,290
Damn it.

311
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,880
I can't take much more of this.

312
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,430
It's okay. You're safe now.

313
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,600
You're safe. No one's going to harm you.

314
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,570
Touch me and I'll kill you.

315
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,680
Sweet child. That won't be necessary.

316
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,230
Please, the last thing we want is to harm you.

317
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,950
My friends are looking for me,

318
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,350
and when they find me they will kill you.

319
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,820
They will kill all of you!

320
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:40,920
I get it.

321
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,290
You don't trust me.

322
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:42,810
Why should you?

323
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,770
I know you're not ready to hear this, but I'm going to say it anyway.

324
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,150
I'm sorry.

325
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,620
Who are you? What do you want with me?

326
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,090
Fair questions.

327
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,830
I'd be angry too if I were brought here against my will.

328
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,720
Please, I don't want you to be afraid.

329
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,460
I... I must apologize about my overzealous companions.

330
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,440
They're good men,

331
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,680
but sometimes we have to resort to less than civilized means.

332
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,470
We live in a less than civilized world.

333
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,770
You know it. I know it.

334
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,730
So... when we encounter strangers

335
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,410
the family needs to take... necessary precautions.

336
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,980
What family?

337
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,000
Ours.

338
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,890
This is our home.

339
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,620
And I am responsible for their well-being.

340
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,260
I'm Tobias Campbell.

341
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,820
I guess you can say

342
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,410
I'm like a father to our little family.

343
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,590
But like a family, we take care of one another.

344
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,700
Everyone contributes. Everyone benefits.

345
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,900
It's how we've survived the last three years.

346
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,380
It's the only way we'll survive in the future.

347
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,330
Don't you agree?

348
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,380
You must be hungry. Please eat.

349
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,860
We have plenty to share.

350
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,750
I'm not hungry.

351
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,600
You will be.

352
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,080
Until then, why don't you go with Moonshade and Stormy.

353
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:04,880
Ladies,

354
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,610
be so kind as to find some fresh clothes for our newest member.

355
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,000
I didn't say anything about joining your... family.

356
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,030
Oh, I'm sorry.

357
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,880
I don't mean to be presumptuous.

358
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,990
It's just that once people see

359
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,150
the love and bounty that we share

360
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,840
they never want to leave us.

361
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,030
Ladies?

362
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,860
Wait, so this Rocky dude loses the fight?

363
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,350
Yeah. Yeah, but see in losing, he wins.

364
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,950
It's very zen.

365
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,190
I'd like to see Rocky fight a Z.

366
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,630
If he loses, he gets eaten.

367
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,750
Hey, is everything okay?

368
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:52,320
Fine.

369
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,410
It's about time.

370
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,160
What's wrong? Where's Addy?

371
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,090
Missing.

372
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,820
Is she...?

373
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,460
No.

374
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,080
Taken alive.

375
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,160
What?

376
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,550
By humans.

377
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,280
Who?

378
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,450
We thought you might know.

379
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,580
Me? Why would I know?

380
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,650
You recognize these guys?

381
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,000
No. Why would I?

382
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,930
Creep on the left was one of those two bikers back in Jersey.

383
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,320
With your friend Travis.

384
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,860
I told you, I didn't know that guy.

385
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,180
And I don't know them either.

386
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,250
You are gonna start telling me the truth right now

387
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,730
- or I am going to start blowing holes  - Mack.

388
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,830
- in you until you do. - Mack.

389
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,960
Do you understand me?

390
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,750
Mack. Put the gun away. Put the gun away.

391
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,570
You're gonna tell us everything you know about these guys right now.

392
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,110
Or I'll shoot you.

393
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,050
I can't go back!

394
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,010
Back where?

395
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,300
Where? Where? Where is she?! Where is she?!

396
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,150
Shoot.

397
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,540
You look beautiful.

398
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,260
I look like a post-apocalyptic stripper. Jesus.

399
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,600
More like bait.

400
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,510
Look at you.

401
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,670
Mother will be so pleased.

402
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,060
Supper will be ready soon.

403
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,710
Set the table.

404
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:25,400
And set a place of honor for our guest next to Mother.

405
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,560
Where are you Mack?

406
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,730
Enough!

407
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,790
All right, Cassandra! No more bullshit.

408
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,350
Tell us what you know. Now!

409
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,950
All right. I know them.

410
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,930
They're part of a group of survivors. A family of sorts.

411
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,510
But more like a cult actually.

412
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,690
Led by a man named Tobias Campbell.

413
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,150
I can't go back there. I won't go back.

414
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,560
You'll do whatever the hell we need you to do

415
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,810
to get Addy back!

416
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,930
You don't know these people. They're dangerous.

417
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:02,990
So are we.

418
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,000
Not like they are.

419
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,530
Tobias and the others are worse than Zs.

420
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,630
I thought I'd gotten away from them,

421
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,980
but then Travis spotted me with you.

422
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,390
Why are you so afraid of them?

423
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,860
You don't get it.

424
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,360
You don't pick who you survive with.

425
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,940
At first I thought I was lucky.

426
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,290
They started out like everybody else.

427
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:28,390
Tobias was smart. He was strong. He saved us.

428
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:31,180
But then Black Summer came, and everything went to hell.

429
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,590
Somewhere along the way he lost his mind,

430
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,970
and... and we lost our souls. And I am not going back there!

431
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,660
What are they gonna do to Addy?

432
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,440
Tobias has this weird control over people.

433
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,070
He can make you do terrible things.

434
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,430
What do you mean? Rape?

435
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,380
No, he'll use her as bait.

436
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,750
Bait? What, do they rob people?

437
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,700
Not just rob.

438
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,470
Murder them?!

439
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,930
No! Not rape. Not murder.

440
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,300
They don't just kill their victims. It's worse.

441
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,940
Well hope we are not eating dog.

442
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:40,540
Oh God! Oh no! Oh God! Oh no! No!

443
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,990
Supper's ready!

444
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,950
There was this farmer.

445
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,500
Had the smartest pig in the world, Arnold.

446
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,450
This pig could read and do math.

447
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,550
Arnold was famous.

448
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,050
And then one day, the farmer's friend, he comes over

449
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,900
and he sees Arnold tripping around on three legs.

450
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,850
And he says to the farmer, "hey, what happened to poor Arnold?"

451
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,900
And the farmer says

452
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,170
"Smart pig like that, you don't eat him all at once."

453
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,750
Oh, what? Too soon?

454
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,970
We didn't start out as cannibals.

455
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,450
Cannibals? How is that even possible?

456
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,440
Everything's infected with the zombie virus.

457
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,220
If you kill it and eat it, you get the live virus.

458
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,530
But if you eat it alive...

459
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,700
We were people just trying to survive.

460
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,800
Tobias saved me. First from the Zs.

461
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,560
Then from the worst of humanity.

462
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,860
He was a good man. Then his wife got sick.

463
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,340
She just couldn't take it anymore.

464
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,840
And he was never the same after that.

465
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,260
When Black Summer came

466
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,430
and everyone else in the world was starving,

467
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,360
he swore he would do whatever it took to keep us alive.

468
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,340
And he did.

469
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,200
I'm going back for Addy.

470
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,760
Hang on, Mack.

471
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,470
Garnett, do not try to stop me.

472
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,930
Nobody's gonna try to stop you. We're all going back.

473
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,090
We just need a plan.

474
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,990
You don't understand! These people are worse than Zs!

475
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,270
They'll kill all of you!

476
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,610
Yeah, she's right. We need to look at the big picture.

477
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,670
Shut up!

478
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,260
Do you know where they've taken her?

479
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,360
I know you think we're monsters. Inhuman.

480
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,580
We all did too at first.

481
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:41,430
But hunger has a way of changing one's mind.

482
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,630
Morality is stripped away.

483
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,170
And all that remains is survival.

484
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,760
I know, this takes some getting used to.

485
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,840
Perhaps this will make it more palatable.

486
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,600
Please, Little Flower.

487
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,330
You must be starving.

488
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,160
Just a bite to keep your strength.

489
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,720
I made it special for you.

490
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,500
Now you've upset Mama.

491
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,820
I know this is a big adjustment.

492
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,540
But in times like these, it's eat or be eaten.

493
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,370
So please. Mama likes you.

494
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,830
Make her happy.

495
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,900
Fresh meat.

496
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,850
You two, get this meat back in the kitchen.

497
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,460
Then get in position.

498
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,340
Afternoon, friend.

499
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,590
If it's female companionship you're looking for,

500
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,460
you've come to the right place.

501
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,450
Actually I'm looking for my friend.

502
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,790
Red head.

503
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,740
Goes by the name of Addy.

504
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,290
Addy? Addy? Don't know anybody named Addy.

505
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,100
Sure would remember if we had one.

506
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,900
Oh hey, how about the lovely Moonshade or Stormy?

507
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,450
We got a two for one special today.

508
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,050
Listen, scumbag.

509
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,000
I know you got her.

510
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,490
You send her out here in the next ten seconds

511
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,800
or a lot of bad shit is gonna start happening.

512
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:47,840
Oooh, tough guy.

513
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,390
That was a head shot.

514
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,670
We showed your friend some mercy.

515
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,800
I'm not gonna do the same for you.

516
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,210
Next shot is going through your heart.

517
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,680
So unless you want to be prematurely zombified,

518
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,410
you get my friend out here.

519
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,010
Now.

520
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,640
Not if I blow you away first.

521
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,660
You're not gonna do that. You're gonna get me Addy.

522
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,020
And if you're quick about it, you can still eat your friend.

523
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,780
That won't be necessary.

524
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,440
Garnett!

525
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,960
Not yet. Not yet. Come on.

526
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,940
Apparently you've been talking to my little Sunshine.

527
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,360
Garnett, get me out of here. These people are insane.

528
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,710
Say that again and I will eat your heart.

529
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,780
Apparently we both have something the other wants.

530
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,310
Perhaps we can make a deal.

531
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,880
Give me back my Sunshine, and you can have your precious Addy.

532
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,190
Nah, I'm not gonna negotiate with a cannibal.

533
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,750
You're gonna give me Addy. We're gonna walk away.

534
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,720
And you can eat anybody you want.

535
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,000
You know the first rule of negotiation is

536
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,920
the person who wants it least wins.

537
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,750
If you harm her, we'll kill every one of you.

538
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,920
Kill away.

539
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,570
Frankly I've had about all the zombie apocalypse I can take.

540
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:04,540
But of course, you and the girl will be the first to die.

541
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,170
That's what I thought.

542
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,080
Do you know the second rule of negotiation?

543
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,330
What?

544
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,440
The guy with the 50 caliber machine gun wins.

545
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,470
That didn't sound good.

546
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,170
You gonna give me back my Sunshine?

547
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:39,090
Or do we continue this conversation in hell?

548
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,080
- No, Mack. - No, no, if we're going to hell,

549
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,060
I'm going all the way and I'm taking this bastard with me.

550
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,380
- Wait! - What do you want?!

551
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,240
I'll go.

552
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,190
Stop!

553
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,050
Let her go, Tobias.

554
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,500
What are you doing?

555
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,680
What I should have done in the first place.

556
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,190
Let her go, and I'll come back.

557
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,100
Don't do it. Kill them. Kill them all.

558
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,670
- No. - It's okay. It's okay.

559
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:28,950
Come on.

560
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,020
It's okay. It's okay, baby.

561
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,890
It's okay. Come on. Let's go.

562
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,020
My Sunshine.

563
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:54,280
Hey, we about given up on you.

564
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,980
I actually gave up on you about an hour ago.

565
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:00,740
Never thought I'd be happy to see your sad ass again.

566
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,200
Let's get out of here, guys. Now.

567
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:03,820
Wait. What?

568
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:05,880
Come on.

569
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,970
We're not... we're not leaving her there, are we?

570
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,070
Addy. She lied to us. It almost got you killed.

571
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:17,890
We can't do that.

572
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,030
We can't just leave her there.

573
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,030
Come in the truck with me.

574
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,110
We'll talk about this when you're safe.

575
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,670
I am not going.

576
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,300
Look, he's right.

577
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,190
We almost all got killed going back for you.

578
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,250
Yeah, she's a freakin' cannibal, and she got what she deserved.

579
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,430
She did what she had to do to survive.

580
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,270
And you of all people would have done the same.

581
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,940
Come on, Addy is right!

582
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,310
We cannot leave her back there!

583
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,050
You men don't know what it's like.

584
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,540
What is this, a chick thing now?

585
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,020
- Yes. - Yes.

586
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,440
All right, I want to help her too.

587
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,540
But we're not gonna beat a 50 caliber machine gun.

588
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,060
It's gonna tear us to pieces before we get to the fence.

589
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,840
How good a shot are you?

590
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,360
Pretty good.

591
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,320
One thousand eighty-four.

592
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,240
Oh yeah, and a half.

593
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,900
Okay. I have an idea.

594
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,130
Calling Northern Light. Calling Northern Light.

595
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,340
Come in, Northern Light. Do you copy? Over.

596
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,140
Come in... Citizen whoever you are.

597
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,610
This is Delta-Xray-Delta.

598
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,450
Where the hell are you? Come in. Over.

599
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,770
I'm here. I'm here. Northern Light.

600
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,190
Copy you Delta-Xray.

601
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,990
Northern Light, we need your help. Do you copy?

602
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:35,960
We need your help.

603
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,260
Copy that, ma'am. What can I do?

604
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,810
We need music.

605
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,720
I'm sorry. Say again.

606
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,390
It sounded like you said you needed music.

607
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,320
That's a roger.

608
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,910
Can you broadcast on the AM frequency? Over.

609
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,840
We're the NSA, ma'am.

610
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,050
Master of all frequencies.

611
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,420
What would you like to hear?

612
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,260
We need a diversion. Something loud.

613
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,400
Something that'll make the Zs go crazy.

614
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,460
Copy that and can do, ma'am.

615
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,890
I think I have just the thing.

616
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,290
Give me five minutes and look for my broadcast

617
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:04,010
on the low end of the AM dial.

618
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,040
Thanks, dude.

619
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,210
Over.

620
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,130
Hear that boy?

621
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,210
They need us.

622
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,920
Somebody actually needs us.

623
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,890
Mama's so much happier when you're here.

624
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,300
Got some fresh meat in trailer two

625
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,470
looking for something exotic.

626
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,060
You're on, Sunshine.

627
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,620
That's what I'm talkin' about.

628
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:54,360
Twenty minutes and no rough stuff.

629
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,960
Define rough stuff.

630
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,890
Sunshine will let you know.

631
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,280
Oh. Sunshine.

632
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,770
What are you doing?

633
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,530
The right thing.

634
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,470
Just follow my lead.

635
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,320
You know this is gonna get us all killed, right?

636
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,500
At least we're going out with some style.

637
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,520
Crank it up!

638
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:20,560
Here they come.

639
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,560
If you got any prayers, now's the time.

640
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:43,450
- Oh yeah, baby! - Oh my God!

641
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,830
- Yeah, baby! - Oh, you're so big!

642
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:46,940
- Take it! - Yes!

643
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,510
- Love doctor in the house! - Oh, doctor!

644
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:52,520
Oh yeah! Yeah, baby!

645
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,940
Oh yeah! Ride it, baby!

646
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,440
What fool is playing music?

647
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,770
Yes!

648
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:57,910
Listen. That's our signal.

649
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,940
Come on, baby!

650
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,040
Bernt, see if you can tell where that music is coming from.

651
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,580
Merchant, get on the 50 caliber just in case.

652
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,950
No! No! Don't!

653
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,570
No! No!

654
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,510
Now!

655
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,730
Sunshine.

656
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,820
My name is Cassandra!

657
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,320
Let's go. Come on.

658
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:00,470
Let's go! Let's go!

659
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,260
Sunshine!

660
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,760
It's now or never.

661
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,250
My kinda town.

662
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,630
If anybody asks, we were nowhere near that bell.

663
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,580
I always heard Philly was a tough town, but sheesh.

664
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,350
Zombies with attitude.

665
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,580
Hope my peeps down in the Philly area can hear this.

666
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:07,420
Thought I'd spin some blues to travel by.

667
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:11,000
And to anybody else out there within the sound of my voice.

668
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,720
I hope some slide guitar

669
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,280
gets you through another messed up day of death and destruction.

670
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,940
Everybody out there, whether you're hiding in a cave

671
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,290
or running for your life,

672
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,990
just keep doing what you got to do to stay alive.

673
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,390
Because in the end, that's the only way we're gonna win

674
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,250
this Zombie Apocalypse thing.

675
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,400
Bash 'em, slash 'em, bust 'em, and burn 'em.

676
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:34,680
Whatever it takes. Just stay alive.

677
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,590
No questions asked.

《僵尸国度》前情提要
Previously on Z Nation.

20
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,620
这些都是僵尸咬的
Those are zombie bites.

21
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:04,680
八个僵尸
Eight of them.

22
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,610
如果我们能把他送到加利福尼亚的实验室
If we can get him to the lab in California,

23
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,250
他们就能用他的血造出更多抗体
they can use his blood and make more of the vaccine.

24
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,390
快射他
Shoot him!

25
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,150
你就是那位救我一命的神枪手  是不是
You're that sharp shooter that saved my ass, aren't you?

26
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,040
孩子  你叫什么
So what's your name, kid?

27
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,480
一万
Ten Thousand.

28
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,820
有什么深意吗
Does it mean anything?

29
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,460
是我要消灭的僵尸的数量
How many zombies I'm going to kill.

30
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,510
第1059个
One thousand fifty-nine.

31
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,230
第1060个
One thousand sixty!

32
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,420
射得好  孩子
Nice shot, kid!

33
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,170
宾夕法尼亚  阿米什乡村

34
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,190
阿米什僵尸
Amish zombies.

35
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,290
搞笑呢
Really?

36
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,140
搞笑呢
Really?

37
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,520
他们试着把自己与社会的其他部分
They tried to quarantine themselves

38
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,990
隔绝开来
from the rest of society.

39
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,810
避免僵尸将病毒传播到这里来
Keep the Zs from spreading the infection.

40
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,070
罗梅罗[美国地名]沦陷前  阿米什人也就这做派吧
That was before we knew Romero had it right.

41
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,460
我们都携带着病毒
We were all carrying the virus.

42
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,070
无所谓你是什么人  最后会怎么死去
Didn't matter who you were or how you died.

43
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,750
《活死人之夜》  出色的电影  糟烂的现实
Night of the Living Dead. Great movie, sucky reality.

44
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,730
知道我有哪点搞不懂吗  如果不是僵尸传播的病毒
You know what I don't get, If the Zs didn't spread the virus,

45
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,480
那么我们都是如何被感染到的
how did we all get infected?

46
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,090
我听说的最靠谱说法  是由鸟类传播的
Best guess I heard, it was spread by birds.

47
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,130
禽流感病毒中携带着某种寄生虫
Some kind of parasite piggybacked on the bird flu.

48
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,450
在你死之前一直蛰伏在体内
Stays dormant 'till you die.

49
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,160
你要知道
You know

50
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,580
要了解实情就要去找有一手资讯的人
take it from somebody who knows first hand.

51
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,220
僵尸爱吃大脑这种旧闻早已是明日黄花
Other than the fact that they find brains delicious,

52
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,300
一说到僵尸  人人都能变成砖家
when it comes to zombies nobody knows nothin'.

53
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,550
轮到我去了
My turn.

54
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,480
咱俩不熟是吧
Have we just met?

55
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,660
谢了
Thank you.

56
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,580
你快去快回
Hey, hurry up.

57
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,100
我希望在天黑前到达疾控中心
I want to get past DC before dark.

58
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,190
好了好了好了
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,070
我告诉你吧  僵尸只剩个躯壳而已
I'm tellin' ya, there ain't nothin' there.

60
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,940
没有了思维  没有了记忆
No thoughts, no memories.

61
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,840
没有了灵魂
No soul.

62
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,090
啥都没有
Nothin'.

63
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,500
但是它们还是活着的
Well they're not dead.

64
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,620
它们还想要点什么
They want something.

65
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,770
是啊  大脑嘛
Yeah. Brains.

66
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,520
如果你没有意识  没有灵魂 
You can't want something if you're not conscious,

67
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,800
是不会想去要些什么的
if you don't have a soul.

68
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,610
当我爸当初受伤后
When my pa was wounded,

69
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,550
他让我在他变异前把他绑紧
he told me to tie him up before he turned.

70
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,990
让我向他保证在他死的时候要施以仁慈
Made me promise to show him mercy when he died.

71
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,770
将大脑杀死  你懂得
Kill the brain, you know?

72
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,190
我下不去手
I couldn't do it.

73
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,800
我不能伤害我的父亲
I couldn't hurt my pa,

74
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,790
无论他变成什么
no matter what he'd become.

75
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,300
我有史以来第一次那么长时间地注视着他
I stared into his eyes for the longest time, just

76
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,080
希望能从他的眼神里看到转机
looking for some sign he was still in there.

77
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,560
那你看到了吗
Did you see anything?

78
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,590
你当时怎么做的
What did you do?

79
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,720
我杀了它
I killed it.

80
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,760
我靠  孩子啊
Damn, kid.

81
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,620
你当时被迫杀了自己老爸吗
You had to put down your own dad?

82
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,030
我没有杀"他"
Didn't kill him.

83
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,510
我杀的是"它"
Killed it.

84
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,190
但如果它当时已经变异  你是如何杀的它
But if it's not alive, how did you kill it?

85
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,220
我刺穿了它
Piked it.

86
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,680
就在这  我杀的第一个
Right here. My first kill.

87
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,380
我一直希望他能知道
I always wish he knew, you know,

88
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,890
不管怎样  知道我当初信守了诺言
somehow knew that I kept my promise.

89
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,670
有人来了  在你们背后
Humans! Six o'clock!

90
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,420
我看着他们呢
I see them.

91
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,100
你的食人族朋友还没死绝吗
Is that more of your cannibal friends?

92
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,060
不  这是另一伙人
No. Something else.

93
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,950
前方有状况
Up ahead!

94
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,870
他要去哪呢
Where's he going?

95
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,600
嘿  孩子
Hey! Kid!

96
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,260
你怎么看
What do you think?

97
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,580
直接撞过去吗
Plow right through?

98
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,480
不  我不想再把车毁了
No, I don't want to wreck the truck again.

99
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,890
我们把它们赶走再赶路吧
Let's pike them and be on our way.

100
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,640
搞什么  我们是在开圣母派对吗
Oh what, are we having a little mercy party?

101
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,740
我们悄悄地过去
Hey, let's do this quietly.

102
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,340
边上说不定还有更多僵尸
There might be more of them nearby.

103
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,690
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

104
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,820
有点不对劲
Something's wrong.

105
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,240
她说得对  看看它们的脚
Yeah, she's right. Look at their feet.

106
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,540
别动
Hold it right there!

107
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,030
好了好了  现在放下武器
All right, now drop your weapons

108
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,550
不然送你们上西天
or die

109
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,370
一枪崩了你们
right where you stand.

110
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,090
要么放下武器
Put down the weapons

111
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,340
要么就去吃大脑吧
or eat brains.

112
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,230
天哪  我爱死那孩子了
God, I love that kid.

113
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,100
我们只想要那辆车
Now, we just want the vehicle.

114
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,580
好吗
All right?

115
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,360
只要把卡车给我们
So give us the truck

116
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,870
我们就放你们一条活路  大家秋后算账
and we'll let you live to die another day.

117
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,770
把卡车给他们吧
Give them the truck!

118
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,940
什么都别给他们
Don't give them a goddamn thing!

119
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,650
好好算算吧  加内特
Do the math Garnett.

120
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,390
我们还有别的要紧事
We have other priorities.

121
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,370
把卡车给他们
Get them the damn truck.

122
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,490
听听你朋友说的话
Listen to your friend there.

123
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,730
谁都不想死在这
Nobody wants to die.

124
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,020
不过那辆卡车我们要定了
But we're taking that truck.

125
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,800
一切听你的  加内特
Say the word, Garnett.

126
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,170
给他们...
Let them have it.

127
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,090
卡车
The truck.

128
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,020
把卡车给他们
Let them have the truck.

129
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,840
明智的决定
Smart move.

130
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,400
大家伙儿  我们走
All right guys, let's go!

131
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,560
别管那辆破车了
And leave the junker!

132
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,420
他们走不了多远
They're not gonna get very far.

133

Now that's a hundred miles south from here.

274
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:53,930
你最好别那样想

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,660
我们被告知他有一台直升机
We were told he has a helicopter.

286
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,390
没错  他有一台直升机
Yeah, he's got a chopper.

287
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,790
但麦坎德斯将军现在非常忙碌
But General McCandles is a very busy man.

288
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,530
他现在负责指挥整个东海岸
He's got the entire east coast under his command.

289
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,650
他无法去帮那些正在执行自杀任务的
He can't worry about some raggedy ass group of civilians

290
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,110
民间破烂蠢队
on a suicide mission.

291
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,240
我建议在其他感染者找上你们之前赶紧离开吧
I suggest you move on before the infected find you.

292
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,910
我们不是什么民间破烂蠢队  长官
Nothing raggedy ass about this group of civilians, sir.

293
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,620
而且这位先生可以为研制
And this man has important information

294
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,060
僵尸病毒疫苗提供重要信息
about a vaccine for the zombie virus.

295
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,180
他身上有该死的僵尸味道
He smells like a damn Z.

296
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,520
你身上的味道也好不到哪去  化粪池
You don't smell so good yourself, septic tank.

297
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,010
你到底帮不帮我们
You gonna help us or not?

298
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,860
你们想见将军吗
You want to see the General?

299
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,520
那就拿出点诚意
You're going to have to pay a tribute.

300
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,860
拿出诚意向他表达你们的决心
Gesture of goodwill to show him you're serious.

301
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,080
你想要我们拿出怎样的诚意
What kind of tribute you have in mind?

302
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,370
我们的医疗兵已经失踪一年多了
Our medic has been MIA over a year.

303
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,960
我们需要止痛药  抗生素
We need painkillers. Antibiotics.

304
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,510
任何你们有的药物
Anything you got.

305
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,980
我去拿我的医疗包
I'll get my bag.

306
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,840
我有阿司匹林  四环素  西普罗
I got aspirin, tetracycline, cipro.

307
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,920
应该能对付大部分的感染
That should knock out most any infection.

308
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,270
还有奥施康定
And oxycontin.

309
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,500
奥施康定就好  我们需要止痛药
The oxy. We need painkillers.

310
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,760
你到底想不想见将军
You want to see the General or not?

311
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,820
我们只剩这些药物了
This is the last of our supply.

312
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,620
这就对了
That'll do.

313
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,300
现在你们可以见将军了
The General will see you now.

314
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,660
为了什么事来打扰我
Why are you wasting my time?

315
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,480
麦坎德斯将军  长官
General McCandles, sir.

316
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,470
国家警卫队和几个平民
We have a National Guard unit and several civilians

317
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,030
请求跟您说话
requesting permission to speak to you.

318
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,400
亲爱的上帝跟他们一起来的吗
Is sweet Jesus with them?

319
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,610
没有  长官
No, sir.

320
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,740
-那叫他们见鬼去吧  -我想没有
- Then tell them to go to hell! - I don't believe so.

321
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,370
我还有战要打  我要的近距空中支援呢
I've got a war to fight! Where's that close air support I ordered?

322
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,610
告诉海军上将早上8点前潜艇必须到位
Tell the Admiral I need those subs in position by 0800.

323
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,200
B连队  不惜一切代价坚守岗位
Bravo Company, hold your position at all costs.

324
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,170
重复  不惜一切代价
Repeat, all costs.

325
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,980
听到将军说的话了吧
You heard the General.

326
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,740
麦坎德斯将军  长官
General McCandles, sir.

327
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,140
我们在执行一项直接由总统授权的
We're on a mission of extreme importance

328
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,160
非常重要的任务
by direct order from the president.

329
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,750
我们必须要找到能飞到
It's imperative that we find air transport

330
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,680
-加利福尼亚的  -抱歉  我很忙
-to Mt. Wilson CDC lab - Sorry, I'm busy.

331
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,290
威尔森山疾病控制中心研究所的飞机
in California.

332
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,900
我的增援部队什么时候到
Where are my reinforcements?

333
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,450
你听到了  该走了
You heard the man. Time to go.

334
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,620
这样就完事了吗
That's it?

335
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,760
我要揍到你把奥斯康定吐出来
I've a good mind to make you barf up my oxycontin.

336
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,570
多克[医生]  多克[医生]  冷静点
Doc! Doc! Stand down!

337
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,930
你刚才说的"医生"  真的是名医生吗
Did you say Doc? As in doctor?

338
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,850
是的  我们的队伍里有一名医生
Yeah, our team includes a medical doctor.

339
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,470
你刚才为什么没说  让他进来
Why didn't you say so? Send him up.

340
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,040
我有个手下受伤了  需要被治疗
I have a wounded man in need of medical attention.

341
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,810
只准医生进去  其他人在外面等着
Just the doctor. The rest of you wait here.

342
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,810
我自己就行
I got this.

343
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,190
好吧
All right.

344
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,070
跟他说说借用直升机的事
Hey, hey, hey. Talk to him about the chopper.

345
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,620
那个贱种
Son of a bitch.

346
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,250
我还想留着奥斯康定
I was saving that oxy

347
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,220
到加利福尼亚开派对的时候用呢
for a party when we got to Cali.

348
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,680
你就是那个医生吗
You the medic?

349
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,110
的确是我
I am indeed.

350
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,100
你是将军吗
You the General?

351
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,490
亚瑟·C·麦坎德斯将军
General Arthur C. McCandles.

352
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,110
指挥官  中央司令部
Commander, Central Command,

353
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,870
感染反应部队
Infection Response Forces.

354
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,740
你受伤的手下在哪
Where's your wounded man?

355
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,840
就是我
Right here.

356
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,620
这不是被僵尸咬伤的
It's not a bite.

357
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,260
看起来不太好
This looks bad.

358
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,590
真的很糟
Real bad.

359
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,180
只是被抓了一下
It's just a scratch.

360
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,980
不  这  这更像一个坏疽
No, that's... that's more like gangrene.

361
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,770
你能保住我这条腿吗
Can you save the leg?

362
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,520
恐怕不能  将军
I'm afraid not, General.

363
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,260
它已经向外蔓延了
It's already starting to spread.

364
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,730
不久僵尸病毒就会蔓延全身
Soon the Z virus will take over.

365
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,750
我只能在你变成僵尸的时候
All I can do at this point is show you mercy

366
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,890
对你"施以仁慈"了
when the time comes.

367
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,540
这就是你的诊断吗
You call that a diagnosis?

368
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,110
我只能实话实说
I call it the truth.

369
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,230
你不久就会死去
You're gonna die.

370
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,300
很快
And soon.

371
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,630
上一个家伙也是这么说的
That's what the last guy said.

372
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,510
快看这是谁
Look who.

373
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,580
你觉得怎么样  小狗
What do you think, pup?

374
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,170
能不能变成我们的下一个小伙伴呢
Could we use another friend?

375
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,480
我也是这么想的
My thoughts exactly.

376
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,030
速度真快
That was quick.

377
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,080
你在北极怎么样了
How are things at the North Pole?

378
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,020
好极了  今天看到美丽的极光了
Awesome. Beautiful Aurora today.

379
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,640
你那边怎么样
How's your day going?

380
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,460
有点寂寞  能有个聊天的人真好
Kinda lonely. Nice to have somebody to talk to.

381
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,390
我知道那种感觉  我在这也很寂寞
I know the feeling. Gets lonely here too.

382
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,600
尽管一直忙着关注整个地球
Keeping an eye on the planet keeps you busy though.

383
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,510
我知道你在看着我们就感到很安心
I feel safer just knowing you're there.

384
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,080
感觉你很酷[冷静]
You seem so cool.

385
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,130
希望我能见到你
I wish I could meet you in person.

386
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,970
虽然非常忙  但是我保证我们能见面
Super busy, but I'm sure that could be arranged.

387
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,830
你现在在做什么
What are you doing right now?

388
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,350
你懂的
Aww you know.

389
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,110
跟以前一样呗
Same ol', same ol'.

390
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,380
一千零九十
One thousand ninety.

391
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,120
一千零九十一
One thousand ninety-one.

392
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,260
一千零九十二
One thousand and ninety-two.

393
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,720
多克怎么样了
Okay, what's going on with Doc?

394
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,570
伙计们  如果我们不尽快离开这里
Guys, if we don't get out of here soon

395
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,500
事情可能就糟糕了
this could get ugly.

396
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,800
你应该说变得更糟
Oh, you mean uglier.

397
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,750
你们听到了吗
Do you hear that?

398
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,300
听到什么
Hear what?

399
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,410
我什么也没听到
I don't hear anything.

400
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,710
听起来好像是多克
Sounds like Doc.

401
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,970
快住口
Make it stop!

402
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,330
快住口
Make it stop!

403
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,420
是多克没错  但是他到底在哪
That's Doc all right. But where the hell is he?

404
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,430
在上面的某处
Somewhere up there.

405
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,940
我们上去找他
We're going up after him.

406
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,440
不  你们不能进去
No, you don't.

407
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,520
让我们上去
Let us up now.

408
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,820
没有将军的命令谁也不能上去
Nobody goes upstairs without the General's orders.

409
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,860
现在就让我们上去
We go up now

410
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,350
不然让你的大脑变豆脑
or I scramble your egg-brain inside the shell.

411
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,720
你会后悔的
You'll be sorry.

412
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,920
你也会后悔的  因为你和我们一起
So will you cuz you're coming up with us.

413
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,480
一万  侧面掩护
10K! Cover our flank.

414
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,270
别让人或僵尸跟上来
Don't let man or zombie follow us up.

415
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,620
遵命
Yes, sir.

416
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,150
1093个
One thousand ninety-three.

417
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,830
一箭双雕
No.

418
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,410
应该是第1094个
Ninety-four.

419
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,980
将军在几楼
What floor is the General on?

420
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,040
在顶楼
Top floor.

421
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,080
拜托  他可是将军
He's the General, man.

422
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,930
他还能在哪一层呢
What floor do you think he's on?

423
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,140
这一切都是幻觉
My world is but an illusion.

424
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,200
这一切都是幻觉
My world is but an illusion.

425
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,400
天呐  为什么我以前没有多注意
Oh God, why didn't I pay better attention

426
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,610
和我约会的那个信佛的妞
to that sweet little Buddhist chick I dated?

427
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,300
保持冷静
Stay calm.

428
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,260
我确定他们...
I'm sure they're...

429
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,590
我确定他们在守着你
I'm sure they're watching you right now.

430
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,860
他们正在找你
They're looking for you.

431
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,850
他们现在正在找你
They're looking for you right now.

432
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,890
他们不可能抛弃你
There's no way they'd just leave you here

433
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:43,790
不会让你卡在通风井里
trapped in the air shaft with an ugly-ass zombie

434
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,100
和一个等着吃人的丑僵尸在一起
waiting to eat my face off!

435
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,870
等等
Oh, wait.

436
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,310
这还差不多
Oh, that's more like it.

437
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,420
我这是为特殊情况省下来的
I was saving this for a special occasion.

438
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,190
就像现在
Like now.

439
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,480
加油  坚持住
Come on, suck it up.

440
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,770
加油  挺住
Come on. Come on.

441
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,090
这他妈是个好东西
That's good shit, man.

442
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,340
冷静点
Chill!

443
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,720
救命呀
Help!

444
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,390
现在做什么
Now what?

445
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,940
准备好见招拆招
Be ready for anything.

446
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,600
我有提过吗
Did I mention that

447
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,150
除了僵尸
the one thing I have a phobia of aside

448
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,170
我最怕的就是电梯
from zombies is elevators.

449
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,110
你们真不应该去惹将军
Shouldn't have messed with the General.

450
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,690
这里是不是越来越热了
Is it getting hot in here?

451
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,800
快点  把该死的门打开
Hey, come on. Open the damn door.

452
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,590
我要出去
I got to get out of here.

453
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,570
摩菲  放松
Relax, Murphy.

454
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,030
不  我要出去  这里氧气不足
No, no, I got to get out. There's not enough oxygen.

455
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,230
冷静点
Chill out!

456
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:55,730
马克
Mack!

457
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,660
宝贝  我在这
I'm here, babe.

458
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,490
为什么停了
Hey, why aren't we moving?

459
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,450
马上就会启动
It'll start in a second.

460
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,650
儿子  谢谢你
Thank you, son.

461
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,730
真不错
It's good.

462
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,380
我现在能为你做些什么
Can I do anything for you?

463
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,280
确保这些结都系紧了
Make sure those knots are tight.

464
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,820
要不了多久了
It's not gonna be long now.

465
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,900
是双活结  按照你教我那样打的
It's double-half-hitch. Just like you taught me.

466
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,280
再确认一下吧
Just be sure.

467
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,170
答应我
Promise me

468
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,000
时间一到
you'll do what we talked about

469
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,070
你要按照我们说好的做
when the time comes.

470
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,540
答应我
Promise me.

471
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,220
我保证
I promise.

472
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,430
按照我们说好的来
Just like we talked about.

473
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,180
我发誓
I swear.

474
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,020
别发誓
Don't swear.

475
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,930
你母亲不喜欢发誓
Your mother never liked that.

476
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,500
我保证
I promise.

477
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,480
好
Good.

478
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,480
我一直相信你能做正确的事
I could always trust you to do the right thing.

479
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,540
你是个好孩子
You're a good boy.

480
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,880
你母亲
Your mother,

481
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,980
她会为日后的你而自豪
she'd be proud of the man you're growing up to be.

482
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,690
再给我抽一口
Give me another puff.

483
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,380
行吗
Will ya?

484
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,480
你现在别乱来好吗
Ya know, now don't take offense.

485
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:35,420
比你那张脸更恐怖的
But the only thing worse than that mug of yours

486
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,320
就是你的口臭了
is your breath.

487
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,060
别咬我手指  畜生
Not my fingers, you animal!

488
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,060
我是在请你抽最后一口好东西
I was offering you the last hit.

489
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,130
得了  都便宜了我自己吧
Well, fine. I'll bogart it myself then.

490
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,820
我跟你说这玩意儿可是用途广泛
A thousand and one uses, I tell ya.

491
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,770
该死的
Well I'll be damned.

492
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,620
我看你是被熏醉了
I think you're stoned.

493
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,400
矮油  疫苗之类都可以省了
Hell, we don't need a vaccine.

494
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:13,230
只需要几百万吨的优质大麻
Just need a few billion tons of some primo Ganja,

495
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,550
就能天下太平了
and the world would be just fine.

496
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,150
摩根·亨利医生
Doctor Morgan Henley.

497
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,910
你那个吸饱大麻烟气的脑袋
Does that name ring a bell

498
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:37,400
觉得这个名字听起来耳熟吗
in any of those cannabinol soaked brain cells you have left?

499
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,870
我一定也是醉了
I must be really stoned.

500
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,500
产科医生是吗
Obstetrics, huh?

501
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,520
真想知道那是怎样的感觉
I wonder what that must have been like.

502
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,490
把那些美丽的小天使带到尘世间来
Bringing all them beautiful little angels into the world.

503
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:58,130
我是说那么多奇迹发生时你都能在场见证
I mean just to be present for so many miracles.

504
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:03,110
结果那些婴儿都长大变成了僵尸也真令人痛心
Yeah, it's a bummer all those babies grew up to be zombies.

505
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,280
你知道吗
You know,

506
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,740
我在外头有个孩子
I got a kid out there somewhere.

507
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,690
我从没告诉过其它人
I never told anybody that before.

508
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,430
我十九岁就有的他
I had him when I was 19.

509
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,740
当时我太年轻了
Too young.

510
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,210
应该陪他长大的时候我都不怎么在他身边
Wasn't really around for him like I should've been.

511
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,420
从没能真正了解他
Never really got to know him.

512
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,170
我一直在告诉自己
Kept telling myself maybe you know

513
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:32,120
或许某一天我会和他通个电话
someday I...I would just call him up.

514
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,460
来弥补我没能陪伴他的时光
Make up for lost time.

515
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,280
逝去的时光  逝去的时光
Lost time. Lost time.

516
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,580
我甚至都不知道他是死是活
And I don't even know if he's alive or dead.

517
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,460
救命呀
Help!

518
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,920
救命呀
Help!

519
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,440
来人啊
Somebody!

520
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,160
有人吗
Anybody!

521
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,040
救命
Help!

522
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,100
在增援部队抵达之前
Bravo Company must hold their positions

523
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,680
B连队必须要挺住
until the reinforcements arrive.

524
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,750
一旦他们的前线崩溃
If their line is broken,

525
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,300
就再也无法阻止受感染者
there's nothing to stop the infected

526
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,290
从本地向海洋移动了
between here and the ocean.

527
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,520
你告诉那个中校
You tell that wing commander

528
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,610
要是他不能马上安排飞机起飞
if he doesn't get those planes in the air right now

529
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,730
我就要亲自去他那里
I'm gonna come down there personally

530
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,730
把他的脑袋从肩膀上卸下来
and tear his head off his shoulders

531
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,170
用他鲜血淋漓的头骨把那群僵尸给揍趴下
and beat the damn zombie horde to death with his bloody skull.

532
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,910
看看这些送上门来的家伙们
What do we have here?

533
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:30,500
屡教不改的人真是不听话啊
Insubordinate curs can't take no for an answer?

534
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,380
我们走着瞧吧
We'll see about that, eh?

535
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,520
电梯怎么不动了  发生什么事了
Why aren't we moving? What's going on?

536
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,760
行了  你们都冷静下
All right, everyone needs to relax.

537
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,390
别想糊弄我们
Don't mess with us.

538
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,320
我没在糊弄你  伙计
I'm not messing with you, man.

539
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,480
一旦出事  第一个受死的就是你
Anything happens, you'll be the first to go.

540
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,180
我没法再待在这里了
I got to get out of here!

541
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,190
摩菲  别出去
Murphy! No!

542
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,320
不要开枪
Don't fire!

543
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,430
早知道我抽那个家伙时下手就该再狠点
I should have slapped that fool harder.

544
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,500
摩菲
Murphy!

545
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,560
摩菲
Murphy!

546
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,160
摩菲  摩菲
Murphy! Murphy!

547
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,710
行了沃伦  你跟我来
All right Warren, you come with me.

548
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,120
你们在这里等他
You guys stay here in case he comes back.

549
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,090
了解
Got it.

550
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,170
你们还好吗
You okay?

551
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,680
我们出去吧
Let's get out of here.

552
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,000
伙计
Dude,

553
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,740
你真的开始让我觉得反胃了
you're really starting to marsh my mellow.

554
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:16,120
我一小时前就该用你了
Well I coulda used you about an hour ago.

555
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,610
听着伙计
Look, man.

556
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,500
跟你在一起挺愉快
It's been fun,

557
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,260
不过我觉得该让你归西了
but I think it's time you go home now.

558
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,750
你开始吓着我了  伙计
You're starting to creep me out, man.

559
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,470
我们做个了断吧
Let's just get this over with.

560
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,420
摩根·亨利医生
Doctor Morgan Henley.

561
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,320
我仁慈地结束你的生命
I give you mercy.

562
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,230
好了
Okay.

563
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,680
行了
There.

564
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,990
现在我该怎么出去呢
Now how am I gonna get out of here?

565
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,860
沃伦
Warren!

566
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,590
救命  有人吗
Help! Somebody!

567
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,640
多克  多克
Doc? Doc?

568
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,670
有人吗
Anybody!

569
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,070
多克  是你吗
Doc, is that you?

570
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,860
摩菲
Murphy?

571
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,040
摩菲  是你吗
Murphy, is that you?

572
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,450
撑住  多克
Hang in there, Doc.

573
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,100
会有人来救你的
Someone will come help you.

574
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,990
不过不是我
Just not me.

575
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,560
{\an8}禁区

576
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,040
我的弹药用光了
I'm out of ammo.

577
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,080
我也是
Me too.

578
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,340
瞧瞧这是谁啊
Well look who.

579
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,450
我想他们是最后几个了
I think that's the last of them.

580
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,980
大家都没事吧
Is everybody okay?

581
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,850
有人看到摩菲了吗
Anybody seen Murphy?

582
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,060
摩菲  摩菲
Murphy! Murphy!

583
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,750
别喊了  我在这
You don't have to shout. I'm right here.

584
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,300
你接近人的时候别鬼鬼祟祟地行吗
You don't sneak up on people

585
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,430
现在是僵尸时代
in the zombie apocalypse, okay?

586
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,600
对不起  我错了
Sorry, sorry.

587
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,550
我知道多克在哪儿
I know where Doc is.

588
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,480
哪里
Where?

589
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,300
我的天哪
Holy shit.

590
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:01,660
我没子弹了
I'm out of ammo.

591
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,760
我也是
Me too.

592
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,500
我有这个
I got this.

593
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,640
加内特
Garnett!

594
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,240
趴下
Take cover!

595
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,710
不

596
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,320
不
No!

597
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,300
大家没事吧
Is everybody okay?

598
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,670
没事
Yeah.

599
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,510
摩菲  多克在哪里
Murphy, where's Doc?

600
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,780
他就在通风井里面
He was down that air shaft.

601
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,000
什么
What?

602
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,780
我们去找直升机吧
Let's go find that helicopter

603
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,300
然后离开这里
and get out of here.

604
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,020
走吧
Now.

605
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,260
总统女士  无意冒犯
No disrespect Madame President,

606
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,560
不过你都没法好好带着一群幼儿园的孩子
but you're not fit to lead a gang of kindergartners

607
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,890
打泥巴仗
in a dirt clod war.

608
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:48,200
更别想在这国难深重之时统领国家
Let alone this great nation in a moment of grave national peril

609
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,120
就像现在我们都处于水深火热之中
like we find ourselves in now.

610
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,520
我一直等着你们呢
I've been waiting for you.

611
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,380
啊  垃圾
Ah, crap.

612
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,450
没有一件有用的
Nothing works anymore.

613
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,770
都没用
Nothing.

614
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,070
你们究竟想要什么
What do you people want anyway?

615
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,290
我们正在执行一项有可能拯救人类的任务
We're on a mission that just might save the human race.

616
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,980
这个人的血液中有抗体
This man has antibodies in his blood

617
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,810
能用来制造僵尸疫苗
needed to make a zombie vaccine.

618
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,060
我们负责把他护送到
We've been tasked with getting him

619
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,540
加利福尼亚的疾病控制中心研究所
to a CDC lab in California.

620
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,090
要活的
Alive.

621
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,600
我们需要你的直升机
We need your helicopter.

622
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,670
见鬼  你们怎么不早说
Well hell, why didn't you say so sooner?

623
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,370
我亲自开直升机带你们去
I'll fly you there myself.

624
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,910
她很漂亮  对吧
She's beautiful, isn't she?

625
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,580
怎么回事  你在开玩笑吗
What is this, some kind of joke?

626
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,930
她的确需要好好维修一下了
Sure, she needs a little maintenance.

627
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,850
不过
But,

628
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,820
只要细心呵护她
with some TLC,

629
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,980
再帮忙给她找来一些零件
a little help scrounging a few spare parts,

630
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,770
我很快就会把你们送到加利福尼亚的
I'll have you to California in no time.

631
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:59,890
混蛋
Jackass!

632
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:02,450
我的朋友就为了这一堆垃圾送了命
A friend of mine died trying to get to that pile of junk.

633
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,730
你跟多克是朋友
You and Doc were friends?

634
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,110
我们一起玩过牌...  一次
We played cards...once.

635
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,920
这是战争  小子
This is war, son.

636
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,660
我们都失去过朋友
We've all lost friends.

637
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,290
妈的  我认识的所有人都死了
Hell, everybody I ever knew is dead.

638
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,970
我怎么就不吃惊呢
Why am I not surprised?

639
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,130
知道吗  我可不喜欢你
You know I don't like you.

640
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,170
那请先排个队
Well get in line.

641
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,390
麦坎德斯将军
General McCandles.

642
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,450
长官
Sir.

643
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,750
谢谢  但我想我们还是另想办法运送吧
Thank you, but I think we'll find alternate transportation.

644
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,740
你们觉得我疯了  是不是
You think I'm insane, don't you?

645
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,170
也许我的确是疯了
Well maybe I am.

646
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,070
死了那么多人
Too much death.

647
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:37,020
很多人英年早逝
Too many good men sent to an early grave.

648

那么多僵尸

649
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,920
后退  我来对付
Stand down! I got this!

650
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,220
来啊  你们这些蔑视上帝的吃脑蠢货
Come here you Godless brain eating scum!

651
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,570
咱们地狱见啦
I'll see you in Hell!

652
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,020
多克呢
What happened to Doc?

653
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:16,890
他没挺过来
He didn't make it.

654
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,730
有僵尸
Zombies.

655
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,310

斯蒂文·多克·贝克

660
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:54,160
我仁慈地结束你的生命
I give you mercy.

661
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,940
搞什么鬼  沃伦
What the hell, Warren?

662
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,510
你这是要杀我吗
You trying to kill me?

663
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,160
你还活着吗
You're alive?

664
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,030
废他妈话  我活好好的
Damn straight I'm alive.

665
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,170
我们以为你死了
We thought you were dead.

666
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,770
哥也这么以为呢
Well so did I.

667
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,400
不知哪个傻瓜往我被困的通风道
Some numbskull threw a grenade

668
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,810
扔了颗手雷
in the air shaft I was stuck in.

669
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,290
赶紧过来吧
Well hurry up!

亲一个  宝贝

好吧  我也不想再烦你了

Here's a song for all the lonely people out there,

686
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,600
这首歌写得是关于那些还活着的人
which is just about everybody that's left.

687
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,830
所以如果在大灾变中  有朋友陪伴着你
So if you've got somebody to go through the Apocalypse with,

688
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,390
你一定要好好掩护他

689

因为所剩的人已经不多了
Cuz there ain't many of us left.

是的

I've been thinking about what you told me about your dad

699
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,750
还有  你希望他知道你做了正确的事
and how you wished he knew you did the right thing

700
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,040
信守承诺  仁慈地结束他的生命
giving him mercy like you promised.

701
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,240
所以呢

我只想让你明白

他也知道你做得对

705
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,990
你信守了承诺

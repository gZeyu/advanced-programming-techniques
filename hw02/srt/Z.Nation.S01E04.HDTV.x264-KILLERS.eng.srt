{\an8}{\pos(150.4,193.188)}.

19
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,350
Previously on Z Nation.

20
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,620
Those are zombie bites.

21
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:04,680
Eight of them.

22
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,610
If we can get him to the lab in California,

23
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,250
they can use his blood and make more of the vaccine.

24
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,390
Shoot him!

25
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,150
You're that sharp shooter that saved my ass, aren't you?

26
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,040
So what's your name, kid?

27
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,480
Ten Thousand.

28
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,820
Does it mean anything?

29
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,460
How many zombies I'm going to kill.

30
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,510
One thousand fifty-nine.

31
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,230
One thousand sixty!

32
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,420
Nice shot, kid!

34
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,190
Amish zombies.

35
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,290
Really?

36
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,140
Really?

37
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,520
They tried to quarantine themselves

38
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,990
from the rest of society.

39
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,810
Keep the Zs from spreading the infection.

40
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,070
That was before we knew Romero had it right.

41
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,460
We were all carrying the virus.

42
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,070
Didn't matter who you were or how you died.

43
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,750
Night of the Living Dead. Great movie, sucky reality.

44
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,730
You know what I don't get, If the Zs didn't spread the virus,

45
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,480
how did we all get infected?

46
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,090
Best guess I heard, it was spread by birds.

47
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,130
Some kind of parasite piggybacked on the bird flu.

48
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,450
Stays dormant 'till you die.

49
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,160
You know

50
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,580
take it from somebody who knows first hand.

51
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,220
Other than the fact that they find brains delicious,

52
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,300
when it comes to zombies nobody knows nothin'.

53
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,550
My turn.

54
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,480
Have we just met?

55
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,660
Thank you.

56
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,580
Hey, hurry up.

57
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,100
I want to get past DC before dark.

58
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,070
I'm tellin' ya, there ain't nothin' there.

60
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,940
No thoughts, no memories.

61
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,840
No soul.

62
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,090
Nothin'.

63
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,500
Well they're not dead.

64
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,620
They want something.

65
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,770
Yeah. Brains.

66
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,520
You can't want something if you're not conscious,

67
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,800
if you don't have a soul.

68
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,610
When my pa was wounded,

69
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,550
he told me to tie him up before he turned.

70
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,990
Made me promise to show him mercy when he died.

71
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,770
Kill the brain, you know?

72
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,190
I couldn't do it.

73
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,800
I couldn't hurt my pa,

74
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,790
no matter what he'd become.

75
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,300
I stared into his eyes for the longest time, just

76
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,080
looking for some sign he was still in there.

77
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,560
Did you see anything?

78
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,590
What did you do?

79
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,720
I killed it.

80
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,760
Damn, kid.

81
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,620
You had to put down your own dad?

82
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,030
Didn't kill him.

83
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,510
Killed it.

84
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,190
But if it's not alive, how did you kill it?

85
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,220
Piked it.

86
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,680
Right here. My first kill.

87
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,380
I always wish he knew, you know,

88
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,890
somehow knew that I kept my promise.

89
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,670
Humans! Six o'clock!

90
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,420
I see them.

91
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,100
Is that more of your cannibal friends?

92
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,060
No. Something else.

93
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,950
Up ahead!

94
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,870
Where's he going?

95
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,600
Hey! Kid!

96
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,260
What do you think?

97
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,580
Plow right through?

98
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,480
No, I don't want to wreck the truck again.

99
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,890
Let's pike them and be on our way.

100
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,640
Oh what, are we having a little mercy party?

101
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,740
Hey, let's do this quietly.

102
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,340
There might be more of them nearby.

103
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,690
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

104
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,820
Something's wrong.

105
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,240
Yeah, she's right. Look at their feet.

106
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,540
Hold it right there!

107
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,030
All right, now drop your weapons

108
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,550
or die

109
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,370
right where you stand.

110
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,090
Put down the weapons

111
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,340
or eat brains.

112
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,230
God, I love that kid.

113
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,100
Now, we just want the vehicle.

114
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,580
All right?

115
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,360
So give us the truck

116
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,870
and we'll let you live to die another day.

117
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,770
Give them the truck!

118
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,940
Don't give them a goddamn thing!

119
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,650
Do the math Garnett.

120
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,390
We have other priorities.

121
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,370
Get them the damn truck.

122
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,490
Listen to your friend there.

123
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,730
Nobody wants to die.

124
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,020
But we're taking that truck.

125
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,800
Say the word, Garnett.

126
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,170
Let them have it.

127
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,090
The truck.

128
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,020
Let them have the truck.

129
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,840
Smart move.

130
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,400
All right guys, let's go!

131
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,560
And leave the junker!

132
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,420
They're not gonna get very far.

133
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,370
Murphy.

134
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,860
Beautiful.

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,390
That would be me.

Facebook, Friendster, Twitter, Tinder.

165
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,840
A regular trip down memory lane.

I mean, status unknown.

175
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,240
What a tomato.

176
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,410
What?

177
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,050
No offense babe, but you need a bath.

178
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,430
Do I?

179
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,070
Yeah.

180
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,530
Oh, okay. Yeah, when was the last time

181
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,580
you changed your underwear goat-boy?

182
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,260
What underwear?

183
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,780
Y'all see that?

184
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,900
That's them, all right.

185
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,220
Bastards.

186
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,510
Looks like they're trying to rob some poor family this time.

187
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,570
Not if I have anything to say about it. Come on.

188
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,120
Would it matter at all if I said don't do this?

189
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,640
Drop your weapons on the ground

190
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,450
or the first shot takes your head off.

191
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,290
You heard the man. Drop your weapons.

192
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,760
Now.

193
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,250
What's this?

194
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,450
A robbery.

195
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,430
Drop your weapons.

196
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,250
Now.

197
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,880
I don't want to have to kill you.

198
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,030
Never get out of the boat.

199
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,170
Yo, can't this thing go any faster?

200
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,540
I'm gonna die of old age before we get to California.

201
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,360
You can always get out and push.

202
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,250
No, not me, sister. I'm special.

203
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,840
Talking to you makes me wonder

204
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,060
about this whole saving humanity thing.

205
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,830
Stop the car!

206
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,160
Oh, it's the family.

207
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,570
We got to get off this road.

208
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,850
To update today's top storys:

209
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,840
absolutley nothing new is going on

210
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,720
in this decimated world of ours.

211
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,440
It's the same desperation, the same devastation

212
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,600
everywhere you look.

213
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,850
And who the hell keeps posting all these cat videos?

214
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,690
We should have known piano playing kittens

215
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,390
was a harbinger of the Apocalypse.

217
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,640
Quiet!

218
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,270
This is Sergeant Charles Garnett calling Northern Light.

219
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,990
Charles Garnett calling Northern Light.

220
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,290
Come in, Northern Light.

221
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,700
Can you read me? Citizen Z, are you there? Over.

222
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,510
Yes, this is Northern Light for Garnett.

223
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,050
Citizen Z hitting you back. Go for Garnett.

224
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:37,440
Thank God. We've been trying to make this work for hours.

225
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,910
What are you broadcasting on?

226
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,610
Uh, Clowny the french fry guy.

227
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,320
One of our team, Carver jerry-rigged a drive-thru camera

228
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,190
Addy Carver?

229
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,540
Yeah.

230
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,230
Is she there? I wanna say hi.

231
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,630
Oh, okay.

232
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,830
Hi, Addy.

233
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,010
Hey.

234
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,900
How's it going down there?

235
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,710
Ummm, it's pretty eff'd up actually.

236
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,770
How's it going wherever you are?

237
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,120
Aww you know, same ol' same ol'.

238
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,990
Busy keeping an eye on the world.

239
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,570
What can I do for you folks?

240
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,090
Can we get a chocolate shake and fries for ten thousand men?

241
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,600
Could we please get on with this before the Zs find us?

242
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,800
Wait. Is that Murphy?

243
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,870
Outstanding.

244
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,580
Glad to see you're still alive, sir.

245
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,830
Yeah but he won't be for long if we don't get off this highway.

246
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,730
We're in desperate need of alternate transpo.

247
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,790
We're looking for an airplane or a chopper or a hot air balloon.

248
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,770
Anything airborne.

249
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,600
There is one thing.

250
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,790
I've been monitoring some random transmissions

251
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,530
from what's left of the

252
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,870
Emergency Headquarters for Infection Control.

253
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,030
I can hear them, but they don't respond when I reply.

254
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,360
And it's pretty garbled.

255
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,930
General McCandles might still be holed up there.

256
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,470
You're in luck.

257
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,960
I have a visual confirmation on that chopper.

258
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,270
It looks like it's still there.

259
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,200
Where is it?

260
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,810
McLean, Virginia.

261
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,400
Twenty clicks due west of Washington DC.

262
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,480
Look for a high-rise with structural damage

263
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,590
and a chopper on the roof.

264
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,670
Now that's a hundred miles south from here.

265
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,080
We're going west, not south.

266
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,700
- West. - Do you want to get off the road or not?

267
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,370
Puppies and kittens!

268
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,200
We gotta go.

269
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,330
Bye, Addison.

270
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,780
Call me when you get there.

272
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,240
Not exactly what I was hoping for.

273
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,810
One of these days you're gonna learn to quit hoping for things.

274
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:53,930
You better hope not

275
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,080
cuz that's when we leave your ass at the side of the road.

276
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,130
Halt! Who goes there!

277
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,280
Sergeant Charles Garnett, National Guard.

278
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,840
This is Lieutenant Roberta Warren,

279
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,290
- State your business. - Also National Guard.

280
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,420
We're on a high priority mission

281
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,430
to get this man to a CDC lab in California.

282
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,330
We were sent here by an Intell Officer from the NSA

283
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,860
to see General McCandles.

284
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,740
We need his help finding transpo.

285
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,660
We were told he has a helicopter.

286
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,390
Yeah, he's got a chopper.

287
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,790
But General McCandles is a very busy man.

288
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,530
He's got the entire east coast under his command.

289
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,650
He can't worry about some raggedy ass group of civilians

290
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,110
on a suicide mission.

291
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,240
I suggest you move on before the infected find you.

292
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,910
Nothing raggedy ass about this group of civilians, sir.

293
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,620
And this man has important information

294
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,060
about a vaccine for the zombie virus.

295
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,180
He smells like a damn Z.

296
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,520
You don't smell so good yourself, septic tank.

297
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,010
You gonna help us or not?

298
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,860
You want to see the General?

299
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,520
You're going to have to pay a tribute.

300
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,860
Gesture of goodwill to show him you're serious.

301
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,080
What kind of tribute you have in mind?

302
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,370
Our medic has been MIA over a year.

303
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,960
We need painkillers. Antibiotics.

304
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,510
Anything you got.

305
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,980
I'll get my bag.

306
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,840
I got aspirin, tetracycline, cipro.

307
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,920
That should knock out most any infection.

308
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,270
And oxycontin.

309
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,500
The oxy. We need painkillers.

310
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,760
You want to see the General or not?

311
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,820
This is the last of our supply.

312
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,620
That'll do.

313
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,300
The General will see you now.

314
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,660
Why are you wasting my time?

315
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,480
General McCandles, sir.

316
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,470
We have a National Guard unit and several civilians

317
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,030
requesting permission to speak to you.

318
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,400
Is sweet Jesus with them?

319
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,610
No, sir.

320
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,740
- Then tell them to go to hell! - I don't believe so.

321
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,370
I've got a war to fight! Where's that close air support I ordered?

322
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,610
Tell the Admiral I need those subs in position by 0800.

323
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,200
Bravo Company, hold your position at all costs.

324
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,170
Repeat, all costs.

325
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,980
You heard the General.

326
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,740
General McCandles, sir.

327
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,140
We're on a mission of extreme importance

328
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,160
by direct order from the president.

329
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,750
It's imperative that we find air transport

330
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,680
-to Mt. Wilson CDC lab - Sorry, I'm busy.

331
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,290
in California.

332
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,900
Where are my reinforcements?

333
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,450
You heard the man. Time to go.

334
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,620
That's it?

335
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,760
I've a good mind to make you barf up my oxycontin.

336
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,570
Doc! Doc! Stand down!

337
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,930
Did you say Doc? As in doctor?

338
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,850
Yeah, our team includes a medical doctor.

339
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,470
Why didn't you say so? Send him up.

340
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,040
I have a wounded man in need of medical attention.

341
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,810
Just the doctor. The rest of you wait here.

342
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,810
I got this.

343
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,190
All right.

344
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,070
Hey, hey, hey. Talk to him about the chopper.

345
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,620
Son of a bitch.

346
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,250
I was saving that oxy

347
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,220
for a party when we got to Cali.

348
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,680
You the medic?

349
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,110
I am indeed.

350
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,100
You the General?

351
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,490
General Arthur C. McCandles.

352
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,110
Commander, Central Command,

353
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,870
Infection Response Forces.

354
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,740
Where's your wounded man?

355
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,840
Right here.

356
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,620
It's not a bite.

357
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,260
This looks bad.

358
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,590
Real bad.

359
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,180
It's just a scratch.

360
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,980
No, that's... that's more like gangrene.

361
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,770
Can you save the leg?

362
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,520
I'm afraid not, General.

363
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,260
It's already starting to spread.

364
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,730
Soon the Z virus will take over.

365
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,750
All I can do at this point is show you mercy

366
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,890
when the time comes.

367
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,540
You call that a diagnosis?

368
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,110
I call it the truth.

369
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,230
You're gonna die.

370
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,300
And soon.

371
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,630
That's what the last guy said.

372
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,510
Look who.

373
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,580
What do you think, pup?

374
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,170
Could we use another friend?

375
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,480
My thoughts exactly.

376
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,030
That was quick.

377
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,080
How are things at the North Pole?

378
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,020
Awesome. Beautiful Aurora today.

379
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,640
How's your day going?

380
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,460
Kinda lonely. Nice to have somebody to talk to.

381
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,390
I know the feeling. Gets lonely here too.

382
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,600
Keeping an eye on the planet keeps you busy though.

383
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,510
I feel safer just knowing you're there.

384
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,080
You seem so cool.

385
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,130
I wish I could meet you in person.

386
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,970
Super busy, but I'm sure that could be arranged.

387
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,830
What are you doing right now?

388
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,350
Aww you know.

389
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,110
Same ol', same ol'.

390
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,380
One thousand ninety.

391
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,120
One thousand ninety-one.

392
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,260
One thousand and ninety-two.

393
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,720
Okay, what's going on with Doc?

394
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,570
Guys, if we don't get out of here soon

395
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,500
this could get ugly.

396
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,800
Oh, you mean uglier.

397
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,750
Do you hear that?

398
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,300
Hear what?

399
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,410
I don't hear anything.

400
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,710
Sounds like Doc.

401
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,970
Make it stop!

402
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,330
Make it stop!

403
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,420
That's Doc all right. But where the hell is he?

404
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,430
Somewhere up there.

405
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,940
We're going up after him.

406
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,440
No, you don't.

407
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,520
Let us up now.

408
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,820
Nobody goes upstairs without the General's orders.

409
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,860
We go up now

410
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,350
or I scramble your egg-brain inside the shell.

411
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,720
You'll be sorry.

412
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,920
So will you cuz you're coming up with us.

413
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,480
10K! Cover our flank.

414
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,270
Don't let man or zombie follow us up.

415
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,620
Yes, sir.

416
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,150
One thousand ninety-three.

417
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,830
No.

418
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,410
Ninety-four.

419
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,980
What floor is the General on?

420
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,040
Top floor.

421
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,080
He's the General, man.

422
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,930
What floor do you think he's on?

423
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,140
My world is but an illusion.

424
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,200
My world is but an illusion.

425
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,400
Oh God, why didn't I pay better attention

426
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,610
to that sweet little Buddhist chick I dated?

427
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,300
Stay calm.

428
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,260
I'm sure they're...

429
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,590
I'm sure they're watching you right now.

430
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,860
They're looking for you.

431
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,850
They're looking for you right now.

432
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,890
There's no way they'd just leave you here

433
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:43,790
trapped in the air shaft with an ugly-ass zombie

434
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,100
waiting to eat my face off!

435
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,870
Oh, wait.

436
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,310
Oh, that's more like it.

437
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,420
I was saving this for a special occasion.

438
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,190
Like now.

439
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,480
Come on, suck it up.

440
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,770
Come on. Come on.

441
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,090
That's good shit, man.

442
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,340
Chill!

443
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,720
Help!

444
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,390
Now what?

445
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,940
Be ready for anything.

446
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,600
Did I mention that

447
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,150
the one thing I have a phobia of aside

448
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,170
from zombies is elevators.

449
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,110
Shouldn't have messed with the General.

450
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,690
Is it getting hot in here?

451
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,800
Hey, come on. Open the damn door.

452
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,590
I got to get out of here.

453
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,570
Relax, Murphy.

454
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,030
No, no, I got to get out. There's not enough oxygen.

455
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,230
Chill out!

456
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:55,730
Mack!

457
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,660
I'm here, babe.

458
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,490
Hey, why aren't we moving?

459
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,450
It'll start in a second.

460
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,650
Thank you, son.

461
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,730
It's good.

462
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,380
Can I do anything for you?

463
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,280
Make sure those knots are tight.

464
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,820
It's not gonna be long now.

465
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,900
It's double-half-hitch. Just like you taught me.

466
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,280
Just be sure.

467
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,170
Promise me

468
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,000
you'll do what we talked about

469
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,070
when the time comes.

470
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,540
Promise me.

471
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,220
I promise.

472
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,430
Just like we talked about.

473
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,180
I swear.

474
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,020
Don't swear.

475
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,930
Your mother never liked that.

476
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,500
I promise.

477
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,480
Good.

478
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,480
I could always trust you to do the right thing.

479
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,540
You're a good boy.

480
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,880
Your mother,

481
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,980
she'd be proud of the man you're growing up to be.

482
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,690
Give me another puff.

483
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,380
Will ya?

484
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,480
Ya know, now don't take offense.

485
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:35,420
But the only thing worse than that mug of yours

486
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,320
is your breath.

487
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,060
Not my fingers, you animal!

488
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,060
I was offering you the last hit.

489
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,130
Well, fine. I'll bogart it myself then.

490
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,820
A thousand and one uses, I tell ya.

491
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,770
Well I'll be damned.

492
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,620
I think you're stoned.

493
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,400
Hell, we don't need a vaccine.

494
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:13,230
Just need a few billion tons of some primo Ganja,

495
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,550
and the world would be just fine.

496
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,150
Doctor Morgan Henley.

497
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,910
Does that name ring a bell

498
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:37,400
in any of those cannabinol soaked brain cells you have left?

499
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,870
I must be really stoned.

500
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,500
Obstetrics, huh?

501
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,520
I wonder what that must have been like.

502
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,490
Bringing all them beautiful little angels into the world.

503
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:58,130
I mean just to be present for so many miracles.

504
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:03,110
Yeah, it's a bummer all those babies grew up to be zombies.

505
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,280
You know,

506
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,740
I got a kid out there somewhere.

507
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,690
I never told anybody that before.

508
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,430
I had him when I was 19.

509
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,740
Too young.

510
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,210
Wasn't really around for him like I should've been.

511
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,420
Never really got to know him.

512
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,170
Kept telling myself maybe you know

513
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:32,120
someday I...I would just call him up.

514
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,460
Make up for lost time.

515
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,280
Lost time. Lost time.

516
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,580
And I don't even know if he's alive or dead.

517
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,460
Help!

518
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,920
Help!

519
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,440
Somebody!

520
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,160
Anybody!

521
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,040
Help!

522
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,100
Bravo Company must hold their positions

523
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,680
until the reinforcements arrive.

524
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,750
If their line is broken,

525
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,300
there's nothing to stop the infected

526
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,290
between here and the ocean.

527
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,520
You tell that wing commander

528
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,610
if he doesn't get those planes in the air right now

529
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,730
I'm gonna come down there personally

530
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,730
and tear his head off his shoulders

531
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,170
and beat the damn zombie horde to death with his bloody skull.

532
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,910
What do we have here?

533
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:30,500
Insubordinate curs can't take no for an answer?

534
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,380
We'll see about that, eh?

535
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,520
Why aren't we moving? What's going on?

536
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,760
All right, everyone needs to relax.

537
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,390
Don't mess with us.

538
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,320
I'm not messing with you, man.

539
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,480
Anything happens, you'll be the first to go.

540
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,180
I got to get out of here!

541
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,190
Murphy! No!

542
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,320
Don't fire!

543
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,430
I should have slapped that fool harder.

544
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,500
Murphy!

545
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,560
Murphy!

546
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,160
Murphy! Murphy!

547
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,710
All right Warren, you come with me.

548
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,120
You guys stay here in case he comes back.

549
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,090
Got it.

550
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,170
You okay?

551
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,680
Let's get out of here.

552
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,000
Dude,

553
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,740
you're really starting to marsh my mellow.

554
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:16,120
Well I coulda used you about an hour ago.

555
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,610
Look, man.

556
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,500
It's been fun,

557
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,260
but I think it's time you go home now.

558
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,750
You're starting to creep me out, man.

559
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,470
Let's just get this over with.

560
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,420
Doctor Morgan Henley.

561
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,320
I give you mercy.

562
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,230
Okay.

563
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,680
There.

564
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,990
Now how am I gonna get out of here?

565
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,860
Warren!

566
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,590
Help! Somebody!

567
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,640
Doc? Doc?

568
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,670
Anybody!

569
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,070
Doc, is that you?

570
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,860
Murphy?

571
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,040
Murphy, is that you?

572
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,450
Hang in there, Doc.

573
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,100
Someone will come help you.

574
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,990
Just not me.

576
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,040
I'm out of ammo.

577
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,080
Me too.

578
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,340
Well look who.

579
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,450
I think that's the last of them.

580
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,980
Is everybody okay?

581
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,850
Anybody seen Murphy?

582
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,060
Murphy! Murphy!

583
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,750
You don't have to shout. I'm right here.

584
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,300
You don't sneak up on people

585
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,430
in the zombie apocalypse, okay?

586
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,600
Sorry, sorry.

587
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,550
I know where Doc is.

588
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,480
Where?

589
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,300
Holy shit.

590
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:01,660
I'm out of ammo.

591
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,760
Me too.

592
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,500
I got this.

593
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,640
Garnett!

594
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,240
Take cover!

595
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,710
No!

596
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,320
No!

597
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,300
Is everybody okay?

598
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,670
Yeah.

599
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,510
Murphy, where's Doc?

600
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,780
He was down that air shaft.

601
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,000
What?

602
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,780
Let's go find that helicopter

603
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,300
and get out of here.

604
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,020
Now.

605
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,260
No disrespect Madame President,

606
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,560
but you're not fit to lead a gang of kindergartners

607
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,890
in a dirt clod war.

608
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:48,200
Let alone this great nation in a moment of grave national peril

609
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,120
like we find ourselves in now.

610
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,520
I've been waiting for you.

611
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,380
Ah, crap.

612
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,450
Nothing works anymore.

613
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,770
Nothing.

614
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,070
What do you people want anyway?

615
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,290
We're on a mission that just might save the human race.

616
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,980
This man has antibodies in his blood

617
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,810
needed to make a zombie vaccine.

618
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,060
We've been tasked with getting him

619
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,540
to a CDC lab in California.

620
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,090
Alive.

621
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,600
We need your helicopter.

622
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,670
Well hell, why didn't you say so sooner?

623
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,370
I'll fly you there myself.

624
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,910
She's beautiful, isn't she?

625
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,580
What is this, some kind of joke?

626
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,930
Sure, she needs a little maintenance.

627
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,850
But,

628
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,820
with some TLC,

629
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,980
a little help scrounging a few spare parts,

630
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,770
I'll have you to California in no time.

631
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:59,890
Jackass!

632
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:02,450
A friend of mine died trying to get to that pile of junk.

633
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,730
You and Doc were friends?

634
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,110
We played cards...once.

635
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,920
This is war, son.

636
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,660
We've all lost friends.

637
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,290
Hell, everybody I ever knew is dead.

638
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,970
Why am I not surprised?

639
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,130
You know I don't like you.

640
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,170
Well get in line.

641
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,390
General McCandles.

642
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,450
Sir.

643
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,750
Thank you, but I think we'll find alternate transportation.

644
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,740
You think I'm insane, don't you?

645
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,170
Well maybe I am.

646
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,070
Too much death.

647
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:37,020
Too many good men sent to an early grave.

648
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,080
Too many zombies.

649
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,920
Stand down! I got this!

650
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,220
Come here you Godless brain eating scum!

651
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,570
I'll see you in Hell!

652
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,020
What happened to Doc?

653
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:16,890
He didn't make it.

654
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,730
Zombies.

655
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,310
Oh God, is that...

656
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,500
It's Doc.

657
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:41,940
Someone's gotta...

658
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,060
I'll do it.

659
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,580
Steven "Doc" Beck.

660
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:54,160
I give you mercy.

661
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,940
What the hell, Warren?

662
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,510
You trying to kill me?

663
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,160
You're alive?

664
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,030
Damn straight I'm alive.

665
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,170
We thought you were dead.

666
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,770
Well so did I.

667
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,400
Some numbskull threw a grenade

668
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,810
in the air shaft I was stuck in.

669
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,290
Well hurry up!

670
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:23,850
Here.

671
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:24,890
Come on.

672
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,720
Give me a kiss, baby.

673
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,190
Well I should let you go.

674
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,740
I'm sure you're busy with

675
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,620
keeping an eye on the world and all.

676
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,860
Yeah.

677
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,680
I got a hungry dog here I better go feed.

678
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,750
Nice talking to you.

679
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,060
I hope we get to meet someday.

680
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,220
I'd really like that.

681
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,660
Good night.

682
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,080
Sweet prince.

684
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,990
Good night, fair lady.

685
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,310
Here's a song for all the lonely people out there,

686
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,600
which is just about everybody that's left.

687
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,830
So if you've got somebody to go through the Apocalypse with,

688
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,390
you better watch their backs.

689
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,580
Cuz there ain't many of us left.

690
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:33,860
And oh yeah,

692
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:37,810
I'd like to dedicate this song to Addison Carver,

693
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,190
wherever you are.

694
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,870
I'd like to dedicate this song to Addison Carver,

695
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,430
wherever you are.

696
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,070
I talked to the guy twice. Come on.

697
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,520
You know kid,

698
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:01,380
I've been thinking about what you told me about your dad

699
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,750
and how you wished he knew you did the right thing

700
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,040
giving him mercy like you promised.

701
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,240
Yeah?

702
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,340
Well I just want you to know

703
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,580
your dad knows what you did for him.

704
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,560
And he knows you did the right thing.

705
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,990
You kept your promise.

706
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,630
Thanks.

707
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:46,840
I'm sorry, papa.

708
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,470
I love you.

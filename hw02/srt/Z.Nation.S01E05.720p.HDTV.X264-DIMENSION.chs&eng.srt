00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,980
是活生生的宝宝
Whoa. It's a real live baby.

21
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,080
得像拿着点燃的手榴弹那样抱他  给我吧
You don't hold him like he's a live grenade. Just give him to me.

22
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,600
我对孩子没经验
Me and babies, not so much.

23
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,890
我们在执行高优先级任务
We're on a high priority mission

24
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,920
把这位先生送去加州的疾病控制中心研究所
to get this man to a CDC lab in California.

25
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,010
他无法去帮那些正在执行自杀任务的
He can't worry about some raggedy ass group of civilians

26
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,660
我们不是什么民间破烂蠢队  长官
Nothing raggedy ass about this group of civilians, sir.

27
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,650
放松
Relax,

00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,830
谢谢亲爱的
Ah, thank you, honey.

32
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,740
没什么比的上清晨的第一杯
Mmmm-mmm. Nothing like the first cup.

33
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,590
我跟你的维柯丁[止痛药]
I will see your vicodin

34
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,190
再加注一颗四环素
and raise you one tetracycline.

35
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,580
我跟
Call.

三同号[三张牌相同]
Three of a kind.

37

{\an8}手中一组三张同点和一组两张同点的一共五张牌

38
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,220
满堂红
Full house.

39
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,660
最大点的哦
Aces high.

40
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,880
有没有搞错
Man.

41
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,790
你已经连赢五把牌了
That's five hands in a row.

42
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,710
如果你还想继续用老子的牌桌玩
If you're gonna continue to use my deck

43
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,710
就别再从屁股里面变牌出来了
you need to quit pulling cards out your ass.

44
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,830
矮油  矮油
Oh boo hoo.

45
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,870
嘘  等会再说  市民Z回来了
Hey shhh. Hold on, he's back on.

46
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,800
朋友们  我要告诉你们  恶劣天气即将来袭
Friends, I'm talking about mean weather coming in fast.

47
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,170
有报告说是龙卷风
Some reports of tornados.

48
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,730
快找个避难处躲躲吧
Find shelter and take cover.

49
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,290
现在在外待着  比以往都要更为危险
It's dangerous out there. More so than usual.

50
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,910
现在让我为大家放一曲灾难当前的暖人歌曲吧
Now back to the soothing sounds of the Apocalypse.

51
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,220
你知道吗  当他搞错了直升机的事儿后
You know after he was so wrong about that chopper

52
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,640
我现在觉得天气播报员的活儿挺适合他
weatherman's a pretty good job for that geek.

53
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,920
到你们了
You're up.

54
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,800
都还好吧
All good?

55
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:53,840
和谐的一晚
Peaceful night.

56
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,920
你的死忠粉刚才告诉我们将有暴雨来袭
Your stalker said there's a storm front coming in.

57
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,100
外面现在有迹象吗
How is it out there?

58
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,290
乌云当空  僵尸可能也会来
Cloudy with a chance of zombie.

59
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,450
好的  你们俩去休息吧
Okay, you two get some rest.

60
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,050
遵命
You got it.

61
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,130
我曾过过比这更糟的日子
I've had worse days.

62
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,910
这儿也算不上差了
It's not a bad set up.

63
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,370
你知道吗
You know,

64
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,330
我还真在这儿找到了家的感觉
I'm really starting to feel at home here.

65
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,510
我考虑之后在这搞个烤肉趴
I'm thinking about putting a barbecue right here.

66
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,730
这位先需要被打扫一下了
This one needs to be flipped.

67
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,160
我真的很喜欢屋主设计的景观  还有这花啊
I really like what they did with the landscaping, the flowers,

68
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,250
一切的一切  特有家的感觉
everything. So homey.

69
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,340
是啊  可惜他们都挂了
Yeah. Too bad they're dead.

70
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,830
抱歉了  走错屋子了
Sorry. Wrong room.

71
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,370
好了
Okay.

72
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,220
哇靠  还有床呢  上一次咱俩在床上做是哪年的事儿了
Oh my God. A bed. When was the last time we did it in a bed?

73
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,350
你怎么看
What do you think?

74
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,000
裸不
Naked?

75
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,720
你说衣服都脱了吗
Like no clothes?

76
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,570
必须一丝不挂  宝贝
Full commando, baby.

77
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,720
矮油  你还真是个多情滴种子
Oh my God, you are such a romantic.

78
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,190
这个...
The...

79
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,270
毯子...
blanket...

80
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,340
我只不过看到它...
I was just...

81
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,630
不好意思
Sorry.

82
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,580
那货真可怕
Scared of that one.

83
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,470
最好别去招惹她
Best not to mess.

84
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,270
要是咱们好好培养那两位
You know if we breed those two,

85
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,180
这些僵尸们都得完蛋了
it'd be all over for the zombies.

86
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,990
我记不起上次跟人偷偷溜出来是什么时候了
Can't remember the last time I snuck off with somebody.

87
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,590
我都记不起上次有这个念头是什么时候的事了
I can't remember the last time I wanted to.

88
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,990
你还在想他吗
You still think about him?

89
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:32,990
安托万吗
Antoine?

90
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,930
我试着不去想他
I try not to.

91
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,650
而且我也不知道后来发生了什么
And I never heard what happened,

92
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,450
所以其实没什么关系
so there's not much point.

93
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,940
你呢
What about you?

94
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,070
我之前每天都会想艾米和孩子们
I used to think about Amy and the kids everyday.

95
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,800
每次闭上眼睛  分别的情景就历历在目
Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the end all over again.

96
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,810
到了一定程度  我就放弃了
It got to a certain point where I just gave up.

97
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,110
不去在乎我到底是死是活了
Didn't care if I lived or died.

98
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,970
然后有趣的事情就发生了
And a funny thing happened.

99
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,790
我没有死
I didn't die.

100
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,730
发生了这么多事
And with everything that's happened

101
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,990
我已经越来越难以回想起从前的事了
it's been harder and harder to remember the past.

102
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,950
我猜这应该算是件好事吧  对吗
I guess that's a good thing, right?

103
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,710
应该吧
Guess so.

104
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,530
我们是不是离你的家乡很近了
Are we close by your hometown?

105
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,250
我知道你在想什么  我的回答是不行
I know what you're thinking, and the answer is no.

106
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,000
咱们往西走的时候顺路去一下就好
Just swing by on our way west.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,430
为什么  都过去了
Why? It's long gone.

108
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,250
他已经不在了
He's gone.

109
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,860
我只希望我当时能等等他
And I just wish that I would've waited for him

110
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,330
能在我最后一次出发之前和他说声再见
and said goodbye before the last time I got shipped out.

111
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,420
你不想去确认一下吗
Don't you want to know for sure?

112
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,410
你自己都还不清楚的事情
You can't start forgetting 

113
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,320
不能就这么开始忘记
what you don't know.

114
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,750
这看上去可不妙
That does not look good.

115
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,270
是龙卷风
It's tornado weather.

116
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,690
听起来就在耳边啊
That was close.

117
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,740
你没事吧
Are you okay?

118
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,800
没事
Uh, yeah.

119
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,790
不
No.

120
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,950
不  我不知道
No, I dunno.

121
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,340
他们过来了
Incoming!

122
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,210
阿猫阿狗们  咱得走了
Puppies and kittens! Time to go!

123
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,880
所有人从后门出去
Everybody out the back!

124
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,750
我助你脱离苦海
I give you mercy.

125
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,250
北极光
美国国安局作战指挥中心

126
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,740
{\an8}搜索信号中

127
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,350
我讨厌通信盲点  伙计
I hate blind spots, boy.

128
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,460
让人家好紧张呢
Make me anxious.

129
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,160
紧张得消化不良了
Mess with my digestion.

130
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,760
真有趣
That was funny.

131
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,810
{\an8}搜索信号中

132
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,970
不好意思  我忘了你了
Sorry, I forgot you.

133
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,110
对了  你在戒酒
Oh that's right, you're on the wagon.

134
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,500
对不起  我又忘了
Sorry, I forgot.

135
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,540
比自饮自酌更惨的就是滴酒不能沾了
The only thing worse than drinking alone is not drinking.

136
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,600
你好  美女
Hello, beautiful.

137
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,340
咱们要找什么呢
What are we looking at here?

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,350
厉害  龙卷风走廊果然名不虚传
Dang. They don't call it Tornado Alley for nothing.

139
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,060
我没醉
I am not drunk.

140
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,680
你才醉了
You're drunk.

141
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,980
你全家都醉了
No, your mom's drunk.

142
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,900
为了持续为您带来
In our continuing effort to bring you

143
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,400
最新消息  我们僵尸电视台调用了
up to the minute information, we at Z-TV have acquired

144
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,370
已被弃用多时的
a National Weather Service satellite

145
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,130
气象局卫星信号
that they aren't using anymore.

146
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,440
但这不是本次播报的重点
But that's not important.

147
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,840
现在镜头转向南方天气预报员约翰·史密斯
We now go to John Smith, southern weather correspondent

148
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,570
请他来谈谈最近的天气状况
to get his opinion on the story.

149
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,700
这可是我这老多年见过的最强的风暴
This is the badassest storm this weatherman has ever seen.

150
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,010
从墨西哥湾一直延伸到密西西比河谷
From the Gulf of Mexico right up the Mississippi Valley,

151
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,270
麻烦临头咧
trouble is brewing.

152
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,250
我不知道这玩意儿该叫飓风还是龙卷风
I don't know if they call this thing a turricane or a tornado

153
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,770
还是别的啥  但只要你呆在芝加哥南边
or what. But if you're anywhere south of Chicago

154
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:56,750
或者落基山脉东边
or east of the Rockies,

155
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,130
我可得警告你  赶紧躲起来吧
I'm issuing a get your butt in a bunker warning.

156
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,020
我希望你们几位能听到这个
Hey, I hope you guys are getting this.

157
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,680
艾迪和其他几位
Addy and friends.

158
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,630
你们得赶紧找地方躲起来  因为
You guys got to seek shelter immediately because

159
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,620
这场风暴特别强  还有
this is bad. And

160
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,450
你们去找藏身的地方
when you seek shelter immediately

161
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,480
找到之后
and after you do that,

162
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,750
请你们联系我  告诉我你们的位置
you need to contact me and tell me where you are.

163
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,240
我会告诉你们接下来该怎么做  好吗
And I'll update you with further instructions. Okay?

164
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,790
我是市民Z  本次播音完毕
All right, well this is Citizen Z, and I'm signing off.

165
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,310
艾迪是谁啊
Who's Addy?

166
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,010
我们往哪去
So which way do we go?

167
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,600
风暴从墨西哥湾向北推进
The storm is pushing north from the gulf.

168
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,650
如果我们能走上70号州际公路
If we make it to the I-70,

169
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,400
就能躲开风暴
we can outrun it.

170
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,730
这风暴可比那破烂卡车快多了
That storm is going faster than that craptastic truck ever will.

171
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,690
我们不能在大路上走了
Yeah, we got to get off the road.

172
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,840
你听见市民Z的建议了
You heard Citizen Z.

173
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,770
我们得赶紧找庇护所去
We got to seek shelter.

174
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,450
我们要做的是赶紧离开这里
What we need is to get the hell out of here.

175
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,230
我可不会就因为个卫星小子说两句话就不走了
I ain't stopping just cuz some punk with a satellite says so.

176
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,130
慢着  我听错了什么了吗
Okay, hang on. Am I missing something?

177
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,090
你们大老远把我拽过来
You did not drag my ass this far

178
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:52,210
可不是为了让龙卷风把人类救星吸上天吧
so that mankind's hope could get sucked up by a tornado,

179
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,010
是吧
did you?

180
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,750
艾迪
Hey, Addy.

181
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,230
你一直也不说个话
You know you've been quiet.

182
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,040
我就是问问你没事吧
Just want to make sure you're okay.

183
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,180
我没事
Yeah, I'm fine.

184
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,560
就是
Just,

185
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,300
你懂的  都是僵尸惹的祸
you know, zombies.

186
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,770
谁给哥来颗薄荷糖呗
Anybody got a mint?

187
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,580
{\an8}卡斯尔波恩特  距离2英里
圣路易斯  距离62英里

188
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,200
卡斯尔波恩特  那是你家乡是吧
Castle Point. That's your hometown right?

189
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,160
我的天  看看那风暴
Whoa. Look at that storm coming in.

190
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,340
好吧  你赢了
Okay, fine. You win.

191
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,500
{\an8}欢迎来到卡斯尔波恩特

192
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,070
欢迎回家  罗伯塔
Welcome home, Roberta.

193
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,760
这么说这里你很熟了吗
So you know this town?

194
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,670
这是生我养我的地方
Born and raised here.

195
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,120
我们要避一避
We need to take cover.

196
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,810
附近有什么安全的地方吗
Is there someplace safe nearby?

197
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,630
有  我家有个防风窖
Yeah, there's a storm cellar in my house.

198
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,100
你家有多近
How close by is your house?

199
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,220
不远
It's not far.

200
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,640
我认识这些人
I knew these people.

201
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,450
有我的邻居
My neighbor.

202
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,950
我的老板
My boss.

203
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,250
我的...
My...

204
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,280
是他吗
Is that him?

205
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,550
他是谁
Who's him?

206
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,800
不是吧
Oh, no.

207
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:26,570
我们又不是来找你死掉的丈夫的
No. We are not here searching for dead hubby, are we?

208
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,480
我们走
Let's go.

209
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,380
避难所在这边
Shelter's this way.

210
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,460
走吧
Get going.

211
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,550
真绿啊
It's so green.

212
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,490
我从未见过这样的天空
I never seen a sky look like that.

213
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,630
我只在电视上看过龙卷风
I've only seen tornadoes on TV.

214
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,180
我不喜欢龙卷风
I don't like tornadoes.

215
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,350
我坚信它也不待见我
I'm pretty sure they don't like me either.

216
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,550
是你家吗
That it?

217
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,000
是的
That's it.

218
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,500
一万  过来
10K, come on!

219
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,660
来吧
Come on!

220
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,520
如果他在里面  他八成是...
If he's in there and he's...

221
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,290
我不会手下留情的
I will not hesitate.

222
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,020
甜蜜的僵尸啊
Home sweet zombie.

223
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,040
离开那把椅子
Get out of that chair!

224
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,820
起来  走开
Go on and get out of there!

225
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,700
这是我丈夫最喜爱的椅子
That's my husband's favorite chair!

226
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,760
好吧
All right.

227
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,240
楼上一切正常
Uh, upstairs is all good.

228
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,620
我来
I got this.

229
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,080
请不要开枪
Please don't shoot us.

230
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,400
我丈夫受伤了
My husband is hurt.

231
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,170
你们在我家做什么
What are you doing in my house?

232
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,910
一个消防员说我们在这会很安全
The fireman said we'd be safe here.

233
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,400
开始吧
Here we go.

234
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,770
像狗一样冲着我叫
Bark like a dog for me.

235
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,090
我不是在说你  但是我很感动
Well I wasn't talking to you, but I'm impressed.

236
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,070
天呐
God.

237
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,800
从三级风变成七层地狱了
From a Category Three to the Seventh Circle of Hell.

238
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,070
三角洲X光小队  希望你们不在这下方
Delta-Xray-Delta, I hope you guys aren't underneath that.

239
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,990
拜托  给我个信儿
Come on. Drop me a note.

240
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,150
发个信号弹  给我个电话
Send up a flare. Give me a ring.

241
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,670
找不到你们  我就帮不上忙
I can't help you if I can't find you.

242
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,050
你会没事的
You're going to be okay.

243
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,500
他是医生
He's a doctor.

244
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,890
我这医生也不过是徒有虚名而已
Well they sorta just call me Doc.

245
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:09,620
不要
No.

246
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,400
不用医生  我只是  需要睡一觉
No doctor. I just... need a nap.

247
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,710
老兄  那样可好不了
Oh that, no that wouldn't be good, dude.

248
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,290
别睡
Do not nap.

249
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,990
别让他睡过去  他至少是严重脑震荡
Don't let him fall asleep. He's got a bad concussion at least.

250
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,050
瑞克  瑞克
Rick? Rick?

251
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,580
救救他
Help him!

252
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:29,970
地下室是安全的
Basement's clear.

253
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,550
他会没事吧
Is he gonna be okay?

254
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,220
是这名消防员吗
Is this the fireman?

255
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,040
什么
What?

256
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,090
是这名消防员把你们带到这来的吗
Is this the fireman that brought you here?

257
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,130
我不知道
I don't know.

258
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,620
也许  他当时戴着头盔
Maybe. He was wearing a helmet.

259
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,140
也许是他
Maybe it's him.

260
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,000
我想是的
I think it is.

261
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,820
谢谢
Thank you.

262
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,850
我们得在风暴来袭之前离开这里
We need to get out of here before this storm hits.

263
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,100
你说去哪里
And go where, huh?

264
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,340
我们应该怎么做
What are we supposed to do,

265
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,110
就坐在这期待它错过这里吗
just sit here and hope it misses us?

266
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,800
地下室是安全的
The basement is secure.

267
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,930
我们可以待在下面安全度过
We can ride it out down there.

268
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,430
在它来袭之前我们先收集一些物资
Let's just gather some supplies before it hits.

269
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,390
厨房是个备货的好地方
Kitchen was pretty well stocked up.

270
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,870
那里有水和罐头食品
There's water and canned food.

271
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,580
但是  没有医疗用品  没有电池
No medical supplies, no batteries though.

272
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,430
我们得让通讯设备恢复使用
We need to get our communications up.

273
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,050
你们俩  去附近看看
You two, go out in the neighborhood.

274
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,840
看看能找到什么  但是别走远了
See what you can find. But don't go far.

275
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,890
确保在风暴来袭之前能够回来
Be sure to get back before the storm hits.

276
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,390
简妮  这些人在这里干什么
Janey what are all these people doing here?

277
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,810
我的父母随时都会回来吃晚饭
My parents will be home for dinner any minute.

278
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,320
他能挺得过来吗
Is he gonna make it?

279
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,330
你真的想知道吗
Is that a serious question?

280
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:47,850
我也不知道
I don't know.

281
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,310
他头部受伤了
He got cracked on the dome.

282
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,890
在他想吃大脑的时候
Okay, I for one do not

283
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,940
我不想和这个家伙
want to be trapped in a basement with this guy

284
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,820
一起被困在地下室里
when he starts craving brains.

285
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,130
别理他
Don't mind him.

286
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,270
他妈没教育好他
His mama didn't raise him right.

287
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,650
如果我有对症的药物或者急救箱
Well if I had the proper meds or a first aid kit...

288
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,530
消防站可能还有急救用品
You know the fire station may still have first aid supplies.

289
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,360
把地下室锁上
Hey, lock down the basement.

290
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,240
如果这个孩子变成了僵尸
If that kid turns,

291
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,700
我希望你能正确应对
I want you to be right on that.

292
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,600
好的  当然
Yeah, of course.

293
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,460
看着点摩菲
Keep an eye on Murphy.

294
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,470
在风暴开始前我们就会回来
We'll be back before the party starts.

295
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,160
艾迪
Addy!

296
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,630
艾迪
Addy!

297
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:40,990
什么
What?

298
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:41,910
怎么了
What?

299
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,080
什么
What?

300
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,230
这地方唤起了我的好多回忆
This place brings back so many memories.

301
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,190
怎么了
What?!

302
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,720
我的初吻
My first kiss.

303
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,110
跟那个消防员吗
With the fireman?

304
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,300
是的  安托万
Antoine, yeah.

305
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,300
小心
Look out!

306
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,600
我都已经完全忘记那个吻了
I totally forgot about that kiss until now!

307
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,920
那个吻看来非比寻常
That must have been some kiss!

308
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,880
那可不仅仅只是个吻
It was more than just a kiss!

309
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,380
那个吻阐释了
It was a kiss that explained things

310
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,590
我们无法对彼此说出口的事
we couldn't seem to say to each other!

311
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,070
看看我们的大情圣
Look who's the big romantic!

312
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,480
我想这是你跟我说的第一件私事吧
I think that's the first personal story you ever told me!

313
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,840
我爱那个男孩
I loved that boy.

314
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,870
这边
This way.

315
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,680
看着好像很久没人来过了
Doesn't look like anybody's been here for a while.

316
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,740
对不起
Sorry.

317
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:38,130
看看有什么能用的然后走人
Let's find what we can and get out of here.

318
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,550
急救包看着不错
First aid kits look good.

319
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,080
没怎么用过
Hardly touched.

320
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,320
还有些吗啡
Even some morphine.

321
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,730
可别告诉多克
Don't tell Doc.

322
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,290
你知道  他可能还在这附近
You know he could still be around here somewhere.

323
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,990
两年前的新泽西之战我发了这张
I sent this after the Battle of New Jersey two years ago.

324
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,070
我们最亲近的一次告别
Closest we got to a goodbye.

325
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,890
我在他值班的时候被调走
I deployed while he was on duty.

326
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,620
我应该等他回家再走的
I should've waited for him to get home.

327
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,070
你看
Look.

328
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,270
有人住在你家
Someone's living in your house.

329
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,980
食品柜是满的
The pantry's stocked.

330
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,210
那小两口说他们见到一个消防员
That couple said they met a fireman.

331
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,840
有可能他还...
There's a chance he's...

332
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,500
那种生活已经过去了
That life is gone.

333
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,590
我早就意识到了这点
I've known that for a long time.

334
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,990
我们时间不多了
We don't have much time.

335
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,790
马上撤回避难所
Shelter! Now!

336
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,060
去还是留  做个选择吧
Pick your poison.

337
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,320
在这里比外面安全
It's safer in here than out there.

338
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,240
好的  你看到他了吗
Okay. Do you see him?

339
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,950
现在是活人对战死人
It's the living against the dead now.

340
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,880
好的
All right.

341
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,630
我没子弹了
I'm out.

342
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,660
我也是
Me too.

343
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,610
你后面
Behind you.

344
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,130
安托万
Antoine?

345
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,130
小心
Look out!

346
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:43,970
安托万
Antoine.

347
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,330
是他吗
Is that him?

348
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,680
不是
No.

349
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,250
不是  是他最好的朋友
No, it's his best friend,

350
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,700
迪尔伯恩
Dearborn.

351
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,400
马特·迪尔伯恩
Matt Dearborn.

352
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,760
给你
Here.

353
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,570
谢谢
Thanks.

354
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,550
小心点
Easy now.

355
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,340
抱歉
Sorry.

356
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,970
告诉外面那几个小伙子
Tell those frat boys out there 

357
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,580
把死亡金属音乐关掉
to turn down the death metal.

358
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,940
不然我就再去报警
I'll call the cops again.

359
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,910
我会跟他们说的
I'll tell them.

360
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,590
这家伙因为血肿导致颅内压升高不堪负荷
The dude's brain is getting crushed by the swelling.

361
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,450
我们得降低颅内压
We need to relieve the pressure.

362
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,610
很好  那我们该怎么做
Great. How we gonna do that?

363
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,340
我并不是很清楚  不过
Uh, I don't know exactly. But...

364
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,770
以前在《急诊室的故事》看过一次处理方法
but I saw this once on an episode of ER.

365
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,070
我们得疏通血肿  应该是这样
We need to drain the blood out I think.

366
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,150
所以我需要有尖头又锋利的东西
So I need something sharp and pointy to...

367
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,140
比如螺丝锥或者碎冰锥一类的东西
like a corkscrew, an ice pick?

368
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,320
摩菲
Murphy!

369
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,320
摩菲  快来帮忙
Murphy? A little help.

370
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:47,740
妈的
Damn it.

371
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,610
摩菲
Murphy!

372
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,570
你在搞什么鬼
What the hell, man?

373
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,770
摩菲
Murphy!

374
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,790
我们这里都天下大乱了
The world's coming apart around us, man.

375
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,440
你还有心情去理了个发
And you decide it's time for a haircut?

376
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,490
别让他接近瑞克
Keep him away from Rick!

377
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,450
摩菲  我需要你来帮忙
Murphy, I need your help.

378
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:04,210
去找个锋利的东西来  我要刺穿他的头骨
Find something sharp to penetrate his skull.

379
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,710
要够锋利足以刺穿头骨  了解
Sharp enough to penetrate his skull. Got it.

380
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,570
是时候刺穿他了
About time we piked him.

381
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,810
他在说什么
What is he talking about?!

382
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,990
好好搜一下房间
Way to read the room!

383
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,160
他在说什么
What is he talking about?

384
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,190
别担心  没人要刺穿你丈夫
Don't, don't worry. Nobody's gonna pike your husband.

385
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,110
艾迪在哪里
Where's Addy?

386
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,800
艾迪
Addy!

387
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,570
艾迪  艾迪
Addy? Addy?

388
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,710
你怎么了  
What, what is this?

389
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,290
我不知道
I don't know.

390
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,280
我不知道
I don't know.

391
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,160
麦克  我需要你
Mack! I need you, man!

392
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,620
-去吧  -行
- Go. - All right.

393
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,680
找的怎么样了摩菲
How we doin' Murphy?!

394
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,080
多谢
Thanks.

395
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,680
好了
Okay.

396
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,200
按住他
Just hold him still.

397
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,930
听着  这方法要是奏效了可能会大出血
Now look, if this works right there could be a lot of blood.

398
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:09,690
但是出血是好滴
But that's good.

399
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:10,370
出血是应该滴
That's a good thing 

400
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,230
因为我们要释放颅内压
because we want to relieve the pressure.

401
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,460
这样颅脑就会有空间
And then that way the brain will have room to...

402
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,860
你就别看了
Don't watch.

403
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,800
哎呦我擦
Oh damn.

404
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,480
这都是哥预料之中的事儿
I knew this was gonna happen.

405
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,280
别看我啊  大夫
Don't look at me... doctor.

406
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,360
天哪  小子
Jeez, kid.

407
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,040
我拿来当锤子的哈  锤子
As a hammer. A hammer.

408
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,700
好主意好主意
That's good.

409
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,560
嗷  神呐
Oh God.

410
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,930
看来压力降下来了
Well I guess that relieved the pressure.

411
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,920
这办法有用吗
Is this gonna work?

412
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,840
鬼知道啊
I don't know.

413
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,630
那一集结尾我又没看好吗
I didn't see the end of the episode.

414
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,530
他会好起来的  我相信
He's gonna be all right. I know it.

415
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,540
一定会的
I know it.

416
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,430
快  轻轻压住止血
Here. Just apply pressure.

417
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,770
像这样
Just like that.

418
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,180
特洛伊
Troy.

419
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:19,920
文斯
Vince.

420
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,070
迈克
Mike.

421
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,870
还有迪尔伯恩
And Dearborn.

422
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,150
我仁慈地结束了你们的生命
I give you mercy.

423
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,470
愿上帝赐予你们安宁祥和
May God give you peace.

424
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,070
准备好了吗
You ready?

425
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,020
来对付外面的吧
Let's take it to 'em.

426
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,290
僵尸都跑哪儿去了
Where'd they all go?

427
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,860
算了  走吧
Come on. Let's go.

428
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,810
不错啊
That's good.

429
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,770
这是好兆头啊
That's good.

430
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,960
也许我们应该趁着他昏迷的时候
Maybe I should've pulled the drill bit

431
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,590
把钻头给拔出来
while he was still knocked out.

432

你不觉得那东西很疯狂吗
Does that thing look mad to you?

434
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,610
那个该不会是...
Is that what I think?

435
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,110
不是鲨鱼哟
They ain't sharks!

436
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,070
神啊  你认真的吗  认真的吗
Really, God?! Really?!

437

How is he?

443
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,600
我不知道
I don't know.

444
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,380
你做了什么
What did you do?

445
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,400
给他做了颅骨减压术
Oh, decompressive craniectomy.

446
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,930
我拿电钻钻了他的头骨
I put a drill to the dome.

447
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,320
一万和卡桑德拉去哪儿了

452
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,610
我们回不去了  找个地方躲起来
We're not gonna make it back! Take shelter!

453
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:27,920
去车上
Run for the car!

454
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,830

462
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,230
暴风随时会来
The storm's gonna come any second!

463
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,600
拜托  快出来

465
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,000
罗伯塔  你在干什么  罗伯塔
Roberta! What are you doing, Roberta?!

466
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,260
开门
Open the door!

467
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,520

我来倒数
On my count.

470
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,740
少整没用得了
Shut up, Doc.

471
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,080
拿上毯子
Get the blankets.

472
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,070
罗伯塔  听得到吗
Roberta! Can you hear me?!

473
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,650
这次我必须等他  查理
I have to wait for him this time, Charlie.

474
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,230
我欠他太多了
I owe him that much.

475
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,240

477
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,660
就像你说的
It's like you said.

478
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,580
我无法忘却
I can't start forgetting...

479
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,030
直到我知道一切
until I know.

480
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,630
查理  求你别这样
Roberta, please don't do this.

481
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,480
好啦  这就好了啦
Got it. That's it!

482
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,180

她必须下来

她不肯下来
She's not coming.

490
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,090
摩菲

491
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,590
你开什么玩笑
You kidding me?

492

别胡闹了
Quit screwing around with this thing.

00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:56,820
沃伦
Warren.

501
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,260
你脸色不好  老大

502

516
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,320
略知一二吧
A little bit, yeah.

517
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,580

519
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,980

520

521
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,810
我不太喜欢你现在的造型
I'm not sure if I care for that look.

522
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,290
又没人问你的意见
Nobody asked you.

523
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,960
发型易改

你有没有可以止痛的药

528
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,130

00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,480
这些可都是好东西呢
That's good stuff.

535
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,950
你们俩会没事吧
Are you folks gonna be all right?

536
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:51,010
瑞克的家人就在附近
Rick's got family nearby.

537
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,030
我们还要继续寻找他们
We're gonna keep looking for them.

538
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,600
不过  谢谢你们

539
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,380
谢谢你们所做的一切
Thanks for everything.

540
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,280
怎么了
What?

541
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:07,390
你说的没错
You were right.

542
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,900
我确实得回来
I did need to come back.

543
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,700
当时我都没搞清楚安托万身上发生了什么
Even if I never know for sure what happened to Antoine,

544
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,950
就跟大家道别
I said my goodbye.

545
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,880
我知道现在我人在这里  我很好
I know I'm okay with being here now.

546
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,200
和你在一起
With you.

547
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,880
我也很高兴
And I'm good with that too.

548
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,610
我一直都想这样做
I always wanted to do that.

549
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,920
我能感觉得到
I could tell.

550
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,040
世间的幸存者们  大家好
Survivors of the world, hello.

551
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,580
如果你们还能听到我说话  恭喜你们
If you're hearing this, congrats. 

552
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,330
说明你们还活着
You're still alive.

553
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,780
你们真是人渣中的极品
You are the baddest of the badasses.

554
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,670
你们害怕的既不是人类
Fearing neither man

555
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,940
不是龙卷风  也不是僵尸
nor twister nor living dead.

556
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,020
我要关掉耳麦了
My headset is off to you.

{\an8}{\pos(185.6,49.901)}.

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,260
{\an8}{\pos(228.267,57.0297)}.

17
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,260
{\an8}{\pos(150.4,193.188)}.

19
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,770
Previously on Z Nation.

20
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,980
Whoa. It's a real live baby.

21
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,080
You don't hold him like he's a live grenade. Just give him to me.

22
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,600
Me and babies, not so much.

23
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,890
We're on a high priority mission

24
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,920
to get this man to a CDC lab in California.

25
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,010
He can't worry about some raggedy ass group of civilians

26
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,660
Nothing raggedy ass about this group of civilians, sir.

27
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,650
Relax,

28
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,250
Garnett and Warren know what they're doing.

30
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,470
There you are.

31
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,830
Ah, thank you, honey.

32
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,740
Mmmm-mmm. Nothing like the first cup.

33
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,590
I will see your vicodin

34
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,190
and raise you one tetracycline.

35
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,580
Call.

36
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,400
Three of a kind.

38
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,220
Full house.

39
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,660
Aces high.

40
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,880
Man.

41
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,790
That's five hands in a row.

42
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,710
If you're gonna continue to use my deck

43
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,710
you need to quit pulling cards out your ass.

44
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,830
Oh boo hoo.

45
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,870
Hey shhh. Hold on, he's back on.

46
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,800
Friends, I'm talking about mean weather coming in fast.

47
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,170
Some reports of tornados.

48
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,730
Find shelter and take cover.

49
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,290
It's dangerous out there. More so than usual.

50
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,910
Now back to the soothing sounds of the Apocalypse.

51
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,220
You know after he was so wrong about that chopper

52
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,640
weatherman's a pretty good job for that geek.

53
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,920
You're up.

54
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,800
All good?

55
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:53,840
Peaceful night.

56
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,920
Your stalker said there's a storm front coming in.

57
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,100
How is it out there?

58
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,290
Cloudy with a chance of zombie.

59
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,450
Okay, you two get some rest.

60
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,050
You got it.

61
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,130
I've had worse days.

62
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,910
It's not a bad set up.

63
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,370
You know,

64
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,330
I'm really starting to feel at home here.

65
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,510
I'm thinking about putting a barbecue right here.

66
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,730
This one needs to be flipped.

67
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,160
I really like what they did with the landscaping, the flowers,

68
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,250
everything. So homey.

69
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,340
Yeah. Too bad they're dead.

70
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,830
Sorry. Wrong room.

71
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,370
Okay.

72
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,220
Oh my God. A bed. When was the last time we did it in a bed?

73
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,350
What do you think?

74
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,000
Naked?

75
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,720
Like no clothes?

76
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,570
Full commando, baby.

77
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,720
Oh my God, you are such a romantic.

78
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,190
The...

79
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,270
blanket...

80
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,340
I was just...

81
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,630
Sorry.

82
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,580
Scared of that one.

83
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,470
Best not to mess.

84
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,270
You know if we breed those two,

85
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,180
it'd be all over for the zombies.

86
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,990
Can't remember the last time I snuck off with somebody.

87
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,590
I can't remember the last time I wanted to.

88
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,990
You still think about him?

89
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:32,990
Antoine?

90
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,930
I try not to.

91
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,650
And I never heard what happened,

92
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,450
so there's not much point.

93
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,940
What about you?

94
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,070
I used to think about Amy and the kids everyday.

95
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,800
Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the end all over again.

96
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,810
It got to a certain point where I just gave up.

97
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,110
Didn't care if I lived or died.

98
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,970
And a funny thing happened.

99
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,790
I didn't die.

100
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,730
And with everything that's happened

101
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,990
it's been harder and harder to remember the past.

102
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,950
I guess that's a good thing, right?

103
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,710
Guess so.

104
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,530
Are we close by your hometown?

105
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,250
I know what you're thinking, and the answer is no.

106
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,000
Just swing by on our way west.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,430
Why? It's long gone.

108
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,250
He's gone.

109
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,860
And I just wish that I would've waited for him

110
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,330
and said goodbye before the last time I got shipped out.

111
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,420
Don't you want to know for sure?

112
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,410
You can't start forgetting 

113
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,320
what you don't know.

114
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,750
That does not look good.

115
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,270
It's tornado weather.

116
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,690
That was close.

117
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,740
Are you okay?

118
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,800
Uh, yeah.

119
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,790
No.

120
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,950
No, I dunno.

121
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,340
Incoming!

122
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,210
Puppies and kittens! Time to go!

123
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,880
Everybody out the back!

124
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,750
I give you mercy.

127
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,350
I hate blind spots, boy.

128
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,460
Make me anxious.

129
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,160
Mess with my digestion.

130
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,760
That was funny.

132
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,970
Sorry, I forgot you.

133
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,110
Oh that's right, you're on the wagon.

134
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,500
Sorry, I forgot.

135
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,540
The only thing worse than drinking alone is not drinking.

136
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,600
Hello, beautiful.

137
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,340
What are we looking at here?

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,350
Dang. They don't call it Tornado Alley for nothing.

139
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,060
I am not drunk.

140
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,680
You're drunk.

141
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,980
No, your mom's drunk.

142
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,900
In our continuing effort to bring you

143
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,400
up to the minute information, we at Z-TV have acquired

144
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,370
a National Weather Service satellite

145
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,130
that they aren't using anymore.

146
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,440
But that's not important.

147
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,840
We now go to John Smith, southern weather correspondent

148
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,570
to get his opinion on the story.

149
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,700
This is the badassest storm this weatherman has ever seen.

150
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,010
From the Gulf of Mexico right up the Mississippi Valley,

151
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,270
trouble is brewing.

152
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,250
I don't know if they call this thing a turricane or a tornado

153
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,770
or what. But if you're anywhere south of Chicago

154
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:56,750
or east of the Rockies,

155
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,130
I'm issuing a get your butt in a bunker warning.

156
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,020
Hey, I hope you guys are getting this.

157
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,680
Addy and friends.

158
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,630
You guys got to seek shelter immediately because

159
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,620
this is bad. And

160
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,450
when you seek shelter immediately

161
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,480
and after you do that,

162
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,750
you need to contact me and tell me where you are.

163
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,240
And I'll update you with further instructions. Okay?

164
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,790
All right, well this is Citizen Z, and I'm signing off.

165
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,310
Who's Addy?

166
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,010
So which way do we go?

167
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,600
The storm is pushing north from the gulf.

168
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,650
If we make it to the I-70,

169
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,400
we can outrun it.

170
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,730
That storm is going faster than that craptastic truck ever will.

171
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,690
Yeah, we got to get off the road.

172
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,840
You heard Citizen Z.

173
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,770
We got to seek shelter.

174
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,450
What we need is to get the hell out of here.

175
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,230
I ain't stopping just cuz some punk with a satellite says so.

176
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,130
Okay, hang on. Am I missing something?

177
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,090
You did not drag my ass this far

178
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:52,210
so that mankind's hope could get sucked up by a tornado,

179
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,010
did you?

180
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,750
Hey, Addy.

181
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,230
You know you've been quiet.

182
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,040
Just want to make sure you're okay.

183
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,180
Yeah, I'm fine.

184
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,560
Just,

185
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,300
you know, zombies.

186
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,770
Anybody got a mint?

188
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,200
Castle Point. That's your hometown right?

189
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,160
Whoa. Look at that storm coming in.

190
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,340
Okay, fine. You win.

192
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,070
Welcome home, Roberta.

193
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,760
So you know this town?

194
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,670
Born and raised here.

195
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,120
We need to take cover.

196
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,810
Is there someplace safe nearby?

197
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,630
Yeah, there's a storm cellar in my house.

198
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,100
How close by is your house?

199
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,220
It's not far.

200
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,640
I knew these people.

201
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,450
My neighbor.

202
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,950
My boss.

203
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,250
My...

204
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,280
Is that him?

205
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,550
Who's him?

206
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,800
Oh, no.

207
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:26,570
No. We are not here searching for dead hubby, are we?

208
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,480
Let's go.

209
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,380
Shelter's this way.

210
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,460
Get going.

211
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,550
It's so green.

212
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,490
I never seen a sky look like that.

213
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,630
I've only seen tornadoes on TV.

214
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,180
I don't like tornadoes.

215
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,350
I'm pretty sure they don't like me either.

216
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,550
That it?

217
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,000
That's it.

218
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,500
10K, come on!

219
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,660
Come on!

220
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,520
If he's in there and he's...

221
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,290
I will not hesitate.

222
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,020
Home sweet zombie.

223
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,040
Get out of that chair!

224
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,820
Go on and get out of there!

225
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,700
That's my husband's favorite chair!

226
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,760
All right.

227
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,240
Uh, upstairs is all good.

228
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,620
I got this.

229
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,080
Please don't shoot us.

230
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,400
My husband is hurt.

231
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,170
What are you doing in my house?

232
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,910
The fireman said we'd be safe here.

233
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,400
Here we go.

234
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,770
Bark like a dog for me.

235
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,090
Well I wasn't talking to you, but I'm impressed.

236
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,070
God.

237
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,800
From a Category Three to the Seventh Circle of Hell.

238
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,070
Delta-Xray-Delta, I hope you guys aren't underneath that.

239
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,990
Come on. Drop me a note.

240
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,150
Send up a flare. Give me a ring.

241
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,670
I can't help you if I can't find you.

242
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,050
You're going to be okay.

243
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,500
He's a doctor.

244
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,890
Well they sorta just call me Doc.

245
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:09,620
No.

246
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,400
No doctor. I just... need a nap.

247
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,710
Oh that, no that wouldn't be good, dude.

248
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,290
Do not nap.

249
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,990
Don't let him fall asleep. He's got a bad concussion at least.

250
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,050
Rick? Rick?

251
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,580
Help him!

252
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:29,970
Basement's clear.

253
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,550
Is he gonna be okay?

254
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,220
Is this the fireman?

255
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,040
What?

256
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,090
Is this the fireman that brought you here?

257
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,130
I don't know.

258
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,620
Maybe. He was wearing a helmet.

259
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,140
Maybe it's him.

260
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,000
I think it is.

261
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,820
Thank you.

262
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,850
We need to get out of here before this storm hits.

263
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,100
And go where, huh?

264
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,340
What are we supposed to do,

265
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,110
just sit here and hope it misses us?

266
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,800
The basement is secure.

267
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,930
We can ride it out down there.

268
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,430
Let's just gather some supplies before it hits.

269
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,390
Kitchen was pretty well stocked up.

270
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,870
There's water and canned food.

271
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,580
No medical supplies, no batteries though.

272
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,430
We need to get our communications up.

273
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,050
You two, go out in the neighborhood.

274
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,840
See what you can find. But don't go far.

275
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,890
Be sure to get back before the storm hits.

276
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,390
Janey what are all these people doing here?

277
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,810
My parents will be home for dinner any minute.

278
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,320
Is he gonna make it?

279
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,330
Is that a serious question?

280
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:47,850
I don't know.

281
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,310
He got cracked on the dome.

282
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,890
Okay, I for one do not

283
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,940
want to be trapped in a basement with this guy

284
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,820
when he starts craving brains.

285
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,130
Don't mind him.

286
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,270
His mama didn't raise him right.

287
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,650
Well if I had the proper meds or a first aid kit...

288
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,530
You know the fire station may still have first aid supplies.

289
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,360
Hey, lock down the basement.

290
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,240
If that kid turns,

291
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,700
I want you to be right on that.

292
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,600
Yeah, of course.

293
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,460
Keep an eye on Murphy.

294
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,470
We'll be back before the party starts.

295
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,160
Addy!

296
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,630
Addy!

297
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:40,990
What?

298
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:41,910
What?

299
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,080
What?

300
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,230
This place brings back so many memories.

301
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,190
What?!

302
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,720
My first kiss.

303
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,110
With the fireman?

304
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,300
Antoine, yeah.

305
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,300
Look out!

306
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,600
I totally forgot about that kiss until now!

307
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,920
That must have been some kiss!

308
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,880
It was more than just a kiss!

309
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,380
It was a kiss that explained things

310
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,590
we couldn't seem to say to each other!

311
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,070
Look who's the big romantic!

312
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,480
I think that's the first personal story you ever told me!

313
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,840
I loved that boy.

314
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,870
This way.

315
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,680
Doesn't look like anybody's been here for a while.

316
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,740
Sorry.

317
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:38,130
Let's find what we can and get out of here.

318
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,550
First aid kits look good.

319
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,080
Hardly touched.

320
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,320
Even some morphine.

321
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,730
Don't tell Doc.

322
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,290
You know he could still be around here somewhere.

323
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,990
I sent this after the Battle of New Jersey two years ago.

324
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,070
Closest we got to a goodbye.

325
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,890
I deployed while he was on duty.

326
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,620
I should've waited for him to get home.

327
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,070
Look.

328
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,270
Someone's living in your house.

329
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,980
The pantry's stocked.

330
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,210
That couple said they met a fireman.

331
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,840
There's a chance he's...

332
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,500
That life is gone.

333
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,590
I've known that for a long time.

334
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,990
We don't have much time.

335
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,790
Shelter! Now!

336
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,060
Pick your poison.

337
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,320
It's safer in here than out there.

338
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,240
Okay. Do you see him?

339
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,950
It's the living against the dead now.

340
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,880
All right.

341
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,630
I'm out.

342
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,660
Me too.

343
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,610
Behind you.

344
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,130
Antoine?

345
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,130
Look out!

346
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:43,970
Antoine.

347
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,330
Is that him?

348
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,680
No.

349
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,250
No, it's his best friend,

350
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,700
Dearborn.

351
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,400
Matt Dearborn.

352
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,760
Here.

353
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,570
Thanks.

354
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,550
Easy now.

355
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,340
Sorry.

356
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,970
Tell those frat boys out there 

357
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,580
to turn down the death metal.

358
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,940
I'll call the cops again.

359
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,910
I'll tell them.

360
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,590
The dude's brain is getting crushed by the swelling.

361
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,450
We need to relieve the pressure.

362
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,610
Great. How we gonna do that?

363
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,340
Uh, I don't know exactly. But...

364
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,770
but I saw this once on an episode of ER.

365
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,070
We need to drain the blood out I think.

366
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,150
So I need something sharp and pointy to...

367
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,140
like a corkscrew, an ice pick?

368
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,320
Murphy!

369
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,320
Murphy? A little help.

370
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:47,740
Damn it.

371
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,610
Murphy!

372
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,570
What the hell, man?

373
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,770
Murphy!

374
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,790
The world's coming apart around us, man.

375
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,440
And you decide it's time for a haircut?

376
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,490
Keep him away from Rick!

377
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,450
Murphy, I need your help.

378
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:04,210
Find something sharp to penetrate his skull.

379
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,710
Sharp enough to penetrate his skull. Got it.

380
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,570
About time we piked him.

381
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,810
What is he talking about?!

382
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,990
Way to read the room!

383
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,160
What is he talking about?

384
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,190
Don't, don't worry. Nobody's gonna pike your husband.

385
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,110
Where's Addy?

386
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,800
Addy!

387
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,570
Addy? Addy?

388
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,710
What, what is this?

389
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,290
I don't know.

390
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,280
I don't know.

391
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,160
Mack! I need you, man!

392
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,620
- Go. - All right.

393
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,680
How we doin' Murphy?!

394
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,080
Thanks.

395
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,680
Okay.

396
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,200
Just hold him still.

397
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,930
Now look, if this works right there could be a lot of blood.

398
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:09,690
But that's good.

399
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:10,370
That's a good thing 

400
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,230
because we want to relieve the pressure.

401
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,460
And then that way the brain will have room to...

402
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,860
Don't watch.

403
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,800
Oh damn.

404
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,480
I knew this was gonna happen.

405
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,280
Don't look at me... doctor.

406
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,360
Jeez, kid.

407
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,040
As a hammer. A hammer.

408
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,700
That's good.

409
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,560
Oh God.

410
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,930
Well I guess that relieved the pressure.

411
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,920
Is this gonna work?

412
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,840
I don't know.

413
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,630
I didn't see the end of the episode.

414
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,530
He's gonna be all right. I know it.

415
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,540
I know it.

416
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,430
Here. Just apply pressure.

417
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,770
Just like that.

418
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,180
Troy.

419
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:19,920
Vince.

420
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,070
Mike.

421
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,870
And Dearborn.

422
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,150
I give you mercy.

423
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,470
May God give you peace.

424
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,070
You ready?

425
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,020
Let's take it to 'em.

426
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,290
Where'd they all go?

427
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,860
Come on. Let's go.

428
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,810
That's good.

429
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,770
That's good.

430
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,960
Maybe I should've pulled the drill bit

431
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,590
while he was still knocked out.

432
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,490
Roberta!

433
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,710
Does that thing look mad to you?

434
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,610
Is that what I think?

435
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,110
They ain't sharks!

436
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,070
Really, God?! Really?!

437
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,670
Come on! We got to get inside!

438
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,600
Come on! There's no time!

439
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,770
Let's go!

440
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,970
Murphy, take care of that zombie!

441
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,680
Get it, Doc!

442
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,750
How is he?

443
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,600
I don't know.

444
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,380
What did you do?

445
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,400
Oh, decompressive craniectomy.

446
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,930
I put a drill to the dome.

447
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,320
Where's 10K and Cassandra?

448
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,160
I don't know.

449
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,150
Warren!

450
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,490
Murphy! What are you doing?!

451
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,210
Pike that thing now!

452
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,610
We're not gonna make it back! Take shelter!

453
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:27,920
Run for the car!

454
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,830
Roberta!

455
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,950
Roberta!

456
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,160
Roberta!

457
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,490
Roberta! What are you doing?!

458
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,150
Roberta! Can you hear me?!

459
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,640
Please don't do this!

461
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:37,770
What are you doing?!

462
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,230
The storm's gonna come any second!

463
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,600
Come on! Hurry up!

464
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,370
Come on, Roberta!

465
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,000
Roberta! What are you doing, Roberta?!

466
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,260
Open the door!

467
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,520
Mack, help me get him under the table, will ya?

468
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:00,830
Okay.

469
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,600
On my count.

470
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,740
Shut up, Doc.

471
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,080
Get the blankets.

472
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,070
Roberta! Can you hear me?!

473
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,650
I have to wait for him this time, Charlie.

474
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,230
I owe him that much.

475
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,240
No. No! Goddamn it! Come down right now!

476
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,020
It is not safe up here!

477
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,660
It's like you said.

478
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,580
I can't start forgetting...

479
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,030
until I know.

480
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,630
Roberta, please don't do this.

481
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,480
Got it. That's it!

482
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,180
Where's Warren?

483
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,650
She's not coming.

484
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,590
What?

485
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,620
What?

486
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,230
She's not coming?

487
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,410
She's gonna get killed out there.

488
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:19,620
She's got to get down here.

489
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,130
She's not coming.

490
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,090
Murphy.

491
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,590
You kidding me?

492
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,460
Quit screwing around with this thing.

493
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,050
Mercy.

494
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:41,780
Okay.

495
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,740
Hang on.

496
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,990
Oh no! Oh no!

497
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,350
Oh God.

498
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,890
I waited for you.

499
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,950
Well that was fun.

500
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:56,820
Warren.

501
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,260
You don't look so good, chief.

502
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,380
I need to get out of here.

503
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,310
I need to get out of here now.

504
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,750
Roberta!

505
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,550
Roberta!

506
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,040
Hi, Charlie.

507
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,210
Why didn't you...

508
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,910
How did you...

509
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,870
I tried to go home.

510
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,070
I did.

511
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,800
But I'm still here.

512
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,540
Thank God you are.

513
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,570
I'm still here.

514
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,920
You're crazy.

515
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,320
You're crazy. You know that, right?

516
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,320
A little bit, yeah.

517
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,580
Warren.

518
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,040
Thank you.

519
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,980
Man... If I see a munchkin, I'm gonna freak.

520
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,290
I need to go!

521
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,810
I'm not sure if I care for that look.

522
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,290
Nobody asked you.

523
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,960
New haircut.

524
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,540
Same Murphy.

525
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,790
Hey, Doc. Thanks.

526
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,290
Thank you, truly.

527
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,820
Do you have anything for the pain?

528
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,130
Oh, I...

529
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,910
I am so sorry.

530
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,940
I wish I did.

531
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,360
Oh, hell.

532
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,100
Here.

533
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,500
Take it easy on those.

534
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,480
That's good stuff.

535
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,950
Are you folks gonna be all right?

536
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:51,010
Rick's got family nearby.

537
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,030
We're gonna keep looking for them.

538
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,600
But thanks.

539
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,380
Thanks for everything.

540
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,280
What?

541
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:07,390
You were right.

542
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,900
I did need to come back.

543
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,700
Even if I never know for sure what happened to Antoine,

544
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,950
I said my goodbye.

545
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,880
I know I'm okay with being here now.

546
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,200
With you.

547
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,880
And I'm good with that too.

548
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,610
I always wanted to do that.

549
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,920
I could tell.

550
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,040
Survivors of the world, hello.

551
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,580
If you're hearing this, congrats. 

552
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,330
You're still alive.

553
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,780
You are the baddest of the badasses.

554
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,670
Fearing neither man

555
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,940
nor twister nor living dead.

556
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,020
My headset is off to you.

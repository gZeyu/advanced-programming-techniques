《僵尸国度》前情提要
Previously on Z Nation.

20
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,590
这些都是僵尸咬的
Those are zombie bites.

21
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:04,600
八个僵尸
Eight of them.

22
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,930
在你们面前的是唯一已知的被僵尸咬伤之后
You're looking at the only human known to have survived

23
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,060
还能活下来的人
being bitten by a zombie.

24
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,150
如果我们能把他送到加利福尼亚的实验室
If we can get him to the lab in California

25
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,840
他们就能用他的血造出更多抗体
they can use his blood and make more of the vaccine.

26
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,060
那不会是我认为的那东西吧
Is that what I think?!

27
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,220
不是鲨鱼哟
They ain't sharks!

28
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,240
你还在想他吗
You still think about him?

29
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,300
安托万吗
Antoine?

30
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,320
我试着不去想他
I try not to.

31
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,120
安托万吗
Antoine?

32
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:20,930
是他吗
Is that him?

33
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:21,820
不是
No.

34
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,010
当时我都没搞清楚安托万身上发生了什么
Even if I never know for sure what happened to Antoine

35
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,100
我很高兴现在能和你在一起
I'm okay with being here now with you.

36
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,650
我也很高兴
I'm good with that too.

37
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,230
全国现已进入紧急状态
This is a national emergency.

38
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,480
我现在决定汇总一下
I've decided to catalog

39
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,020
目前有关僵尸病毒起源的各类说法
all the theories about where the Z virus came from.

40
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,540
其种类可谓五花八门
There's more than a few.

41
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,560
所以说僵尸是拜火教对死人复活的称呼吗
Is it what the Zoroastrians would call Frashokereti?

42
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,530
还是我们被亚马逊上的脑残洗脑了
Or are we contaminated with Amazon brain rot?

43
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,390
又或许我们的星球被彗星的尾巴扫到
Or maybe we passed through the tail of a comet

44
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,150
将僵尸的灰烬洒落在了地球上
that sprinkled the earth with zombie dust.

45
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,520
还是说这是一种从国防部实验室不幸流出的
Or was it a defense department weaponized virus

46
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,580
生化病毒呢
that escaped the lab?

47
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,250
也可能这是一个
Or how about

48
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,740
本身会成为事实的预言
self fulfilling prophecy.

49
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,740
社会大众都对僵尸为之着迷  然后僵尸
Public fascination with all things zombie just

50
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,550
这一虚幻的预言变成了现实
willed it into existence.

51
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,630
这些说法越往南边传的越离谱
As things went south the theories got weirder.

52
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,680
在世界末日的关头  正是各种宗教布道的大好时机
Good times for religions with an end of the world scenario.

53
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,960
说的越疯狂越精彩
The crazier the better.

54
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,540
有关天启的生意又火了
The Apocalypse business was booming.

55
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,720
至少还能有机会让这门生意火起来
At least while there still was business to boom.

56
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,480
{\an8}爱尔兰诗人及剧作家  曾获1923年诺贝尔文学奖

57
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,480
这让我想起了叶芝的一首诗
It reminds me of a poem by Yeats.

58
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,570
"于是何等恶兽  它的时辰终于到来
"And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,

59
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,830
懒洋洋地走向伯利恒来投生"
slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?"

60
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,370
无任何解药
There is no cure.

61
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,740
到底是何等恶兽啊
What rough beast indeed.

62

{\an8}汉尼拔镇  密苏里州

63
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,360
天父啊  我们请求您守护我们的兄弟姐妹们
Father, we ask that watch over our brothers and sisters

64
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,920
当他们离开教堂的会众  奔向一段更伟大的旅程
as they leave our congregation for a greater journey.

65
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,240
阿门
Amen.

66
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,420
虽然我们此生无缘再会
And although we will not see them again in this life,

67
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,480
但他们依旧会通过他们的牺牲  继续活下去
they will live on through their sacrifice.

68
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,240
现在我请求各位起立
Now I ask you all to rise.

69
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,850
伊莱兄弟  马修兄弟
Brother Eli, Brother Matthew,

70
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,960
请帮一下这几位复生的教友
please help with the Resurrected

71
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,900
让我们虔诚祈祷
Let us pray.

72
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,140
今天是充满喜悦的一天
For today is a day of joy.

73
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,020
{\an8}宗教仪式上傅油使神圣化

74
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,020
我现在请求为各位受傅者上前一步
I ask now for the anointed to please step forward.

75
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,950
这几位兄弟姐妹
These brothers and sisters

76
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,250
将很快领悟到宁静的真正深意
will soon know the true meaning of peace

77
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,360
而这深意唯有信仰和重生方能授予
that only belief and resurrection can bring.

78
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,250
希望这些能守卫您旅途的安全
May these keep you safe on your journey

79
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,160
并且成为您救助苍生的利器
and serve as the instrument of your salvation.

80
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,520
我羡慕你们  兄弟们
I envy you, brothers.

81
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:48,990
姐妹
Sister.

82
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,540
让我们鸣钟
Let us ring the bell

83
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,950
然后愉快地召唤更多重生的人们
and joyously call out for more of the resurrected

84
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,460
加入到我们中间来
to join our flock.

85
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,970
伊莱兄弟
Brother Eli.

86
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,240
马修兄弟
Brother Matthew.

87
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,900
请做好迎接他们的准备
Please prepare to greet them.

88
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,380
这附近没有僵尸
No Zs in sight.

89
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,420
还有谁也在担忧着那位"阳光先生"呢
Anybody else worried about Mr. Sunshine out there?

90
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,090
我知道
I know.

91
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,210
看来他的状况每况愈下
He's looking worse.

92
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,460
没错  他一开始就很让人毛骨悚然了
Yeah, he was pretty creepy to start with.

93
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,100
拜托  大家还是让他休息一下吧
Come on, guys. Give him a break.

94
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,240
现在是世界末日  大家状态都不好
It's the Apocalypse. None of us look our best.

95
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,910
就像顶着拖沓的乱发过了一天
It's like one long bad hair day.

96
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,070
说到发型  他的光头是怎么回事
Speaking of hair, what's with all the bald patches?

97
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,170
可能疫苗就相当于僵尸病毒的化疗
Maybe that vaccine is like zombie chemo.

98
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,870
也许疫苗现在已经失效了
Or maybe that vaccine isn't working.

99
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,960
你怎么看  多克
What do you think, Doc?

100
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,580
我见过比他看上去状况更好的僵尸
I've seen Zs look better than him.

101
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,700
他能撑到加州吗
Will he make it to California?

102
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,340
如果可以加快脚步的话  
If we haul ass.

103
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,360
如果他变成僵尸  我们只好杀掉他了
If he goes zombie, we might have to put him down.

104
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,490
我投票刺穿他的脑袋
Dibs on piking him.

105
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,150
如果他变异的话  刺穿他还不是小事一桩
If he turns, piking him's the least of our problems.

106
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,730
怎么了
What?

107
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,510
短暂休息结束  我们继续前进
Pit stop's over. Let's get moving.

108
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,040
哥长了个巨型膀胱  不可以吗
I have a ginormous bladder.

109
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,320
有种告我啊
Sue me.

110
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,650
我现在都能拿几个僵尸去做堪萨斯烤肋排了
Man, I sure could use some of them Kansas City barbecue ribs about now.

111
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,820
亲爱的  你也是个肋排(食人)大胃王对吧
How bout you, darlin'. You're a big rib eater, aren't you?

112
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,310
你知道吗  我刚才差一点就开始同情你了
You know I was almost starting to feel sorry for you.

113
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,440
作为一个两天没吃饭的人  你这表情
You look pretty happy for someone who hasn't eaten

114
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,430
也太开心了点
in two days.

115
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:15,970
这还不算最糟嘛
Could be worse.

116
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,010
真的吗
Really?

117
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,390
至少我们还活着  对吧
We're still alive, aren't we?

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,870
你总能看到事情好的一面
You were always a glass half full kinda guy.

119
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,670
我最爱你这点了
It's what I love about you.

120
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,810
其实我很期待能在普罗温斯敦
Actually I'm looking forward to getting some food

121
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,790
找到一些食物  再洗个热水澡
and a hot shower at Provincetown.

122
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,840
别抱太大希望
Well don't get your hopes up.

123
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,770
我们现在都不确定这个地方是否还存在
We don't even know if this place still exists.

124
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,880
哈蒙德在地图上把这里标做成了补给点
Hammond had it marked on his map as a resupply place.

125
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,340
如果他的联系人威廉姆斯正是
And if his contact there is the same Major Williams

126
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,830
我在国民警卫队的威廉姆斯少校
from my National Guard days,

127
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,070
我们还真有可能获得一些帮助
we might actually get some help.

128
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,430
我们现在就依靠一张死人的地图吗
So we're relying on the map of a dead guy?

129
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,740
怕你忘了
In case you forgot

130
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,410
提醒一下  那个人是为了保护你而死的
that dead guy was a hero who died protecting you.

131
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,930
死也不意味着他就可以顺势成为英雄
Just because he's dead doesn't make him a hero.

132
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,570
我真心希望普罗温斯敦还在
Well I hope Provincetown does exist

133
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,170
因为我们现在除了希望  其他一无所有
because we're out of just about everything but hope.

134
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,170
第1554个
One thousand five hundred and fifty four.

135
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,370
{\an8}进入之前  请准备上缴所有武器
普罗温斯敦  无武器区域

136
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,040
交出所有的武器  他们是认真的吗
Surrender all weapons? Are they serious?

137
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,050
看上去是的
Looks like.

138
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,210
你打算怎么办
What do you wanna do?

139
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,200
入乡随俗
Their town, their rules.

140
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,660
看上去我们没有其他的选择
Looks like we don't have much of a choice.

141
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,170
停  这里是私人领地
Stop right there! This is a private compound.

142
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,230
我要求你们调转车头
I'm gonna have to ask you to turn around

143
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,710
从哪里来的就回哪里去
and go back the way you came.

144
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,930
我们找威廉姆斯少校
I'm looking for Major Wiliams.

145
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,120
乔·威廉姆斯
Joe Williams.

146
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,960
你又是谁
And who are you?

147
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,660
我是查尔斯·加内特中士
I'm Sergeant Charles Garnett,

148
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,960
佐治亚国家警卫队的
Georgia National Guard.

149
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,020
我们从僵尸爆发之前就认识了
We've knowm each other going back pre-z.

150
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,020
在这等着  你的人待在车里
Wait there. Your crew stays in the truck.

151
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,420
他们要是敢出来  或者我看见有人亮武器
They try to get out or we see a weapon,

152
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,140
我就开火
we'll fire.

153
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,060
大家别妄动
Easy everyone.

154
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,830
查理能应付得来
Charlie's got it under control.

155
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,700
矮油  都叫上查理了呦
So you're calling him Charlie now?

156
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,420
没错  你要是不给姐闭嘴
Yeah, and I'm gonna start calling you my bitch

157
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,860
姐就叫你婊子
if you don't shut up.

158
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,760
我的天
Well holy shit.

159
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,670
查理·加内特的鬼魂上门来了
It's the ghost of Charlie Garnett.

160
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,400
我还以为见不到你了  至少活着见不到了
Never expected to see you again. At least not alive.

161
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,660
你好啊  乔  我也没想到能再见到你
Hey, Joe. Didn't expect to see you again either.

162
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,430
看来你我都坚持下来了
Looks like we're both still standing.

163
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,860
看来如此
Looks like.

164
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,520
上次我见到你
Last time I saw you,

165
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,180
你把我从僵尸堆里捞了出来
you were pulling my ass out of a ditch full of Zs.

166
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,880
还你人情罢了
Just returning the favor.

167
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,610
那天我们杀了多少僵尸
How many Zs we kill that day?

168
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,100
还不够多
Not enough.

169
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,950
我能放下手吗
Do you mind?

170
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,380
放下枪
Stand down.

171
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,630
你是我见到的第一个故人
You're the first person I've seen from before.

172
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,750
你怎么混到这来了
How the hell you end up here?

173
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,180
其实我在给政府办件事
I'm actually on a mission for the government,

174
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,390
不管你信不信了
if you can believe that.

175
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,990
如果换了别人说这话
If it was anybody but you,

176
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,160
我还真不信
I wouldn't.

177
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,110
我们从纽约赶过来的  好几天没吃东西了
We've come from New York. Haven't eaten in a few days.

178
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,130
纽约
New York?

179
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,220
这一年多就没见过
Haven't seen anyone

180
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,590
有谁活着从东密西西比过来的
east of the Mississippi for over a year.

181
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,690
你们一共几个人
How many of you are there?

182
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,690
八个  包括一名医生
Eight. Including a doctor.

183
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,750
货真价实的医生吗
Real doctor?

184
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:06,900
算是吧
Sort of.

185
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,610
他看过好多集《急诊室的故事》
He's watched a lot of E.R.

186
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,220
那好
All right.

187
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,010
进来跟我讲讲你的经历  我们给你弄些吃的
Come inside and tell me your story. We'll get you some food.

188
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,090
但你们的卡车要停在外面
But the truck stays outside.

189
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,200
放行
Let them in.

190
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,050
当然  你们都得上交武器
And of course you'll have to check your weapons.

191
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,750
别忘了还给我们
Just make sure we get these back.

192
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,310
我怎么一点都没觉得安心呢
Why is this not making me feel any safer?

193
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,170
看来这家伙见过场面啊
Looks like it's seen a little action.

194
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,660
以前做过狱警吗
Ex prison guard?

195
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,610
运输安全管理局的
TSA.

196
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,480
就跟《道奇城》[西部片]似的
Just like Dodge City.

197
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,130
我们自有道理
We have our reasons.

198
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,170
做得对
Makes sense.

199
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,630
安检越严
Strong on the outside.

200
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,690
内部才能安全
Safe on the inside.

201
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,830
少校  说了你可能不信
Major, you're not gonna believe this.

202
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,790
三个雅各布的信徒回来了
Three of Jacob's flock are back.

203
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,860
威廉姆斯少校
Major Williams?

204
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,000
我们想回来
We'd like to come back.

205
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,610
我们不该走的
We were wrong to leave.

206
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,220
原来雅各布就是一疯掉的邪教头子
Jacob turned out to be just some crazy cult leader.

207
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,430
我们带吃的回来了
We brought food.

208
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,590
我们该怎么处理他们
What do you want us to do?

209
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,000
检查下他们  没问题就放进来
If they're clean, let 'em back in.

210
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,120
没准还有更多"迷途羔羊"想回来呢
Probably won't be the last of his sheep to wander back.

211
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,990
没有那把锤头  我真是一身轻松
I feel so much lighter without that damn hammer.

212
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,210
我感觉像是在裸奔  整个人都不好了
Yeah, I feel naked, and not in a good way.

213
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,740
一开始  每个人都是全副武装
When we started out, everyone was armed.

214
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,040
一天  有个男人射杀了他妻子的男性朋友
Then one day a guy decided to shoot his wife's boyfriend.

215
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,560
他变异了  结果我们死了5个人
He turned, and we lost five people.

216
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,920
所以我们制定了规定
So we made a rule.

217
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,960
只有警卫能在内部携带武器
Only guards could carry inside.

218
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,610
之后来了个贸易集团  抢走了警卫的枪
Then a trading group came in. Took a gun off a guard.

219
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,160
那时死了7个人  我们庆幸情况没变得更糟
Seven dead that time. We were lucky it wasn't worse.

220
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,230
我们的防线很坚固  从未被攻破
We have a strong perimeter. Never been breached.

221
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,740
问题都出现在内部
All our problems happened inside.

222
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,230
所以我们消除了威胁
So we removed the threats.

223
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,270
这段时间内  内部禁止携带武器
No weapons inside the walls, period.

224
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,250
这样能更好更安全的生活
It's a better way to live. Safer.

225
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,610
整天全副武装对人有影响
Being armed all the time has an effect on people.

226
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,400
也许是我天真  不过这的确带给我希望
Maybe I'm naive, but this gives me hope.

227
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,060
这是关僵尸的笼子吗
Is this a zombie cage?

228
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,170
这些天不怎么用了
Doesn't seem much use these days.

229
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,810
我们每天在附近巡逻两次
We patrol the surrounding area for Zs twice a day,

230
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,210
所以僵尸对我们来说不是问题
so they aren't really a problem.

231
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,480
我们要担心的是人类
It's the people we have to worry about.

232
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,360
自从禁止携带武器以来
Since going weapon-free,

233
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,480
一年多没有出现过死亡事件了
we've gone over a year without a fatality.

234
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,210
想一想  你在外面的世界里
Think about that. You've been out in the world.

235
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,790
过去一年内你目睹过多少死亡事件
How many deaths have you seen in the last year?

236
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,610
够一辈子了
Enough for a lifetime.

237
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,640
如果出现自然死亡又该怎么办呢
What if someone, you know, dies of natural causes?

238
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,400
当然  这有可能发生
Sure, that could happen.

239
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,770
所有门都是自动关闭的
All the doors and gates close automatically,

240
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,650
将院子的每个部分封闭起来  像潜水艇一样
sealing off each section of the compound. Like on a submarine.

241
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,470
僵尸打不开
Can't be opened by Zs.

242
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,440
一切都是防僵尸的
Everything's been zombie-proofed.

243
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,350
你听说过泰坦尼克号没
You ever hear of the Titanic?

244
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,450
欢迎你滚回外面的车上
You're welcome to wait outside in your vehicle.

245
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,160
请原谅我的朋友  他受到不小的刺激
You'll have to forgive my friend. He's been through a lot.

246
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,510
我们也一样
We all have.

247
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,340
没有十全十美的事儿  但我们尽力为之了
Nothing's perfect, but this is as close as it gets.

248
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,940
不久后  大部分人发现
After a while, most people find

249
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,520
他们可以好好的睡上一晚
they can actually sleep through the night.

250
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,870
真的吗  真不敢想象
Really? I can't imagine that.

251
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,050
我们自给自足
We grow all our own fruits and vegetables.

252
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,970
残羹剩饭和垃圾都会进入生物发电机
The scraps and our waste all go into a biomass generator.

253
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,010
我们一天供电4小时
We're up to four hours of electricity a day.

254
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,520
真的吗  好棒
Really? That's cool.

255
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,170
他们什么来头
What's their story?

256
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,420
我们和之前进来的传道士有些矛盾
We had a little trouble a while back with a preacher we took in.

257
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,030
他不可救药了
He drank his own Kool-Aid.

258
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,790
认为僵尸灾变实际是基督再临
Decided the Zompocalypse was actually The Second Coming

259
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,270
我们应该挽救僵尸而不是杀了他们
and we needed to save the Zs, not kill them.

260
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,940
他称僵尸为"重生者"  真是疯子
Calls them "The Resurrected." Real whack-job.

261
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,650
我不是研究《圣经》的专家
I'm not an expert on the Bible,

262
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,400
但我肯定《圣经》中没有提到僵尸
but I'm pretty sure there's nothing in there about zombies.

263
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,450
我们把他和他的追随者都踢了出去
We had to kick him out, along with his followers.

264
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,030
我之前也见过  疯狂的思想传得很快
I've seen this kind of thing before. Crazy spreads fast.

265
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,810
那你为什么让他们回来
So why would you let them back in?

266
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,750
他们有家人在这里
They all had family still here.

267
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,410
我知道一旦他们出去一段时间
I knew once they were out a while,

268
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,800
就会挨饿害怕  一部分人会回来的
they'd get hungry or scared and some would come back.

269
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,920
像发条一样  今天这三人回来了
Like clockwork these three turned up today.

270
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,900
不是真正的信徒哦
Not true believers, huh?

271
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,510
肚子空空能去信谁
Hard to believe on an empty stomach.

272
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,380
说到这  让你的人吃点东西吧
Speaking of which, let's get you people something to eat.

273
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,890
第一餐我请客  之后就得交易了
First meal is on me. The rest you trade for.

274
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,120
当然  没有肉  希望你们都是素食者
No meat of course. Hope you're vegetarian.

275
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,190
好吧
Oh yeah.

276
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,280
我们的目的地是加州的疾病控制中心研究所
We're headed to a CDC lab in California.

277
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,770
你们永远也到不了加利福尼亚
You're never gonna make it to California.

278
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,030
是啊  别人一直都这么对我说   
Yeah, that's what I've been told.

279
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,850
不  我是认真的
No, seriously.

280
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,730
僵尸都群集在西部  数百万计的僵尸
The Zs are swarming out west. Millions of them.

281
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,440
我一直从别人或第三方消息来源那听说  
Been hearing about it second and third hand.

282
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,020
城市里已被啃食得消失殆尽
Nothing left to eat in the city,

283
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,360
所以他们涌向旷野  形成超级僵尸群
so they're pouring into open country, forming mega herds.

284
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,070
谣传整个西海岸都是禁区
Rumor has it the whole west coast is a no-go zone.

285
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,700
我们还是要尝试一下
Well we still got to try.

286
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,010
那个人很讨厌
The guy's a pain in the ass,

287
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,610
但他是我们能被治愈的唯一机会
but he's our only chance for a cure.

288
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,670
如果你死了就什么也救不上了
Getting yourself killed won't cure anything.

289
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,010
我这早就需要你们了
I could use you here.

290
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,370
我需要训练有素的士兵和经验丰富的医生
I need experienced soldiers and a doctor.

291
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,030
这是个诱人的提议  乔
That's a tempting offer, Joe.

292
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,980
但是我们得继续前行
But we got to keep going.

293
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,250
我们时间紧迫
Clock's ticking on our guy.

294
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,040
实际上  我可以借助你的力量
In fact, I could use your help.

295
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,820
我们这一路上也需要像你这样的老派硬汉
We could use an old school ass kicker like you out on the road.

296
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,880
我也不知道  我看到过无数次希望破灭
I don't know. I've seen so much hope come to nothing.

297
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,140
这是我第一次投身于
This is the first thing I've been a part of

298
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,370
一个可行的事情里
that might actually work.

299
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,220
这些人依赖着我
These folks rely on me.

300
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,370
我知道
I know.

301
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,020
我明白了
I get it.

302
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,750
我有个备用房间  你们之中的两三个可以住进去
I've got a spare room two or three of you can use.

303
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,040
其他人就得在公共休息室睡了
The rest can grab a bunk in the community room.

304
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,430
让我考虑考虑你说的
Let me think about what you said.

305
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,310
我们明天再继续  你们也休息一下
We'll talk more tomorrow. In the meantime, get some rest.

306
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,090
谢谢
Thanks.

307
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,150
谢谢你
Thank you.

308
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,920
老兄  老兄  慢点  他们又不会拿走
Dude. Dude, slow down. They're not gonna take it from you.

309
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,540
所以
So...

310
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,700
我们摸清这的起居安排了
We got the lowdown on the sleeping situation.

311
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,060
有个房间  大家之中的两个或三个可以共住
There's a room that two or three of us can share,

312
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,260
并且这里还有公共休息室
and there's a communal bunk.

313
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,370
那个房间归老子了
Dibs on the room.

314
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,410
怎么了  这能减少他们弄清我身份的风险
What? Be less risk of anyone figuring out who I am.

315
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,630
我觉得我们应该把房间让给他俩
I think we should give it to those two.

316
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,020
什么  不不不  我们不是...
What, no, no, no. We're not a...

317
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,970
是啊  你们住吧
Yeah, you guys take it.

318
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:53,570
是啊
Yeah.

319
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,120
有这么明显吗
Is it that obvious?

320
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,380
好吧
Well...

321
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,240
如果我们能承受得起后果
If we're gonna do the time,

322
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,220
真去做点"坏事"又何妨呢
we may as well do the crime.

323
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,300
-你是认真的吗  -当然  
- Are you serious? - Yes.

324
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,960
额  这可不太像我之前想的...
It's not exactly what I was...

325
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,460
这太完美了
It's perfect.

326
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,590
罗伯塔
Roberta, ummm...

327
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,680
怎么了
Yeah?

328
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,110
我是想说  快看
I mean, come on.

329
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,150
这间屋子  有张床
This room, it's like you know here's the bed.

330
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,070
它很...
It's...

331
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,570
舒适
cozy.

332
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:18,760
舒适
Cozy.

333
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,000
是啊
Yeah.

334
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,410
我不知道该说点什么
I don't know what to say.

335
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,090
什么也不要说
Don't say anything.

336
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,710
额  我身上没有...  那个
Hey, ummm, I don't have any...

337
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,810
我们会想出其他办法的
We'll think of something.

338
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,890
我上的是天主教学校[禁止婚外性行为]
I went to Catholic school.

339
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,360
这样啊
Oh.

340
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,340
椅子拿来
Chair.

341
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,130
对
All right.

342
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,680
你怕有修女进来吗
What are you worried about the nuns?

343
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,040
谁知道呢
Never know.

344
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,750
因为有福音传给我们
For indeed we have had good news preached to us,

345
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,430
正如传给非信徒一样
just as the unbelievers.

346
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,540
只是他们所闻之道于他们无益
But the word they heard did not profit them,

347
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,610
因为他们已将事实拒于心门之外
for their hearts were closed to the truth.

348
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,580
所以我们
So then we

349
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,270
要帮他们看清事实
shall open their eyes.

350
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,800
那家伙才被赶出去
That fella seems pretty popular

351
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,750
一回来就这么受欢迎啊
for a guy who just got kicked out of here.

352
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,860
那边的日子没想象中好过
It was a lot harder than we expected it.

353
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,320
所以我想着还是回来好了
Thought we'd be better off back here.

354
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,870
少校允许你回来  你挺幸运的
Lucky for you the Major was willing to take you in again.

355
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,290
是啊  我们都很幸运
Yes, it was lucky for us all.

356
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,640
嘿  卢克  你回来了呀
Hey, Luke. Glad to see you back, man.

357
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,280
我知道你不会蠢到相信那个雅各布小丑的
I knew you were too smart to fall for that Jacob clown.

358
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:32,950
是啊
Yeah.

359
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,720
去了之后发现跟我想的完全不一样
It wasn't at all what I thought it was gonna be.

360
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,770
很高兴我能回来
Glad to be back.

361
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,180
我好像把一些药落在弹药包里了
I think I left some meds in my ammo bag.

362
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,510
你能帮我找找吗
Do you mind checking for me?

363
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,500
没问题  等等
Sure, hang on.

364
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,800
嘿  你没事吧
Hey, are you all right?

365
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,080
所有人  都听着
Listen to me, all of you,

366
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,040
我有好消息要告诉你们
for I have good news.

367
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,120
少校不相信雅各布的善言
The major didn't believe in the word of Jacob.

368
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,550
但他以后会的
But he will.

369
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,930
你们还有一次机会聆听雅各布的善言
All of you will be given another chance to hear his word

370
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,790
加入重生教堂
and join the Resurrection Church.

371
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,900
你干什么  给我下来
What are you doing? Get down from there.

372
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,240
他身上有武器
He's got a weapon!

373
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,550
父怎样叫死人起来  使他们活着
For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life,

374
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,830
子也照样随自己的意思使人活着
so also the Son gives life to whom he will.

375
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,980
他要变异了
He's gonna turn.

376
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,430
该死
Damn it.

377
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,280
天哪  卢克
Oh God! Luke!

378
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,810
帮我关好门  不能放僵尸进去
Help me secure these doors! We have to contain this!

379
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,110
你确定你没上过天主教学校吗
Are you sure you didn't go to Catholic school?

380
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,860
嗯哼  走开
Uh-uh. Go away!

381
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,890
喂  关键时刻别来打扰我们
Hey! This is a very bad time to bother us.

382
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,130
哦  很不是时候哦
Oh, terrible time.

383
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,610
谁在外面
Who's there?

384
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,690
僵尸
Zombies?

385
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:27,960
不会的
It can't be.

386
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,020
摩菲
Murphy!

387
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,300
摩菲
Murphy!

388
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,620
摩菲  快点
Murphy! Come on!

389
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,450
快来啊
Come on!

390
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,210
快来  走吧  快啊
Come on! Let's go! Hurry!

391
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,520
我现在只想要我的僵尸重击锤
I would give my left nut for that z-whacker right now!

392
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,580
大家快点啊
Come on, you guys!

393
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,460
快跑
Let's go!

394
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,550
这个太可怕了
Oh, that was a bad one.

395
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,360
摩菲哪儿去了
Where's Murphy?

396
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,610
我最后只看到他从别的门跑出去了
The last we saw, he ran out some other door.

397
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,430
要拿皮带把那家伙拴住才行
We need a leash for that guy.

398
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,770
有人把门撬开放僵尸进来了
Someone wedged that door open for the zombies.

399
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,440
什么
What?

400
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,860
我们一次干掉一只都费劲
We can barely face these guys one at a time.

401
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,650
这次爆发扩散了  会有五十只一起冲来
This outbreak spreads, they'll be coming at us 50 at a time.

402
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,180
摩菲和其他人怎么办
What about Murphy and the others?

403
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,720
我也不知道  我们需要武器
I don't know. We need weapons.

404
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,200
乔
Joe.

405
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,850
怎么回事
What the hell happened?

406
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,430
是雅各布和他的信徒
Jacob and his cult.

407
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,660
我们重新接收回来的那几个人切开了自己的喉咙
The ones we let back in slit their throats.

408
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,810
该死的  自杀变成了僵尸
Goddamn suicide zombies.

409
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,890
是他们阴谋破坏了那些门
They sabotaged the doors.

410
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,270
混账疯子
Insane bastards.

411
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:20,560
我们努力做的一切已经没了  都没了
Everything we've worked for, it's gone. All gone.

412
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,850
我们需要武器
We need weapons.

413
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,060
武器库已经全是僵尸了  我们进不去
The armory's full of Zs. We can't get in there.

414
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,430
肯定还有被你藏起来的
Well you got to have some hidden somewhere.

415
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,110
没有  都在笼子里
No. They're all in the cage.

416
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,920
全部吗
All of them?!

417
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,690
那我们怎么自卫
How are we supposed to defend ourselves?!

418
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,120
我以为没有僵尸能进的来
I thought we were zombie-proofed!

419
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,090
听着  乔
Hey, Joe.

420
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,500
你不能崩溃  伙计
You got to pull yourself together, man.

421
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,890
肯定有办法出去
There's got to be a way out of here.

422
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:37,910
加内特
Garnett!

423
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,080
感谢上帝你没事
Thank God you're okay.

424
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,100
摩菲呢
Where's Murphy?

425
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,270
我们走散了  到处都是僵尸
Got separated. Zombies everywhere.

426
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,100
一万呢
10K?

427
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,540
他也不见了
He's out there somewhere.

428
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,110
他能保护自己
If anyone can make it he can.

429
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,620
那要有枪才行
If only he had his gun.

430
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,040
在我们完全沦陷之前
You have to get to the emergency exit

431
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,340
你们必须到紧急出口去
before we're completely overrun.

432
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,030
出口在哪
Where is it?

433
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:56,970
穿过那些门
Through those doors.

434
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,980
长长的走廊尽头有一个加固门
There's a long hallway ending in a reinforced door.

435
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,240
出去就能到外面了
It leads outside the perimeter.

436
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,820
然后一直跑到树林那边不要停
Don't stop till you hit the woods,

437
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,330
然后你们就可以折回到你们的卡车那了
then you can double back around to your truck.

438
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,210
那你怎么办
What about you?

439
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,600
我要留在这  尽我所能地救人
I've got to stay and try to save as many as I can.

440
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:08,550
准备好了吗
Ready?

441
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,340
好了
Indeed.

442
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,140
很好  出发
All right, let's go!

443
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,200
杀了你  该死的僵尸
Die you freakin' Z!

444
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,260
我是人  我是人  我是人
Human! Human. Human.

445
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,270
抱歉  你看起来好像僵尸
Sorry. You look like one of them.

446
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,240
你自己脸色也不太好  亲爱的
You don't look so good yourself, sweetheart.

447
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,990
听着  我需要帮助
Look, I need some help.

448
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:45,440
好  我们一起行动  两个人机会更大
Okay. We'll stick together. Two of us might have a chance.

449
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,950
你怎么不帮忙
Why didn't you help?

450
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,330
僵尸怎么不攻击你
Why didn't it attack you?

451
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,750
是不是你的阴谋
Are you part of this?!

452
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,060
不  不
No! No.

453
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,200
救命  看在上帝的份上
Help me! For God's sake!

454
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,960
不要走
Don't leave me!

455
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:37,120
来吧  兄弟姐妹们  我预言过的
Come, brothers and sisters! It is as I foretold!

456
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,800
基督再临就在此处
Our Second Coming is here!

457
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,580
看吧  重生者
Behold the Resurrected!

458
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,720
是时候得到属于我们的东西了
It's time to take what is rightfully ours.

459
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,120
活捉亵渎神明的人
Bring me the Blasphemers alive.

460
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,350
死路  打不开
It's jammed! It won't open!

461
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,770
回去  回去
Turn around! Turn around!

462
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,510
退后  门堵上了
Back up! The door's blocked!

463
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,730
大家  我们难逃一劫的
Guys, we're not gonna make it.

464
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,430
我们得转过身
We have to turn around!

465
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,410
退回去
Go back!

466
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,380
退回去
Go back!

467
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,760
快点
Come on!

468
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,310
查理  我很害怕
Charlie, I'm scared.

469
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,220
把那些僵尸推回去
Push those Zs back!

470
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,430
我甚至没法转过身
I can't even turn around.

471
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,320
推
Push!

472
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,550
艾迪  艾迪  艾迪
Addy! Addy! Addy!

473
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,250
坚持住  艾迪  过来这里
Stay with me! Addy! Come here.

474
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,760
喂喂  没事的
Hey, hey. It's okay.

475
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,380
我们撑不了多久了
We're not gonna last much longer.

476
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,040
一万
10k!

477
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,080
快点  快点
Come on. Come on.

478
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,320
我们要怎样离开这里
How do we get out of here?

479
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,680
我只能在屋顶上走动
I've been using the roofs to move.

480
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,270
那群狂热信徒在楼里  持械
The cult freaks are in the compound. Armed.

481
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,060
摩菲呢
Murphy?

482
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,810
没看到他
Haven't seen him.

483
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:30,530
我们需要武器
We need weapons.

484
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,900
然后再去找摩菲  行动
Then we'll find Murphy. Let's go.

485
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,180
兄弟姐妹们好
Greetings brothers and sisters.

486
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,000
重生教堂欢迎你
The Resurrection Church welcomes you.

487
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,880
请把双手举高
Please raise your hands to the heavens

488
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,190
否则我就地让你们重生
or I will resurrect you where you stand.

489
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,560
让他们走
Let them go.

490
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,730
重生者会处理他们的
The Resurrected will take care of them.

491
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,760
留下的人跟我们走
The rest of you, come with us.

492
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,130
最后一批重生者已经被控制了
The last of the Resurrected have been secured.

493
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,670
而那些在今天逝去的人们
And those who died today have the honor

494
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,500
有幸比我们早一步接受上帝的恩典
of entering into grace ahead of us.

495
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,100
上帝保佑他们一路走来
Blessed is the path before them.

496
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,190
上帝保佑他们前路平安
Blessed will their journey be.

497
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,230
兄弟姐妹们
Brothers and sisters,

498
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,400
我知道现在你们的内心是憎恨的
I know you have hate in your hearts right now

499
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,980
不愿意站出来接受信仰的考验
and do not come willingly to this test of faith.

500
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:31,450
但今天你们每个人都会成为
But today each of you will become part

501
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,850
新重生者教堂的一份子
of the New Resurrection Church.

502
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,830
不管怎样你们得先选择要怎么服务
First however you must choose how you will serve.

503
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,870
你们可以加入生者的队伍
You may join the living flock

504
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:44,030
在活着的每一天为重生者服务
and spend your days serving the Resurrected.

505
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,350
或者选择让你们的灵魂继续
Or your souls taking the next step on their journey

506
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,730
它的永生
to eternal life.

507
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,210
现在是你们做出选择的时候了
The time has come for you to choose.

508
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:56,200
加入我和生者一起走下去
Join me and walk among the living

509
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,090
或者追随这个
or follow this blasphemer

510
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,400
以为可以与正义为敌
who thought he could oppose the righteous

511
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,330
却成了行尸走肉的亵渎者
and now walks among the dead.

512
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:22,180
现在不要为少校感到悲伤  兄弟姐妹们
Now don't feel sorrow for the Major, brothers and sisters.

513
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,260
虽然我们不喜欢以前的他
Although we stood against the man he was,

514
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,970
我们要为他选择加入重生者感到高兴
we take joy in his choice to join the Resurrected!

515
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:32,150
上帝保佑他一路走来
Blessed is the path before him!

516
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,620
什么选择
What choice?

517
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,550
跟你这种疯子一起生活  或死后成为僵尸
To live with you lunatics or die and become a zombie?

518
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,550
我不知道你的名字  兄弟
I don't know your name, brother.

519
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,860
但我欢迎你来到重生教堂
But I welcome you to the Resurrection Church.

520
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,770
跟我们在一起你会得到永恒的快乐和安宁
With us you will know everlasting joy and peace.

521
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,390
以前这里很安宁
There was peace here.

522
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,710
被你杀死的乔·威廉姆斯  给过你安宁
Joe Williams, the man you killed, gave you peace.

523
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:54,450
这里以前很好  这里以前很安全
This was a good place. This was a safe place.

524
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,040
这里可以恢复安宁
And it can be again.

525
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,500
现在还为时不晚  放下武器
It's not too late. Put down your weapons.

526
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,760
让我们过人道的生活
Let's live the way that people are supposed to.

527
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,370
互相帮助  一起工作  现在还来得及
Helping one another, working together. It's not too late.

528
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:07,410
放下武器  释放我们  我们会帮助你们
Put down your weapons. Let us free. We'll help you.

529
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,830
你我相比于那些重生者要更接近上帝
The Resurrected aren't any closer to God than you and I are.

530
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,550
我真嫉妒你  兄弟
I envy you, brother.

531
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,480
你即将迈入重生者的行列
The time for you to walk among the Resurrected is near.

532
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,210
查理
Charlie.

533
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:29,480
我要杀了你  你这个神棍
I'm gonna kill you, you psychotic bastard.

534
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,390
别担心  小姐妹
Don't you worry, sister.

535
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,710
你很快就会步上你宝贝查理的后尘
You won't be far behind your Charlie.

536
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:37,920
快射他
Shoot him.

537
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,260
我没法瞄准
I can't get a shot.

538
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,910
我得去屋顶
I need to get on the roof.

539
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:44,790
你去把卡车开过来
You get the truck.

540
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,820
你们俩都会先我一步获得永生
Rejoice as both of you will walk before me

541
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,060
我真为你俩高兴
on the road to everlasting life.

542
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,250
听着  雅各布
Listen, Jacob.

543
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,780
你可以杀了我  让我重生
Kill me, resurrect me,

544
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,760
但是你要放了其他人
but spare the others.

545
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,830
别怕  兄弟
Don't be afraid, brother.

546
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,390
我是在送你去更棒的地方
I send you to a better place.

547
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,940
他面前就是神明庇佑之路
Blessed is the path before him!

548
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,570
我就是耶稣复活在世  生命之神
I am the new Resurrection and the life.

549
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,430
信我者  虽死犹生
Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live.

550
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,720
够了
Stop!

551
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:34,240
要是你们认为重生者更接近天堂
If you think the Resurrected are one step closer to heaven

552
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,860
那就准备好迎接你们的新上帝吧
then prepare to meet your new god.

553
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,740
快来  兄弟
Come, brother.

554
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,170
快从重生者堆里出来
Step away from the Resurrected.

555
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,840
凡人不该待在那里
That's no place for a mortal human.

556
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,100
快来加入我们  这里欢迎所有凡人
Come join our flock. All are welcome.

557
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,540
加入你们吗
Join your flock?

558
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,550
我不是重生者之一
I am not one of the Resurrected.

559
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,880
我才是你们的救世主
I'm your Messiah.

560
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,560
你这是在亵渎神明  兄弟
That's blasphemy, brother.

561
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,870
大家都看得出你就是一介凡人而已
We can all see you're one of the living.

562
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,200
八次
Eight times!

563
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,900
我被咬过八次
I was bitten

564
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,580
但是我并没有变成僵尸
and did not turn!

565
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:26,980
我被僵尸那血淋淋的唾液感染过八次
Eight times I was infected by their bloody saliva.

566
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,920
但如今我完好无损站你们面前
And yet here I stand before you.

567
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,930
我想要告诉你们
And I am here to tell you that he

568
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,950
他就是个假先知
is a false prophet!

569
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:44,140
因为我才是真正的耶稣复活在世
For I am the true incarnation of the Resurrected!

570
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,290
他到底在做什么
What the hell is he doing?

571
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,150
我也搞不清楚
I have no idea.

572
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,920
把这个渎神者干掉
Kill the blasphemer.

573
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,270
但是他身上那些咬痕  雅各布
But the bites, Jacob.

574
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,380
他是个假先知
He's a false prophet!

575
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,500
我能够证明
I can prove it!

576
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,430
我能够证明我所言不假
I can prove that my words are true.

577
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,810
那说来听听吧  渎神者
Tell us, blasphemer.

578
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,210
这个弥天大谎你还想要怎么圆
How can you possibly prove this outrageous lie?

579
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,110
我会证明给你看
I'll show you.

580
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,250
好好看着吧  你们这群怀疑论者
Observe Ye of little faith.

581
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,730
天呐[耶稣]
Jesus.

582
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,710
不是  就是摩菲而已
No. Just Murphy.

583
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,320
好  这样就够了
Okay, that's enough of that.

584
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:05,180
重生者不会攻击我
The Resurrected will not attack me

585
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,890
因为他们爱我敬我
because they love and fear me.

586
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,100
大家好好看清楚
Behold my flock.

587
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,370
这就是你们要的证据  兄弟姐妹们
There's your proof, brothers and sisters!

588
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,460
放我们走  雅各布
Now let us go, Jacob,

589
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,430
不然我们的人会让你们全部复活
before my flock resurrects all of you!

590
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,080
雅各布  如果他说的是事实怎么办
Jacob, what if he's speaking the truth?

591
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,320
他不是救世主  我会证明这一点
He's no messiah. I'll prove it.

592
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,820
你还要通过最后一个测试  亵渎神明的人
There's one last test for you to pass, blasphemer.

593
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,730
见鬼
Damn it.

594
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,290
一颗穿心的子弹即可揭示真相
A bullet to the heart will reveal the truth!

595
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,830
不要
No!

596
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,870
查理
Charlie.

597
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,870
查理
Charlie.

598
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,270
你不会有事的
You'll be ok.

599
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:24,740
去救  去救摩菲
Go get... Go get Murphy.

600
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,150
不  我不会离开你
No. I'm not leaving you.

601
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,370
我爱你
I love you.

602
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,520
我也爱你
I love you too.

603
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,090
那就走
Then go.

604
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,630
活下去
Live.

605
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,430
不
No.

606
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,440
别
Don't.

607
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,460
别走
Don't go.

608
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,000
快点
Come on!

609
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:14,880
沃伦  我们得走了
Warren, we have to go.

610
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,110
-不  -我们得马上走
- No. - We have to go now!

611
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,510
我们不能让他变异
We can't let him turn!

612
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,630
不  我们必须对他"施以仁慈"
No! We have to give him mercy!

613
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,420
没有时间了
There's no time!

614
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,270
不  让我去
No! Let me go!

615
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,540
不行  等一下
No! Wait a minute!

616
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,560
没有时间了
There's no time.

617
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:28,420
不  不要  等一下
No. No. Wait!

618
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,500
等一下
Wait!

619
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,620
快点  快点  快点
Come on. Come on. Come on.

620
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,130
我们得走了  一万
We have to go, 10K!

621
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,380
她在干什么
What is she doing?

622
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,190
查尔斯·加内特
Charles Garnett,

623
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,870
我仁慈地结束你的生命
I give you mercy.

624
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,470
我们走吧
Let's go.

625
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,870
也许有一天我们会发现
Someday maybe we'll find out

626
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,300
僵尸灾变发生的真正原因
the real reason the Zombie Apocalypse happened.

627
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,410
所有的死亡和毁灭  所有的痛苦和悲伤
All this death and destruction. All the pain and heartache.

628
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:49,330
我们可以怪责谁
Who do we blame?

629
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,770
也许是政府实验室的病毒出逃
Maybe it was a government virus that escaped the lab.

630
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,200
也许是巫毒
Maybe it was voodoo.

631
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,210
或者也许只是上帝看我们不顺眼
Or maybe God just doesn't like us.

632
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,410
但有时候
Some days though

633
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,840
我会想这是不是我们咎由自取
I wonder if we brought this on ourselves.

634
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:07,430
我们有过机会用正确的方式对待这个星球
We had a chance to do this whole planet earth thing right, and...

635
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,270
而我们搞砸了
and we blew it.

636
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:13,490
这个世界末日是我们罪有应得
We got the Apocalypse we deserved.

637
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,280
但如果我们运气好
But if we're lucky,

638
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,600
某一天这一切终将结束
some day this will all be over.

639
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:21,910
我希望如此
I hope so.

640
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,420
但下一次  我希望我们别再做错
And next time, I hope we get it right.

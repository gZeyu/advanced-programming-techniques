{\an8}{\pos(185.6,49.901)}.

00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,090
{\an8}{\pos(228.267,57.0297)}.

17
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,090
{\an8}{\pos(150.4,193.188)}.

19
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,330
Previously on Z Nation.

20
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,590
Those are zombie bites.

21
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:04,600
Eight of them.

22
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,930
You're looking at the only human known to have survived

23
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,060
being bitten by a zombie.

24
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,150
If we can get him to the lab in California

25
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,840
they can use his blood and make more of the vaccine.

26
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,060
Is that what I think?!

27
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,220
They ain't sharks!

28
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,240
You still think about him?

29
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,300
Antoine?

30
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,320
I try not to.

31
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,120
Antoine?

32
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:20,930
Is that him?

33
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:21,820
No.

34
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,010
Even if I never know for sure what happened to Antoine

35
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,100
I'm okay with being here now with you.

36
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,650
I'm good with that too.

37
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,230
This is a national emergency.

38
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,480
I've decided to catalog

39
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,020
all the theories about where the Z virus came from.

40
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,540
There's more than a few.

41
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,560
Is it what the Zoroastrians would call Frashokereti?

42
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,530
Or are we contaminated with Amazon brain rot?

43
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,390
Or maybe we passed through the tail of a comet

44
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,150
that sprinkled the earth with zombie dust.

45
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,520
Or was it a defense department weaponized virus

46
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,580
that escaped the lab?

47
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,250
Or how about

48
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,740
self fulfilling prophecy.

49
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,740
Public fascination with all things zombie just

50
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,550
willed it into existence.

51
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,630
As things went south the theories got weirder.

52
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,680
Good times for religions with an end of the world scenario.

53
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,960
The crazier the better.

54
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,540
The Apocalypse business was booming.

55
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,720
At least while there still was business to boom.

57
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,480
It reminds me of a poem by Yeats.

58
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,570
"And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,

59
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,830
slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?"

60
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,370
There is no cure.

61
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,740
What rough beast indeed.

63
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,360
Father, we ask that watch over our brothers and sisters

64
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,920
as they leave our congregation for a greater journey.

65
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,240
Amen.

66
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,420
And although we will not see them again in this life,

67
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,480
they will live on through their sacrifice.

68
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,240
Now I ask you all to rise.

69
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,850
Brother Eli, Brother Matthew,

70
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,960
please help with the Resurrected

71
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,900
Let us pray.

72
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,140
For today is a day of joy.

74
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,020
I ask now for the anointed to please step forward.

75
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,950
These brothers and sisters

76
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,250
will soon know the true meaning of peace

77
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,360
that only belief and resurrection can bring.

78
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,250
May these keep you safe on your journey

79
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,160
and serve as the instrument of your salvation.

80
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,520
I envy you, brothers.

81
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:48,990
Sister.

82
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,540
Let us ring the bell

83
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,950
and joyously call out for more of the resurrected

84
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,460
to join our flock.

85
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,970
Brother Eli.

86
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,240
Brother Matthew.

87
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,900
Please prepare to greet them.

88
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,380
No Zs in sight.

89
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,420
Anybody else worried about Mr. Sunshine out there?

90
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,090
I know.

91
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,210
He's looking worse.

92
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,460
Yeah, he was pretty creepy to start with.

93
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,100
Come on, guys. Give him a break.

94
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,240
It's the Apocalypse. None of us look our best.

95
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,910
It's like one long bad hair day.

96
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,070
Speaking of hair, what's with all the bald patches?

97
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,170
Maybe that vaccine is like zombie chemo.

98
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,870
Or maybe that vaccine isn't working.

99
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,960
What do you think, Doc?

100
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,580
I've seen Zs look better than him.

101
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,700
Will he make it to California?

102
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,340
If we haul ass.

103
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,360
If he goes zombie, we might have to put him down.

104
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,490
Dibs on piking him.

105
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,150
If he turns, piking him's the least of our problems.

106
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,730
What?

107
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,510
Pit stop's over. Let's get moving.

108
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,040
I have a ginormous bladder.

109
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,320
Sue me.

110
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,650
Man, I sure could use some of them Kansas City barbecue ribs about now.

111
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,820
How bout you, darlin'. You're a big rib eater, aren't you?

112
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,310
You know I was almost starting to feel sorry for you.

113
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,440
You look pretty happy for someone who hasn't eaten

114
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,430
in two days.

115
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:15,970
Could be worse.

116
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,010
Really?

117
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,390
We're still alive, aren't we?

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,870
You were always a glass half full kinda guy.

119
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,670
It's what I love about you.

120
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,810
Actually I'm looking forward to getting some food

121
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,790
and a hot shower at Provincetown.

122
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,840
Well don't get your hopes up.

123
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,770
We don't even know if this place still exists.

124
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,880
Hammond had it marked on his map as a resupply place.

125
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,340
And if his contact there is the same Major Williams

126
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,830
from my National Guard days,

127
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,070
we might actually get some help.

128
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,430
So we're relying on the map of a dead guy?

129
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,740
In case you forgot

130
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,410
that dead guy was a hero who died protecting you.

131
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,930
Just because he's dead doesn't make him a hero.

132
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,570
Well I hope Provincetown does exist

133
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,170
because we're out of just about everything but hope.

134
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,170
One thousand five hundred and fifty four.

136
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,040
Surrender all weapons? Are they serious?

137
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,050
Looks like.

138
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,210
What do you wanna do?

139
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,200
Their town, their rules.

140
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,660
Looks like we don't have much of a choice.

141
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,170
Stop right there! This is a private compound.

142
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,230
I'm gonna have to ask you to turn around

143
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,710
and go back the way you came.

144
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,930
I'm looking for Major Wiliams.

145
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,120
Joe Williams.

146
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,960
And who are you?

147
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,660
I'm Sergeant Charles Garnett,

148
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,960
Georgia National Guard.

149
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,020
We've knowm each other going back pre-z.

150
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,020
Wait there. Your crew stays in the truck.

151
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,420
They try to get out or we see a weapon,

152
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,140
we'll fire.

153
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,060
Easy everyone.

154
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,830
Charlie's got it under control.

155
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,700
So you're calling him Charlie now?

156
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,420
Yeah, and I'm gonna start calling you my bitch

157
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,860
if you don't shut up.

158
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,760
Well holy shit.

159
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,670
It's the ghost of Charlie Garnett.

160
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,400
Never expected to see you again. At least not alive.

161
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,660
Hey, Joe. Didn't expect to see you again either.

162
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,430
Looks like we're both still standing.

163
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,860
Looks like.

164
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,520
Last time I saw you,

165
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,180
you were pulling my ass out of a ditch full of Zs.

166
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,880
Just returning the favor.

167
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,610
How many Zs we kill that day?

168
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,100
Not enough.

169
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,950
Do you mind?

170
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,380
Stand down.

171
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,630
You're the first person I've seen from before.

172
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,750
How the hell you end up here?

173
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,180
I'm actually on a mission for the government,

174
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,390
if you can believe that.

175
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,990
If it was anybody but you,

176
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,160
I wouldn't.

177
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,110
We've come from New York. Haven't eaten in a few days.

178
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,130
New York?

179
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,220
Haven't seen anyone

180
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,590
east of the Mississippi for over a year.

181
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,690
How many of you are there?

182
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,690
Eight. Including a doctor.

183
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,750
Real doctor?

184
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:06,900
Sort of.

185
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,610
He's watched a lot of E.R.

186
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,220
All right.

187
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,010
Come inside and tell me your story. We'll get you some food.

188
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,090
But the truck stays outside.

189
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,200
Let them in.

190
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,050
And of course you'll have to check your weapons.

191
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,750
Just make sure we get these back.

192
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,310
Why is this not making me feel any safer?

193
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,170
Looks like it's seen a little action.

194
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,660
Ex prison guard?

195
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,610
TSA.

196
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,480
Just like Dodge City.

197
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,130
We have our reasons.

198
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,170
Makes sense.

199
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,630
Strong on the outside.

200
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,690
Safe on the inside.

201
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,830
Major, you're not gonna believe this.

202
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,790
Three of Jacob's flock are back.

203
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,860
Major Williams?

204
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,000
We'd like to come back.

205
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,610
We were wrong to leave.

206
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,220
Jacob turned out to be just some crazy cult leader.

207
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,430
We brought food.

208
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,590
What do you want us to do?

209
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,000
If they're clean, let 'em back in.

210
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,120
Probably won't be the last of his sheep to wander back.

211
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,990
I feel so much lighter without that damn hammer.

212
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,210
Yeah, I feel naked, and not in a good way.

213
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,740
When we started out, everyone was armed.

214
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,040
Then one day a guy decided to shoot his wife's boyfriend.

215
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,560
He turned, and we lost five people.

216
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,920
So we made a rule.

217
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,960
Only guards could carry inside.

218
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,610
Then a trading group came in. Took a gun off a guard.

219
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,160
Seven dead that time. We were lucky it wasn't worse.

220
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,230
We have a strong perimeter. Never been breached.

221
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,740
All our problems happened inside.

222
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,230
So we removed the threats.

223
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,270
No weapons inside the walls, period.

224
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,250
It's a better way to live. Safer.

225
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,610
Being armed all the time has an effect on people.

226
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,400
Maybe I'm naive, but this gives me hope.

227
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,060
Is this a zombie cage?

228
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,170
Doesn't seem much use these days.

229
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,810
We patrol the surrounding area for Zs twice a day,

230
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,210
so they aren't really a problem.

231
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,480
It's the people we have to worry about.

232
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,360
Since going weapon-free,

233
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,480
we've gone over a year without a fatality.

234
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,210
Think about that. You've been out in the world.

235
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,790
How many deaths have you seen in the last year?

236
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,610
Enough for a lifetime.

237
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,640
What if someone, you know, dies of natural causes?

238
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,400
Sure, that could happen.

239
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,770
All the doors and gates close automatically,

240
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,650
sealing off each section of the compound. Like on a submarine.

241
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,470
Can't be opened by Zs.

242
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,440
Everything's been zombie-proofed.

243
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,350
You ever hear of the Titanic?

244
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,450
You're welcome to wait outside in your vehicle.

245
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,160
You'll have to forgive my friend. He's been through a lot.

246
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,510
We all have.

247
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,340
Nothing's perfect, but this is as close as it gets.

248
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,940
After a while, most people find

249
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,520
they can actually sleep through the night.

250
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,870
Really? I can't imagine that.

251
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,050
We grow all our own fruits and vegetables.

252
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,970
The scraps and our waste all go into a biomass generator.

253
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,010
We're up to four hours of electricity a day.

254
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,520
Really? That's cool.

255
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,170
What's their story?

256
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,420
We had a little trouble a while back with a preacher we took in.

257
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,030
He drank his own Kool-Aid.

258
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,790
Decided the Zompocalypse was actually The Second Coming

259
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,270
and we needed to save the Zs, not kill them.

260
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,940
Calls them "The Resurrected." Real whack-job.

261
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,650
I'm not an expert on the Bible,

262
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,400
but I'm pretty sure there's nothing in there about zombies.

263
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,450
We had to kick him out, along with his followers.

264
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,030
I've seen this kind of thing before. Crazy spreads fast.

265
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,810
So why would you let them back in?

266
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,750
They all had family still here.

267
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,410
I knew once they were out a while,

268
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,800
they'd get hungry or scared and some would come back.

269
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,920
Like clockwork these three turned up today.

270
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,900
Not true believers, huh?

271
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,510
Hard to believe on an empty stomach.

272
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,380
Speaking of which, let's get you people something to eat.

273
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,890
First meal is on me. The rest you trade for.

274
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,120
No meat of course. Hope you're vegetarian.

275
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,190
Oh yeah.

276
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,280
We're headed to a CDC lab in California.

277
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,770
You're never gonna make it to California.

278
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,030
Yeah, that's what I've been told.

279
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,850
No, seriously.

280
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,730
The Zs are swarming out west. Millions of them.

281
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,440
Been hearing about it second and third hand.

282
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,020
Nothing left to eat in the city,

283
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,360
so they're pouring into open country, forming mega herds.

284
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,070
Rumor has it the whole west coast is a no-go zone.

285
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,700
Well we still got to try.

286
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,010
The guy's a pain in the ass,

287
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,610
but he's our only chance for a cure.

288
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,670
Getting yourself killed won't cure anything.

289
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,010
I could use you here.

290
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,370
I need experienced soldiers and a doctor.

291
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,030
That's a tempting offer, Joe.

292
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,980
But we got to keep going.

293
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,250
Clock's ticking on our guy.

294
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,040
In fact, I could use your help.

295
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,820
We could use an old school ass kicker like you out on the road.

296
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,880
I don't know. I've seen so much hope come to nothing.

297
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,140
This is the first thing I've been a part of

298
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,370
that might actually work.

299
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,220
These folks rely on me.

300
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,370
I know.

301
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,020
I get it.

302
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,750
I've got a spare room two or three of you can use.

303
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,040
The rest can grab a bunk in the community room.

304
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,430
Let me think about what you said.

305
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,310
We'll talk more tomorrow. In the meantime, get some rest.

306
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,090
Thanks.

307
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,150
Thank you.

308
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,920
Dude. Dude, slow down. They're not gonna take it from you.

309
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,540
So...

310
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,700
We got the lowdown on the sleeping situation.

311
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,060
There's a room that two or three of us can share,

312
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,260
and there's a communal bunk.

313
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,370
Dibs on the room.

314
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,410
What? Be less risk of anyone figuring out who I am.

315
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,630
I think we should give it to those two.

316
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,020
What, no, no, no. We're not a...

317
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,970
Yeah, you guys take it.

318
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:53,570
Yeah.

319
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,120
Is it that obvious?

320
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,380
Well...

321
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,240
If we're gonna do the time,

322
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,220
we may as well do the crime.

323
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,300
- Are you serious? - Yes.

324
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,960
It's not exactly what I was...

325
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,460
It's perfect.

326
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,590
Roberta, ummm...

327
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,680
Yeah?

328
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,110
I mean, come on.

329
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,150
This room, it's like you know here's the bed.

330
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,070
It's...

331
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,570
cozy.

332
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:18,760
Cozy.

333
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah.

334
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,410
I don't know what to say.

335
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,090
Don't say anything.

336
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,710
Hey, ummm, I don't have any...

337
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,810
We'll think of something.

338
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,890
I went to Catholic school.

339
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,360
Oh.

340
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,340
Chair.

341
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,130
All right.

342
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,680
What are you worried about the nuns?

343
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,040
Never know.

344
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,750
For indeed we have had good news preached to us,

345
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,430
just as the unbelievers.

346
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,540
But the word they heard did not profit them,

347
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,610
for their hearts were closed to the truth.

348
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,580
So then we

349
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,270
shall open their eyes.

350
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,800
That fella seems pretty popular

351
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,750
for a guy who just got kicked out of here.

352
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,860
It was a lot harder than we expected it.

353
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,320
Thought we'd be better off back here.

354
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,870
Lucky for you the Major was willing to take you in again.

355
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,290
Yes, it was lucky for us all.

356
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,640
Hey, Luke. Glad to see you back, man.

357
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,280
I knew you were too smart to fall for that Jacob clown.

358
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:32,950
Yeah.

359
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,720
It wasn't at all what I thought it was gonna be.

360
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,770
Glad to be back.

361
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,180
I think I left some meds in my ammo bag.

362
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,510
Do you mind checking for me?

363
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,500
Sure, hang on.

364
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,800
Hey, are you all right?

365
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,080
Listen to me, all of you,

366
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,040
for I have good news.

367
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,120
The major didn't believe in the word of Jacob.

368
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,550
But he will.

369
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,930
All of you will be given another chance to hear his word

370
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,790
and join the Resurrection Church.

371
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,900
What are you doing? Get down from there.

372
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,240
He's got a weapon!

373
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,550
For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life,

374
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,830
so also the Son gives life to whom he will.

375
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,980
He's gonna turn.

376
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,430
Damn it.

377
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,280
Oh God! Luke!

378
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,810
Help me secure these doors! We have to contain this!

379
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,110
Are you sure you didn't go to Catholic school?

380
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,860
Uh-uh. Go away!

381
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,890
Hey! This is a very bad time to bother us.

382
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,130
Oh, terrible time.

383
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,610
Who's there?

384
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,690
Zombies?

385
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:27,960
It can't be.

386
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,020
Murphy!

387
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,300
Murphy!

388
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,620
Murphy! Come on!

389
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,450
Come on!

390
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,210
Come on! Let's go! Hurry!

391
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,520
I would give my left nut for that z-whacker right now!

392
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,580
Come on, you guys!

393
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,460
Let's go!

394
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,550
Oh, that was a bad one.

395
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,360
Where's Murphy?

396
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,610
The last we saw, he ran out some other door.

397
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,430
We need a leash for that guy.

398
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,770
Someone wedged that door open for the zombies.

399
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,440
What?

400
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,860
We can barely face these guys one at a time.

401
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,650
This outbreak spreads, they'll be coming at us 50 at a time.

402
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,180
What about Murphy and the others?

403
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,720
I don't know. We need weapons.

404
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,200
Joe.

405
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,850
What the hell happened?

406
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,430
Jacob and his cult.

407
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,660
The ones we let back in slit their throats.

408
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,810
Goddamn suicide zombies.

409
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,890
They sabotaged the doors.

410
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,270
Insane bastards.

411
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:20,560
Everything we've worked for, it's gone. All gone.

412
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,850
We need weapons.

413
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,060
The armory's full of Zs. We can't get in there.

414
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,430
Well you got to have some hidden somewhere.

415
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,110
No. They're all in the cage.

416
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,920
All of them?!

417
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,690
How are we supposed to defend ourselves?!

418
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,120
I thought we were zombie-proofed!

419
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,090
Hey, Joe.

420
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,500
You got to pull yourself together, man.

421
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,890
There's got to be a way out of here.

422
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:37,910
Garnett!

423
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,080
Thank God you're okay.

424
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,100
Where's Murphy?

425
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,270
Got separated. Zombies everywhere.

426
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,100
10K?

427
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,540
He's out there somewhere.

428
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,110
If anyone can make it he can.

429
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,620
If only he had his gun.

430
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,040
You have to get to the emergency exit

431
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,340
before we're completely overrun.

432
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,030
Where is it?

433
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:56,970
Through those doors.

434
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,980
There's a long hallway ending in a reinforced door.

435
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,240
It leads outside the perimeter.

436
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,820
Don't stop till you hit the woods,

437
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,330
then you can double back around to your truck.

438
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,210
What about you?

439
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,600
I've got to stay and try to save as many as I can.

440
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:08,550
Ready?

441
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,340
Indeed.

442
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,140
All right, let's go!

443
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,200
Die you freakin' Z!

444
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,260
Human! Human. Human.

445
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,270
Sorry. You look like one of them.

446
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,240
You don't look so good yourself, sweetheart.

447
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,990
Look, I need some help.

448
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:45,440
Okay. We'll stick together. Two of us might have a chance.

449
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,950
Why didn't you help?

450
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,330
Why didn't it attack you?

451
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,750
Are you part of this?!

452
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,060
No! No.

453
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,200
Help me! For God's sake!

454
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,960
Don't leave me!

455
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:37,120
Come, brothers and sisters! It is as I foretold!

456
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,800
Our Second Coming is here!

457
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,580
Behold the Resurrected!

458
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,720
It's time to take what is rightfully ours.

459
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,120
Bring me the Blasphemers alive.

460
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,350
It's jammed! It won't open!

461
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,770
Turn around! Turn around!

462
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,510
Back up! The door's blocked!

463
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,730
Guys, we're not gonna make it.

464
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,430
We have to turn around!

465
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,410
Go back!

466
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,380
Go back!

467
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,760
Come on!

468
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,310
Charlie, I'm scared.

469
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,220
Push those Zs back!

470
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,430
I can't even turn around.

471
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,320
Push!

472
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,550
Addy! Addy! Addy!

473
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,250
Stay with me! Addy! Come here.

474
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,760
Hey, hey. It's okay.

475
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,380
We're not gonna last much longer.

476
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,040
10k!

477
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,080
Come on. Come on.

478
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,320
How do we get out of here?

479
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,680
I've been using the roofs to move.

480
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,270
The cult freaks are in the compound. Armed.

481
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,060
Murphy?

482
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,810
Haven't seen him.

483
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:30,530
We need weapons.

484
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,900
Then we'll find Murphy. Let's go.

485
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,180
Greetings brothers and sisters.

486
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,000
The Resurrection Church welcomes you.

487
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,880
Please raise your hands to the heavens

488
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,190
or I will resurrect you where you stand.

489
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,560
Let them go.

490
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,730
The Resurrected will take care of them.

491
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,760
The rest of you, come with us.

492
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,130
The last of the Resurrected have been secured.

493
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,670
And those who died today have the honor

494
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,500
of entering into grace ahead of us.

495
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,100
Blessed is the path before them.

496
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,190
Blessed will their journey be.

497
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,230
Brothers and sisters,

498
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,400
I know you have hate in your hearts right now

499
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,980
and do not come willingly to this test of faith.

500
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:31,450
But today each of you will become part

501
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,850
of the New Resurrection Church.

502
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,830
First however you must choose how you will serve.

503
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,870
You may join the living flock

504
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:44,030
and spend your days serving the Resurrected.

505
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,350
Or your souls taking the next step on their journey

506
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,730
to eternal life.

507
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,210
The time has come for you to choose.

508
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:56,200
Join me and walk among the living

509
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,090
or follow this blasphemer

510
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,400
who thought he could oppose the righteous

511
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,330
and now walks among the dead.

512
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:22,180
Now don't feel sorrow for the Major, brothers and sisters.

513
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,260
Although we stood against the man he was,

514
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,970
we take joy in his choice to join the Resurrected!

515
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:32,150
Blessed is the path before him!

516
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,620
What choice?

517
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,550
To live with you lunatics or die and become a zombie?

518
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,550
I don't know your name, brother.

519
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,860
But I welcome you to the Resurrection Church.

520
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,770
With us you will know everlasting joy and peace.

521
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,390
There was peace here.

522
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,710
Joe Williams, the man you killed, gave you peace.

523
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:54,450
This was a good place. This was a safe place.

524
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,040
And it can be again.

525
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,500
It's not too late. Put down your weapons.

526
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,760
Let's live the way that people are supposed to.

527
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,370
Helping one another, working together. It's not too late.

528
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:07,410
Put down your weapons. Let us free. We'll help you.

529
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,830
The Resurrected aren't any closer to God than you and I are.

530
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,550
I envy you, brother.

531
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,480
The time for you to walk among the Resurrected is near.

532
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,210
Charlie.

533
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:29,480
I'm gonna kill you, you psychotic bastard.

534
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,390
Don't you worry, sister.

535
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,710
You won't be far behind your Charlie.

536
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:37,920
Shoot him.

537
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,260
I can't get a shot.

538
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,910
I need to get on the roof.

539
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:44,790
You get the truck.

540
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,820
Rejoice as both of you will walk before me

541
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,060
on the road to everlasting life.

542
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,250
Listen, Jacob.

543
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,780
Kill me, resurrect me,

544
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,760
but spare the others.

545
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,830
Don't be afraid, brother.

546
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,390
I send you to a better place.

547
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,940
Blessed is the path before him!

548
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,570
I am the new Resurrection and the life.

549
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,430
Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live.

550
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,720
Stop!

551
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:34,240
If you think the Resurrected are one step closer to heaven

552
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,860
then prepare to meet your new god.

553
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,740
Come, brother.

554
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,170
Step away from the Resurrected.

555
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,840
That's no place for a mortal human.

556
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,100
Come join our flock. All are welcome.

557
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,540
Join your flock?

558
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,550
I am not one of the Resurrected.

559
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,880
I'm your Messiah.

560
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,560
That's blasphemy, brother.

561
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,870
We can all see you're one of the living.

562
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,200
Eight times!

563
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,900
I was bitten

564
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,580
and did not turn!

565
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:26,980
Eight times I was infected by their bloody saliva.

566
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,920
And yet here I stand before you.

567
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,930
And I am here to tell you that he

568
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,950
is a false prophet!

569
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:44,140
For I am the true incarnation of the Resurrected!

570
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,290
What the hell is he doing?

571
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,150
I have no idea.

572
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,920
Kill the blasphemer.

573
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,270
But the bites, Jacob.

574
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,380
He's a false prophet!

575
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,500
I can prove it!

576
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,430
I can prove that my words are true.

577
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,810
Tell us, blasphemer.

578
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,210
How can you possibly prove this outrageous lie?

579
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,110
I'll show you.

580
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,250
Observe Ye of little faith.

581
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,730
Jesus.

582
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,710
No. Just Murphy.

583
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,320
Okay, that's enough of that.

584
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:05,180
The Resurrected will not attack me

585
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,890
because they love and fear me.

586
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,100
Behold my flock.

587
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,370
There's your proof, brothers and sisters!

588
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,460
Now let us go, Jacob,

589
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,430
before my flock resurrects all of you!

590
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,080
Jacob, what if he's speaking the truth?

591
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,320
He's no messiah. I'll prove it.

592
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,820
There's one last test for you to pass, blasphemer.

593
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,730
Damn it.

594
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,290
A bullet to the heart will reveal the truth!

595
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,830
No!

596
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,870
Charlie.

597
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,870
Charlie.

598
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,270
You'll be ok.

599
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:24,740
Go get... Go get Murphy.

600
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,150
No. I'm not leaving you.

601
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,370
I love you.

602
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,520
I love you too.

603
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,090
Then go.

604
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,630
Live.

605
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,430
No.

606
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,440
Don't.

607
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,460
Don't go.

608
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,000
Come on!

609
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:14,880
Warren, we have to go.

610
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,110
- No. - We have to go now!

611
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,510
We can't let him turn!

612
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,630
No! We have to give him mercy!

613
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,420
There's no time!

614
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,270
No! Let me go!

615
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,540
No! Wait a minute!

616
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,560
There's no time.

617
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:28,420
No. No. Wait!

618
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,500
Wait!

619
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,620
Come on. Come on. Come on.

620
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,130
We have to go, 10K!

621
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,380
What is she doing?

622
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,190
Charles Garnett,

623
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,870
I give you mercy.

624
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,470
Let's go.

625
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,870
Someday maybe we'll find out

626
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,300
the real reason the Zombie Apocalypse happened.

627
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,410
All this death and destruction. All the pain and heartache.

628
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:49,330
Who do we blame?

629
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,770
Maybe it was a government virus that escaped the lab.

630
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,200
Maybe it was voodoo.

631
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,210
Or maybe God just doesn't like us.

632
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,410
Some days though

633
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,840
I wonder if we brought this on ourselves.

634
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:07,430
We had a chance to do this whole planet earth thing right, and...

635
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,270
and we blew it.

636
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:13,490
We got the Apocalypse we deserved.

637
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,280
But if we're lucky,

638
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,600
some day this will all be over.

639
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:21,910
I hope so.

640
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,420
And next time, I hope we get it right.

No!

00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,710
我爱你
I love you.

23
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,500
我也爱你

沃伦  我们得走了
Warren, we have to go.

25
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:14,990
-不  -我们得马上走
- No. - We have to go now!

26
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,490
我们不能让他变异
We can't let him turn.

27
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,000
我们必须对他"施以仁慈"
We have to give him mercy!

28
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,700
大家早上好
Good morning, people.

29
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,510
欢迎来到僵尸爆发第三年
Welcome to the third day of the sixth month

30
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,230
零六个月的第三天
of the year 03 A.Z.

31
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,970
如果你现在在听着广播  说明你还活着
If you're listening to this, it means you're still alive.

32
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,910
那么必须得恭喜一下了
So congratulations.

33
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,460
亦或者同情一下了
Or condolences.

34
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,220
{\an8}欢迎来到堪萨斯

35
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,960
你们懂得  这已无关紧要
You know, whatever.

36
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,600
如果你注意到了我今天的声音比以往都要来的绝望
If you're noticing more despair in my voice than usual today,

37
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,500
那是因为我们失去了一个特殊的人
it's because we lost someone special.

38
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,810
我知道  我们一直都在失去着身边的人
I know, we lose people all the time.

39
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,640
被丧尸咬掉脸颊比活着撑到
Getting your face chewed off by a Z is more common

40
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,560
你下一个生日要容易得多
than making it to your next birthday.

41
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,160
但这个家伙...
But this guy...

42
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,950
这是一位值得提及的人物
This one's worth mentioning.

43
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,860
查尔斯·加内特  陆军国民警卫队预备役中士
Charles Garnett, First Sergeant, Army National Guard Reservist,

44
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:24,190
是一位对上帝  对生活  虔诚的好人
was an honest to God, real life, actual good guy.

45
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,070
他并不只为了自己  他还为别人而战  
He fought for other people, not just for his own survival.

46
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,530
他在最近的日子里  完成了很多不可能完成的任务
And he did something that's pretty much impossible these days.

47
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,730
他给人们带来了希望
He gave people hope.

48
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,400
还记得希望为何物吗
Remember hope?

49
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,290
还记得我们也曾想象过  我们也许最终
Remember thinking that we might actually

50
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,550
真的会挺过这次灾难吗
come out on the other side of this thing?

51
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,140
是的  就是那希望
Yeah. That.

52
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,030
加内特中士为了带给我们这样一个希望而死
Sergeant Garnett died trying to give us a reason to hope.

53
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,180
出于您的行为...
And for that...

54
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,940
查尔斯·加内特中士
Sergeant Charles Garnett.

55
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,980
我仅代表这个伟大的国度
On behalf of a grateful nation,

56
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,530
不管我们现在变成了何等鬼样子
or whatever the hell we are now,

57
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,210
我们向您致敬
we salute you.

58
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,020
又是散热器吗
Radiator?

59
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,840
是啊
Yeah.

60
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,720
修得了吗
Fixable?

61
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:41,870
说不准
Don't know.

62
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,370
汗  我们要能有个机修工该多好
Gee, if we only had a mechanic.

63
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
老兄  你得让她自己缓缓
You got to let her deal, man.

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,830
她有创伤后的压力嘛
She's got that post-traumatic stress.

65
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,950
她有创伤后的压力  呵呵
She's got post-traumatic stress?

66
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,720
全世界都有创伤后的压力好吗
The whole world's got post-traumatic stress.

67
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,100
实际上根本没有关于这玩意的确切说法
Actually there isn't anything post about it.

68
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,190
我们现在所有人一直都会有那些
We all got plain ol' present tense,

69
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,950
什么创伤啦  压力之类的
all traumatic, all stress all the time.

70
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,380
怎么就非要对她特殊照顾
What makes her so special?

71
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,760
喂  醒醒了  喂
Hey. Wake up. Hey.

72
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,960
不  你不能就坐这看光景
No, you can't just check out.

73
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,870
我们有任务要完成
We got a job to do.

74
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,640
我现在也没多少时间了
And I am running out of time.

75
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,480
距离加利福尼亚还有2000里的恶路要走
And California is still 2,000 miles of bad road away.

76
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,490
没有你的带领  我们是到不了的
And we are not gonna make it without you.

77
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,950
因为他们接下来不会听我的
Cuz it's not like they're gonna follow me

78
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,280
也不会听老头子的或是摩托车上那俩奇葩的
or the old man or the wonder twins out there.

79
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,250
喂
Hey.

80
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,120
好吧  我和安迪去前面探探路
All right, Addy and I will scout up ahead.

81
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,500
看看能不能找到帮手
See if we can get some help.

82
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,760
我们去找吗
We will?

83
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,070
对
Yeah.

84
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,860
额  我也不确定  但我觉得我们该待在一起
Yeah, I don't know guys. I think we should stick together.

85
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,830
不  多克  不用担心  
No, Doc. Don't worry.

86
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,920
我们就去前面兜一圈然后就回来找你们
We're just gonna scout ahead and circle back around and find you.

87
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,350
反正你们在卡车里也跑不远
I mean it's not like you're getting far in the truck.

88
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,110
快来吧  安迪
Come on, Addy.

89
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,870
我也不敢相信我会这么说  不过
I can't believe I'm saying this, but

90
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,230
如果沃伦一直走不出来怎么办
what if Warren doesn't snap out of it?

91
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,410
她不会就此放弃的
She's not giving up.

92
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,330
行吧  但我们
All right, well

93
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,270
也不可能坐以待毙奢望帮助会自动上门吧
we can't just sit here and wait for help to come.

94
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,020
我们得做点什么
I mean we got to do something.

95
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:22,800
好吧
Okay.

96
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,150
我找到散热器水管上的漏洞了
I found the leak in the radiator hose.

97
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,570
我补了一下  不过
Taped it up a little bit, but

98
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,100
要往里面倒点水  我们才能继续上路
we're not going anywhere unless we get some water in there.

99
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,970
我渴了
I get thirsty.

100
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,780
大家都很渴
We all get thirsty.

101
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,620
我来开车
I'll drive.

102
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,070
随便开  孩子
Knock yourself out, kid.

103
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,850
悠着点  孩子
Easy there, kid! Easy!

104
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,750
谁教你开的车
Who taught you how to drive?

105
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,060
没人教过我
No one.

106
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,340
手放在方向盘十点和两点的位置
Hands on the ten and the two.

107
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,560
轻踩油门
And easy on the gas.

108
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,370
这里什么都没有
Nothin' out here.

109
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,640
没人  没汽油  连僵尸都没有
No people, no gas, not even Zs.

110
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,770
算了  我们回去吧
Nah, we got to go back.

111
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,640
这里没什么能帮得上忙
There is no help out here.

112
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,050
回去也一样
There's no help back there either.

113
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,370
我们必须要回去  麦克
We have to go back, Mack.

114
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,210
我们有任务在身
We have a mission.

115
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,980
我们许下了承诺
We made a promise.

116
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,250
其实  我们并没有
No, we didn't.

117
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,160
我们从来都没承诺什么
We never did.

118
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,780
艾迪  我们只对彼此许下了承诺
Addy, the only promise we ever made was to each other.

119
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,930
努力活下去
To stay alive.

120
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,170
是的  没错
Look, yeah, okay.

121
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,550
也许我们没有说出来  也没有签署誓约
Maybe we didn't say the words and we didn't sign an oath.

122
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,640
但是大家互相照应
But we all stand for each other.

123
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,230
谁也不会丢下别人不管
We don't leave each other behind.

124
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,740
我被食人族绑架后  加内特还回来救我
Garnett came back for me when those cannibals kidnapped me.

125
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,430
你现在却想丢下沃伦扬长而去吗
And now you want to leave Warren?

126
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,110
她需要我们
She needs us.

127
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,170
大家都需要我们
They all need us.

128
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,420
我只是在想
I just think

129
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,470
也许我们单打独斗会有更好的机会
maybe we have a better chance on our own.

130
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,220
就像开始那样
Like in the beginning.

131
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,360
有多久了
So how long?

132
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,660
什么
What?

133
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,500
你多久之前就开始意识到
How long before you think that you have a better chance

134
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,510
你自己有更好的机会
on your own?

135
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
艾迪  慢着
Addy. Whoa.

136
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,550
我回来都是为了你
I came back for you.

137
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,960
那些食人族
The cannibals.

138
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,110
我是为你而回  我以后也会这样做
I came back for you. I'll always come back for you.

139
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,490
你了解我的
You know me.

140
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,460
我不太确定了
I'm not so sure anymore.

141
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,190
我现在对任何事都不确定了
About anything.

142
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:25,960
好吧
All right.

143
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,790
我们回去吧
We'll go back.

144
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,340
好的
Okay.

往右边开
Go right.

146
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,430
为什么
Why right?

147
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:44,850
为什么不
Why not?

148
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,930
没有僵尸
No Zs.

149
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,080
那是个好迹象
That's a good sign.

150
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
{\an8}枪械展会  就在今日

151
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,040
越来越有意思了
Getting interesting.

152
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,560
酒  这才像话
Liquor! Now you're talking.

153
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,840
摩菲  我们应该经常让你带路
Murphy, we're gonna have to let you navigate more often.

154
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,540
恭喜你  孩子  你现在是代驾司机了
Congratulations, son. You're now the designated driver.

155
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,820
什么意思
What's that mean?

156
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,110
意思是  猛踩油门
It means step on it!

157
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,420
我从没见过这么多僵尸聚在一起
I've never seen so many in one place.

158
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,160
重返大部队计划到此为止

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,290
你们都有武器吗
Y'all armed?

161
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,020
那还用说
Obviously.

162
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,520
很好  我们可没时间照顾别人
Good. We don't have time to babysit anyone.

163
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,450
枪和酒
Guns and liquor.

164
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,970
还能出什么问题
What could go wrong?

165
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,850
刚刚有人提到酒吗
Did anyone say liquor?

166
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,690
好好欣赏展会  小伙子们

174
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,320
我记得后车厢里还有点冰毒
Well I think I got some crystal back in the truck.

175
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,440
那玩意也很不错
It's the good stuff too.

176
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,040
那些垃圾货色你自己收着
Back off with the toilet bowl cleanser meth.

177
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,010
我们只收真正的冰毒
We only take that genuine

178
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,700
得是那种能让你忘记末日来临
vein splittin' take you right out of this beautiful apocalypse

179
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,390
感觉置身于世外仙境的刺激玩意
and into a hell-hole meth.

180
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,800
真他妈吓了我一跳
Well slap my ass and call me Sally

181
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,110
竟然是斯盖齐 ·麦克莱恩
if it ain't Sketchy McClain.

182
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,470
你怎么会到这里来了
How'd you get way out here?

183
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,840
我们一路做着买卖过来的
We traded our way up in the world.

184
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,120
这边走
Here.

185
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,440
要知道僵尸行动起来毫无章法可言
You see zombies, they move in mysterious ways.

186
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,510
我们当时快撑不下去了
We were on our last legs when we came upon this

187
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,940
碰巧遇到僵尸在攻击这辆满载武器的卡车
truckload of sweet weaponry under attack.

188
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,090
我们不得不对前任主人施以仁慈
We had to give the former owners mercy.

189
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,210
作为回报
And in return,

190
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,380
他们给了我们这辆好车
they gave us this wonderful vehicle with

191
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,570
我们就这么开到了堪萨斯州
enough gas to get us here to Kansas.

192
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,130
斯基齐
Hey, Skeezy!

193
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,890
看看僵尸们带来了谁
Look what the living dead dragged in!

194
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,040
多克
Doc!

195
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,640
我听说你死在蓝天营了
I heard you were toast back at Camp Blue Sky!

196
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,550
别傻站着  快过来
Don't just stand there. Get your ass in here.

197
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,710
我们需要另一个傻瓜
We need another sucker.

198
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,670
去死吧你  斯基齐
Bite me, Skeezy.

199
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,060
我来给你看看新式改良版僵尸叉
Hey, I got to show you the new and improved Z-Whacker.

200
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,700
说起僵尸叉
Hey, speaking of Z-Whacker

201
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,510
那时和你在一起的姑娘怎么样了  她是不是...
what happened to the girl you were with? Did she...

202
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,130
还没  兄弟  我们还是在一起行动
No, man. We're still traveling together.

203
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,660
他们先走一步求助去了
They went ahead looking for help.

204
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,690
我还以为他们到这里了
Kinda thought they'd end up here.

205
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,780
没  我没见过他们
No, haven't seen them.

206
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,950
我一定会好好留意的
And I'm pretty sure I'd notice.

207
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,250
我们这里有大战僵尸
Here we've got our latest innovations

208
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,010
最新开发出的枪械
in zombie fighting technology.

209
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,230
无论是轻武器  很热销哦

围攻武器
Siege weapons.

211
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,480
还是砍脑神器
Brain-obliterators.

212
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,350
只要你能说得出  我们就有
You name it, we got it.

213
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,900
保证你们能高枕无忧
Just sit back, relax,

214
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,600
再也不用为末日发愁了
and forget about the apocalypse.

215
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,400
你们不担心僵尸吗
Aren't you worried about the Zs?

216
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,420
看看周围
Look around.

217
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,290
我们在堪萨斯州荒无人烟的地方
We're in the middle of nowhere Kansas.

218
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,210
四周空空如也  只有几百平方英里的
We're surrounded by hundreds of square miles

219
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,470
休耕农田
of nothing but fallow farmlands.

220
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,630
这里没有僵尸  他们没有食物
There's no Zs here. Nothing for them to eat.

221
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,400
他们都去了大城市
They've all moved on to the big cities.

222
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,640
你别担心
Don't you worry.

223
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,370
我会保护你
I'll protect you.

224
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,720
无论如何  即使有僵尸过来溜达
Yeah, but anyway, if one were to come amble by,

225
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,820
我们也万事俱备时刻准备迎战了  不是吗
to say we're prepared is an understatement, right?

226
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,420
那里就是福吧
Uh, over there is the FU-Bar.

227
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,070
里头出售最棒的
Home to the finest

228
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,750
事实上可能是从这里到密西西比河之间
and probably actually the only corn whiskey

229
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,830
唯一仅有的玉米还有私酿威士忌
and moonshine between here and the Miss...

230
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,010
矮油  有人急不可待了呀
Whoa. Somebody's thirsty.

231
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,360
听着兄弟  我们需要一辆新车
Listen man, we need a new vehicle.

232
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,070
我们的旧车眼看就要不行了
Ours is dying a slow death.

233
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,250
你能帮我们一把吗
You think you could help us out?

234
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,760
看在往日情面上
You know, for old time's sake?

235
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,230
不行  朋友
No can do, my friend.

236
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,940
我是个商人  不是慈善家
I'm an entrepreneur, not a philanthropist.

237
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,930
不过
But

238
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,050
你们或许能自己赢一辆回来
there might be a way you can help yourself.

That a real 50 caliber M82 Barret?

243
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,600
货真价实
Genuine.

244
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,180
另外我们还随枪附送几百发子弹
Plus we'll even throw in a few hundred rounds of shells.

245
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,180
杀伤力未免太大了
Seems like a little overkill.

246
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,490
没错  不过很多人都喜欢这些家伙
Yeah. But there's a lot of guys who like their toys.

不少人可能愿意用一辆车
A lot of guys who might be willing to trade a vehicle

来换这样一挺漂亮的机枪
for a sweet piece of steel like that 50.

249
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,430

这孩子可以用弹弓
This kid could kill a Z at 50 yards away

253

杀死50码开外的僵尸
with a rubber band and a paper clip.

344

我猜得没错

345

357
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,880
你脸色不太好
You don't look so good.

358
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,150
流血了吗
You bleeding?

359
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,740
何止流血  你个白痴  我被咬了
I'm more than bleeding, you idiot. I'm bit!

360
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,400
被一个僵尸长相的家伙咬了
Some zombie-looking mother bit me!

361
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,550
如果真被僵尸咬了  你会变僵尸的
If it was a zombie, you'd have turned.

362
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,440
我不知道他是什么
I don't know what he was.

363
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,830
但他不对劲
But he wasn't right!

364
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,010
他像某种动物或者什么的

365
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,750
他拿走了我福曼移动站的钥匙
He took the keys to the Formanmobile.

366
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,810
他会把你们的东西也偷走

367
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,520
而且谁知道他还会咬谁

368
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,280
你  你  你
You. You. You.

369
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,700
我要找到那家伙
I'm finding that dude

370
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,270
在他有机会咬别人之前
and I'm taking him out before he has a chance

371
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,590
做掉他

372
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,930
谁要跟我一起去

376

那不是僵尸
It's not a zombie.

377
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:30,040
好像发生了非自然灾难
It's like some kind of unnatural disaster.

378
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,520
是可怕的僵尸侵袭
A freakin' zunami.

379
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,010
这不是测试  重复  这不是测试
This is not a test. Repeat. This is not a test.

380
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,000
这是市民Z的紧急广播系统  发生了
This is the Citizen Z emergency broadcast system. There's a...

381
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,590
涌进现象  僵尸涌进
a flood, a zombie flood,

382
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,630
大面积的僵尸侵袭
a zunami of biblical proportions.

383
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,080
如果你在堪萨斯西部附近
If you're anywhere in the vicinity of Western Kansas,

384
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,040
你得...

385
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:04,000
妈蛋  你得赶紧逃命啊
Screw it. You need to get the hell out now!

386
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,010
如果你在哈密尔顿  格里利

388
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,950
赶紧逃命

389
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,840
就是他  就是那个僵尸咬了我
That's him! That's the Z that bit me!

390
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,420
为什么我有种不祥的预感

391

就是他
That's him!

392
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,530
你们好  有事吗
Hey, guys. What's up?

393
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,330
他不是僵尸  他还会说话呢
He's not a zombie. He's talkin'.

394
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,210
我刚才是说他长得像僵尸
I said he looked like a zombie.

395
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,380
你看看他长成什么样
I mean look at him.

396
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,300
不过那都不是事  他偷走了我的钥匙
But it doesn't matter. He stole my keys!

397
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,350
呃  他在撒谎
Uh, that's a lie.

398
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,570
那你在我车边上干什么呢
Then what are you doing at my machine?

399

00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,460
你说呀
What?

411

你咬了那哥们儿吗
You bit that guy?

412
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,850
没有  不是  打了一架而已
No. No. It was just a fight.

413
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,340
那你拿什么跟他打的
Well what'd you fight him with?

414
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,800
因为他在流血  流得还不少
Because he was bleeding. A lot.

415
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,220
我不清楚  他喝醉了  我没看出来
I dunno. He was drunk. I didn't see.

416
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,120
我试着帮他  他还反赖我偷他的东西
I tried to help him, and then he accused me of stealing from him.

417
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,400
你试着帮他吗
You tried to help him?

418
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,370
算了吧  兄弟  跟我说实话
Come on, man. Level with me.

419
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:36,190
说就说  我们要用车  比他更急着用
Screw it. We need a vehicle, and we need it more than he does.

420
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,980
因为我是人类的救世主

421
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,880
还记得吗  第一要务

422

所以该干什么就干什么  偷点东西又怎样
So we do what we got to do. And sometimes we steal stuff.

423
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,310
你到底咬没咬人
Did you bite him?

424
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,090
多克  你懂我的
Doc, you know me.

425
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,650
我不是禽兽
I am not an animal.

426
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,610
你牙齿怎么了
What happened to your tooth?

427
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:55,930
听着
Look.

428
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,860
呆在这儿
Stay here.

429
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,520
我去找其他人
I'm gonna go get the others.

430
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,710
你真让我失望
I'm very disappointed.

431
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,070
还剩五位参赛选手
We got five contestants left.

432
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,980
下一目标
Next target.

433
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,860
带牛仔帽的
Cowboy hat.

434
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,230
开火
Fire!

435
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,560
斯奈德  出局
Snyder, you're out.

436
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,810
马利根  出局
Mulligan, you're out.

437
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,460
枪法不错  马利根
Good shootin', Mulligan.

438
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,250
明年再接再厉  如果明年你还活着
Better luck next year. If there is a next year.

439
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,050
好啦  还有三位参赛选手
All right, we got three contestants left!

440
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:50,330
我们要增加筹码  把距离拉到400码
So let's up the ante and let's take it out to 400 yards!

441
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,350
我们得赶紧走了
We need to get out of here.

442
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,640
不行  再等等
We can't, not yet.

443
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,090
他还没被淘汰吗
He's still in it?

444
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,190
是呀
Oh yeah.

445
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,570
我们的小万万真棒
That's our boy.

446
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,260
你朋友都不把你给埋起来
Your friends didn't even cover you up.

447
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,590
一群野蛮人
Savages.

448
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,240
你没变异
You didn't turn.

449
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,580
好啦  我们还剩三位参赛选手
All right, we got three contestants left!

450
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,400
继续加大难度
Let's up the ante!

451
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:01,810
把僵尸引到500码外
Let's take her out 500 yards!

452
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,060
你为什么叫一万
Why are you called Ten Thousand?

453
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,300
我计划杀一万只僵尸
It's how many Zs I plan to kill.

454
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,340
你已经杀了多少
How many you got?

455
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:10,870
不算上今天的话...
Not counting today...

456
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,810
一共杀了2119只
Two thousand one hundred nineteen.

457
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,420
我今天会杀得比你多的
I'll still get more than you today.

458
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,230
有可能
Maybe.

459
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,100
但也不一定
Maybe not.

460
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,710
朝着穿工装裤的那家伙
The dude with the coveralls!

461
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,710
开火
Fire!

462
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,410
不好意思  你出局了哟
Sorry! You're gone!

463
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,550
行啊  小伙子  你可以的
You got this, kid. You got this!

464
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,900
准备好缴械投降了吗
You ready to give up?

465
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,100
休想
Never.

466
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,180
休想?
Never?

467
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,940
如果你是想用这种方法让我抓狂
If this is your attempt at trying to psych me out,

468
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,490
那你就很不幸地失算了
you're failing miserably.

469
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,780
集中注意力
Stay focused.

470
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,590
那枪我拿定了
That gun is mine.

471
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:02,580
有僵尸
Zombies.

472
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,360
僵尸闯进来了
Zombies inside the perimeter!

473
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,960
各位听好  我们
Okay, listen up everybody. We...

474
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,700
我们需要几个人去消灭几个僵尸
we need a few people to go check and clean up some Zs

475
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,930
去看看边界那边怎么回事
and see what's going on at the perimeter.

476
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,620
各位  如果不消灭这些个僵尸
Look people, no one's gonna win anything

477
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,640
我们大伙儿谁都尽不了兴  赢不了枪
unless we stop these Zs from spoiling our fun!

478
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,220
你们说是吧
All right?

479
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,160
待在这
Stay here.

480
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,490
继续比赛
You keep shooting.

481
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,550
他们从哪来的
Where the hell they all come from?

482
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,840
你现在成了僵尸了
So you're a zombie now.

483
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,340
真是太好了
That's just perfect.

484
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,870
这说明你跟其他人一样  满嘴扯谎
I guess that makes you a liar like everyone else.

485
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,610
不不  没关系
No, no, it's okay.

486
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,330
我不怪你
I don't blame you.

487
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,790
要说该怪谁
If it's anybody's fault,

488
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,180
只能怪我
it's mine.

489
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,730
我该放聪明点的  查理
I shoulda known better, Charlie.

490
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,440
悔不当初啊
I shoulda.

491
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,340
但你是这么的...
But you were so...

492
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,850
我们刚上路的时候
I used to just watch you

493
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,740
我还观察过你
back when we started.

494
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,590
我知道你不想谈这个
I know you don't like to talk about this.

495
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:39,060
你喜欢杀僵尸  还越杀越兴奋
But it doesn't make you bad that you like to kill them

496
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,660
但这不意味着你是坏人
and it turns you on.

497
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,220
不是的
It doesn't.

498
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,380
所以我才相信你
It's what made me believe in you.

499
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:51,860
你真是太厉害了  哥们
You were such a badass. Oh man.

500
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,380
你不像那些个盲目的白痴
Not like those blind idiots

501
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,220
总是做着回到往日好生活的春秋大梦
always dreaming of a life that will never come back.

502
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,390
不  你不盲目
No, you weren't blind.

503
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,570
你看清了真相  你坦然面对
You saw it, and you faced it.

504
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:06,040
所以当你告诉我还有出路
So when you told me there was a way,

505
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,500
还能活下去的时候
a way to live again,

506
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,830
我信了你
I believed you.

507
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:20,230
你让我信了你
You made me believe you.

508
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,460
你怎么能这么对我
How could you do that to me?

509
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,180
你给了我...
You gave me...

510
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,160
希望
hope.

511
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,860
你让我  我们希望
That I, that we,

512
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,390
还能过过小日子  而且我...
could have some kind of life. And I...

513
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,050
我为此爱过你
I loved you for that.

514
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,410
结果这一点把你害死了
Then it got you killed.

515
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,320
你心存希望
You had hope,

516
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,660
但希望削弱了你
and it made you weak.

517
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,210
也削弱了我
It made me weak.

518
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,310
你怎么能这样  查理
How could you do that, Charlie?

519
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,300
你怎么能
How could you

520
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,750
给了我这么多希望
give me all of that

521
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,150
然后一下子全夺走
and then take it away?

522
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:16,520
你怎么能...死
How could you... die?

523
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,390
你为什么要死
How could you die?

524
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,970
你怎么忍心死
How could you die?

525
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,460
趁还有得亲
Just in case.

526
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,450
如果你没有活下去的理由
If you don't have a reason to live,

527
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,420
还不如死了
you might as well die.

528
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,670
你就是这样
That's all you did.

529
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,890
因为你给了我理由
Cuz you gave me a reason.

530
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,440
很好的理由
And it was a nice one.

531
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,170
一个非常美好的谎言
A beautiful lie, really.

532
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,550
那种美好再也不会有了
It won't ever be beautiful like that.

533
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:24,450
但我会找到活下去的理由
But I'll find a reason to live.

534
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,880
我会的
I will.

535
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,800
我仁慈地结束你的生命
I give you mercy.

536
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:47,680
好  现在靶距500码  不能再远了
Okay! We're 500 yards out, and we can't go any further!

537
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,070

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,680
这是胜利者的战利品
To the victor goes the spoils!

569
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:08,030
健健康康的地活着  现在快找地方躲吧
Kill in good health, kid. Now get out of dodge.

570
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,950
收拾家伙了
Closing time!

571
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,750
快快快  快快快
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

572
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,310
我快没子弹了
I'm getting low on ammo.

573
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,210
我也是
Yeah, me too.

574
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,320
这些僵尸是从哪冒出来的
Where are these Zs coming from?

575
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,950
不知道  我爸爸跑哪去了
I dunno. But where the hell is my dad?

576
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:57,500
我们不能久留了
We can't wait much longer.

577
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,000
布莉塔妮
Brittany!

578
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,000
他在那
There he is.

579
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,820
布莉塔妮
Brittany!

580
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,250
我没子弹了
I'm out.

581
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,440
第2025个
Two thousand two hundred five.

582
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,110
好枪法  孩子
Nice shooting, kid!

583
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,510
快  布莉特  我们得走了
Come on, Brit! We got to go!

584
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,640
等等
Wait!

585
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,990
拿上这个吧
Take this.

586
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,170
你比我更应该得到
You deserve it more than I do.

587
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,710
真的  我真心希望你收下
Really. I want you to have it.

588
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,830
布莉特  我们必须走了
Brit. We got to go.

589
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,500
谢谢
Thank you.

590
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,220
祝你好运  孩子
Good luck, kid.

591
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,660
大哥  您是从哪冒出来的
Where'd you come from?

592
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,790
你好像好点了
You're looking better.

593
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,610
下一个是谁
Who's next?

594
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,310
我们还要等他多久
How much longer are we gonna wait for him?

595
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,250
不会很久了
Not much.

596
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,400
他会回来的
He'll be here.

597
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,870
-快射啊  -我没法瞄准
- Get him! - I can't get shot!

598
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,200
抓稳他  孩子
Hold him steady, kid!

599
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,090
我做不到
I can't!

600
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,670
你这是往哪开
You know where you're going?

601
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,860
朝着太阳的方向
Followin' the sun.

602
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,410
要是查理...
It's what Charlie...

603
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,580
他就会这么做
It's what he would do.

604
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,690
希望我们能赶上麦克和艾迪
I hope we catch up with Mack and Addy.

605
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,300
是啊  我也希望
Yeah, I hope so too.

606
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,840
各位
Well, people.

607
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,680
若不是我们已经身处大灾变之中
If we weren't already in an apocalypse,

608
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,650
这绝对是个灾难将至的明显信号
this would be a damn obvious sign.

609
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,740
比大灾变更糟糕的状况叫什么呢  而它...
What do you call something worse than an apocalypse? Because

610
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,610
就在我的眼前  不管它叫什么
this is it. Whatever it is.

611
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,610
成群  蜂拥  海啸  一望无际
Swarm, horde, tsunami. There's no end in sight.

612
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,610
如果你身在他们前进的方向上
If you're not already west of this thing,

613
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,000
你最好赶紧动身  因为根本不可能闯过去
you better get moving. There's no getting through it.

614
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,240
不可能逃脱
There's no outrunning it.

615
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,440
你必须找个安全的地方躲起来
You got to find some place safe and hide.

616
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,700
祝你们好运  各位
Good luck, people.

617
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,740
祝你们平安
And Godspeed.

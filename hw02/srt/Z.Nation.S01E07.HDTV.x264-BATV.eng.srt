19
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,110
Previously on "Z Nation".

20
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,400
A bullet to the heart will reveal the truth.

21
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,930
No!

22
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,710
I love you.

23
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,500
I love you too.

24
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:13,850
Warren, we have to go.

25
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:14,990
- No. - We have to go now!

26
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,490
We can't let him turn.

27
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,000
We have to give him mercy!

28
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,700
Good morning, people.

29
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,510
Welcome to the third day of the sixth month

30
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,230
of the year 03 A.Z.

31
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,970
If you're listening to this, it means you're still alive.

32
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,910
So congratulations.

33
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,460
Or condolences.

35
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,960
You know, whatever.

36
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,600
If you're noticing more despair in my voice than usual today,

37
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,500
it's because we lost someone special.

38
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,810
I know, we lose people all the time.

39
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,640
Getting your face chewed off by a Z is more common

40
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,560
than making it to your next birthday.

41
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,160
But this guy...

42
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,950
This one's worth mentioning.

43
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,860
Charles Garnett, First Sergeant, Army National Guard Reservist,

44
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:24,190
was an honest to God, real life, actual good guy.

45
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,070
He fought for other people, not just for his own survival.

46
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,530
And he did something that's pretty much impossible these days.

47
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,730
He gave people hope.

48
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,400
Remember hope?

49
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,290
Remember thinking that we might actually

50
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,550
come out on the other side of this thing?

51
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,140
Yeah. That.

52
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,030
Sergeant Garnett died trying to give us a reason to hope.

53
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,180
And for that...

54
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,940
Sergeant Charles Garnett.

55
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,980
On behalf of a grateful nation,

56
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,530
or whatever the hell we are now,

57
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,210
we salute you.

58
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,020
Radiator?

59
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,840
Yeah.

60
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,720
Fixable?

61
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:41,870
Don't know.

62
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,370
Gee, if we only had a mechanic.

63
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
You got to let her deal, man.

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,830
She's got that post-traumatic stress.

65
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,950
She's got post-traumatic stress?

66
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,720
The whole world's got post-traumatic stress.

67
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,100
Actually there isn't anything post about it.

68
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,190
We all got plain ol' present tense,

69
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,950
all traumatic, all stress all the time.

70
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,380
What makes her so special?

71
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,760
Hey. Wake up. Hey.

72
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,960
No, you can't just check out.

73
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,870
We got a job to do.

74
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,640
And I am running out of time.

75
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,480
And California is still 2,000 miles of bad road away.

76
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,490
And we are not gonna make it without you.

77
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,950
Cuz it's not like they're gonna follow me

78
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,280
or the old man or the wonder twins out there.

79
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,250
Hey.

80
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,120
All right, Addy and I will scout up ahead.

81
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,500
See if we can get some help.

82
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,760
We will?

83
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,070
Yeah.

84
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,860
Yeah, I don't know guys. I think we should stick together.

85
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,830
No, Doc. Don't worry.

86
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,920
We're just gonna scout ahead and circle back around and find you.

87
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,350
I mean it's not like you're getting far in the truck.

88
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,110
Come on, Addy.

89
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,870
I can't believe I'm saying this, but

90
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,230
what if Warren doesn't snap out of it?

91
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,410
She's not giving up.

92
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,330
All right, well

93
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,270
we can't just sit here and wait for help to come.

94
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,020
I mean we got to do something.

95
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:22,800
Okay.

96
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,150
I found the leak in the radiator hose.

97
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,570
Taped it up a little bit, but

98
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,100
we're not going anywhere unless we get some water in there.

99
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,970
I get thirsty.

100
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,780
We all get thirsty.

101
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,620
I'll drive.

102
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,070
Knock yourself out, kid.

103
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,850
Easy there, kid! Easy!

104
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,750
Who taught you how to drive?

105
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,060
No one.

106
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,340
Hands on the ten and the two.

107
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,560
And easy on the gas.

108
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,370
Nothin' out here.

109
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,640
No people, no gas, not even Zs.

110
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,770
Nah, we got to go back.

111
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,640
There is no help out here.

112
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,050
There's no help back there either.

113
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,370
We have to go back, Mack.

114
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,210
We have a mission.

115
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,980
We made a promise.

116
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,250
No, we didn't.

117
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,160
We never did.

118
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,780
Addy, the only promise we ever made was to each other.

119
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,930
To stay alive.

120
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,170
Look, yeah, okay.

121
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,550
Maybe we didn't say the words and we didn't sign an oath.

122
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,640
But we all stand for each other.

123
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,230
We don't leave each other behind.

124
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,740
Garnett came back for me when those cannibals kidnapped me.

125
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,430
And now you want to leave Warren?

126
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,110
She needs us.

127
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,170
They all need us.

128
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,420
I just think

129
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,470
maybe we have a better chance on our own.

130
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,220
Like in the beginning.

131
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,360
So how long?

132
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,660
What?

133
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,500
How long before you think that you have a better chance

134
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,510
on your own?

135
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
Addy. Whoa.

136
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,550
I came back for you.

137
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,960
The cannibals.

138
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,110
I came back for you. I'll always come back for you.

139
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,490
You know me.

140
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,460
I'm not so sure anymore.

141
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,190
About anything.

142
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:25,960
All right.

143
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,790
We'll go back.

144
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,340
Okay.

145
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,580
Go right.

146
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,430
Why right?

147
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:44,850
Why not?

148
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,930
No Zs.

149
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,080
That's a good sign.

151
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,040
Getting interesting.

152
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,560
Liquor! Now you're talking.

153
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,840
Murphy, we're gonna have to let you navigate more often.

154
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,540
Congratulations, son. You're now the designated driver.

155
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,820
What's that mean?

156
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,110
It means step on it!

157
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,420
I've never seen so many in one place.

158
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,160
So much for going back.

159
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,260
Stop.

160
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,290
Y'all armed?

161
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,020
Obviously.

162
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,520
Good. We don't have time to babysit anyone.

163
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,450
Guns and liquor.

164
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,970
What could go wrong?

165
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,850
Did anyone say liquor?

166
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,690
Enjoy the show fellas.

167
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,540
Welcome to S&S Limited,

168
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,940
the finest gun show in the west.

169
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,330
Entry fee is seven.

170
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,510
Seven what?

171
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,540
Bullets.

172
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,160
Oxy.

173
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,460
Grams of whatever DIY super fun time substance you got.

174
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,320
Well I think I got some crystal back in the truck.

175
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,440
It's the good stuff too.

176
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,040
Back off with the toilet bowl cleanser meth.

177
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,010
We only take that genuine

178
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,700
vein splittin' take you right out of this beautiful apocalypse

179
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,390
and into a hell-hole meth.

180
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,800
Well slap my ass and call me Sally

181
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,110
if it ain't Sketchy McClain.

182
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,470
How'd you get way out here?

183
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,840
We traded our way up in the world.

184
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,120
Here.

185
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,440
You see zombies, they move in mysterious ways.

186
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,510
We were on our last legs when we came upon this

187
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,940
truckload of sweet weaponry under attack.

188
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,090
We had to give the former owners mercy.

189
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,210
And in return,

190
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,380
they gave us this wonderful vehicle with

191
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,570
enough gas to get us here to Kansas.

192
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,130
Hey, Skeezy!

193
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,890
Look what the living dead dragged in!

194
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,040
Doc!

195
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,640
I heard you were toast back at Camp Blue Sky!

196
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,550
Don't just stand there. Get your ass in here.

197
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,710
We need another sucker.

198
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,670
Bite me, Skeezy.

199
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,060
Hey, I got to show you the new and improved Z-Whacker.

200
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,700
Hey, speaking of Z-Whacker

201
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,510
what happened to the girl you were with? Did she...

202
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,130
No, man. We're still traveling together.

203
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,660
They went ahead looking for help.

204
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,690
Kinda thought they'd end up here.

205
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,780
No, haven't seen them.

206
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,950
And I'm pretty sure I'd notice.

207
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,250
Here we've got our latest innovations

208
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,010
in zombie fighting technology.

209
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,230
Small arms. Hot potato.

210
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,870
Siege weapons.

211
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,480
Brain-obliterators.

212
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,350
You name it, we got it.

213
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,900
Just sit back, relax,

214
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,600
and forget about the apocalypse.

215
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,400
Aren't you worried about the Zs?

216
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,420
Look around.

217
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,290
We're in the middle of nowhere Kansas.

218
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,210
We're surrounded by hundreds of square miles

219
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,470
of nothing but fallow farmlands.

220
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,630
There's no Zs here. Nothing for them to eat.

221
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,400
They've all moved on to the big cities.

222
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,640
Don't you worry.

223
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,370
I'll protect you.

224
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,720
Yeah, but anyway, if one were to come amble by,

225
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,820
to say we're prepared is an understatement, right?

226
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,420
Uh, over there is the FU-Bar.

227
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,070
Home to the finest

228
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,750
and probably actually the only corn whiskey

229
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,830
and moonshine between here and the Miss...

230
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,010
Whoa. Somebody's thirsty.

231
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,360
Listen man, we need a new vehicle.

232
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,070
Ours is dying a slow death.

233
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,250
You think you could help us out?

234
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,760
You know, for old time's sake?

235
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,230
No can do, my friend.

236
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,940
I'm an entrepreneur, not a philanthropist.

237
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,930
But

238
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,050
there might be a way you can help yourself.

239
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,740
Our first annual live zombie shooting contest.

240
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,830
What's the prize?

241
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,650
Hey, Vernon. Show our friends here first prize.

242
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,390
That a real 50 caliber M82 Barret?

243
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,600
Genuine.

244
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,180
Plus we'll even throw in a few hundred rounds of shells.

245
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,180
Seems like a little overkill.

246
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,490
Yeah. But there's a lot of guys who like their toys.

247
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,320
A lot of guys who might be willing to trade a vehicle

248
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,580
for a sweet piece of steel like that 50.

249
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,430
You know what I mean?

250
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,490
Where do I sign up?

251
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,790
You think you got what it takes, little man?

252
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,150
This kid could kill a Z at 50 yards away

253
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,100
with a rubber band and a paper clip.

254
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,990
All right. Sign ups in the FU-Bar.

255
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,490
If you do win

256
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,490
and you want to trade it for a bad mama jama vehicle,

257
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,990
you wanna talk to a guy named Wannamaker.

258
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,610
Oh and if you want side action talk to Vernon.

259
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:14,450
But do not bet against that guy.

260
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,430
Darren Cooper.

261
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,680
Ex Ranger Sniper.

262
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,020
Fifty confirmed kills in Afghanistan.

263
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,490
Lethal as they come.

264
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,150
You got to do something about her.

265
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,250
I'm not waiting for anybody.

266
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,210
I know, Murphy. Keep your shorts on.

267
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,460
Have you seen a guy in here named Wannamaker?

268
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,270
What, are we making friends now?

269
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,070
Anybody know anybody in here named Wannamaker?

270
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,780
Who wants to know?

271
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,540
Oh, we're just lookin' to trade.

272
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,010
You know just a little business.

273
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,420
Yeah, my friend said he might have a vehicle.

274
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,030
Yeah.

275
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,050
Wannamaker's got cars.

276
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,120
Do you know where he is?

277
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,130
Uh, hey! Uh, hello!

278
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,050
He's not gonna wake up.

279
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,290
Once Wannamaker's down, he's down.

280
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,060
Check back in forty-eight hours.

281
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,120
Well what about you?

282
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,810
You look like a car man.

283
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,200
I don't drive cars.

284
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,770
I drive machines.

285
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,340
Any, uh, any machine you'd be willing to let go of?

286
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,880
Depends.

287
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,470
What do you got to trade?

288
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,800
Don't worry, darlin'. You're not worth it.

289
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,690
Ain't nothing as sweet as the Formanmobile.

290
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,150
What about that 50 caliber first prize?

291
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,660
Even if you do win, and that's a big if,

292
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,310
the Formanmobile is not for sale.

293
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,980
Bio-diesel.

294
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,080
Solar-powered.

295
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,310
Quiet as they come.

296
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,200
Kitchen.

297
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,390
Bathroom.

298
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,000
Fully regenerative internal plumbing system

299
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,290
complete with marine grade PEX fittings.

300
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,350
Built in, we got an NSV machine gun, flame thrower,

301
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,280
cattle gun, grenade launcher, doom whistle,

302
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,490
plus the usual

303
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,510
wheel spikes, all that.

304
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,990
Look at me teasin' ya.

305
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,310
Ain't no way you're getting your hands on my baby.

306
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,250
Oh, okay.

307
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,660
Well he's drunk.

308
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,870
Let's go get you signed up, kid.

309
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,060
I got to drain the lizard king.

310
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:25,960
Hey, Forman!

311
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:27,860
Forman, you okay?

312
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,820
Forman.

313
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,260
What are you doing?

314
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,370
Get off me!

315
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,030
Zombie. Hell.

316
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,020
What are you?!

317
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,560
Zombie.

318
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,980
Let's hope they'll take a busted up truck for the entrance fee.

319
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,780
Next. Have your entry fees ready.

320
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,780
No key. Come on.

321
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,290
Ladies and gentlemen.

322
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,950
It's that moment you've all been waiting for.

323
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,800
It's shootin' time.

324
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,380
I'm Ten Thousand.

325
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,240
Don't need to know your name to kick your ass.

326
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,140
Registered shooters!

327
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,260
Please hit your marks on the designated firing line!

328
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,010
All right, this first round takes place 100 yards out.

329
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,940
When I announce the target Z, you aim.

330
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,110
When I say fire, you shoot.

331
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,650
If you miss, you're out.

332
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,780
This is sudden death, people.

333
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,380
Cuz there ain't no other way these days.

334
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,930
Skeezy over here's gonna be judge.

335
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,970
And what the judge says is final. Yeah?

336
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,180
Last man standing gets the 50!

337
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,930
Tell them what second place gets them, Vernon!

338
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,440
Set of steak knives!

339
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,810
You're a shoe-in, kid.

340
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,290
You lost someone?

341
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,170
Seems like that's all we ever do these days.

342
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,410
Makes you wonder if it's even worth being around people anymore.

343
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,790
Was it family?

344
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,640
Yeah, that's what I thought.

345
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,490
You're gonna need a few more of these.

346
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,720
You ready, shooters?!

347
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,740
Let's... kill... some... zombies!

348
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,270
Round one!

349
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,140
There's the first target right there.

350
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,120
Hippie dude with the long hair.

351
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,670
Fire!

352
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,570
All right, who shot grandma?

353
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,340
Voorhees, you're out!

354
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,870
Next target! Hipster with the sweatpants!

355
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,840
Fire!

356
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,720
You okay, Forman?

357
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,880
You don't look so good.

358
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,150
You bleeding?

359
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,740
I'm more than bleeding, you idiot. I'm bit!

360
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,400
Some zombie-looking mother bit me!

361
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,550
If it was a zombie, you'd have turned.

362
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,440
I don't know what he was.

363
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,830
But he wasn't right!

364
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,010
He's like some kind of animal or something.

365
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,750
He took the keys to the Formanmobile.

366
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,810
And he'll steal your stuff too.

367
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,520
And who knows who else he's gonna bite.

368
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,280
You. You. You.

369
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,700
I'm finding that dude

370
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,270
and I'm taking him out before he has a chance

371
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,590
to bite anyone else.

372
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,930
Who's with me?!

373
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,520
- Let's get him! - We'll get him!

374
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,150
Let's go!

375
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,490
Anything I need to know?

376
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,180
It's not a zombie.

377
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:30,040
It's like some kind of unnatural disaster.

378
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,520
A freakin' zunami.

379
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,010
This is not a test. Repeat. This is not a test.

380
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,000
This is the Citizen Z emergency broadcast system. There's a...

381
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,590
a flood, a zombie flood,

382
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,630
a zunami of biblical proportions.

383
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,080
If you're anywhere in the vicinity of Western Kansas,

384
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,040
you need to...

385
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:04,000
Screw it. You need to get the hell out now!

386
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,010
If you're in Hamilton, Greeley,

387
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,850
Wichita, Kearney County area,

388
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,950
get the hell out now!

389
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,840
That's him! That's the Z that bit me!

390
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,420
Why do I have a bad feeling about that?

391
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,060
That's him!

392
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,530
Hey, guys. What's up?

393
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,330
He's not a zombie. He's talkin'.

394
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,210
I said he looked like a zombie.

395
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,380
I mean look at him.

396
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,300
But it doesn't matter. He stole my keys!

397
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,350
Uh, that's a lie.

398
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,570
Then what are you doing at my machine?

399
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,790
Search him.

400
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,010
It is a Z!

401
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,470
I told you.

402
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,960
I am gonna put him down.

403
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,450
No!

404
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,410
Zombies!

405
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,320
Let's go! Get out of here!

406
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,390
Nice shootin', everybody!

407
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,250
People checking out inventory over at the barter tables,

408
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,350
watch stray bullets. Thanks.

409
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,620
What?

410
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,460
What?

411
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,850
You bit that guy?

412
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,850
No. No. It was just a fight.

413
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,340
Well what'd you fight him with?

414
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,800
Because he was bleeding. A lot.

415
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,220
I dunno. He was drunk. I didn't see.

416
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,120
I tried to help him, and then he accused me of stealing from him.

417
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,400
You tried to help him?

418
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,370
Come on, man. Level with me.

419
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:36,190
Screw it. We need a vehicle, and we need it more than he does.

420
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,980
Because I'm the savior of humanity.

421
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,880
Remember? Priority number one.

422
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,160
So we do what we got to do. And sometimes we steal stuff.

423
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,310
Did you bite him?

424
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,090
Doc, you know me.

425
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,650
I am not an animal.

426
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,610
What happened to your tooth?

427
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:55,930
Look.

428
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,860
Stay here.

429
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,520
I'm gonna go get the others.

430
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,710
I'm very disappointed.

431
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,070
We got five contestants left.

432
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,980
Next target.

433
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,860
Cowboy hat.

434
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,230
Fire!

435
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,560
Snyder, you're out.

436
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,810
Mulligan, you're out.

437
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,460
Good shootin', Mulligan.

438
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,250
Better luck next year. If there is a next year.

439
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,050
All right, we got three contestants left!

440
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:50,330
So let's up the ante and let's take it out to 400 yards!

441
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,350
We need to get out of here.

442
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,640
We can't, not yet.

443
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,090
He's still in it?

444
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,190
Oh yeah.

445
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,570
That's our boy.

446
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,260
Your friends didn't even cover you up.

447
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,590
Savages.

448
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,240
You didn't turn.

449
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,580
All right, we got three contestants left!

450
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,400
Let's up the ante!

451
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:01,810
Let's take her out 500 yards!

452
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,060
Why are you called Ten Thousand?

453
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,300
It's how many Zs I plan to kill.

454
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,340
How many you got?

455
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:10,870
Not counting today...

456
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,810
Two thousand one hundred nineteen.

457
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,420
I'll still get more than you today.

458
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,230
Maybe.

459
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,100
Maybe not.

460
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,710
The dude with the coveralls!

461
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,710
Fire!

462
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,410
Sorry! You're gone!

463
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,550
You got this, kid. You got this!

464
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,900
You ready to give up?

465
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,100
Never.

466
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,180
Never?

467
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,940
If this is your attempt at trying to psych me out,

468
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,490
you're failing miserably.

469
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,780
Stay focused.

470
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,590
That gun is mine.

471
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:02,580
Zombies.

472
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,360
Zombies inside the perimeter!

473
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,960
Okay, listen up everybody. We...

474
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,700
we need a few people to go check and clean up some Zs

475
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,930
and see what's going on at the perimeter.

476
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,620
Look people, no one's gonna win anything

477
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,640
unless we stop these Zs from spoiling our fun!

478
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,220
All right?

479
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,160
Stay here.

480
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,490
You keep shooting.

481
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,550
Where the hell they all come from?

482
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,840
So you're a zombie now.

483
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,340
That's just perfect.

484
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,870
I guess that makes you a liar like everyone else.

485
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,610
No, no, it's okay.

486
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,330
I don't blame you.

487
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,790
If it's anybody's fault,

488
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,180
it's mine.

489
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,730
I shoulda known better, Charlie.

490
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,440
I shoulda.

491
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,340
But you were so...

492
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,850
I used to just watch you

493
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,740
back when we started.

494
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,590
I know you don't like to talk about this.

495
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:39,060
But it doesn't make you bad that you like to kill them

496
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,660
and it turns you on.

497
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,220
It doesn't.

498
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,380
It's what made me believe in you.

499
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:51,860
You were such a badass. Oh man.

500
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,380
Not like those blind idiots

501
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,220
always dreaming of a life that will never come back.

502
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,390
No, you weren't blind.

503
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,570
You saw it, and you faced it.

504
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:06,040
So when you told me there was a way,

505
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,500
a way to live again,

506
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,830
I believed you.

507
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:20,230
You made me believe you.

508
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,460
How could you do that to me?

509
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,180
You gave me...

510
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,160
hope.

511
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,860
That I, that we,

512
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,390
could have some kind of life. And I...

513
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,050
I loved you for that.

514
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,410
Then it got you killed.

515
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,320
You had hope,

516
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,660
and it made you weak.

517
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,210
It made me weak.

518
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,310
How could you do that, Charlie?

519
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,300
How could you

520
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,750
give me all of that

521
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,150
and then take it away?

522
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:16,520
How could you... die?

523
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,390
How could you die?

524
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,970
How could you die?

525
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,460
Just in case.

526
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,450
If you don't have a reason to live,

527
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,420
you might as well die.

528
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,670
That's all you did.

529
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,890
Cuz you gave me a reason.

530
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,440
And it was a nice one.

531
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,170
A beautiful lie, really.

532
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,550
It won't ever be beautiful like that.

533
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:24,450
But I'll find a reason to live.

534
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,880
I will.

535
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,800
I give you mercy.

536
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:47,680
Okay! We're 500 yards out, and we can't go any further!

537
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,070
So best shot wins!

538
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,620
This is for all the cookies!

539
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,730
First up!

540
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,380
The judge!

541
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,190
Fire!

542
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,600
Ladies first.

543
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,650
Screw you. I'm no lady.

544
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,280
kay.

545
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,240
Beat that.

546
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,780
Kay.

547
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,360
Two bullets, one hole.

548
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,840
I'm callin' it a tie.

549
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,160
Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen.

550
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,710
We got ourselves a barn burner here.

551
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,610
This thing's going into sudden death overtime!

552
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,200
So come on over and see me

553
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,830
and put down your bets before the next round!

554
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,160
All right, people. Place your bets.

555
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,510
Come on. Put them down.

556
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,280
Oh shit.

557
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,480
We got a couple of frash runner.

558
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,510
You first. I'll clean up.

559
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,610
Our driver!

560
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,720
Our driver!

561
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,530
They're getting Side Meat!

562
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,840
Give the man mercy!

563
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,510
Nice shootin'.

564
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,590
Hey, we've got ourselves a winner!

565
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,530
Nice job, kid.

566
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:56,210
Now let's get your prize and get the hell out of here.

567
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,190
Good shootin'.

568
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,680
To the victor goes the spoils!

569
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:08,030
Kill in good health, kid. Now get out of dodge.

570
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,950
Closing time!

571
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,750
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

572
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,310
I'm getting low on ammo.

573
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,210
Yeah, me too.

574
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,320
Where are these Zs coming from?

575
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,950
I dunno. But where the hell is my dad?

576
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:57,500
We can't wait much longer.

577
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,000
Brittany!

578
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,000
There he is.

579
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,820
Brittany!

580
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,250
I'm out.

581
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,440
Two thousand two hundred five.

582
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,110
Nice shooting, kid!

583
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,510
Come on, Brit! We got to go!

584
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,640
Wait!

585
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,990
Take this.

586
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,170
You deserve it more than I do.

587
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,710
Really. I want you to have it.

588
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,830
Brit. We got to go.

589
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,500
Thank you.

590
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,220
Good luck, kid.

591
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,660
Where'd you come from?

592
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,790
You're looking better.

593
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,610
Who's next?

594
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,310
How much longer are we gonna wait for him?

595
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,250
Not much.

596
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,400
He'll be here.

597
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,870
- Get him! - I can't get shot!

598
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,200
Hold him steady, kid!

599
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,090
I can't!

600
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,670
You know where you're going?

601
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,860
Followin' the sun.

602
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,410
It's what Charlie...

603
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,580
It's what he would do.

604
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,690
I hope we catch up with Mack and Addy.

605
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,300
Yeah, I hope so too.

606
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,840
Well, people.

607
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,680
If we weren't already in an apocalypse,

608
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,650
this would be a damn obvious sign.

609
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,740
What do you call something worse than an apocalypse? Because

610
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,610
this is it. Whatever it is.

611
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,610
Swarm, horde, tsunami. There's no end in sight.

612
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,610
If you're not already west of this thing,

613
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,000
you better get moving. There's no getting through it.

614
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,240
There's no outrunning it.

615
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,440
You got to find some place safe and hide.

616
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,700
Good luck, people.

617
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,740
And Godspeed.

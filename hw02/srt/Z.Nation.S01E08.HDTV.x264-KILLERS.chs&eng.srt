00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,830
好  好  就来
Yeah, yeah, all right.

148
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,860
没路了
Nuh-uh, no way.

149
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,970
这里是死胡同
This place is a death trap.

150
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,620
好  很好  这茶是
Good, very good. This tea is...

151
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,940
伯爵茶吗
Earl Grey?

152
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,530
没错  伯爵茶
That's right. Earl Grey.

153
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,930
我最喜欢的茶
It's my favorite.

154
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,840
也是我最喜欢的
Huh. It's my favorite too.

155
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,310
我们有很多共同点
We have in common much, you and I.

156
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,330
尤里
So, Yuri.

157
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,770
我觉得我们得追溯一下
I think we got to address

158
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,600
这头八百磅重的大猩猩的由来
the eight hundred pound gorilla in the room.

159
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,030
不  那是一种比喻
No. It's an expression.

160
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,380
是美国的俚语
It's American slang.

161
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,750
我不懂
Sorry.

162
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,040
好吧  这么说吧
All right. Look,

163
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,180
你是怎么落到这来的
okay, how did you get here?

164
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,220
好的  好的  好的
Yes, yes, yes.

165
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,390
从ISS来的
Ummm, on I.S.S..

166
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,980
宇宙空间站
International Space Station.

167
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,500
你一直在宇宙空间站里
You were on the International Space Station?

168
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,730
可不是吗  空间站还在运行
Oh that's right, it's still up there.

169
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,840
当休斯顿和莫斯科...
When Houston and Moscow...

170
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:59,950
停止  废掉的时候  我们被孤立了
stop, went dark, we were... alone.

171
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,130
那已经是三年前的事情了
Wow, that was like three years ago.

172
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,060
你自己待了那么长时间
That's a long time to be alone.

173
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,260
很长时间  没错
A long time, yes.

174
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,730
之后  食物吃光了
After time, the food was gone.

175
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,710
系统停止运行了
The system...stop, stop working.

176
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,480
没有氧气  也不能取暖了
The air, the heat.

177
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,740
所以联盟号逃生舱把我带到你这
So Soyuz escape pod bring me to you.

178
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,840
那定是一段地狱般的旅程
Wow, that must've been one hell of a ride.

179
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,500
那其他人呢
What about the others?

180
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,860
你指的是
Others?

181
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,530
你们剩下的工作人员呢
The rest of your crew?

182
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,700
死了
No crew.

183
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,330
只剩尤里

184
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,760

00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:05,930
为了生存
To surviving.

188
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,880
为了生存干杯
To surviving.

189
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,940
可怜的狗狗
Poor dog.

190
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,270
它一定是玩得太累了
All the excitement must've tuckered him out.

191
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,680
我在想他们要去哪
I wonder where they're all going.

192
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,640
无处可去
Nowhere.

193
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,530
他们是僵尸
They're zombies.

194
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,980
好在他们没有领头的
Be glad they don't have a leader.

195
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,650
现在怎么办
Now what?

196
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,070
我们等他们散去
We wait them out.

197
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,310
我们不能在这坐以待毙
We can't just stay here and wait to die.

198
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,450
你们听到了吗  还是我幻听了
Do you hear that or is that just in my head?

199
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,940
我希望是老鼠
I hope it's rats.

200
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,000
我想声音是从这里传出来的
I think it's coming from in here.

201
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,750
哎呦  我去
Awww, damn.

202
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,640
发生这种事还让人怎么休息
How's a guy supposed to relax with all that going on?

203
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,820
我来开
I'll open it.

204
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,930
你动手
You pike it.

205
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,370
别开抽屉  别管它不就行了
Don't open that drawer. Just leave it alone.

206
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,940
淡定
Calm down.

207
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,890

三

210
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,040
我觉得在这里面
I think it's coming from this one.

211
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,610
你还好吗
You okay?

212
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:45,810
没事
Yeah.

213
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,020
摩菲  劳驾下次帮帮忙
Feel free to help out next time, Murphy.

214
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,490
你头发里有只耳朵
You got an ear in your hair.

215
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,720
又怎么了
What's new?

216
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,420
他们要闯进来了
They're coming in.

217
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,520
冷静
Settle down.

218
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,150
这样好吗
I don't know.

219
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,840
我们别无选择
We don't have much choice.

220
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,680
我才不要进那玩意里
No way in hell am I getting in that thing.

221
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,840
一定很有意思
Well, this is gonna be fun.

222
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,310
好了  够了  朋友我不要了
Okay. Good... No more, my friend.

223
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,080
我的朋友

224
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,500
好的
Okay.

225
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,800
我将要向你展示的东西

没有人见过

227
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,240
只有朋友可见  这是朋友圈共享的
This is for friends only. This is a friend zone.

228
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,710

外面还是有幸存者的

我都能轻松掌控

我们能找到僵尸大灾变的原因

外面有人想知道我到底知道些什么

292
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,380
你先来  下一个是我
All right, I'll take the next one.

293
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,010
我害怕呆在密闭空间里
I'm no good in tight spaces.

294
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,330
赶紧进去
Get in.

295
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,020
臣妾觉得臣妾做不到啊
I don't think I can do this.

296
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,710
沃伦  你最好搞快点
Warren, you better hurry.

297
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,510
知道
I am.

298
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,300
该死  现在怎么办
Oh damn. Now what?

299
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,830
来吧
Come on.

300
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,970
好吧  好吧
Okay. Okay.

301
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,360
这里主要用作仓库
It's storage mostly,

302
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,120
储藏备用电源  当然还能用来练高尔夫
backup power, and of course the driving range.

303
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,270
这儿这么多机械  打这么硬的球合适吗
Is good idea to hit hard ball off machinery?

304
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,940
有时候的确需要修理打坏了的机器  不过
Well from time to time we do require repairs, but

305
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,140
我还能怎么办呢
what can I do?

306
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,120
又不能出去打球  球都会不见的
Can't play outside. I'd lose all my balls.

307
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,910
给我球杆
Driver.

308
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,090
因为外面有雪
Because of the snow.

309
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,800
球是白色的  雪也是白色的
You know the balls are white and the snow is white.

310
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,990
我会帮你提高幽默感的
We'll work on your humor.

311
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,240
啊  耶
Ahhh, yeah.

312
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,010
-意思是还不错吗  -呜
- Means is good? - Oooooh.

313
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,700
那意思是很不错  递根球杆来
That means it's great. Hand me an iron.

314
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,550
啊  真棒
Ahhh, yes.

315
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,330
耶  好家伙
Yeah, baby!

316
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,060
你笑什么
Why do you laugh?

317
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,090
你那一球太糟了
That was terrible.

318
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,750
别闹了
Stop.

319
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,050
别抽着哟
Don't choke.

320
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,410
狗屎
Shit!

321
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,260
怎么回事  你喜欢那个  左转左转
What's up? You like that? Go left! Go left!

322
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,520
我完全不喜欢这个
I totally do not like this.

323
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,240
把他们往那边引  把他们往那边引
Lure them this way, lure them this way.

324
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,500
我不喜欢  我不喜欢
I don't like! I don't like!

325
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,770
我不喜欢啦  逮住那个
I don't like! Grab that one!

326
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:23,780
看见了吗
You see this?

327
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,470
-看到了  好棒  -我杀僵尸了  我杀僵尸了
- Yes! Yes! - I'm killing. I'm killing.

328
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,080
帮我记作六杆吧
Put me down for a six,

329
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,630
四杆
four,

330
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,870
三杆吧
three.

331
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,290
嗯  算三杆吧  这是个小鸟球
Uh, three! It's a birdie!

332
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,860
嗨  同志
Yo comrade?!

333
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,670
尤里?
Yuri?

334
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,240
尤里  你在干嘛
Yuri, what are you doing?

335
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,200
这个我们空间站里有
This we had on space station.

336
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,920
行了  走吧  别把东西弄坏了
Okay, well come on before you break something.

337
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,430
我还以为这个球找不回来了呢
I thought I lost this ball.

338
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,260
你必须打完这一洞  现在是加时赛了
You got to finish this hole. It's a playoff.

339
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,680
骤死赛[一球定胜负]
Sudden death.

340
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,860
骤死听起来可不好玩哦  西蒙
Sudden death does not sound like fun game, Simon.

341
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,780
抱歉  你说什么
Sorry, what?

342
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,720
决出胜负来就不好玩了嘛
No fun your game of death.

343
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,890
你就是个怪咖  西蒙
You are odd duck, Simon.

344
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,600
西蒙
Simon?

345
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,730
-不准离开我们  -你待着别动就行了
- Don't you leave us. - Shhh. Just stay real still.

346
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,970
-摩菲  你要敢跑...  -别动了
-Murphy. Don't you leave. - Don't move.

347
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,770
我必须要把你送到加利福尼亚
I got to get you to California.

348
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,320
你已经尽到你最大努力了
You got me as far as you could.

349
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,370
摩菲  求你了
Murphy, please.

350
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,190
他们是怎么死的
What's made them dead?

351
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,150
怎样才能杀死他们
How do we kill them?

352
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,240
你必须冲着头部开枪
You got to shoot for the head.

353
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,420
真的吗  直接爆头
This is true? Shoot the head?

354
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,780
是的  爆头  只有这样才能阻止它们
Yeah, kill the brain. It's the only way to stop them.

355
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,540
再高点瞄准
Aim higher.

356
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,270
去死吧  僵尸
Die zombie!

357
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,620
我们比他们强大
We're stronger than they.

358
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,070
我们是指人类吗
Us humans?

359
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,200
是的  想杀死我们可没这么简单
Mmm-hmmm, yes. It's not so simple to kill us.

360
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,950
想杀死我们手段可要多点
There is not one way but instead many ways to die.

361
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,770
来点爆米花怎么样  你想吃爆米花吗
How 'bout some popcorn? Do you want some popcorn?

362
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,930
我去拿点爆米花
I'm gonna go make us some popcorn.

363
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:43,090
死吧  僵尸  去死吧
Die zombie! Die!

364
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,230
掌握秘诀之后是不是杀得更容易些
Is easy to kill when you know the secret.

365
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,200
我要去趟厕所[朝着头部打]
I'm gonna hit the head.

366
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,490
是的  直接爆头
Yep, shoot in head.

367
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,830
不不不  我是指
No, no, no, I mean...

368
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,980
算了  我马上回来
Nevermind. I'll be right back.

369
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,840
再去拿点伏特加和零食
Oh, bring vodka with snack.

370
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,210
好的  好的  我马上回来
Oh yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. I'll be back.

371
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,730
死吧  僵尸  死死死死  去死吧
Die zombie! Die, die, die, die, die!

372
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:12,450
{\an8}国际空间站氧气已耗尽

373
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,860
{\an8}国际空间站氧气已耗尽

374
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,520
{\an8}国际空间站烧毁于近地轨道
据推测站内所有人员均已死亡

375
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,760
死叛徒想耍我
Judas monkey sauce.

376
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,480
你是掉坑里了吗
Did you fall in?

377
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,280
什么
What?

378
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,480
稍等一下  我马上完事了
Just a second. I'm almost done.

379
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,660
掉坑里  就是指整个人都掉进马桶里了
Fall in. Like you fall in toilet, your whole self.

380
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,660
真好笑  是吧
It's good joke, yes?

381
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,200
是的  是的  我听懂了
Yes, yes, I get that.

382
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,090
用词还挺形象啊
Your slang's coming right along.

383
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,540
我马上就出去了  等一会
I'll be right out. Wait one second.

384
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,880
离那个仪表盘远点  尤里
Step away from that panel, Yuri.

385
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,790
你对国际空间站里伙伴们用的那点手段
You're not gonna do me like you did your

386
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,040
可对付不了我
comrades on the International Space Station.

387
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,540
西蒙
Simon.

388
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,820
市民Z  我的名字是市民Z
Citizen Z. My name is Citizen Z.

389
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,420
没有人叫我西蒙
No one calls me Simon.

390
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,400
甚至没人知道我叫西蒙
No one even knows my name is Simon.

391
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,220
你是怎么知道的
So how do you know?

392
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,690
因为我们是朋友
Because we are friends.

393
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,800
好朋友
Close friends.

394
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,190
朋友  我们不是朋友
Friends. We're not friends.

395
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:18,120
你欺骗我
You lied to me.

396
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:21,680
你告诉我你到底是谁
Now you tell me who you really are.

397
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,100
你问错问题了
You ask the wrong question.

398
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,490
离控制板远一点
Back away from that panel.

399
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,760
退后
Back away!

400
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,090
为什么要穿航空服
And what's with the suit, huh?

401
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,480
这个问题好多了
That is better question.

402
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,690
你是想  你是想冻住我吗
Are you gonna... you gonna try and freeze me out?

403
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,000
放开我
Get off me!

404
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,050
给我老实点别动
Don't even blink

405
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:18,160
不然我就把你脑袋崩回俄罗斯摩尔曼斯克
or I'll blow your brains back to Murmansk.

406
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,700
干什么
What?

407
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,290
你们又不想咬我  你们想干什么
You don't want to eat me, what do you want?

408
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,360
好吧  我就是这个瞎子国的独眼国王
Great. I'm the one-eyed king in the land of the blind.

409
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,970
你为什么来这里
Why are you really here?

410
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,400
谁派你来的  那些黑客吗
Who sent you? The hackers?

411
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,710
狗狗怎么了
What is wrong with dog?

412
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,620
你不准问问题
You don't ask questions!

413
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,800
现在是我在审你
I'm interrogating you!

414
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,510
狗在睡觉  不是吗
Dog is sleepy, no?

415
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,520
你来之前他都好好的
He was fine before you got here.

416
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,530
你对他做了什么
What did you do to him?

417
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,850
你给他下毒了吗
Did you poison him?

418
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,090
问你自己
Ask yourself.

419
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,890
狗怎么了
What is wrong with dog?

420
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,780
天呐  你给我的狗下毒了
God, you poisoned my dog?

421
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,170
如果你做了任何伤害他的事
If you did anything to hurt him...

422
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,670
你个狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

423
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,570
那不是爸爸
That's not daddy.

424
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,680
谢谢  是的  我们准备点餐了
Thank you. Yes, we are ready to order.

425
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,890
我快饿死了
Oh I'm so hungry.

426
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,990
我很想吃帝王蟹
I would love to have some Alaskan King Crab.

427
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,420
还很想吃炒饭
And I would love to have the rice pilaf.

428
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,150
那就太好了  我能再...
That will be so nice. And could I please...

429
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,460
我不想孤单地死去
I don't wanna die alone.

430
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,790
好吧其实我们的死都是孤单的
Well, I mean we all die alone, really.

431
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,130

I like a juicy rib eye with a loaded baked potato.

533
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,830
你个食品雷达能给我扫描扫描吗
Can your psycho food radar find that?

534
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,230
你就是一贪得无厌的老混蛋  多克
Yeah Doc, you're one greedy bastard.

00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,070
别这么客气
Okay, okay, okay.

543
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:13,000
我这么做纯粹是受不了多克抱怨个没完
I only did it to stop Doc's constant whining.

544
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,770
说得有理
That is totally fair.

545
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:16,920
这是牛肉干吗
Is this beef jerky?

546
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:21,310
你别整袋都吃了啊
You're not taking the whole bag, are you?

547
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,150
那么  可以出发了吗
So ummm, can we go now?

548

我想上路了  所以大家都动身吧

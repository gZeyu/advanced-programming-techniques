{\an8}{\pos(185.6,49.901)}.

16
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,820
{\an8}{\pos(228.267,57.0297)}.

17
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:42,820
{\an8}{\pos(150.4,193.188)}.

20
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,250
Hey, hey, hey.

21
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,790
Another quiet Saturday night here at the top of the world.

22
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,290
If you can hear my voice, let me just say

23
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,680
I'm glad you're still alive.

24
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,680
The Great Zombie Zunami of 03

25
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,290
continues to pound the prairie into dust,

26
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,360
headed south from Nebraska into Kansas.

27
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,790
This hive minded crowd of a million plus zombies

28
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,140
is crushing everything in its random path, so

29
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,700
watch your ass out there.

30
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,540
Keep your hands and feet inside the boat,

31
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,100
and don't feed the animals.

32
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,670
This is Citizen Z.

33
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,920
Signing off.

35
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,470
Mays!

36
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,580
What you got, Mays? What you got?

37
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,900
Hernandez!

38
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,900
Could you do that more quietly?

39
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,810
Hello there.

40
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,250
Is someone trying to hack me ?

41
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,700
Sneaking in the side door, huh?

42
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:31,990
Nobody hacks me.

43
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,770
Not now. Not ever.

44
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,040
No entry without an invitation.

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,050
Jeez, I'm working here!

46
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,020
Now to follow you right back...

47
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,880
You clumsy dimwitted amateur!

48
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,550
What do we have here? Wait.

49
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,710
Oh Jumanji.

50
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,610
Dude!

51
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,170
A fireball from outer space gives the base a haircut,

52
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,600
and you got nothing for me?

53
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,140
Saturday night is picking up.

54
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,520
Okay, that's pretty crazy town.

55
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,330
That's impossible.

58
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,940
I read once that you could drink your own urine.

59
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,940
But all I'm pissin' is dust.

60
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,890
Water isn't gonna find you just sitting there.

61
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,850
Why are you so freaking chipper?

62
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,590
I've been wondering that myself.

63
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,830
Maybe it's cuz I conserve my precious bodily fluids.

64
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,310
What is that?

65
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,800
Is it an earthquake?

66
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,610
More like a zombie quake.

67
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,240
Goddamn guys just won't quit.

68
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,200
I suggest we run for it.

69
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,800
Come on, people. Pick it up.

70
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,450
I...

71
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,080
We...

72
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,930
Can't. Dehydrated.

73
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,920
Come on. Keep movin'.

74
00:04:59,310 --> 00:04:59,950
Come on.

75
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,930
Let's go.

76
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,070
Come on! Move it!

78
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,300
This way!

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,780
Wait!

80
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,190
Don't shoot!

81
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,770
Don't move or I'll shoot!

82
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:35,720
Go ahead.

83
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,320
Make my apocalypse.

84
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,620
Reach for the sky!

85
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,990
All right, ummm.

86
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,360
Put your hands... up.

87
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,750
Hands up.

88
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,530
Yeah, yeah, like that.

89
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,070
Yeah.

90
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,080
I am friend.

91
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:18,790
Friend?

92
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,460
You can take your helmet off.

93
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,750
The air is safe.

94
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,130
The air is not safe.

95
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,130
Yes, yes it is. The air is safe.

96
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,500
Yeah, see.

97
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:44,960
The air is safe.

98
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:48,780
Okay.

99
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,630
So that's it?

100
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,430
We're all just gonna lie down and die?

101
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,640
Doc!

102
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,530
Knock it off, Murphy.

103
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,330
Three days without water, man.

104
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,790
The human body hits the wall.

105
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,790
There must be thousands of them.

106
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,080
Millions.

107
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,470
They're migrating.

108
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,420
Migrating to where?

109
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,190
South for the winter.

110
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,350
Zs don't like the cold.

111
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,430
Kid's got it.

112
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,350
We had a place up in North Dakota

113
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,530
near Fort Yates,

114
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,830
quiet little place right on the river.

115
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,170
Couple dozens of us having a go.

116
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,330
I mean, zombie bison every once in a while,

117
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,750
but that was as bad as it got.

118
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,880
Then the rumbling started and never stopped.

119
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,910
Well where'd they come from?

120
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,690
Refugee camp up in Alberta.

121
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,440
Over a million people. No food. No water.

122
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,240
It got ugly.

123
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,470
They all turned in a week.

124
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,830
We shoulda kept running.

125
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,850
You couldn't get around them?

126
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,740
This herd is miles wide. I mean it's got a mind of its own.

127
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,850
You can't move fast enough to get around it.

128
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,050
And every single thing it overruns just adds to its crowd,

129
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,900
you know fast zombies, healthy zombies,

130
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,900
like the ones that just got my friend Buck.

131
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,600
Hey man, you gonna share that with the class?

132
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,120
It ain't water.

133
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,890
Pass it around, whatever it is.

134
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,620
Go easy on it.

135
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,580
Homemade hooch ain't for everyone.

136
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,250
Easy man. Come on. It's got to last me.

137
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,320
Anti-freeze and...

138
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,650
Castor oil.

139
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,670
We've got to get out of here.

140
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,140
He's right.

141
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,190
Okay, this room isn't secure.

142
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,740
We got to find some place more secure.

143
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,540
What's back there?

144
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,250
Morgue.

145
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,320
Let's go.

146
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,670
You heard the lady! Let's go!

147
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,830
Yeah, yeah, all right.

148
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,860
Nuh-uh, no way.

149
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,970
This place is a death trap.

150
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,620
Good, very good. This tea is...

151
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,940
Earl Grey?

152
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,530
That's right. Earl Grey.

153
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,930
It's my favorite.

154
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,840
Huh. It's my favorite too.

155
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,310
We have in common much, you and I.

156
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,330
So, Yuri.

157
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,770
I think we got to address

158
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,600
the eight hundred pound gorilla in the room.

159
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,030
No. It's an expression.

160
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,380
It's American slang.

161
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,750
Sorry.

162
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,040
All right. Look,

163
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,180
okay, how did you get here?

164
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,220
Yes, yes, yes.

165
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,390
Ummm, on I.S.S..

166
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,980
International Space Station.

167
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,500
You were on the International Space Station?

168
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,730
Oh that's right, it's still up there.

169
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,840
When Houston and Moscow...

170
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:59,950
stop, went dark, we were... alone.

171
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,130
Wow, that was like three years ago.

172
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,060
That's a long time to be alone.

173
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,260
A long time, yes.

174
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,730
After time, the food was gone.

175
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,710
The system...stop, stop working.

176
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,480
The air, the heat.

177
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,740
So Soyuz escape pod bring me to you.

178
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,840
Wow, that must've been one hell of a ride.

179
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,500
What about the others?

180
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,860
Others?

181
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,530
The rest of your crew?

182
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,700
No crew.

183
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,330
Only Yuri.

184
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,760
Your crew?

185
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,930
No crew.

186
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,640
Only Citizen Z.

187
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:05,930
To surviving.

188
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,880
To surviving.

189
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,940
Poor dog.

190
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,270
All the excitement must've tuckered him out.

191
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,680
I wonder where they're all going.

192
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,640
Nowhere.

193
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,530
They're zombies.

194
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,980
Be glad they don't have a leader.

195
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,650
Now what?

196
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,070
We wait them out.

197
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,310
We can't just stay here and wait to die.

198
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,450
Do you hear that or is that just in my head?

199
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,940
I hope it's rats.

200
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,000
I think it's coming from in here.

201
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,750
Awww, damn.

202
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,640
How's a guy supposed to relax with all that going on?

203
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,820
I'll open it.

204
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,930
You pike it.

205
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,370
Don't open that drawer. Just leave it alone.

206
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,940
Calm down.

207
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,890
One.

208
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:25,840
Two.

209
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:26,750
Three.

210
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,040
I think it's coming from this one.

211
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,610
You okay?

212
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:45,810
Yeah.

213
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,020
Feel free to help out next time, Murphy.

214
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,490
You got an ear in your hair.

215
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,720
What's new?

216
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,420
They're coming in.

217
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,520
Settle down.

218
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,150
I don't know.

219
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,840
We don't have much choice.

220
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,680
No way in hell am I getting in that thing.

221
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,840
Well, this is gonna be fun.

222
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,310
Okay. Good... No more, my friend.

223
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,080
My friend.

224
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,500
Okay.

225
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,800
What I'm about to show you,

226
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,880
no other human being has seen.

227
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,240
This is for friends only. This is a friend zone.

228
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,710
So after what happened, you know after everybody...

229
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,880
I started working.

230
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,930
Collecting data, collating, running algorithms, 

231
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,660
doing anything that I could do to

232
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,260
put the pieces of the puzzle together.

233
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,240
There is global communication?

234
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,680
Yeah, I mean some.

235
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,580
There are survivors out there.

236
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,970
And you... alone keep this in operation?

237
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,150
Uh, yeah. I mean I'm the only person here.

238
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,010
Internet, satellites, the cameras in cities?

239
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,060
Yes. Yes.

240
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,160
Nanny cams, security cams, web cams.

241
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,580
Anything that puts out a signal

242
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,300
or is somehow connected to the grid

243
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,840
I can reach out and touch it.

244
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,610
I'm the NSA, baby.

245
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,480
What a terrible burden.

246
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,030
What?

247
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,250
To see so much pain.

248
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,470
One man cannot carry this alone.

249
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,580
I'm sorry, friend.

250
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,810
Just stop that.

251
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,390
All right, back to the tour.

252
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,670
And for here, the...

253
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,700
the power, the heat, the fresh air, you...

254
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,830
you control all these things?

255
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,450
Oh yeah, you and I are gonna be fine.

256
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,320
I got solar power, generators,

257
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,510
water filters, air filters.

258
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,640
Enough food to last for a couple of decades.

259
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,910
And enough booze to last for

260
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,740
I dunno a couple fun years.

261
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,780
I know how much you people love your Vodka.

262
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,360
Husky dog.

263
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,700
Dog usually run and play, yes?

264
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,910
Your dog, he...

265
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,960
he do nothing. Why do you think?

266
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,220
You sure do ask a lot of questions, comrade.

267
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:41,890
Yuri,

268
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,800
Yuri, listen to me.

269
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,230
I need your help.

270
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,730
I think

271
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,610
that we can find out the reason for the zombie apocalypse.

272
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,120
The answer is here somewhere.

273
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,080
But we got to be careful.

274
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,450
Somebody tried to hack into my system.

275
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,300
There are other bases like this?

276
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,840
I don't know. I guess.

277
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,170
Someone out there wants to know what I know.

278
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,600
And we can't trust anybody.

279
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,010
I don't want to die in here.

280
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,260
Well you ain't gonna live out here.

281
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,160
I know.

282
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,750
After you, kid. Age before beauty.

283
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,960
Okay.

284
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,350
All right.

285
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,540
One of you goes next.

286
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,960
Rock, paper, scissors?

287
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,120
What are you nine?

288
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,920
Fine, I'll take it.

289
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,700
You better hurry up.

290
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,440
Here you go, Doc.

291
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,240
Okay.

292
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,380
All right, I'll take the next one.

293
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,010
I'm no good in tight spaces.

294
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,330
Get in.

295
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,020
I don't think I can do this.

296
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,710
Warren, you better hurry.

297
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,510
I am.

298
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,300
Oh damn. Now what?

299
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,830
Come on.

300
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,970
Okay. Okay.

301
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,360
It's storage mostly,

302
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,120
backup power, and of course the driving range.

303
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,270
Is good idea to hit hard ball off machinery?

304
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,940
Well from time to time we do require repairs, but

305
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,140
what can I do?

306
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,120
Can't play outside. I'd lose all my balls.

307
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,910
Driver.

308
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,090
Because of the snow.

309
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,800
You know the balls are white and the snow is white.

310
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,990
We'll work on your humor.

311
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,240
Ahhh, yeah.

312
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,010
- Means is good? - Oooooh.

313
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,700
That means it's great. Hand me an iron.

314
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,550
Ahhh, yes.

315
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,330
Yeah, baby!

316
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,060
Why do you laugh?

317
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,090
That was terrible.

318
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,750
Stop.

319
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,050
Don't choke.

320
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,410
Shit!

321
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,260
What's up? You like that? Go left! Go left!

322
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,520
I totally do not like this.

323
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,240
Lure them this way, lure them this way.

324
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,500
I don't like! I don't like!

325
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,770
I don't like! Grab that one!

326
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:23,780
You see this?

327
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,470
- Yes! Yes! - I'm killing. I'm killing.

328
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,080
Put me down for a six,

329
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,630
four,

330
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,870
three.

331
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,290
Uh, three! It's a birdie!

332
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,860
Yo comrade?!

333
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,670
Yuri?

334
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,240
Yuri, what are you doing?

335
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,200
This we had on space station.

336
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,920
Okay, well come on before you break something.

337
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,430
I thought I lost this ball.

338
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,260
You got to finish this hole. It's a playoff.

339
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,680
Sudden death.

340
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,860
Sudden death does not sound like fun game, Simon.

341
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,780
Sorry, what?

342
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,720
No fun your game of death.

343
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,890
You are odd duck, Simon.

344
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,600
Simon?

345
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,730
- Don't you leave us. - Shhh. Just stay real still.

346
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,970
-Murphy. Don't you leave. - Don't move.

347
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,770
I got to get you to California.

348
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,320
You got me as far as you could.

349
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,370
Murphy, please.

350
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,190
What's made them dead?

351
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,150
How do we kill them?

352
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,240
You got to shoot for the head.

353
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,420
This is true? Shoot the head?

354
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,780
Yeah, kill the brain. It's the only way to stop them.

355
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,540
Aim higher.

356
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,270
Die zombie!

357
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,620
We're stronger than they.

358
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,070
Us humans?

359
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,200
Mmm-hmmm, yes. It's not so simple to kill us.

360
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,950
There is not one way but instead many ways to die.

361
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,770
How 'bout some popcorn? Do you want some popcorn?

362
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,930
I'm gonna go make us some popcorn.

363
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:43,090
Die zombie! Die!

364
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,230
Is easy to kill when you know the secret.

365
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,200
I'm gonna hit the head.

366
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,490
Yep, shoot in head.

367
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,830
No, no, no, I mean...

368
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,980
Nevermind. I'll be right back.

369
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,840
Oh, bring vodka with snack.

370
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,210
Oh yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. I'll be back.

371
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,730
Die zombie! Die, die, die, die, die!

375
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,760
Judas monkey sauce.

376
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,480
Did you fall in?

377
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,280
What?

378
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,480
Just a second. I'm almost done.

379
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,660
Fall in. Like you fall in toilet, your whole self.

380
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,660
It's good joke, yes?

381
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,200
Yes, yes, I get that.

382
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,090
Your slang's coming right along.

383
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,540
I'll be right out. Wait one second.

384
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,880
Step away from that panel, Yuri.

385
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,790
You're not gonna do me like you did your

386
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,040
comrades on the International Space Station.

387
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,540
Simon.

388
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,820
Citizen Z. My name is Citizen Z.

389
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,420
No one calls me Simon.

390
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,400
No one even knows my name is Simon.

391
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,220
So how do you know?

392
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,690
Because we are friends.

393
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,800
Close friends.

394
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,190
Friends. We're not friends.

395
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:18,120
You lied to me.

396
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:21,680
Now you tell me who you really are.

397
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,100
You ask the wrong question.

398
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,490
Back away from that panel.

399
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,760
Back away!

400
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,090
And what's with the suit, huh?

401
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,480
That is better question.

402
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,690
Are you gonna... you gonna try and freeze me out?

403
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,000
Get off me!

404
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,050
Don't even blink

405
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:18,160
or I'll blow your brains back to Murmansk.

406
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,700
What?

407
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,290
You don't want to eat me, what do you want?

408
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,360
Great. I'm the one-eyed king in the land of the blind.

409
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,970
Why are you really here?

410
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,400
Who sent you? The hackers?

411
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,710
What is wrong with dog?

412
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,620
You don't ask questions!

413
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,800
I'm interrogating you!

414
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,510
Dog is sleepy, no?

415
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,520
He was fine before you got here.

416
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,530
What did you do to him?

417
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,850
Did you poison him?

418
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,090
Ask yourself.

419
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,890
What is wrong with dog?

420
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,780
God, you poisoned my dog?

421
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,170
If you did anything to hurt him...

422
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,670
Son of a bitch.

423
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,570
That's not daddy.

424
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,680
Thank you. Yes, we are ready to order.

425
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,890
Oh I'm so hungry.

426
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,990
I would love to have some Alaskan King Crab.

427
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,420
And I would love to have the rice pilaf.

428
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,150
That will be so nice. And could I please...

429
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,460
I don't wanna die alone.

430
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,790
Well, I mean we all die alone, really.

431
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,130
I don't wanna die in here.

432
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,250
I don't wanna die now.

433
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,160
I don't wanna die.

434
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:31,970
The Yardbirds.

435
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,910
Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page. Yep.

436
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:38,060
No, Jeff Beck then Jimmy Page.

437
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,320
Get out of here! Go away!

438
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,590
Try to breathe, man. Just breathe.

439
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,170
There's no air in here.

440
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,980
I got to get out of the darkness. I can't take it.

441
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,380
If we all go at once, we can overpower them.

442
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,050
No. No, man. No one's going.

443
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,850
Chill, man. Chill.

444
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,250
One.

445
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:05,830
Two.

446
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:09,850
Otis, be cool man. Be cool.

447
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,990
Three.

448
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:24,470
The Kinks.

449
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:27,000
Ray Davies. Dave Davies.

450
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,050
Did you poison my dog?!

451
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,250
If he dies,

452
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:42,780
- I will kill you. - You won't kill me!

453
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,190
Simon,

454
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,910
you can't.

455
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,340
Simon, you need to listen.

456
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,630
How do you know my name?

457
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:55,260
How do I know your name? I am friend.

458
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,240
Close friend.

459
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,330
You don't know me, but I know you.

460
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:02,690
You tell me what you used to poison my dog! Answer me!

461
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,130
Ask yourself, what is wrong with dog?!

462
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,420
I don't know!

463
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,390
You know answer!

464
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,500
Simon. Is important. Hmmm?

465
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,920
Simon. What do you know?

466
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,010
We need to find out what you know. Simon, think.

467
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,920
What do you know?

468
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,620
What's different about today?

469
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,970
Some crazy cosmonaut broke into my secure

470
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,890
and isolated listening post

471
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,280
and poisoned me and my dog.

472
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:56,670
You have to do better than that, Simon.

473
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,190
Try to answer the question.

474
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,850
What is wrong with dog?

475
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,930
Go to hell.

476
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,420
What's different about today?

477
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,400
What is wrong with dog?

478
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,380
What do you know?

479
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:24,670
Is this all your fight?

480
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,020
You have to do better, Simon.

481
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,790
You must fight for life.

482
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,800
Simon, fight! Fight!

483
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,510
Fight for life!

484
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,630
Help us, please.

485
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,160
What are you?

486
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,890
Leave some water for my girl.

487
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,780
If you see a man, red jacket...

488
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:17,710
Tell him we're still alive. At least do that.

489
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,060
What's different today?

490
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,390
What is wrong with dog?

491
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,810
What do you know?

492
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:17,250
I...can't...breathe...

493
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,260
Good.Why?

494
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,370
What?

495
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:27,440
- You're... suffocating me. - Yes. Why?

496
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:32,420
You're... strangling me.

497
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,890
More specific.

498
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,310
What?

499
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:41,900
You can't breathe because...

500
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:50,110
There is... no... oxygen.

501
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,990
Come on, boy. Come on now.

502
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,330
There you go.

503
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,880
There you go.

504
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,770
All right.

505
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,600
It's time to go.

506
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,420
They've gone?

507
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,790
Yeah.

508
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,320
You came back?

509
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,520
I did.

510
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,310
Where'd you get that?

511
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:00,800
Took it... from a dead family.

512
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,660
Thank you.

513
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:14,990
Oooh, yeah.

514
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,670
Looks like it's just me and you again, pup.

515
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:14,680
Murphy, how did you do this?

516
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,600
No, I don't even want to know.

517
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,390
I take back everything 10K said about you.

518
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:22,590
Well, you know I thought they got Warren already.

519
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:25,150
No offense, but you were almost dead.

520
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:28,260
But Murphy, man you are unreal.

521
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,990
Where'd they all go? How many did you kill?

522
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,510
Are we gonna go outside and see them piled like

523
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,830
ten-deep on the sidewalk?

524
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,620
Down low. Down low. Down low. There you go.

525
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,160
What?

526
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,100
That is the most words

527
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,790
I ever heard come out of your sound hole, kid.

528
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:45,770
These used to be my favorite food.

529
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,020
Where the hell did you find goldfish?

530
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,760
I'm a goldfish magnet.

531
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,600
I didn't know they were your favorite though.

532
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,080
I like a juicy rib eye with a loaded baked potato.

533
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,830
Can your psycho food radar find that?

534
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,230
Yeah Doc, you're one greedy bastard.

535
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,680
You know that?

536
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,970
To Murphy.

537
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:02,470
You may be the mission.

538
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:05,280
But today you became our friend.

539
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:06,970
Thank you.

540
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:07,820
Here, here.

541
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:08,980
Cheers.

542
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,070
Okay, okay, okay.

543
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:13,000
I only did it to stop Doc's constant whining.

544
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,770
That is totally fair.

545
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:16,920
Is this beef jerky?

546
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:21,310
You're not taking the whole bag, are you?

547
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,150
So ummm, can we go now?

548
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,360
I need to go. So I need you to go.

549
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,920
I need to go.

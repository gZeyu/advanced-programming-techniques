《僵尸国度》前情提要
Previously on Z Nation.

21
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,290
各位晚上好  我叫它僵尸重击
Good night, everyone! I call it the Z Whacker.

22
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,810
听着  我就是不相信摩菲
Look, I just don't trust Murphy, okay?

23
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,070
那家伙肯定有古怪
There's something wrong with that dude.

24
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,320
万一这是真的呢
What if it's true?

25
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,660
万一摩菲真如他们所说的那样
What if Murphy's who they say he is

26
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,860
万一我们真有机会制造出疫苗呢
and there's a chance for a vaccine?

27
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,850
因为那是个希望  麦克
Cuz that's hope, Mack.

28
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,550
那不是希望  那是谎话
It's not hope. It's a lie,

29
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,590
这谎话会害死我们的
and it's gonna get us both killed.

30
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,280
那我也情愿因相信这个谎话而死
Well then I'd rather die believing in a lie

31
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,800
总好过没有信仰地苟且活着
than live believing in nothing.

32
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,070
高速公路162  四角保护区  犹他州

33
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:38,330
我累到可以一觉长眠不起
I'm so tired I could sleep for a thousand years.

34
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,580
我们就在这里扎营吧
Let's just camp here, yeah?

35
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,840
我们该走了
We should get moving.

36
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,380
为什么不能待在这里呢
Why can't we stay here?

37
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,770
我们已经超过约定时间两天  可能是三天了
We're probably two days out from the rendezvous. Maybe three.

38
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,580
这或许是我们赶上其他小伙伴最后的机会了
This may be our last chance to sync up with the others.

39
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,370
我希望市民Z这回没搞错
Yeah well I hope Z gets it right this time.

40
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,760
我们去了
Well we went

41
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,280
南部
south.

42
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,720
他们去了西部
They went west.

43
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,790
我们很可能会在中部碰面
Hopefully we'll hook up somewhere in the middle.

44
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,730
我们得转去西部才行
We got to angle west.

45
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,740
是西部没错  加利福尼亚就在那个方向
West is that way. California's that way.

46
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,380
要是它还存在的话
If it's still there.

47
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,130
要是我们能找到通讯设备
Well if we can power up somewhere

48
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,750
我就能和市民Z联系上了
I can try to get in touch with Z.

49
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,180
没准还能获知他们的最新位置
See if maybe I can get an update on their location.

50
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,140
我有点嫉妒那家伙了
I sorta envy that dude.

51
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,300
离这喧嚣尘世远远的
So far away from all this.

52
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,060
没错  可他孤身一人
Yeah, and all alone.

53
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,690
我们朝西部出发
We're gonna go west.

54
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,430
我们去和大队会合
We're gonna meet up with the team.

55
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,270
送摩菲到实验室去
We're gonna get Murphy to that lab,

56
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,710
然后找到治愈僵尸病毒的方法
and then we are going to cure this virus.

57
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,890
真是任重而道远
That's a lot of stuff we're doing.

58
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,020
说的没错
It sure is.

59
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,890
还有那些不在任务之列的事情呢
What about some of the things we aren't doing?

60
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,220
你指什么
What do you mean?

61
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,540
比如讨论一下  前戏神马的
Like talking, for starters.

62
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,000
最近你甚至都不正眼看我了呢
Lately it seems like you can't even look at me.

63
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,000
就像现在这样
Like right now.

64
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,910
艾迪
Addy,

65
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,400
发生什么了
what's going on?

66
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,590
我跟你说过了麦克  我正在努力排解好吗
I told you, Mack. I'm working through it, okay?

67
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,860
我只是不确定
It's a big knot that

68
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,240
现在该不该解开这个心结
I'm just not sure I want to untie right now.

69
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,290
不是一切问题都和你有关
Not everything is about you.

70
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,760
这里风景真好  我们就不能待在这里吗
It's really beautiful. Can we just stay here please?

71
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,950
美景会引来麻烦
Beauty attracts trouble.

72
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,750
你应该知道的
You should know that.

73
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,540
好的
Okay.

74
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,700
我们应该待在那条小溪边上
We should've stayed at the...at the creek.

75
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,520
我以为这点汽油能多撑会  都怪我行吧
Thought we'd get farther on the gas. That's on me. All right?

76
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,010
艾迪  你在看什么
Addy, what are you looking at?

77
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,030
你还好吗
You okay?

78
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,660
艾迪
Addy?

79
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:01,980
你没事吧
You okay?

80
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,960
什么
What?

81
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,820
感觉你好像去过某个地方
It's like you go somewhere.

82
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,440
你到底看到了什么
I mean what is it you see exactly?

83
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,060
麦克  我累了  不想聊这个
Mack, I'm too tired for this.

84
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,710
艾迪
Addy.

85
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,500
麦克
Mack.

86
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,910
你总是这样精神恍惚的  我们得谈谈
We need to talk about when you drift off like this.

87
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,890
很显然  有什么事情在折磨你
I mean obviously something is tearing you up.

88
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,930
只有真正了解你的困扰  我才能帮助你
I might be able to help if I knew what you were dealing with,

89
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,370
但你一直把我拒之门外
but you keep shutting me out.

90
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,090
好吧
Okay.

91
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,700
好吧
Okay.

92
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,890
我想应该是段回忆吧
It's a memory, I think.

93
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,320
我不知道是什么触发了它
I don't know what triggers it,

94
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,230
但无论何时  就好像...
but whenever it happens it's like...

95
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,840
我到了一个自己曾去过的地方
it's like I go somewhere where I've been.

96
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,680
当我试着回忆时
And when I try to remember, it just

97
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,370
这种感觉变得愈发虚无缥缈
it gets further and further away.

98
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,500
你看到了什么
What do you see?

99
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,670
都是同一件事  不断重复上演
It's the same thing. It's over and over again.

100
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,010
周围一片漆黑
It's dark.

101
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,210
然后  好像有一盏灯
There's...there's like a light.

102
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,120
还有一个僵尸
And then a Z.

103
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,060
一个非常凶恶的僵尸
Like a really bad one.

104
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,570
然后就是一场恶战
And it's fighting.

105
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,970
谁和僵尸的恶战
Who's it fighting?

106
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:42,920
我不知道
I don't know.

107
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,350
可能是你
Maybe you.

108
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,370
我
Me, huh?

109
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,240
是的  我一直想不清楚这个部分
Yeah, I can never make that part out. But

110
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,160
但是这僵尸肯定没死
the Z will not die.

111
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,360
能不能...  抱歉  我们能聊点别的吗
Can we...I'm sorry, can we talk about something else?

112
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,570
就这样
Okay.

113
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,140
当然可以  宝贝
Sure, babe.

114
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,310
你想聊点什么呢
What would you like to talk about?

115
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,160
不聊我了  那就聊聊你吧
We're not talking about me. Talk about you.

116
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,240
估计很快就没的聊了
This is probably gonna be a short conversation.

117
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,710
我会一直向你发问
I'll keep it going with questions.

118
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,260
好吧  你打算...
Ummm, okay. What...

119
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,880
如果可以  你现在最想做什么
If you could do anything, what would you do right now?

120
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,180
除了那破裤裆的事儿  你最想做什么
Besides the obvious. What would you do?

121
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,180
我告诉你我想做什么
I'll tell you exactly what I would do.

122
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,550
我会
I would

123
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,390
带你
take you out

124
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,130
去一个很棒的餐厅
to a great restaurant.

125
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,550
城里最好的
The best in town.

126
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,340
穿戴整齐
I mean dress up.

127
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,340
冲个澡
Shower.

128
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,070
全套的  全套的
Whole package, the whole deal.

129
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,070
我会为你开门  帮你摆好椅子
I would open the doors for you. I would pull out your chair.

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,510
我们点些酒
We'd order some wine.

131
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,730
美美地吃一顿
Have a great meal.

132
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,260
然后再点些酒
Order some more wine.

133
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,060
之后我会
And then I would just...

134
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,660
盯着你美丽的眼睛  看一整晚
I would just stare into your beautiful eyes all night

135
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,500
听你讲自己的事
and listen to you talk about yourself.

136
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,120
然后我们回到美妙之极的公寓  嘿嘿...
Then we'd go back to our fabulous pad and...

137
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,730
我们没戏的  麦克
We never stood a chance, Mack.

138
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,270
等等
Hold on.

139
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,700
你说什么
What are you saying to me?

140
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,290
想想吧
Think about it, like

141
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,860
你我的关系  是以什么为基础的
our relationship. What's it based on?

142
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,930
我们有什么共同点吗
Do we even have anything in common?

143
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,240
我们都活着
We're alive.

144
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,340
活着这个动因还不行吗
How's that for starters?

145
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,080
是啊  我就是说这个
Yeah, but that's about it.

146
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,240
灾难爆发的第一天晚上我们相遇了
We met on the first night of the outbreak.

147
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,110
我们甚至不了解对方
We don't even know each other.

148
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,000
我们知道的就是僵尸和骚乱
All we know is zombies and mayhem.

149
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,200
艾迪  我们互相支持着活下来
Addy, we've kept each other alive.

150
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,140
我是说  不管情况有多糟
I mean no matter how bad it's gotten,

151
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,700
我们都不离不弃
we've been there for each other.

152
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,560
这比结婚戒指带来的羁绊更加深刻
That's so much more of a bond than any ring could give us.

153
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,020
是的  但是...
Yeah, but...

154
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,190
我们之间是痛苦的羁绊
we're trauma bonded.

155
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,660
我们一起杀戮
We kill together,

156
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,990
我们一起活了下来
we survive together, and

157
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,450
还一起滚了床单
we have sex together.

158
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,050
但就是这些  这就是一切了
But that's it. That's all we have.

159
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,330
没错  我们在灾难的第一天就相遇了
Yeah, we met on night one.

160
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,800
可我甚至记不清那晚了
And I don't even remember that night really. Like

161
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,090
对我来说那晚就是模糊的...
for me it's just one blur of...

162
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:05,690
好吧
Okay.

163
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,340
混乱
Madness.

164
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,910
是的  没错  我是说
Yeah, yeah. I mean

165
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,860
那很糟糕  并且
that was bad, and and

166
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,980
并且在此之前  我们遇到了很多
we got a lot of bad shit to go through

167
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,680
糟糕的情况  可是艾迪
before this is all over. But Addy,

168
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,390
我需要你  可我不懂你的意思  我们...
I need you. I don't know what you're talking about, we...

169
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,970
你说我们没戏  这是什么意思
we never had a chance. What do you mean by that?

170
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,150
我是说  宝贝  过去三年里
I mean, babe, in three years

171
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,940
我们从没想到过明天过后的事情
we have never thought about anything past tomorrow.

172
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,390
直到...
You know until this

173
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,410
有了这项疯狂的任务  这项...
crazy mission came about, which you know is

174
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,960
就我们而言应该肩负的任务
probably done as far as we're concerned.

175
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,870
但这也不意味着我们玩完了好吗
That doesn't mean we're done.

176
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,770
我们现在在自己骗自己好吗...
Yeah, but who are we kidding? What...

177
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,720
我和你会有一个怎样的未来呢
what kind of future do you and I have?

178
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,930
我们会做些什么
What are we gonna do?

179
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,390
我们会结婚生子吗
We gonna get married? Have some kids?

180
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,420
那种事你想都不能想
You can't even think about that stuff.

181
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,080
那很疯狂  是不可能的事
It's crazy. It's impossible.

182
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,700
我们有彼此啊
We have each other.

183
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,950
我们从未约会过
We've never been on a date.

184
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,270
少来
No?

185
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,960
我不会让那成为我们的羁绊
That's not gonna cut it.

186
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,410
好吧
Okay.

187
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,160
别这样
Stop.

188
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,610
艾迪生
Addison.

189
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,230
你有中间名吗
Do you have a middle name?

190
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,420
恩  我有
Yeah, I got a middle name.

191
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:40,970
是什么
What is it?

192
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,440
格雷斯[意为优雅]
It's Grace.

193
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,340
很适合你
Of course it is.

194
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:56,500
艾迪生·格雷斯·卡弗  你愿意和我出去
Addison Grace Carver, will you go out with me?

195
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,070
约会吗
On a date?

196
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,980
-麦克  -我保证不会是打打杀杀了
- Mack. - I promise we won't kill a thing.

197
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,860
好了  嘘  你...
Okay. Shhh. You know what...

198
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,520
你就在这漂漂亮亮的待着  哪也别去
You just sit here and look pretty. Don't go anywhere.

199
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,700
我还能去哪
Where am I gonna go?

200
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,230
好了  艾迪  不是想要约会吗
All right, Addy. You wanted a date?

201
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,900
我们的第一次约会来了
Here is our first date.

202
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,240
不是吧
No.

203
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,260
艾迪
Addy?

204
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,670
艾迪
Addy?

205
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,020
好吧  没关系  你继续睡吧
All right, that's fine. You go ahead and get your sleep.

206
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,240
末世漫漫无绝期啊
It's been a long apocalypse.

207
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,270
麦克
Mack!

208
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,260
艾迪
Addy?

209
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,480
艾迪
Addy?

210
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,450
麦克
Mack!

211
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,090
艾迪
Addy?

212
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,330
艾迪  你在里面吗
Addy, you in here?

213
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,210
艾迪
Addy?

214
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,390
搞什么鬼
What the hell?

215
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,980
这些是咬痕吗
Are those bites?

216
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,310
什么东西会咬僵尸呢
What bites a zombie?

217
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,230
艾迪
Addy.

218
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,300
艾迪
Addy?

219
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,640
告诉我你是打了这混蛋后逃走了
Please tell me you did a hit and run on this bastard!

220
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,210
混蛋
Damn, dude.

221
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,640
该死的巨人安德雷[著名摔跤手]  艾迪
Freaking Andre the Giant. Addy!

222
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,490
好吧
All right.

223
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,580
宝贝  不要啊
Baby, no.

224
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,000
你从哪得到这串项链的
Where'd you get that necklace?

225
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,290
这项链是从哪儿弄来的  尼玛
Where did you get that necklace? Huh?

226
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,120
回答我  你个无脑变态
Answer me, you brain dead freak!

227
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,770
哦  宝贝
Oh, baby.

228
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,720
好了
Okay.

229
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,050
好了
Okay.

230
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,460
没事了  没事的
You're fine. You're fine.

231
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,070
麦克！
Mack!

232
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,840
艾迪?
Addy?

233
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,340
艾迪  你去哪儿了
Addy? Where'd you go?

234
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,800
等等
Oh, wait a minute.

235
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,420
搞毛线
What?

236
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,250
我曾到过这儿
I've been here.

237
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,080
好吧
Right.

238
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,180
哈哈  咬我啊
Ha. Bite me.

239
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,040
这并不代表她死了  麦克
Doesn't mean she's dead, Mack.

240
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,800
很可能她拼尽全力给它一棒后就脱身了
She could've given it her best shot then bolted.

241
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,120
她是个聪明的姑娘
She's a smart girl.

242
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,400
站住  丑男
Hey, ugly!

243
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,020
艾迪
Addy.

244
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,240
你要吃谁脑子都行
You can have all the others!

245
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,700
就是不能伤害艾迪
You cannot have her!

246
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,610
她不能死
She didn't deserve this.

247
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,360
此一时彼一时哦
Sometimes you're the windshield. Sometimes you're the bug.

248
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,220
这是她的项链
This is her necklace.

249
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,730
不能给你
You can't have it.

250
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,030
绝不对你留情
No mercy.

251
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,160
有没有搞错
Come on.

252
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,880
你打了兴奋剂吗
You on steroids?! Huh?!

253
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,410
我生来就喜欢堂堂正正地跟人干架
I was brought up to compete clean.

254
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,620
向右多跳一步就好了  麦克
One foot to the right, Mack.

255
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,400
走开
Go away.

256
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,680
这一轮我就快死了
I'll be dead soon.

257
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,720
重生模式倒计时
Not soon enough.

258
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,130
艾迪
Addy?

259
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,310
艾迪
Addy?

260
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,620
麦克
Mack!

261
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,570
该死
Damn it.

262
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:28,880
这一轮向右跳
To the right.

263
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,720
向右跳  向右跳  麦克
To the right! To the right, Mack!

264
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,210
尼玛  跳太远了
Too far.

265
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,680
大哥  您又来
You again?

266
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,840
麦克
Mack!

267
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,800
麦克
Mack!

268
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,650
麦克
Mack!

269
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,390
我记得这扇门
I know that door.

270
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,060
我在哪见过这扇门
Where have I seen that door before?

271
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,410
怎么回事
What is it, huh?!

272
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,530
你到底要对我做什么
What do you want from me?!

273
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,660
怎么回事
What is it, huh?!

274
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,180
你到底要干什么
What do you want from me?!

275
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,330
回答我!
Answer me!

276
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,890
是艾迪吗
What is it Addy?!

277
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,730
你休想打她主意
You can't have her.

278
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,090
我不会让你得逞的
I won't let you.

279
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,850
门后面有什么东西
Is there something behind that door

280
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,170
是你不想让我看到的吗
you don't want me to see?

281
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,560
就是因为这个吗
Is that what this is?

282
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,000
到底是什么
What is it?

283
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,010
为什么  伙计  是艾迪吗
What is it, man? Is it Addy?

284
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,000
你到底不想让我看到什么
What is it you don't want me to see?

285
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,060
麦克
Mack?

286
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,700
你还好吧
Are you okay?

287
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,830
还好
Yeah.

288
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,560
还好  就是额...
Yeah, ummm...

289
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,550
不太好
No.

290
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,270
我不知道怎么了
I don't know.

291
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,740
能跟我说说吗
You want to talk about it?

292
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,100
我做了个梦
I had this dream.

293
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,020
其实不像梦  更像是预兆  就好像是...
It's more like a premonition than a dream. You know it's like

294
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,590
通灵梦魇
a psychic nightmare.

295
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,770
哇哦
Whoa,

296
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,000
通灵
Psychic?

297
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,270
麦克·汤姆森  你可是世界头号怀疑论者
Mack Thompson, world's most skeptical man,

298
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,580
你还会有通灵预兆呢
is having psychic premonitions?

299
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,790
过来
Come here.

300
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:28,540
干什么呢
What are you doing?

301
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,330
试试你的体温
Taking your temperature.

302
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,080
我觉得你是发烧烧糊涂了
I think you're having a fever dream.

303
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,650
艾迪  别闹
Addy, come on.

304
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,880
我是认真的
This is serious.

305
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,260
我也是认真的
I'm serious too.

306
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,560
你别忘了  我们现在在荒无人烟的地方
Okay, if you haven't noticed, we're in the middle of nowhere.

307
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,210
我们没水喝  没东西吃  没汽油
We have no water. We have no food or fuel.

308
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,080
我不能让你在我身边倒下  亲爱的
I can't have you falling apart on me, babe.

309
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,000
对不起
I'm sorry.

310
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,130
我也不会在你身边倒下的
I'm not falling apart on you though.

311
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,240
不会的
I'm not.

312
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,200
只不过...
It's just...

313
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,090
那感觉太真实了  你知道吗
It just felt so real, you know?

314
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,350
好像梦境背后隐藏着某件事
You know it felt like it's about something, you know?

315
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,710
肯定是有什么事  肯定有事
It is about something. It is. It has to be.

316
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,010
但我觉得不是关于未来的
But I don't think it's the future.

317
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,430
我觉得问题在于你
I think it's about you.

318
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,790
一定是你的潜意识
I think your subconscious is trying to

319
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,900
想要告诉你某件事
tell you something.

320
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,400
好吗
Okay?

321
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,480
所以我们...我们一起来解决
So let's...let's figure it out.

322
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,060
发生什么了
What happened?

323
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,710
好吧
Okay.

324
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,640
我一直...一直在重复做着同一个梦
It's... It's one of these dreams that keeps repeating,

325
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,820
每次的梦境又有点不一样
you know like each time it's a little bit different.

326
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,040
每次我醒来时都在你身边
Each time I wake up next to you.

327
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,620
可我朝你那儿看时发现你不见了
I look over and you're gone.

328
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,890
然后我听到你哭喊
I hear you crying.

329
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,250
好吧  那没什么
Okay, well that one's easy.

330
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,190
你都...都不需要用佛洛依德那套
You don't... don't need Freud

331
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,860
或者脑部扫描就能搞明白
or a brain scan to figure that one out.

332
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,010
麦克  你那是在担心我
Mack, you're worried about me.

333
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,480
听着  我也担心你
And listen, I'm worried about you too.

334
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,380
但这...  这没那么简单
But that's...that's not just it.

335
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,630
这只是梦的开始  好吗
That's just how it starts, right?

336
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,830
之后我就听到你在求救
And then I hear you,

337
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,260
你好像遇到了什么麻烦
and you're in some kind of trouble.

338
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,970
再之后我就听到一个声音
And then and then I hear this sound,

339
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,700
好像是僵尸在远处大吼大叫
this like zombie howl echoing off in the distance.

340
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,000
真的是超级恐怖
It's super creepy.

341
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,110
来了  就是这个声音
There it is. That's the sound.

342
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,820
又来了  那个声音
There it is again. That sound.

343
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,920
我告诉你  那玩意就在外面
I'm telling you, that thing is out there.

344
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,690
喂喂喂  一个僵尸而已
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's a zombie.

345
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,270
好吧  听着  你听我说
Okay so hey, hey listen.

346
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,630
我们去杀死它
Let's go kill it,

347
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,250
一起去
together.

348
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,060
好吗
Okay?

349
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,370
看  快看  快看
Watch, watch, watch.

350
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,160
它马上就要出现了  就是那里
It's gonna show up right over there.

351
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,930
你确定吗
You sure?

352
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,670
马上就会出现
Any second.

353
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,300
麦克
Mack?

354
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:02,000
搞什么  这太奇怪了
What? That's so weird.

355
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,600
这...
It's...

356
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,410
在梦里我就站在这里
I've stood right here and

357
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,340
每次都能看到它
and and seen it every time in my dream.

358
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,380
就是这里
Right here!

359
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,540
麦克  听着  麦克
Mack, listen. Mack!

360
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,010
麦克
Mack!

361
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,940
麦克
Mack!

362
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,770
这不对劲
This isn't right.

363
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,590
这之前是...
This was...

364
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,480
是这里吗
Is it here?

365
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,990
-退后  快退后  -好的  好的
- Stay back, stay back. - Okay, okay.

366
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,960
好的
Okay.

367
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,640
麦克  你在找什么
Mack, what are you looking for?

368
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,750
一条蛇
A snake.

369
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,200
就是这里
It's here.

370
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,630
它...  它总是...  总是在这里出现
It's...it's...it's always right here.

371
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,270
你觉得我疯了  是吗
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

372
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,430
没有
No.

373
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:02,890
也许是有一点
Maybe a little bit.

374
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:05,040
但是麦克  听着  听我说
But Mack, hey listen, listen.

375
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,670
我们就生活在这个世界里
It's the world we're living in.

376
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,320
多多少少都有点精分
Okay, we're all a little bit crazy.

377
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,720
有些不对劲
Something's not right.

378
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,380
麦克  等等
Mack! Wait!

379
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,050
-麦克  -子弹上膛吧
- Mack! - Lock and load.

380
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,610
它可不好对付  2米左右  250多斤
This thing is badass. 6'7", maybe 280.

381
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,700
当你听到老鹰叫  你就赶快到我身边来
And when you hear a hawk, you stand right next to me

382
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,670
那意味着诡异的事情就要发生了
because all hell's about to break loose.

383
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,730
发生了什么
What's happening?

384
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,610
这里就是它上次杀死我的地方
This is where it killed me the last time.

385
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,190
听起来真恐怖
Sounds horrible.

386
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,480
还好只是个梦
I'm glad that was just a dream.

387
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,050
麦克  这是...
Hey Mack, is that...

388
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,090
这是你梦到的那扇门吗
is that the door from your dream?

389
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,280
对  就是它
Yeah, that's it.

390
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,670
也许我们该瞧瞧里面都有什么
Maybe we should go see what's inside.

391
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,070
我觉得这样不妥
I don't think that's a good idea.

392
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,630
你在梦里有进去过吗
In your dream, did you ever go inside?

393
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,830
没  每次我还没到那就被僵尸怪干掉了
No, Frankenzombie always killed me before I made it that far.

394
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,920
我们应该进去看看
Yeah, we should see.

395
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,570
别去了
No.

396
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,380
算了吧  万一我们还是身处梦境的轮回之中呢
No, come on. What if this is just a dream again?

397
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,370
万一那个怪物在那儿等着我们去送死呢
I mean what if that thing is just waiting in there to kill us?

398
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,500
麦克  我们不可能在同一个梦境里  好吗
Mack, we can't both be having the same dream, okay?

399
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,040
因为我的意识很清醒
Because I'm awake.

400
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,040
艾迪
Addy.

401
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,770
你确定你想这么做吗
You sure you want to do this?

402
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,250
对啊  我们大老远跑过来的
Yeah, we've come this far.

403
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,650
难道你不好奇里面是什么吗
Don't you want to know what's inside?

404
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:46,640
不好奇  因为肯定不是什么好东西
No. Whatever it is, it's bad.

405
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,230
所以我们还是赶快走吧
So let's just...let's just get out of here.

406
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,340
麦克  那只是个恶梦而已
Mack, it was a nightmare.

407
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,960
也许这里面没什么可怕的
There's probably nothing bad in there.

408
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,990
但此时若不一探究竟  就永远无法得知了
But if we don't look, we'll never know.

409
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,250
艾迪  不要
Addy, no.

410
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,030
好吧
Okay.

411
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,390
好了  谜团揭开  世界美妙了
Okay, great, mystery solved. I feel so much better now.

412
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,350
可以走了吗
Can we go?

413
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,420
哥们
Dude.

414
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,630
怎能就此放弃呢
Can't give up yet.

415
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,920
好吧  行了  艾迪  让我来
Okay. All right, Addy. Come on.

416
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,100
你看见什么了吗
What do you see?

417
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,100
不清楚
I don't know.

418
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,850
太暗了  也许是...
It's so dark. Maybe

419
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,980
是个房间吧  但我也不确定
it's some kind of room, but I can't tell.

420
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,260
那你再加把劲儿
Okay, well keep trying.

421
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,620
什么也没有  我们还是走吧
There's nothing in there. Let's just go, okay?

422
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,300
再仔细看看
Keep trying.

423
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,600
有什么吗
What is it?

424
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,060
等一下  我的眼睛还在适应  太暗了
Hang on. My eyes are still adjusting. It's so dark in here.

425
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,210
伸手不见五指
It's pitch black.

426
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,250
看起来像个楼梯间
Looks like a staircase

427
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,970
通向地下室
leading down.

428
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,140
不要  不要
No. No.

429
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,420
不要怕
Don't be afraid.

430
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,890
别害怕
Don't be afraid.

431
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,930

You're having a nightmare. Hey, you're having a nightmare, okay?

440

Addy, there's something I have to tell you.

445
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,290
和你的噩梦有关吗
Does it have to do with the dream?

446
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,460
到底怎么了
What is it?

447

Are you infected?

462
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,020
是你伤的他吗
Did you do this to him?

463

你怎么还不死
Why won't you die?

466
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,270

麦克  太对不起了
Mack, I'm so sorry.

472
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,840
我还以为是你神经
I thought it was you.

473
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,540
这么长时间我一直以为是你神经
All this time I thought it was you.

474
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,340
我算知道那些闪回是怎么回事了
I know what the flashbacks were about.

475
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,700
我以为是你神经  其实是姐自己神经
I thought it was you, but it was me.

476
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,880
天啊  原来是姐  姐是深井冰啊
Oh my God, it was me. It was me.

477
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,480
病毒最初爆发的晚上...
That first night...

我还不知道
I didn't know.

479
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:03,040
当时我还不知道  我还不知道怎么施以仁慈
I didn't know. I didn't know how to give mercy.

480
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,710
我还不知道要捅大脑
I didn't know you had to kill the brain.

481
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:09,760
我就这么一刀一刀又一刀地捅她
I just kept stabbing her over and over and over again.

482
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,510
天啊
Oh my God.

483
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:18,490
我杀了她  麦克  天啊  原谅我吧
I killed her, Mack. Oh my God. Forgive me.

484

485
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,050
我杀了她
I killed her.

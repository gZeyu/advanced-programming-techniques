搞不好人类就又重回轨道了
the human race is back in business.

23
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,940
别跟我扯什么殃及无辜
Oh, don't talk to me about collateral damage.

24
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,090
放弃几个人可以拯救全人类嘛
The death of the few for the good of the many.

25
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,560
我懂得  我懂得啦
I know, I know.

26
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,670
我又在胡言乱语啦
I'm talking out of my ass again.

27
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,420
我不会去核爆任何人的
I'm not nuking anybody.

28

反正今日是不会的

00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,100
但做做白日梦又何妨呢是吧
But a man can dream, right?

30
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,970
估计这会儿  也就只有"咬痕"研究所
Meanwhile, I guess it's up to operation Bite Mark

31
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,550
可以拯救人类了
to save humanity.

32
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:40,960
如果能知道他们在哪
I'd feel a hell of a lot better

33
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,530
感觉就会好多了
if I knew where they were.

34
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,280
我这想法不错吧  二哈
Pretty good, right dog?

35
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,430
矮油  你又不懂的啦

{\an8}布莱克山  南达科他州

37
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,410
不会这整个州都需要爬坡吧
Is this entire state uphill?

38
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,030
我们现在到底在哪
Where are we anyway?

39
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,530
根据这地图显示  我们身处南达科他州的布莱克山上
According to this map, we're in the Black Hills of South Dakota.

40
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,900
我想念以前的卡车了
I miss the truck.

41
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,110
起码我们远离了那一大群恶心鬼
At least we're out of that damn horde.

42
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,850
可这儿没什么丧尸可杀了呢...
There's nothing to kill out here.

43
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,250
这点姐可不介意
That's fine by me.

44
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,120
我们需要赶紧找个地方落脚
We need to find a place to make camp soon.

45
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,220
哥的老蹄子蹬不动了
My dogs is getting tired.

46
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,480
这附近应该有个叫埃奇蒙特的小镇
Well there's supposed to be a little town nearby called Edgemont.

47
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,900
我会在下个山脊这儿看一下罗盘度数
I'll take a compass reading at this next ridge up here.

48
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,460
我们就不能先歇下吗
Can't we just take a break?

49
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,730
歇一小下吧
A quick one.

50
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,940
天呐
Oh my God.

51
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,180
快看
Look.

52
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,470
到底那是谁做的啊
Now who in the hell did that?

53
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,110
一些有着变态幽默感的冒失鬼们吧
Some daredevil with a sick sense of humor.

54
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,420
那是拉什莫尔山吗
Is that Mount Rushmore?

55
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,600
这就是为何我们不能创造美好的事物
This is why we can't have nice things.

56
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,250
估计是之前毁坏自由钟那混蛋的又一杰作吧
Probably the same jackass that tagged the Liberty Bell.

57
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,620
我觉得很赞哦
I think it's awesome.

58
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,480
如果让姐抓到了肇事者
If I ever catch who did that,

59
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,890
姐抽不死丫的
they're gonna get a whoopin'.

60
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,900
快点吧  我们得去找那个镇了
Come on. Let's find that town.

61
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,480
天马上要黑了
It's gonna get dark soon.

62
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,490
我还以为要歇一下呢
I thought we were taking a break.

63
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,710
休息结束了
Break time's over.

64
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,260
我们都走了几小时了
We've been walking for hours.

65
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,760
承认吧  "哥伦布"大姐  你走迷路了
Admit it, Columbus, you're lost.

66
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,870
别BB了  墨菲
Give it a rest, Murphy.

67
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,640
沃伦知道要往哪里走
Warren knows where she's going.

68
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,580
你知道要往哪里走的哈  沃伦  
You know where you're going, Warren?

69
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,390
额  按理说走到这会儿本该走到了
Well we should've hit the town by now.

70
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,890
同时在此声明
And for the record, 

71
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,050
哥伦布当时发现美洲大陆时也迷路了
Columbus was lost when he discovered America.

72
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,150
呵呵  大姐  您给自己台阶铺得真好
Yeah, and look how that turned out.

73
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,380
快看看那儿
Check this out.

74
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,040
那也不是镇子啊
That's not a town.

75
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,390
作为一名乐观开朗  积极向上的医生
Well now being Doctor Brightside for the moment,

76
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,710
我觉得里面或许会有些有用的东西
maybe there's something useful inside.

77
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,270
是啊  过去看看吧
Yeah. Let's check it out.

78
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,970
呵呵  真有家的感觉呢
Oh, just like home.

79
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,810
你知道吗  这个地方对我们而言  或许是个
You know what, this actually might be a safe place 

80
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,570
安全的落脚处  还能搞到些补给
for us to get some rest and load up on some supplies.

81
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,050
我还能睡上一小时
I could use an hour's sleep.

82
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,120
多克  去开门
Hey. Doc, get the door.

83
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,670
这年头还锁什么门嘛
Why do they still lock doors?

84
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,000
幸好我有把万能钥匙
Luckily I have a skeleton key.

85
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,910
作为一名消极悲观的医生
Well being Doctor Darkside,

86
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,790
看来我们在这里是找不到食物或者弹药了
we are not gonna find much food or ammo in here.

87
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,340
没错  要是我们想找工业管道
Yeah. If we wanted industrial pipes,

88
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,610
那就是来对地方了
this would be the place to be.

89
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,750
真讨厌
I don't like this.

90
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,710
快看啊
Oh, look.

91
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,420
打住  你不能就这样喝了
Hey, hey, hold on. You can't just drink that.

92
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,440
你不会以为这里是小超市吧
What do you think this is the local Piggly Wiggly?

93
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,810
这可能是什么工业用水
That could be some kind of you know industrial type water 

94
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,900
喝了会穿肠烂肚
that'll rot your insides.

95
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,730
少废话
Spare me the details.

96
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,830
看这里
Shhh, over there.

97
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,230
快躲起来
Take cover. Come on.

98
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,500
大家都别出声
Everybody sit quietly.

99
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,910
抱歉
Sorry.

100
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,530
屁走火了
It got away from me.

101
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,440
要是我因为你放屁而挂掉  我就拉你垫背
If I die because you farted, I am taking you with me.

102
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,680
这尼玛是什么呀
What in the livin' hell?

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,380
还夜光的呢
It's glowin'.

104
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,810
就像个僵尸鬼
It's like a zombie ghost.

105
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,110
它为什么会发光
Why is he glowing?

106
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,300
它还有同伴
He's got friends.

107
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,400
该死
Shoot.

108
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,640
别碰它们
Don't touch them!

109
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,100
离僵尸远点  这么近很危险
Back away from the Zs! It's not safe!

110
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,090
不行
No!

111
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,690
别碰它们
Don't touch them!

112
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,120
会传染吗
Are they contagious?

113
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,360
它们有放射性
Radioactive.

114
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,800
放射性
Radioactive?

115
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,260
怎么可能
How is that possible?

116
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,420
我带你去看
I'll show you.

117
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:06,860
自己看吧
There you go.

118
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,720
他们今日还真是不走运啊
This is gonna be one of them days, ain't it?

119
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,010
容我问一句
If you don't mind my asking,

120
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,110
你们在反应堆附近瞎转悠什么
what were you folks doing wandering out there near the reactor?

121
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,150
我们迷路了
We were lost.

122
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,930
我们没迷路
We weren't lost.

123
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,740
我们的车在距这里二十英里的地方跑没油了
Our vehicle ran out of gas 20 miles from here.

124
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,740
为了躲开僵尸我们从树林里抄了小路
We took a shortcut through the woods so we could avoid the Zs.

125
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,100
那算你们找对路了
You're not lost anymore.

126
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,600
欢迎来到南达科他州的埃奇蒙特
Welcome to Edgemont, South Dakota.

127
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,450
不算上你们  这里只住了三个人
Population three, not counting you.

128
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,280
我叫威尔伯·格雷迪
Name's Wilbur Grady.

129
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,240
这是我女儿艾米莉亚
This is my daughter, Amelia.

130
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,100
幸会
Nice to meet you.

131
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,750
幸会  我是罗伯塔·沃伦
Nice meeting you. I'm Roberta Warren.

132
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,660
他是摩菲
This is Murphy.

133
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,530
她是卡桑德拉  后面的是一万
And that's Cassandra. And this is 10K in the back.

134
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,580
他还好吧
Is he okay?

135
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,990
不太好  辐射病
No. Radiation poisoning.

136
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,270
我很好
I'm fine.

137
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,910
让我帮你们检查一下
Let's get you folks checked out

138
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,230
给你们搞点吃的
and get you some food.

139
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,390
我们家就在离路口不远的地方
Our place is just around here down the road a little ways.

140
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,100
这是什么
What are these?

141
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,150
碘片
Iodine.

142
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,210
它能防止辐射累积在你的甲状腺内
It'll keep the radiation from accumulating in your thyroid.

143
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,410
对  没错
Yeah, right.

144
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,640
看起来你们身上的辐射量还在正常范围内
Looks like you're still within safe levels.

145
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,030
不过你们该庆幸我们救援及时
But you're lucky we came along when we did.

146
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,920
这里绝大部分僵尸都有高度放射性
Most of the Zs around here are highly radioactive.

147
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,130
好像变成吃脑子的僵尸还不够糟似得
As if being brain-eating zombies wasn't bad enough.

148
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,440
我有个问题要问
Okay. Question.

149
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,870
我们也应该穿上防护服吧
Shouldn't we be in one of these suits too?

150
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,170
这里的辐射强度没那么大
Radiation levels aren't too bad out here.

151
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,070
不过接下来20年里  你们可能会得癌症
But you'll probably get cancer in twenty years.

152
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,360
我倒不太担心这个
Somehow that's way down on my list of worries.

153
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,250
但我们现在面临一个棘手的问题
Yeah, but our more immediate problem

154
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,050
核反应堆芯即将融毁
is the reactor core melting down.

155
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,250
如果我们不尽快修好
We don't fix it soon,

156
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,150
三百英里范围内的所有东西都会发光
then everything within a 300 mile radius will be glowing.

157
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,250
不只是那些僵尸
Not just the Zs.

158
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,060
既然这样
Okay, well

159
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,710
很高兴见到你们
it's been nice meeting you.

160
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,380
我们也有别的地方要去
We have places to be,

161
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,190
那些地方离这里绝对不止三百英里
places at least 300 miles from here.

162
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,370
那祝你好运
Good luck with that.

163
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,890
镇上所有的车都被开走了
Every vehicle in town is gone

164
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,910
剩下的都不能开了
or can't be driven.

165
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,000
我认为我们现在最好是步行上路了
Then I guess we better start walking.

166
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,170
你走不出去的
You won't make it.

167
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,510
还有不到48小时堆芯就会融毁
We have less than 48 hours before the core starts to melt down.

168
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,900
那你们为什么还留在这里
Why are you still here?

169
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,630
因为还有一线希望
Because there's still a chance to shut this thing down

170
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,350
关掉它就可以挽救大片上帝的国度
and save a big chunk of God's country

171
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,250
接下来一万年内免遭辐射之灾
from being irradiated for the next 10,000 years.

172
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,690
而且  我离死也不远了
Besides I'm already a goner.

173
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,900
那令媛呢
Well what about your daughter?

174
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,090
她也为这个自杀任务签下生死状吗
Did she sign up for this suicide mission too?

175
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,690
我一直会陪在父亲身边  帮助他
I am sticking around to help my dad.

176
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,360
我跟她说过  我不需要她的帮助
I told her I didn't need her help,

177
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,890
她就是不听
but she wouldn't listen.

178
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:02,970
我是一名飞行员
I'm a pilot.

179
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,360
我可以用飞机把大家带出危险区
I'll fly us out of the hot zone.

180
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,660
那太好了
Well perfect.

181
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,960
我们搭个顺风车
We'll just hitch a ride.

182
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,650
没错
Yeah.

183
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,910
如你们所见  机上只能坐一名乘客
As you can see there's only room for one passenger.

184
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,380
我的子弹也够给你们每人一枪
And I have enough bullets for all of you,

185
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,520
所以不要再打飞机的主意了
so don't go getting any ideas.

186
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,040
格雷迪...威尔伯先生  
Mister Grady, Wilbur.

187
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,690
虽然你可能看不出来
I know it doesn't look like it,

188
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,360
但这个人
but this man...

189
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,050
他是唯一已知被僵尸咬伤后还能活下来的人
this man is the only known survivor of a zombie bite.

190
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,980
我还以为他有什么问题
Thought there was something wrong with him.

191
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,810
他的血液里有僵尸病毒的抗体
His blood carries antibodies for the zombie virus.

192
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,070
他是全人类最后的希望
He's our last best hope for humanity.

193
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,940
那哥还是复活节的小兔子呢
Yeah right, and I'm the Easter bunny.

194
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:43,920
给他看看
Show him.

195
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,970
我的上帝
Oh my God.

196
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,340
老兄  你看
Now look, man.

197
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,840
这哥们可是如假包换的
This dude here's the real deal.

198
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,700
很多人为了护送他而丧命
And a lot of people got killed getting him this far.

199
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,610
所以你告诉我们怎么做才能关闭反应堆
So tell us what we need to do to shut down that reactor

200
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,400
大家才能继续上路
so we can be on our way.

201
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,710
除非你还要忙着下蛋  兔子先生
Unless of course you have eggs to lay, Mister Bunny.

202
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,510
我的计划是这样的
Okay, here's the plan.

203
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,030
我要进到控制室里面
I need to get to the control room

204
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,990
看看是否可以搞清楚
to see if I can figure out

205
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,740
燃料棒无法正常落入冷却池
why the fuel rods aren't dropping down

206
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,300
阻止核反应的原因
to the cooling pool to stop the reaction.

207
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,700
因为里面僵尸太多
I haven't been able to get in there

208
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,760
我根本进不去
cuz of this gauntlet of zombies.

209
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,310
所以我需要你们的帮助
That's where I need your help.

210
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,050
杀僵尸  我们行
Killing zombies, that's what we do.

211
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,110
核反应堆保护壳外面的辐射强度
Radiation levels are only slightly elevated

212
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,120
只是高那么一点点
outside the containment building.

213
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,160
所以至少两分钟之内是安全的
So you should be safe for at least two minutes.

214
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,410
在你不得不退回来之前
Long enough to get me to the door

215
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,650
有足够的时间协助我到门那里
before you have to retreat back here.

216
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,880
{\an8}禁止停车  不要堵门

217
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,630
用一切手段
Use whatever you have

218
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,180
阻止僵尸靠近
to keep the Zs from getting too close.

219
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,860
它们受到了严重污染
They're very contaminated.

220
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,630
跟他们拥抱一下  你就只剩几小时可活了
One hug and you'll be dead in a few hours.

221
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,590
不要抱僵尸
Don't hug the zombies.

222
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,150
懂了
Got it.

223
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,710
你们俩待在这
You two stay here.

224
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,580
一万  你从上面掩护我们
10K, you cover us from up there.

225
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,750
如果我们回不来  你必须想办法送他去加州
If we don't get back, you get him to California somehow.

226
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,320
来吧孩子  准备好了吗
Come kid, you ready?

227
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,390
上吧
Let's do this.

228
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,650
一万
10k!

229
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,620
第2304个
Two thousand, three hundred and four.

230
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,860
记住  两分钟  不能再长了
Remember two minutes! No more!

231
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,440
上
Go!

232
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,730
快跟上
Come on!

233
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,290
你们还有一分钟
You got one more minute!

234
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,580
不要拥抱哥啦
No hugging!

235
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,280
快上来吧  我们走
Come on, let's go!

236
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,820
你们得走了
Time for you to go.

237
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,380
你们必须撤了
You got to go.

238
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,510
撤
Go!

239
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,100
注意了
Heads up!

240
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,720
我来搞定
I got it.

241
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,710
出去吧
Get out of here.

242
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,840
你们没时间了
You're out of time.

243
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,800
你们必须撤出去  撤
You have to go. Go.

244
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,680
他们回来了
They're back.

245
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,550
我快到控制室了
I'm almost to the control room.

246
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,670
太好了  继续  爸爸
Great. Keep going, dad.

247
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,230
我们现在做什么
What do we do now?

248
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,420
等他
We wait.

249
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,840
咬痕研究所  这里是北极光  呼叫
Operation Bitemark, this is Northern Light, come in.

250
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,890
咬痕研究所  这里是北极光  是否收到
Operation Bitemark, this is Northern Light, do you copy?.

251
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,010
咬痕研究所  这里是北极光  呼叫
Operation Bitemark, this is Northern Light, come in.

252
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,090
咬痕研究所  这里是北极光  是否收到
Operation Bitemark, this is Northern Light, do you copy?.

253
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,140
咬痕研究所  这里是北极光  呼叫
Operation Bitemark, this is Northern Light, come in.

254
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,600
咬痕研究所  这里是北极光
Operation Bitemark, this is Northern Light,

255
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,980
-是否收到  -乖孩子
- do you copy. - Good Boy.

256
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,340
咬痕研究所
Operation Bitemark.

257
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,830
他来了
Hey, here he comes.

258
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,590
爸爸
Dad.

259
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,430
爸爸  爸爸  爸爸  爸爸
Dad, dad, dad, dad.

260
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,570
爸爸  你没事吧
Dad, are you okay?

261
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,550
看着我  爸爸
Look at me, dad.

262
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,990
-我没成功  -爸爸  爸爸  不  不
- I didn't make it. - Dad, dad, no, no.

263
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,150
不  挺住  挺住  挺住
No, hang on, hang on, hang on.

264
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,100
爸爸  不  不
Dad. No! No!

265
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,030
不  爸爸
No! Daddy.

266
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,340
不  醒醒  求你了
No. Wake up. Please.

267
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,070
字幕
No!

268
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,770
不  不  不不  求你  不要死  爸爸
No! No! No, no, please, no, not you dad!

269
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,490
不  不  不
No! No! No!

270
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,170
不
No.

271
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,340
不要死
Not you.

272
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,800
很抱歉  把他埋了吧
I'm sorry. Let's bury him.

273
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,460
不
No.

274
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,920
看起来那东西还是过热
So that thing is still read to cook off.

275
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,660
我想知道现在我们该做什么
Well I'd like to know what we're supposed to do about it.

276
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,700
逃走行不通
Can't run.

277
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,540
我们逃不出爆炸范围
We're still within the blast zone.

278
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,650
我们进去
We go in.

279
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,720
进去干什么
And do what?

280
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,200
知道怎么关闭那玩意儿的是格雷迪
Grady was the one who knew how to shut that thing off.

281
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,750
我是医生  该死的
I'm a doctor, dammit,

282
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,560
又不是核物理学家
not a nuclear physicist.

283
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,140
就差一点
He was so close.

284
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,900
你爸爸做了个很好的尝试
Your dad gave it a good try.

285
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,080
有时候我们能做的也仅限于此
Sometimes that's the best we can do.

286
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,420
起码他没有死于他害怕的东西
It wasn't dying that he was afraid of.

287
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,230
他真的不想变成僵尸
He really didn't want to become a Z,

288
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,730
哪怕只有几秒
even for a few seconds.

289
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,230
艾米莉亚  我们需要知道
Amelia, we need to know...

290
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,250
如果我们保护你  你能不能
can you shut this thing down by yourself

291
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,750
独自关掉那玩意儿
if we protect you?

292
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,150
我了解飞机
I know airplanes,

293
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,690
不是核电站
not nukes.

294
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,860
棒极了
Awesome.

295
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,700
但有一个人知道
I mean there's one guy.

296
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,180
在这吗  在埃奇蒙特吗
Here, here in Edgemont?

297
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,610
是的  荷马·斯塔宾斯
Yeah, Homer Stubbins.

298
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,450
他在核电站做了二十年的总工程师
He was the chief engineer at the plant for 20 years.

299
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,060
他是我爸爸的上司
He was dad's boss.

300
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,280
末世开始之后他就躲进了森林里
He's been holed up in the woods since the apocalypse.

301
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,400
他有武器  是个危险人物
He's armed and dangerous.

302
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,960
他儿子死后他就开始隐居
He became a recluse after the death of his son.

303
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,700
我们怎么才能找到荷马
How do we find Homer?

304
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,240
他不会理你们的
He won't talk to you.

305
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,770
我们得试试
We have to try.

306
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,480
我们只能走到这了
We have to stop here.

307
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,800
还有五十码远呢
We're still fifty yards away.

308
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,650
我爸爸说这里设了地雷
My dad said the place was booby-trapped.

309
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,270
我跟你们说过了  荷马是个疯子
I told you, Homer's crazy.

310
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,900
我们完全不考虑先去打个电话吗
Have we completely dismissed the idea of a phone call?

311
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,220
我就随便一说
Just sayin'.

312
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,200
这种陷阱是你的风格
This is your kinda set-up. 

313
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,430
我们怎么能进去
How do we get in?

314
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,090
是活着进去
Without us getting killed. 

315
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,000
我希望你们把这个谨记于心
I do like to keep that in mind.

316
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,430
有一点很重要
Uh, well one thing.

317
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,050
荷马的陷阱旨在阻止僵尸  而非正常人
Homer's set-up is aimed at stopping Zs, not a team. 

318
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:37,170
所以如果我们擦亮眼睛看清地雷和拉发线
So if we keep a sharp eye out for landmines, trip wires...

319
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,330
就不会有事
We'll be fine.

320
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,720
好的
Okay.

321
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,170
你们三个  留在这里
The three of you guys, stay here.

322
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,740
让我们先走四十秒
Give us a 40 second head start.

323
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,260
我们从侧面绕过去由后门进
We'll flank him and come up from behind.

324
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,750
好的  小心地雷
Okay, watch for mines.

325
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,940
看着呢
Watching them.

326
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,530
别动
Don't move!

327
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,340
你有三秒钟的时间告诉我你们在这干什么
You have three seconds to tell me what you're doing here.

328
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,370
一
One.

329
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,710
二
Two.

330
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,710
别轻举妄动  先生
Don't do that, sir.

331
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,880
动手吧  但是帮我个忙
Go ahead. Do me a solid.

332
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,640
别让我变成僵尸
Just don't leave me a Z.

333
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,070
我不会的  斯塔宾斯先生
I'd never do that, Mr. Stubbins.

334
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,580
我们只是需要你帮忙
We just need your help.

335
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,560
大爷  您也好啊
Hello to you too.

336
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,120
格雷迪是个好人
Grady was a good man.

337
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:07,490
如果说有人可以"安控斧"反应堆
If anyone could SCRAM that reactor

338
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,210
那就是他
it was him.

339
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,370
"安控斧"
Scram?

340
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,580
安全控制棒持斧人
Safety Control Rod Axe Man.

341
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,100
这要追溯到第一个反应堆
Goes back to the first reactors.

342
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,610
他们拥有的唯一安全系统差不多就是
The only safety system they had was literally 

343
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,120
一个人一把斧子
a man with an axe

344
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,100
等到熔毁事故发生时  他只需要
whose whole job in the event of a meltdown

345
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,390
砍断悬在冷却池上方燃料棒上的绳子
was to cut the rope holding fuel rods over the cooling pool.

346
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,350
我爸就是想这么做的
That's what dad was trying to do.

347
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,040
你还有多少时间
How much time do you have?

348
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,150
是我们还有多少时间好吧
How much time do we have?

349
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,730
你跟我们在一条船上  荷马
You're in the soup with us, Homer.

350
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,260
你是不是把我和别的关心这事的人搞混了
You've confused me with someone who gives a damn.

351
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,170
据格雷迪说  不到40小时了
According to Grady, less than 40 hours.

352
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,960
我们还就是关心这事呢
And we do give a damn.

353
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,060
你是打算帮我们
Now are you gonna help us

354
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,710
还是这么干坐着眼看大家全玩完
or are you gonna sit here and let us all die?

355
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,490
有个办法倒可以一试
Well there's one thing we might try.

356
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,770
我得带你们去看看
I'm gonna have to show you.

357
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,540
我们需要武器  设备
We're gonna need weapons, equipment.

358
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,780
来吧  装备起来
Come on. Load up.

359
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,840
反正这些个东西我也用不着了
It's not as if I'm gonna be needing this stuff.

360
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,490
你好啊  救星
Hello, nurse.

361
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:19,580
上等伏特加  僵尸天启特供延命水
Vitamin V. The elixir of the Zombie Apocalypse.

362
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,130
你正在看的是反应堆的
You know you're looking at the original building plans

363
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,540
最初设计图
for this reactor.

364
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,160
我当初也是设计团队的一员
I was part of the design team.

365
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,450
你年纪轻轻的  一把刀使起来
You're pretty handy with that knife

366
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,640
倒挺溜
for a kid.

367
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,890
我儿子...
My son...

368
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,890
他也有把这样的刀
he had one like it

369
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,690
不过刀刃更长
but with a longer blade.

370
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,090
对  是老款的
Yeah, older model.

371
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,290
想用好这刀需要不少技巧
Got to be good to make it work.

372
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,900
马克斯很厉害
Oh, Max was good.

373
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,340
我们走  出发吧
Okay, let's go, let's do it.

374
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,780
我听说了你儿子的事了
I heard about your son.

375
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,380
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

376
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,250
再没有比白发人送黑发人更惨的事了
There's nothing worse than outliving your own child.

377
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,330
没了
Nothing.

378
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,860
南达科他一带还真是静的不得了啊  是不是
There sure is a whole lot of nothing in South Dakota, huh boy?

379
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,370
见鬼
Dammit.

380
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:19,870
{\an8}卫星电话
侦测到通讯

381
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,120
什么鬼
What the hell?

382
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,930
一通卫星电话
A satellite phone?

383
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,710
是那小队的吗
Is it my team?

384
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,900
该死
Oh, rats.

385
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,240
{\an8}通讯中断

386
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,830
北极光  请回答
Northern Light, come in.

387
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,970
我不知道你用那破玩意儿打算联系谁
I don't know what you want with that old piece of junk.

388
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,250
还能打给谁呢
Nobody to call.

389
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,080
我们知道有人没准会接
We got somebody that might pick up.

390
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,980
北极光  请回答
Northern Light, come in.

391
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,000
有什么不对吗  荷马
Something wrong, Homer?

392
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,410
我认识她
I knew her, that's all.

393
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,420
她儿子是马克斯的好朋友
Her son was one of Max's buddies.

394
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,850
你们知不知道重回你童年的老房子
Did you ever go back to the house you grew up in

395
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:01,500
却只能亲眼见到它颓败倒塌是什么感觉
only to see it's falling apart and in a bad neighborhood?

396
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,480
现在就是这种感觉
That's what this feels like.

397
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,920
再扩大十倍
Times ten.

398
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,900
在我老家  僵尸实在是改善市容市貌了
Well where I grew up, the Zombie Apocalypse only improved things.

399
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,120
好  说正事吧
All right, back to business.

400
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,610
过了这道围栏就有辐射了  对吧
From here on the area's hot, right?

401
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,410
你们有两套防辐射服
You got two clean rad suits in there.

402
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,990
一套我用
One for me and

403
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,930
我还需要有个人支援我
I need somebody to back me up.

404
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,650
不  我去
No. I'll go.

405
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,050
你不能去啊
Well you can't go.

406
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,240
万一出了岔子
Who's gonna get him to California

407
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,430
谁把他送到加州呢
if something goes wrong?

408
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,980
别指望哥啊
Don't look at me.

409
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,700
好吧  那行
Okay. All right.

410
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,110
你要记住你现在是有子弹
Just remember you have ammo now.

411
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,280
但子弹也有用完的时候
But not an infinite supply.

412
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,910
我们上吧
Let's do this.

413
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,730
{\an8}禁止入内

414
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,230
我们得找到控制室
We made it to the control room.

415
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,470
问题的关键就在那儿
And there's our problem.

416
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,180
三号冷却池
Cooling pool three.

417
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,520
你能让它紧急停止吗
Can you SCRAM it or not?

418
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,080
根据控制系统显示  所有的燃料棒都启用了
According to the controls, all the rods are enabled

419
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,440
但是有东西卡在了嵌入处
but something is physically blocking the insertion.

420
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,140
必须把那东西清理掉
We need to remove it.

421
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,270
徒手吗
By hand?

422
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,750
不需要我们亲自来
Not by our hand.

423
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,180
它叫罗比
This is Robbie.

424
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,490
它能开进核芯  进行手动紧急停堆
He will roll into the core and do a manual SCRAM.

425
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,700
它能穿透任何东西
He can cut through anything.

426
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,290
这个小宝贝甚至能让钢铁蒸发
This little darlin' can vaporize steel.

427
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,760
我懂了
I get it.

428
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,240
就像无人机一样
It's like a drone.

429
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,830
只不过它从来不在天上飞
Only he never leaves the ground.

430
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,130
僵尸太多了
There's too many Zs.

431
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,330
退回去吧  荷马
Back it up, Homer.

432
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,690
我来操作
I'll do the driving.

433
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,230
我们必须前进
We need to go forward.

434
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,180
该死被僵尸发现了
Damn Zs got us.

435
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,900
你长得可真丑啊
You're an ugly one.

436
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,840
去死吧
Damn Z.

437
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,490
我没时间陪你玩
I don't have time for this.

438
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,660
快干掉他们
Get 'em out of there.

439
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,790
该死的僵尸  滚开
Damn Z. Leave.

440
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,490
罗比阵亡了
We lost Robbie.

441
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,620
现在怎么办
So what now?

442
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,220
采用方案二还是方案三
Plan B or is it C?

443
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,730
要不就是方案四  五  六
Give me a D, E, F.

444
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,210
别说些没用的
Not helpful.

445
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,680
好吧  罗比坏了
All right. Robbie failed.

446
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,690
但我还是能手动停堆
But I can still do a manual SCRAM.

447
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,170
怎么做  里面全都是僵尸
How? That place is filled with Zs.

448
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,800
我们重装上阵
We'll go in heavier.

449
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,490
这次我们一起上
Take us along this time.

450
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,480
我们可能还有一次紧急停堆的机会
We probably only got one more shot at a SCRAM.

451
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,990
但必须先穿上重型保护装才能进控制室
But we'll need heavier suits to reach the control room.

452
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,220
去哪儿找那些保护装
Where do we find them?

453
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,540
在实验室里  离刚才罗比被干掉的地方不远
In the lab, not far from where we lost Robbie.

454
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,280
可以去四个人  两个人穿这种保护装
Four can go in, two in these suits.

455
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,870
我跟这小子穿重型保护装
Me and the kid in the heavies.

456
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,810
好啊
Okay.

457
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,120
不过要是方案三也不中用
But what happens if plan C doesn't work

458
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,370
我们最后都被核辐射弄死了怎么办
and we wind up with our very own Fukushima Chernobyl whatever?

459
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,000
你是担心你自己遭遇不测吧
You mean what happens to you?

460
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,470
喂  我可没有主动请缨拯救人类
I didn't ask for the job of saving the human race.

461
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,220
艾米莉亚
Amelia.

462
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,990
你能不能开飞机把他带到放射区外
Would you be willing to fly him out of the radiation zone?

463
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,050
说实话
To be honest,

464
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,710
飞机燃料不够了
I don't have enough fuel.

465
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,700
我跟我爸撒谎了
I lied to my dad or else

466
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,250
要不然他是不会让我留下来的
he never would have let me stay behind.

467
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,570
好极了
Great.

468
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,650
不过要是有几加仑燃油的话
If I had a few gallons,

469
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,560
我就能带上一个人离开爆炸区
I might be able to get myself and one other person

470
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,410
这说的还是最幸运的情况
outside the blast zone, if we are lucky.

471
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,600
以前  我跟朋友把一辆道奇·达特轿车
Okay, a buddy and I once converted a Dodge Dart

472
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,480
改装成烧酒精的了
to run on alcohol.

473
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,840
一架轻型飞机的发动机也没多少不同
A light plane engine isn't that different.

474
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,910
你有很多伏特加
You had a serious supply of vodka.

475
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,550
任你取用
You're welcome to it.

476
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,040
好的
Okay.

477
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,030
多克和卡桑德拉
Doc and Cassandra,

478
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,550
跟一万和荷马一队  你们掩护他们
go with 10K and Homer. You cover them.

479
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,500
摩菲和艾米莉亚跟我来
Murphy and Amelia, come with me.

480
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,590
考虑到没有其它选择
Given we have no other choices,

481
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,740
我还是接受这个安排吧
I shall embrace the inevitable.

482
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,630
如果行得通  我们就回到这里庆功
If this works, we'll meet back here to celebrate.

483
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,780
{\an8}危险

484
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:59,080
情况不妙啊  爆炸前我们只有30分钟
That's not good. We have 30 minutes till boom.

485
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,080
勇敢的小家伙
Brave little dude.

486
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,290
真糟糕  只能把他留在这里了
Too bad we have to leave him here like this.

487
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,910
在这个丑陋的世界里
Sentiment is a fatal flaw

488
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,250
多愁善感可是致命的缺点
in this ugly world.

489
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,710
以防需要支援
We should let Warren know where we are 

490
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,410
应该让沃伦知道我们到哪了  对吧
in case we need backup, right?

491
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,610
沃伦  我是多克
Warren, this is Doc.

492
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,330
请注意  我们已经进入到
Please be advised we have entered the tunnel

493
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,700
通往反应堆芯的隧道了
to the reactor core. 

494
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,960
通话完毕
Over and out.

495
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,300
我们看看这个宝贝出什么毛病了
Let's see what's going on with this baby.

496
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,550
亲爱的  艾米莉亚
So Amelia, my dear.

497
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,130
我们靠着这堆完好的航空硬件
Where exactly might we be headed

498
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,760
到底要飞到哪里
in this fine piece of aeronautical hardware?

499
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,690
考虑到这可是涉及到我的性命
Considering it's only my life 

500
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,580
以及人类存亡的关键
and the human race at stake.

501
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,810
谢里丹  怀俄明州
Sheridan, Wyoming.

502
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:35,650
我们向西北方向飞
It's to the northwest,

503
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,960
放射性尘埃会被吹向东南方
and the fallout will be to the southeast.

504
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,420
两个方向相距甚远
Far enough away, and

505
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:42,220
我和爸爸还听说那里有人类存活
my dad and I heard there's some real humans.

506
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,440
希望它能飞起来
I just hope it works.

507
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,860
小菜一碟  给我一些工具就行了
Piece of cake. All I need is some tools.

508
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:53,430
摩菲  你能不能别喝燃料了
Murphy, could you quit drinking your fuel

509
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,320
然后给油箱加满
and fill up the damn tank?

510
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,450
我不知道油箱在哪
I don't know where the tank is.

511
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,380
反正不是在你嘴里
Well it's not in your mouth.

512
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,980
给我一个螺丝刀
Let me get a screwdriver.

513
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,780
好吧  飞机里有22加仑燃料
Okay, so that was 22 gallons.

514
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,680
这里到谢里丹的直线距离是250英里
Sheridan is 250 miles as the crow flies.

515
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,990
这里还有两瓶
Here's a couple more.

516
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,180
那里距离爆炸区足够远吗
Is that gonna be far enough to clear the blast zone?

517
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,380
肯定够了
It'll have to be.

518
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,070
这是伏特加  不是航空燃油
Well this is vodka, not avgas. 

519
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,910
所以实际里程数可能存在变数
So the mileage may vary.

520
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,540
听着  我...
Listen, I, uhhh...

521
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:39,890
该死  你不是要跟我道别吧
Oh shit, you're not gonna try and say goodbye, are you?

522
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,380
我本想说
I was going to say

523
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,980
面对每个人的牺牲  要有感恩之心
be grateful for all the sacrifices everyone has made.

524
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,290
看你的了
Back at you.

525
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,310
我们到了吗
Are we there yet?

526
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,010
我们只飞了5分钟好吗
We've been in the air for five minutes.

527
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:14,130
我有点喜欢飞行了  这里看不到僵尸
You know, I kinda like this. You can't see any zombies.

528
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,470
我打赌  他们就在下面
They're down there, bet on it.

529
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:19,350
如果我们能在比林斯找到更多燃料
Hey, if we find more fuel in Billings,

530
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,950
我们可以再次起飞  直达加利福尼亚
we could take off again and head to California.

531
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,950
我们要找的是伏特加
If we find vodka.

532
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,400
我可不知道如何将烧酒精的发动机再改回烧燃油的
I don't know how to change this carburetor back to a gas-burner.

533
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,680
多克  我是沃伦  现在回到工厂了
Doc, this is Warren, back at the plant,

534
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,160
准备按同样路线进入
coming in the same way.

535
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,490
多克  我是沃伦
Doc, Warren.

536
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,930
你好  罗伯塔  欢迎归队
Hello, Roberta. Welcome back.

537
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,390
请注意  我们现在从设施的另一端
Please be advised we're now entering the reactor core

538
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,160
进入反应堆芯
on the other side of the facility.

539
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,660
有什么我能做的吗
Is there something I can do?

540
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,720
为我们祈祷吧
Oh, just the usual prayer.

541
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,650
我们的"贵重货物"怎么样了
What's the status of that precious cargo?

542
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,920
那个"话唠包裹"起飞了吗
Has the mouthy package taken off?

543
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,590
是的  已经飞上天了
Yeah, he's in the air.

544
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,110
那等我们解决掉麻烦
Then we'll fix our little problem.

545
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,620
出去再跟你会合吧
And see you on the way out.

546
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,200
你会记挂你的朋友们吗
Will you miss your friends?

547
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,520
他们不是我的朋友
They're not my friends.

548
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,990
顶多算是临时战友
More like foxhole buddies.

549
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,230
但是  会想念的
But yeah.

550
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,670
-怎么回事  等一下  -我...
- What's going on? Wait. - I...

551
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,980
-什么情况  -我能搞定
- What is that? - I got it.

552
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,040
只是遇到气流  颠簸了一下
Just a little turbulence.

553
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,890
我的妈呀
Oh God!

554
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,200
稳住
Hang on.

555
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,750
-闭嘴  给我坐稳  -我的妈呀
- Shut up and hang on! - Oh God!

556
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,800
我的天啊
Oh God!

557
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:10,970
艾米莉亚
Amelia!

558
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,700
天啊  不是吧
Oh God, no.

559
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,850
施以仁慈
Mercy.

560
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,080
施以仁慈
Mercy.

561
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,210
施以仁慈
Mercy.

562
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,460
好奇怪
It's weird.

563
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,460
太诡异了
It's too weird.

564
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:39,610
来瞧瞧
All right.

565
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:43,180
看哪辆车还能启动可以带我们离开这里
Which one of you fine vehicles is our ride out of here?

566
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,520
你好  三角洲X光小队
Hello, Delta-X-Ray.

567
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,120
这是三角洲X光小队  收到请回复
This is Delta-X-Ray, copy.

568
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,160
给我一些发光僵尸的信息
I need a little information on glowing zombies.

569
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,970
好的  正在查找"僵尸百科"
Okay. Checking zombie-pedia.

570
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,190
你开玩笑呢
Are you kidding?

571
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,240
是的  不过这也不失为一个好主意
For now, but it's not a bad idea.

572
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,570
查到了  这叫"天使之光"
Okay. It's called 'Angel's Glow.'

573
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,770
源自于一种线虫细菌
Comes from nematode bacteria.

574
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,840
不知何故  放射物感染了僵尸的皮肤
Somehow the radiation affects zombie skin

575
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,350
在上面培养出了细菌
and lets bacteria grow there.

576
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,380
细菌暴露在高强度的辐射之下时就会发光
The bacteria glows when exposed to high levels of radiation.

577
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,980
首次出现是在日本的福岛
First observed at Fukushima.

578
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,690
你就回答我  他们会辐射吗
I just need an answer. Are they hot or not?

579
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,840
千万别让他们
Don't let them

580
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,670
喷溅到你
spatter you.

581
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,490
该死
Shoot.

582
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,300
你还在吗
Still there?

583
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,640
对
Yeah.

584
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,780
姐还能去哪儿
I got no other place to be.

585
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,320
你感觉怎么样
How you feeling?

586
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,690
这衣服快把我焖熟了
Like a baked potato in this thing.

587
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,160
反应堆的堆芯就在这条通道的下面
Reactor core is right down this corridor.

588
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,910
那我们还愣在这儿干嘛
Then why are we standing here?

589
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,550
因为那里的放射强度太高了
Because it's highly radioactive in there.

590
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,190
我要下到堆芯里  手动插入操作杆
I'm going into the core to manually insert those rods.

591
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,340
凭你一人之力吗
By yourself?

592
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,400
别挡道  小家伙
Out of my way, sonny.

593
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,000
不好意思  你需要后援
I'm sorry. You need backup.

594
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,210
随你便吧
Suit yourself.

595
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,030
你们去吧  这事就交给我了
You guys go. I've got it.

596
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,990
拿着这个
Take this.

597
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,270
随时跟我们汇报情况
And we need to hear everything!

598
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,020
好了  走吧  行动
All right! Go on! Move it!

599
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,860
快点
Come on!

600
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,710
不知他从哪儿冒出来的  我没反应过来
That guy came out of nowhere. I couldn't move fast enough.

601
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,540
这是一个好消息伴随着各种噩耗的状况吧
It's one of those good news, really really bad news things.

602
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,150
没被咬死  但防护服破了
The suit is breached.

603
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,570
能拿胶带粘上吗
Can I tape it up?

604
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:14,470
孩子  我这辈子吸收的辐射量太多了
Son, I've accumulated so many rads in my life,

605
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,920
我走向大门的那一刻
I was probably a dead man

606
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,800
可能已经注定要牺牲了
the moment I walked through the gate.

607
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,330
我肯定能做点什么
There's got to be something I can do.

608
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,390
刚才那个你不算上吗
Aren't you gonna add to your count?

609
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,810
第2316个
Two thousand three hundred and sixteen.

610
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,940
你知道吗  你是个好孩子
You know you're a good kid, 

611
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,990
跟我儿子马克斯一样坚强和聪明
strong, smart, like my son Max.

612
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:41,410
我希望上帝能给你更好的运气
I just hope to God you have better luck.

613
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,780
你也挺像我爸爸的
You're a lot like my dad too.

614
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,410
有一样的厄运
With the same bad luck.

615
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:52,840
为了大家你得活下去
You need to go on for all of us.

616
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,360
答应我
Promise me that.

617
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:59,170
继续生活...我儿子已经做不到了
Live the life...my son never had.

618
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,790
我们得到上面去
We need to get up there.

619
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,460
所剩的时间不多了
Time really is a waistin'.

620
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,350
让我们搞定它吧
Let's get to it.

621
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,430
这就是我们的麻烦
There's our problem.

622
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,510
有两条棒没下去
Two rods didn't go down.

623
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,460
我得过去手动把它们分开
I'm gonna have to go out there and unstick those rods.

624
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:32,360
小心别把我扔到反应堆里
Be careful not to drop me into the reactor pool.

625
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,500
我会马上被煮熟的
I'll be cooked instantly.

626
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,720
我们不该让他们孤军作战
We shouldn't have left them alone.

627
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:37,830
收到
Got it.

628
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,780
我们无法留下  那超出了我们的极限
We couldn't stay. We were at our limits.

629
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,280
那玩意儿爆炸了  也没啥极限可谈了
That thing goes off and limits won't matter.

630
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,560
荷马知道自己在做什么
Homer knows what he's doing.

631
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,230
而且我们小万万很棒的好吗
And the kid is awesome.

632
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,850
我出发了
Here I go.

633
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,830
你能让我靠近点吗
Can you get me closer?

634
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,260
好的  对不起
Yeah, sorry.

635
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:02,000
我以为你这个时代的人都是遥控高手
I thought everybody your age was a whiz with a remote.

636
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,200
我不是
Not me.

637
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,650
再把我放低一点
Lower me a little more.

638
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,110
你能让我再靠近点吗
Can you get me a little closer?

639
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,080
好
Okay.

640
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,570
按下写着"释放控制爪"的开关
Now hit the switch that says claw release.

641
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,580
一个下去了
One down.

642
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,110
等这个搞定了
Once this is fixed,

643
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,130
毙了我然后逃出去
shoot me and get out.

644
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,040
我不想成为它们的一员
I don't want to become one of them.

645
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,230
如果我最近没说什么
If I haven't said anything lately,

646
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:10,380
我想说非常感谢宇宙
thank you so much,universe.

647
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,220
赐予我僵尸天启
For the Zombie Apocalypse!

648
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,560
莫奇医生还有我的人生遭遇
And for Doctor Merch and my whole situation!

649
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,110
还有...不知道还有什么...走着瞧
And for, well I don't know, let's see, what else.

650
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,820
荒废的核电站
The Badlands Nuclear Power Plant!

651
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,190
还有对了
And yes!

652
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,550
多亏你  宇宙
Points to you, universe!

653
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,200
多亏你一路把我
Points to you for dragging my ass

654
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,290
拖曳来南达科塔找死
all the way to South Dakota to die!

655
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,920
那真是天大的讽刺啊
That was sarcasm.

656
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,110
我跟其他人不一样
I am not like other boys.

657
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,020
我不会施以仁慈的
I do not give mercy.

658
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,550
回去吧
Go home!

659
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,960
哥没有什么可以给你
I don't have anything for you!

660
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,680
你就找不到别人咬了吗
Can't you find somebody to munch on?

661
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:10,970
我的妈呀
Oh God,

662
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,740
还真的是丧尸界的小呆萌
really is puppies and kittens.

663
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:27,040
再过去...两...英寸
Two...more...inches.

664
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,960
现在再打开开关
Now hit the claw release again.

665
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,520
快  搞定了
Almost... there.

666
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,300
荷马  成功了
Homer, it worked.

667
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,060
怎么样
How about that?

668
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,790
咱们做得很好
We did good.

669
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,750
好了  我现在把你拉上来
All right, now let me get you out of there.

670
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,720
现在就杀了我吧
Shoot me now.

671
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,840
我已经杀了我爸爸  我不想再杀你了
I already killed my father. I don't want to kill you.

672
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,830
想说爱你也不容易啊
You don't make it easy.

673
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,420
不不不
No, no, no! No, no, no! No!

674
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,190
不
No!

675
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:36,070
他回来了
Here he comes.

676
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:46,130
孩子  等等  矮油  小万万
Hey, kid! Wait! Wait up!

677
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,000
荷马救了我们
Homer saved us!

678
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,830
没错  他救了整个小镇
That's right. He saved the whole town!

679
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,940
不是那样的
It's not that!

680
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,010
我救不了他
I couldn't save him.

681
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,890
我知道  我们都听到了
I know, I know. We heard.

682
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,180
你已经尽力了
You did everything you could.

683
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:03,730
你让他解脱了
You gave him mercy.

684
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:10,380
你让我回想起了我在好市多工作的前妻  
You remind me of my ex-wife, back from Costco.

685
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:11,880
哪个女的会嫁给你啊
Who'd marry you?

686
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,550
哥老实告诉你  还真不少呢
Several women, I'll have you know.

687
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:17,670
不过她们要么没什么好品味
None with very good taste

688
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,870
要么没什么忍耐力
or staying power.

689
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,140
成功了吗
So it all worked.

690
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,560
我们安全了
We're safe.

691
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,290
至少不会融毁了
From the meltdown.

692
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,050
没别的了
Nothing else.

693
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,210
这个是充电器吗
Is this a battery charger?

694
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,480
是啊  我找不到能修好的卡车
Yeah. I couldn't find a truck that I could fix,

695
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,010
用这个估计能带我们走一段路
so that'll keep us going.

696
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,120
好吧  那我们能继续上路了 
All right, so we can get back on the trail.

697
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,210
可是去哪呢
But where to?

698
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,030
咱们已经跟零号病患走散了
Given the fact that we've lost Patient Zero.

699
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,770
好消息
Great news!

700
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,270
伏特加真是个好燃料
The vodka made perfect fuel

701
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,020
十分钟就用了个精光
for ten minutes!

702
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,270
发生怎么了
What happened?

703
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,580
迫降了
Crash landing

704
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,640
在离小镇大概160公里的地方
about a hundred miles out of town.

705
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,270
你这可走了一大段路啊
Wow, you covered a lot of ground.

706
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,080
你是搭了个顺风车吗
Did you hitchhike?

707
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,400
好像是16公里  管他呢
Ten miles, whatever.

708
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,500
反正走路的时候感觉根本没有尽头
It felt like a hundred miles when you're walking.

709
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,520
那艾米莉亚呢
So what happened to Amelia?

710
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,200
不是吧
Oh no.

711
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,980
你没有仁慈地了结她吗
You didn't give her mercy?

712
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,640
不知道为什么  我感觉这样做不对
It didn't feel right, somehow.

713
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,070
你就让她一路跟着你吗
So you just let her follow you?

714
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,580
感觉...  这样...  比较好吧
That... felt... right, somehow.

715
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,170
好吧  你希望我们怎么做
Okay, what do you want us to do?

716
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,420
不不不
No, no! No, no, no, no, no! No!

717
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,810
不
No!

718
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,020
她不会伤害我们的
She is not hurting us!

719
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,120
我不知道
I don't know.

720
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:38,350
说不定我们应该尝试一下另一种仁慈
Maybe it's time for a different kind of mercy.

721
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:49,240
好吧
Okay.

722
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:51,820
上车吧
Climb aboard.

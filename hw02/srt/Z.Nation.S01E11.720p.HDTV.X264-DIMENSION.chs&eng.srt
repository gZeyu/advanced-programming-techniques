00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,720
《僵尸国度》前情提要
Previously on Z Nation.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,380
我们去和大队会合
We're gonna meet up with the team.

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,170
送摩菲到实验室去
We're gonna get Murphy to that lab.

4
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,340
然后找到治愈僵尸病毒的方法
And then we are going to cure this virus.

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,260
那是个谎话  而且这谎话会害死我们的
It's a lie, and it's gonna get us both killed.

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,990
那我也情愿因相信这个谎话而死
Well then I'd rather die believing in a lie

7
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,500
总好过没有信仰地苟且活着
than live believing in nothing.

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,580
艾迪  艾迪  艾迪
Addy! Addy! Addy!

9
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,790
坚持住  艾迪
Stay with me, Addy!

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,340
-发生什么了  -我知道那些闪回是怎么回事了
- What happened?  - I know what the flashbacks are.

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,630
我杀了我妈妈
I killed my mom.

12
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,510
我们谁也不会丢下其他人不管
We don't leave each other behind.

13
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,780
我是为你而回  我以后也会这样做
I came back for you. I'll always come back for you.

14
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,670
你确定市民Z让我们下到这里来吗
Are you sure Citizen Z said we should be down here?

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,070
是啊  他是这么说的
Yeah, that's what he said.

16
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,410
听到了吗
Hear that?

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,340
你怎么看
What do you think, huh?

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,120
是死是活  是人还是丧尸
Dead? Alive? Human? Zombie?

19
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:12,680
死人一个
Dead.

20
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,390
这边  这边  这边  这边
Here, here, here, here, here.

21
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,310
逮到你们了
Bingo.

22
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:48,500
{\an8}歌词改编自一段美国跳长绳时唱的童谣

23
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,850
灰姑娘穿上了一身黄
Cinderella dressed in yella.

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,550
走到了楼上去亲暖男
Went upstairs to kiss a fella.

25
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,580
她嗑完了药
She took a pill.

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,350
又丢了节操
Lost her frills.

27
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,990
快来数数她宰了
How many zombies

28
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,840
几只丧尸
does she kill?

29
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,500
一  二  三  四
One, two, three, four.

30
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,850
你就不能给他们个痛快吗
You couldn't just give them mercy?

31
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,260
那还有什么意思
What fun would that be?

32
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,520
那是什么
What was that?

33
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,220
我不知道
I don't know.

34
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,120
去看看
Come on.

35
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,540
嘘
Shhhh.

36
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,490
站在那别动
Hold it right there.

37
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,540
哦  原来是奇葩二人组啊
Oh, it's the damn wonder twins.

38
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,210
伙计们
Guys.

39
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:26,740
搞毛线啊
What?

40
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,340
原来是奇葩...
The wonder...

41
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,200
嘿
Hey!

42
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,360
天呐
Oh my!

43
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,960
哥从来  我是说真的  一百万年做梦也想不到
Never, I mean never, ever, in a million years,

44
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,060
还有机会能再看到你们
truly did I think I'd see you guys again.

45
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,220
市民Z让你们到这的吗
Citizen Z send you guys?

46
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,000
是啊  他说这有食物
Yeah. He told us there was food and

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,710
还说有个叫切斯特的人能帮我们逃出去
somebody named Chester who could help us out.

48
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,310
是啊他也这么跟我们说了  真怀疑有没有这么个人    
Yeah, he told us that too. We're starting to have our doubts.

49
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,290
好吧  这个人应该能帮得上忙  我们先往那边走
Okay, well he should be, you know what, right down there.

50
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,820
出发吧
Let's hit it.

51
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,300
她怎么了这是
What happened to her?

52
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,230
她之前被一个带刺的铁丝网伤到了
She got caught on a piece of barbed wire.

53
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,100
现在伤口都感染了
Now it's all infected.

54
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,850
有人吗
Hello!

55
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,360
看来我们找到切斯特了
Well I guess we found Chester.

56
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,950
你好啊  切斯特
Hello, Chester.

57
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,490
看来有人在末世过得不是很开心哦
Somebody got up on the wrong side of the apocalypse.

58
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,740
你们俩在外面的时候都发生了什么
What happened to you guys out there?

59
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,350
她弄明白了一些事情
She's working out some stuff.

60
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,490
你也知道  有些事情在脑海中就是挥之不去
You know how things can catch up with you.

61
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,340
切斯特
Chester?

62
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,130
你找到他们了吗  找到我的小队了吗
You got them yet? You got my team?

63
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,720
有人吗
Hello? Anyone?

64
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,240
是沃伦吗
Warren?

65
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,040
艾迪  这真是...
Addy, it's...

66
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,380
看上面
Hey, hey, hey! Up here!

67
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,230
是你们的老朋友市民Z
It's your old pal, Citizen Z.

68
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,740
大家都在呀
Oh, it's everyone.

69
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,100
大家好
Hi, everyone. Hi!

70
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,480
艾迪还是一如既往那么美艳
Addy, looking gorgeous as always.

71
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,910
你一定就是麦克了
Oh, hey uh, you must be Mack.

72
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,270
呵呵  我原本以为你个子会再高一点呢
Kinda thought you'd be taller.

73
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,300
你这么乳臭未干也真是出乎我意料
I thought you'd be old enough to shave.

74
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,440
摩菲  上前头来让我看清楚你
Hey, Murphy. Squeeze in so I can see you.

75
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,750
你看起来不错  先生
Yeah, lookin' good, sir.

76
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,650
你们猜怎么着  我这里有个好消息
So guess what? I've got good news.

77
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,870
加利福尼亚重新上线了
California's back.

78
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,220
大部分都还活着也连上网了
They're alive and online, well most of them.

79
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,480
他们准备好迎接你们了
But they're getting ready for you,

80
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,740
研发疫苗之梦没有破灭
and the dream is alive.

81
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,090
任务继续  衷心感谢你们
The mission is a go, thanks to yours truly.

82
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,290
这消息不错是吧
That's good news, right?

83
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,300
好消息应该是有一包奥利奥
Good news would be a package of Oreos

84
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,880
和几加仑的牛奶
and a couple gallons of milk.

85
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,650
没错  抱歉
Oh, oh yeah, right. Sorry.

86
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,770
在这个大厅下面左手边的那个房间里
Down the same hall, next door on your left.

87
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,110
里面应该有你们需要的所有东西
Should be everything that you need.

88
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,370
能再次见到你们我真是太高兴了
I can't tell you how good it is to see you all again.

89
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,240
我也很高兴你能见到我们还活着  孩子
Good to see us too, kid.

90
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,080
这里到底是哪里
Hey, what was this place anyway?

91
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,020
中情局黑牢
CIA black site.

92
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,570
像是水刑和《猎杀本·拉登》里那样的黑牢吗
Oh, like waterboarding, Zero Dark Thirty, black site?

93
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,130
是的  是切斯特告诉我的
Yeah, I kinda thought it would be obvious

94
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,070
我还以为挺明显的
from what Chester told me.

95
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,650
那个老家伙在哪里
So where is the old crackpot anyway?

96
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,660
天呐  真不幸
Oh man. Bummer.

97
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,640
沃伦  这段路开慢点好吗
Whoa, Warren. Slow up here, will ya?

98
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,930
一个孩子而已
It's just a kid.

99
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,610
这可不是孩子  这是个被碾到的僵尸
That is not a kid. It's zombie road kill.

100
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,920
距盐湖城251英里

101
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,520
十点钟方向
Ten o'clock.

102
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,710
又来一个孩子
Another kid.

103
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,990
早就不是了
Not anymore.

104
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,880
停车
Stop.

105
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,070
沃伦停车  只是个孩子而已  停车
Warren, stop. It's just a boy. Stop.

106
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,520
别  你弄疼我了  别
Don't! You're hurting me! Don't!

107
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,100
艾迪
Addy!

108
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:57,640
干嘛
What?!

109
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,160
该哪哪去
Fine!

110
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,250
小心  前面这孩子还活着
Heads up, we got a live one.

111
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,020
又是个穿着古怪花衬衫一脸悲伤的孩子
Another sad kid in a weird flowered shirt.

112
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,560
我来对付这个
I got this one.

113
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,870
你还好吗
You okay?

114
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,100
就是有点口渴
A little thirsty is all.

115
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,580
应该的
Of course.

116
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:41,920
稍等
Hold on.

117
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,080
给我水壶
Water.

118
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,330
谢了
Thanks.

119
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,630
喝吧孩子
Here you go, champ.

120
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,630
谢谢你  女士
Thanks, ma'am.

121
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,980
你可以叫我罗伯塔
You can call me Roberta.

122
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,330
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

123
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,410
我叫山姆
I'm Sam.

124
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,650
山姆
Sam.

125
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,520
你妈知道你自己一个人在外吗
Does your mom know you're out here all by yourself?

126
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,540
我要去盐湖城看我爸
I'm going to Salt Lake City to see my dad.

127
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,640
这可不是个好主意
That's not a good idea.

128
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,640
不  不对
Yes, it is.

129
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,130
我已经长大了  我终于可以见我爸了
I'm old enough now. I finally get to meet my dad.

130
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,950
路太远了  况且路上也不安全
It's too far. It's not safe.

131
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,130
路不算远
It's not too far.

132
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,050
布纳恩和达克斯已经到那里了
Brennan and Dax are already there.

133
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,830
山姆
Sam.

134
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,350
盐湖城已经被僵尸占领了
Salt Lake City's been overrun by zombies.

135
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,710
是哦  我知道了
Yeah, right.

136
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,650
等等  山姆
Uh, wait, wait, Sam.

137
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,100
你说的没错
You're right.

138
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,780
你已经长大了  可以去见你的父亲了
You are old enough to go see your dad.

139
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,260
但是还有个事
But here's the thing.

140
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,450
我们的食物吃光了
We've run out of food.

141
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:45,940
你能帮帮我们吗
Can you help us?

142
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,110
我的朋友海伦可以帮到你们
My friend Helen could help you get some food.

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,690
很好
Cool.

144
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,620
你能告诉我们他们住在哪里吗

这样吧

156
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,290
看着好像没人
Doesn't look like it.

157
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,750
麦克  你先下去侦查一下
Mack, you want to check it out?

158
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,270
好的

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,810
回到车里去
Get back in the truck!

160

这里不欢迎你
You're not welcome here!

161
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,420
慢着  别激动
Hold on, hold on!

162
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,770
没事的
It's okay.

163
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,840
我们毫无恶意  我们只是...
We're friendly. We just...

164
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,550
停停停  别开火  先听我把话说完好吗
Stop! Stop! It's fine! Just listen to me for a second!

165
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,180
我们有
We have...

166
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,100
我记得你说她们很友善  山姆
I thought you said they were friendly, Sam.

167
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,300
别开火  求你们别开枪
Stop! Don't shoot! Please!

168
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,750
你们的孩子在我们车上
We have your boy!

169
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,350
山姆跟我们在一起
We have Sam!

170
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,490
停火
Hold your fire!

171
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,160
打开大门
Open the gate.

172
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,910
海伦女士  没事的  他们只是想找些食物
Ms. Helen, it's okay. They just need food.

173
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,880
他们人不错
They're nice.

174
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,130
很高兴见到你  山姆
It's good to see you, Sam.

175
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,540
你进去找你妈吧
Why don't you go inside and find your mother?

176
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,280
我相信她现在急着想见你
I'm sure she's anxious to see you.

177
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,860
谢谢你们能带他回来
Thank you for bringing him back.

178
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,870
有时我们的孩子得了幽居病
Sometimes our kids get cabin fever

179
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,930
然后决定要外出探险
and decide to go exploring.

180
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,730
你怎么了
What's wrong with you?

181
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,000
伤口感染了
It's infected.

182
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,000
那可能很危险
Oh, that could be dangerous.

183
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,890
确实
Yeah, it could.

184
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,560
我们可以帮助你
We can help you.

185
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,950
你们现在到了仁慈姐妹会
You've arrived at the Sisters of Mercy.

186
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,960
大姐  我们赶时间呢
Anytime now!

187
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,620
你不想留下也可以
You don't have to stay!

188
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,260
他必须得留下
Yes, he does.

189
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,590
我们是伙伴
We're a team.

190
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,170
是吗
You are?

191
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,170
是的
Yes.

192
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,790
不管是不是伙伴
Well, team or not,

193
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,240
如果你想留下  你们就必须分开
if you want to stay here, you'll have to split up.

194
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,320
这里只让女人和孩子进
Women and children only here.

195
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,790
你和你的朋友可以进
You can go inside with your friend.

196
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,990
但男人们必须待在墙外
But your men will have to stay outside the wall.

197
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,010
我们给你们二十四小时
We'll give you 24 hours.

198
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,970
你们可以休息  吃东西  然后上路
You can rest, get some food, and then you'll leave us.

199
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,130
你的想法合情合理
That's very fair of you.

200
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,570
请问你怎么称呼
And you are?

201
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,830
海伦  你呢
Helen. And you?

203
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,720

204
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,290
别担心
Don't worry.

205
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,700
我会照顾她的
I got her.

206
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,290
没错  这糟透了
Yeah, this blows.

207
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,590
你能帮她吗
Can you help her?

208
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,100
她的腿感染了  带他去医务室

210
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,640

211

想看看我的胡萝卜吗

212
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,520
当然
Sure.

213
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,080
是我自己种的
I planted them myself.

214
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,290
在这吗
Here?

215
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,280
对
Yep.

216
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,470
这里真美
It's beautiful here.

00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,420
来吧
Come on.

218
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,170

219
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,000
谢谢
Thanks.

220
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,040
看这个  看这里面所有的花
Now look at this one, and look at all the flowers in it.

221
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,420
在这里  我们自己种蔬菜
Here we grow our own vegetables.

222
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,960
后面我们还有鸡和牛
We have chickens and cows out back.

223
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,940
牛  你们有牛奶吗
Cows? You get milk?

224
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,890
牛奶  黄油  酸奶
Milk, butter, yogurt.

225
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,230
对你们来说最重要的是青霉素
Most importantly for you, penicillin.

226
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,630
是艾米自己做的  她以前是药剂师
Amy makes it herself. She used to be a chemist.

227
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,070
厨房的琳娜
Lina's in the kitchen,

228
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,770
会告诉你们  哪里可以清洁一下自己

229
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,750
另外  我希望你能一起来吃午餐

231
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,150
谢谢
Thank you.

232
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,060
错了  应该是  手背  手掌  拍
No. It's back, front, clap,

233
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,630
右  然后左
right, then left.

234
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,600
抱歉  我很久没玩过这个了
Sorry, I haven't done this in forever.

235
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,220
我妈妈很久之前教过我
My mom taught me a really long time ago.

236
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,600
她人好吗
Is she nice?

237
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,870
是的  是的  她人很好
Yeah, yeah, she is.

238
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,330
再来一次
Let's try again.

239
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,050
不管是谁建立了这个地方
Whoever built this place

240
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,400
他一定是预见到大灾变的到来了
must've seen the Apocalypse coming.

241
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,990
这里简直完美
It's perfect.

242
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,520
是我丈夫建立的
That was my husband.

243
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,130
他的处世哲学是
His philosophy was that we become

244
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,750
我们应该绝对地自给自足  脱离尘世
absolutely self-sufficient and off the grid.

245
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,900
你丈夫吗
Your husband?

246
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,380
他不在了
He's gone.

247
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,320
像其他人一样
Like the others.

248
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,100
这些女人呢
All these women?

249
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,350
吉娜和埃米琳是我的好姐妹
Well Zina and Emmeline were my sister wives.

250
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,010
亚蒙死后  我们只有彼此与这个地方
And when Ammon went, we had each other and this place.

251
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,950
在我们发现这些女人前  她们都很不幸
These other women weren't so lucky 'til we found them.

252
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,870
现在她们安全了
Now they're safe.

253
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,450
她们自由了
They're free.

254
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,840
再吃点草莓吗
More strawberries?

255
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,070
不吃了   我...
No. I...

256
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,740
我得去找一下卡桑德拉
I think I'm gonna go look in on Cassandra

257
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,200
看看她怎么样了
and see how she's doing.

258
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,140
-谢谢  -不客气
- Thank you.  - Of course.

259
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,730
这就是你们种的胡萝卜吗  很好吃
So these are the carrots you grew? They're delicious.

260
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,900
感觉好些了吗  谢谢你
Feeling better? Thank you.

261
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,210
好些了
Starting to.

262
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,740
还记得山姆和我们说他要去哪吗
Remember what Sam told us about where he was going?

263
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,480
去盐湖城找他爸爸
Salt Lake City to see his dad.

264
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,400
艾米有个比山姆大一些的儿子
Amy has a son a little older than Sam.

265
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,700
他现在不在这里
He's not here.

266
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,540
你知道为什么吗
You know why?

267
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,940
他也去盐湖城找爸爸了吗
Went to Salt Lake City to see his dad?

268
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,920
女孩都在  而男孩长到13岁都离开了
The girls stay here, but all the boys leave when they turn 13.

269
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,590
她是这么说的
That's what she said.

270
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,620
她们看起来很幸福
They seem so happy.

271
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,310
恩  有点幸福过头了
Yeah, maybe a little too happy.

272
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,140
太善良的人总会吓到我
Nice people always scare me.

273
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,250
等你好起来  我们一起离开这
Let's get you well, and let's get out of here.

274
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,320
这里的女人让我毛骨悚然
All these women give me the creeps.

275
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,970
那个金发女人一直盯着我
That blonde one keeps looking at me.

276
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,940
哥们  可千万别低估了自己
Oh man, don't get down on yourself like that.

277
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,610
你可是一块抢手的大肥肉
You are a perfect hunk of man meat,

278
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,710
你可别忘了
and don't you ever forget it.

279
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,930
哈哈  做好你的本分吧
Ha, ha. Don't quit your day job.

280
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,130
那里面真的只有女人吗
Is there really all women in there?

281
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,530
是啊  小万万  你好好幻想一下吧
Yeah. Enjoy your imagination, kid.

282
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,280
你也许只能想想罢了
That's probably all you're gonna get.

283
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,890
多克  有一点我不能理解
You know what I don't understand, Doc?

284
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,650
男人都死到哪里去了
What the hell happened to all their men?

285
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,170
也许我们可以问问她
Well maybe we can ask her.

286
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,460
来自天堂的天使

那是派吗

头发和眼睛...  他...
the hair and those eyes? He...

292
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,910
一万  别让人打扰哥  末世结束再叫醒哥
10K, Hold my calls, wake me up after the apocalypse

293
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,240
我要去给他送一块派
I'm gonna go give him a piece of this.

294
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,260
什么事
What?

295
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,730
吃派吗
Pie?

296
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,590
孩子  走开
Beat it, kid.

297
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,360
走呀
Beat it!

298
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,940
你喜欢吗
You like that?

299
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,780
没关系  有人让你受伤了吗
It's okay. Somebody hurt you?

300
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:48,220
嗯呐嗯呐  姐了解  姐全都了解

爹地
Daddy.

302
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,250
你需要我的照顾
You need me to take care of you.

303
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,040
我想让你停下
Part of me wants you to stop.

304
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,920
可是我又很想吃派
But part of me really needs the pie.

305
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,160
食人族吗
Cannibals?

306
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,500
很抱歉你遇到了这种事
I'm so sorry that happened to you.

307
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,460
我真的想说我很震惊
And I wish I could say I was surprised.

308
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,670
天呐
Man.

309
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,470
他无法控制自己
He can't help himself.

310
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,430
动物的本能掌控了他
The animal instinct takes over.

311
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,020
滥杀
Kill,

现在又是这个瘟疫  这个病毒
Now this disease, this virus.

315
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,710
雄性荷尔蒙才是地球上最毒的毒药
Testosterone is the most toxic chemical on Earth.

316
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,770
而你挺过了这一切  来到了这里
And you survived through it all. Now you're here.

317
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,780
我运气好
I was really lucky.

318
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,460
一开始我就遇到了麦克
I met Mack on the first night.

319
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,820
我看是他运气好
I think he was the lucky one.

320
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,840
这是什么
What about this?

321
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,230
肯定有故事
This is special.

322
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,680
没错  你怎么知道的
Yeah, yeah. How'd you know?

323
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,460
告诉我
Tell me.

324
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,990
我说不出
I can't.

325
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,050
太沉重了
It's too much for you.

326
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,270
我看得出
I can see that.

327
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,760
你可以告诉我  告诉我吧
You can tell me. Just tell me.

328
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,750
是我妈妈
It was my mom.

329
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,530
还有我弟弟
And my brother.

330
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,380
我不得不...
And I had to...

331
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,980
两个都是
both of them.

332
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,410
可怜的姑娘啊
Oh, my sweet, sweet, sweet girl.

333
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,410
看开吧  释怀就好了
Let it go. Just let it all go.

334
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,870
我能告诉你件事吗
Can I tell you something?

335
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,990
你再也不会遭遇这样的惨剧了
You don't ever have to go through that again.

336
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,900
这个地方  我们姐妹
This place, our sisters,

337
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,030
我们会保护你的
we're protected from that.

338
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
我们用得上你这样的姑娘
We could use a woman like you.

339
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,820
聪明  有本事  心地善良
Smart, resourceful, caring.

340
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,790
你和其他人不一样  你很特别
You're not like the others. You're special.

341
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,210
我看得出
I can see that.

342
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,180
看来有新姐妹加入我们了
Hmmm, looks like we have a new sister.

343
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:35,680
怎么回事
What's going on?

344
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,740
我不确定
I'm not sure.

345
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,040
这位是泰莎
This is Tessa.

346
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,490
泰莎  欢迎你
Tessa, welcome.

347
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,740
你到家了
You're home now.

348
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,130
你安全了
You're safe.

349
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,470
没事了
It's okay.

350
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,470
再也不会有人伤害你了
No one can hurt you here.

351
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,960
这就是我们存在的意义
This is why we exist.

352
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,910
我们建立了一个
We provide a place that is safe

353
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,470
不受男性暴力侵害的地方
from the violent destructive world of men.

354
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,700
而且我们会惩罚那些施暴者
And we bring the perpetrators to justice.

355
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,940
那就是我们的意义
That is our purpose.

356
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,680
那就是我们的意义
That is our purpose.

357
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,260
带上来
Bring him.

358
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,540
你叫什么
What is your name?

359
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,030
咬我啊  婊子
Bite me, Bitch.

360
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,420
婊子
Hmmm, Bitch.

361
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,190
好名字  你用着合适
I like that. It suits you.

362
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,050
是时候让你见识见识正义了  婊子
Well it's time that you learn about justice, Bitch.

363
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,500
带下去
Take him away.

364
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,290
你该来看看
You should see this.

365
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,890
他会有什么下场
What's gonna happen to him?

366
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,440
正义
Justice.

367
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,930
你敢伤女人  你就得死  这就是规矩
You harm a woman, you die. That's our rule.

368
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,370
泰莎
Tessa?

369
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,570
去吧  泰莎
Now, Tessa.

370
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,810
不
No!

371
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,260
不
No!

372
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,630
他是个坏人
He was a bad man.

373
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,390
你还好吗
You all right?

374
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,040
没事
Yeah.

375
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,720
泰莎说外面还有两个姐妹
Tessa said there are two sisters still out there.

376
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,980
你可以帮我们解救她们
We could use your help to free them.

377
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,410
当然可以
Of course.

378
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,040
艾迪
Addy.

379
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,920
你确定你要去吗
You sure you're up to that?

380
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,820
沃伦
Warren.

381
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,820
我们都有可能像她们一样需要帮助
Any one of us could be those sisters.

382
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,580
我要加入
I'm in.

383
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,950
好极了
Wonderful.

384
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,210
好吧  我也去
Yeah, you got me too.

385
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,300
你不必这样
You don't have to.

386
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,340
没关系
No, no, no.

387
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,550
我要支持我的姐妹们
I always got my sister's back.

388
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,910
我们得跟这些人撇清关系  小伙子们  上路吧
We got to burn this joint, boys. Time to motor.

389
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,790
多克  等会  大哥  怎么了
Whoa, Doc. Hold on, man. What Is it?

390
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,860
你看见什么了
What'd you see?

391
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,720
僵尸
Zombie.

392
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,540
熊
Bear.

393
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,330
有人来了
Someone's coming.

394
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,740
她们不会就这样扔下我们不管了吧
They wouldn't just leave us, would they?

395
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,470
不可能  艾迪不会离开我的
No, Addy doesn't go anywhere without me.

396
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,130
对不起  伙计
Sorry, pal.

397
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,670
她刚才就离开你了
She just did.

398
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,850
他们来了
Here they come.

399
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,250
遇到什么麻烦了吗  亲爱的
You got a problem there, darlin'?

400
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,860
你觉得呢
What do you think?

401
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,060
你们这样很危险啊
Kinda dangerous, ain't it?

402
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,840
这么漂亮的两个姑娘
Two pretty little gals like you,

403
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,460
怎么能独自上路呢
travelin' all alone?

404
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,870
外面可不怎么安全
It's not safe out here.

405
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,290
要不这样吧
I'll tell you what.

406
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,710
跟我说说你们要往哪个方向走
Why don't you tell me where you're headed,

407
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,490
侧三轮上的小伙子能帮你们检查引擎
and Sidecar here can have a look at that engine.

408
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,010
手举起来  先生们
Hands up, gentlemen.

409
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,550
你们的小把戏就到此结束吧
Your little game is over.

410
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:50,960
等等  别这样  别这样
Wait, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

411
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,390
我跟他们不是一伙的  他们只不过...
I'm not really with them. They just...

412
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,280
-我被困住了  他们把我救出来的  -闭嘴
- I was stranded, and they helped me out. - Shut up!

413
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,580
把枪放下
Drop your guns.

414
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,710
你想得美  甜心
That ain't happening, sweetheart.

415
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,940
别开枪  别开枪
Hold your fire! Hold your fire.

416
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,190
看见没
You see, huh?

417
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,900
我可是个讲理的人
I'm a reasonable man.

418
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,050
有什么事情我们可以好好商量
I'm sure we can come to some kind of an arrangement.

419
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,680
你直接告诉我你想要什么吧
Why don't you just tell me what you want?

420
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,030
我来问你
Let me ask.

421
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,430
这两个女孩是自愿跟着你的吗
These girls with you voluntarily?

422
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,300
恐怕不是吧
Didn't think so.

423
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,810
女士们
Ladies.

424
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,920
嘿  听我说
Hey, hey, listen to me.

425
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,860
那里有个挂包  里面装的全是奥施康定[止痛药]
That saddlebag, it's full of oxycontin.

426
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,490
你可以全拿走
You can take it.

427
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,780
我没兴趣
Not interested.

428
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,390
哪有怒气冲冲的婊子不做交易的
What kind of a raging bitch doesn't want to make a deal?

429
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,580
我就不
This one.

430
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,820
艾迪  过来帮帮忙
Hey, Addy. We could use your help over here.

431
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:53,110
伸张正义的时刻到了
It's time for some justice.

432
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,460
杀掉一个
Shoot one.

433
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,650
要致命伤  但不要爆头
A mortal wound, anywhere but the head.

434
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,980
其余的人自然就解决了
The rest will take care of themselves.

435
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,970
不是这个
Oh, not this one.

436
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,860
杀另一个
The other one.

437
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,140
艾迪  等一下
Addy, wait.

438
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,690
我发誓  不是我干的  求你了  不是我
I swear. I...it wasn't me. I... please. Please. I wasn't...

439
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,530
真的有必要这么做吗
Is this really necessary?

440
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,180
艾迪  别开枪
Addy, don't do this.

441
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,600
你不会想与我为敌的  好妹妹
You don't want to get in my way, sister.

442
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,980
求你了  我  我发誓  我什么都没做
Please, I...I swear. I swear. I wasn't gonna do anything.

443
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,140
他说谎
He's lying.

444
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,270
记得食人族绑架了你吧
Remember the cannibal remember when he kidnapped.

445
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,380
还记得吧
Remember.

446
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,380
还记得托拜亚斯吧
Remember Tobias.

447
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,150
还记得他绑架了你吧
Remember when he kidnapped.

448
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,550
天啊  不不  不要啊
Oh, God! No! No! No!

449
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,360
好孩子
Good girl.

450
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,070
该走了
It's time to go.

451
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,070
我们得离开这
We got to get out of here.

452
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,760
我知道  我看到那头熊了
I know. I saw the bear.

453
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,110
那都不算事
That's not the problem.

454
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,810
如果连僵尸熊都不算事了  那还有什么
If a zombie bear isn't the problem, what is?

455
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,650
我要见她
I need to see her.

456
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,690
她在一个很奇怪的地方
She's in a weird place.

457
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,560
我也去过那
I've been there.

458
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,280
将她带出来可不是件容易的事
It's not gonna be easy to get her back.

459
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,220
没关系  但是没有她我不走
Well it's fine, but I'm not leaving here without her.

460
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,460
你们做好准备
You guys just get ready.

461
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,230
我尽全力将她带出来
I'll do my best to get her out.

462
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,700
但你可能还是要做出一个选择
But you may have a choice to make.

463
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,950
我知道这不容易
I know what you did seemed hard.

464
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,040
当我杀死自己的丈夫
I felt the same way

465
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,380
获得自由的时候也有同样的感觉
when I freed myself from my husband.

466
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,120
他当时也声称是无辜的
He said he was innocent, too.

467
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,540
我们从小到大
You know we were both raised to

468
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,960
一直坚信
believe all the rules, that

469
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,650
他们是好人  是真理
they were good and true and

470
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,180
是上帝的恩赐
from God.

471
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,580
在我差点死于生第五个孩子之后
And after I almost died after my fifth child,

472
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,690
我就开始不再相信这一切
I started not to believe.

473
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,840
我不想再生孩子了
I didn't want anymore children.

474
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,210
我不需要他了
I didn't want him.

475
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,090
但这些想法不符合那些信条
And that didn't square with the rules.

476
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,730
所以他就打我
So he beat me.

477
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,370
我的鼻子  胳膊还有肋骨都被他打折了
He broke my nose and my arms, ribs.

478
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,420
这还不算最糟的
But that's not even the worst story

479
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,470
这里的姐妹们还有更惨的
that you'll hear from the women in here.

480
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,220
我们现在就得离开
We got to go now.

481
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,360
你看见艾迪了吗
You seen Addy?

482
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,300
没有
No.

483
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,340
我们会在出去的路上找到她的
We will find her on the way out.

484
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,530
我会没事的
I'll be fine.

485
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,690
希望如此
Hope so.

486
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,050
会没事的
I will.

487
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,440
你是从外面进来的
You've been out there.

488
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,810
你知道外面是什么样子的
You know what it's like.

489
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,760
我也...  不知道
I just... don't know

490
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,550
我应该怎么做
what I'm supposed to do anymore.

491
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,010
我做不到无动于衷
I can't un-see any of it.

492
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,730
那些人
The people,

493
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,760
甚至是僵尸
even the zombies.

494
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,800
你承受得太多了
It's too much

495
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,310
任何人都会这样
for anyone.

496
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,180
你需要休息
You need rest.

497
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,410
平静
Peace.

498
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,080
留在这里
Stay here.

499
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,750
成为我们家庭中的一员
Be a part of our family.

500
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,080
我不能离开麦克
I can't leave Mack.

501
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,470
我不能
I can't.

502
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,420
我爱他
I love him.

503
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,980
我知道你爱他  亲爱的
I know you do, sweetheart.

504
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:30,930
所以让你眼睁睁看着他死会更痛苦的
So it'll hurt all that much more when you have to watch him die.

505
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,220
他总有一天会死去
And one day he will die.

506
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,620
而你将会是那个
And it will be you

507
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,030
给他"施与仁慈"的人
that has to give him mercy.

508
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,610
是啊
Yeah.

509
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,560
我要怎么跟他说
How do I tell him?

510
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,290
我该说什么
What do I say?

511
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,280
我来教你怎么跟他说
I'll tell you what to say.

512
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:06,980
好的
Okay.

513
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,200
艾迪
Addy

514
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,360
能找个地方说几句话吗
Hey, can we go talk somewhere real quick?

515
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,870
好  当然可以
Uh, yeah. Yeah, of course.

516
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,630
里面是什么样子
So what's it like in there?

517
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,790
听上去有些怪异  毕竟一个僵尸...
Sounds a little weird, I mean a zombie...

518
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,940
不  不  不  麦克  里面...
Uh, no, no, no, no, no. Mack, it is...

519
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,720
里面很美
It's so beautiful.

520
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,700
要是你能看见就好了
I wish you could see it.

521
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,470
是啊  我也希望能看到
Yeah, I wish I could too.

522
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:47,790
跟外面的世界截然不同
It's so different from out here.

523
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,810
让我有了安全感
I feel safe.

524
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,620
我已经很久没有这样的感觉了
I haven't felt that in such a long time.

525
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,430
不错  很好
Good. That's good.

526
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,990
我很高兴...
I'm glad. It's...

527
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,840
对你来说  离开那里应该挺难的
I'm sure it's gonna be hard to leave.

528
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,060
这就是我想跟你谈的
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

529
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,560
这一切太沉重了
It's too much.

530
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,550
我撑不下去了  麦克
I can't do it anymore, Mack.

531
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,910
但是  艾迪...
But Addy...

532
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,500
我不能跟你一起留下来
I can't stay with you here.

533
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,920
我需要休息了
I need to rest.

534
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,780
我做不到
I can't.

535
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,890
没有你  我什么都做不了
I can't do this without you.

536
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:46,610
不  不  艾迪  艾迪  拜托  拜托
No, no, no, no, no, no. Addy. Addy, come on. Come on.

537
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,880
我爱你  我...  你不能...
I love you. I... I... Don't you...

538
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,050
麦克  我真的很爱你
Mack, I love you so much.

539
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:00,990
我不能再回去  看着你死
I cannot go back out there and watch you die.

540
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,140
我不会死的
I'm not gonna die.

541
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,190
不  你会死
Yes, you will.

542
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,630
我们都会死
We all will.

543
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,510
我希望留存在我脑海里的是你现在的模样
And this is how I want to remember you.

544
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:16,160
麦克  我不能再夺去我心爱之人的生命了
Mack, I cannot kill somebody I love ever again.

545
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,930
你不走  我也不会走的  艾迪
I'm not going back out there without you, Addy.

546
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,310
我不会  我做不到
I'm not. I can't.

547
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,660
这样对大家都好
This is for the best.

548
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,000
艾迪  艾迪  等等  等一下
Addy. Addy, wait. Wait a minute.

549
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,170
摩菲怎么办
What about Murphy, huh?

550
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,280
任务怎么办
And the mission?

551
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,840
你说过  怀揣着信仰死去
You said, you said you would rather

552
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,090
总好过无所信仰地活着
die believing in something than live believing in nothing.

553
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
我得走了
I have to go.

554
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:40,180
看着我  看着我
Look at me. Look at me.

555
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,460
我理解  我懂  你...
I understand. I do. You're...

556
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,490
你妈妈的事让你很难过  人之常情
You're upset about your mom. Of course. Of course.

557
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:50,320
这件事太可怕了  简直是个悲剧
It's horrible. I mean it's, it's beyond horrible.

558
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,890
但是你会熬过去的
But you're gonna get through this.

559
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,800
你不是这样的
That's not who you are.

560
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:01,410
你是个好人  你很强大
You're a good person. You're, you're, you're strong.

561
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,500
你很强  你不需要海伦
You're strong. You don't need Helen

562
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,110
还有什么脑残邪教
and some stupid cult.

563
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,960
对不起
I'm sorry.

564
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,060
艾迪  艾迪  你不能这么做
Addy, Addy, Addy. You can't do this.

565
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,590
-麦克  -你不能离开我  这样很疯狂
- Mack. - You can't leave me. This is crazy.

566
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,680
-麦克  -艾迪  等下
- Mack. - Addy, wait.

567
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,520
-麦克  放开我  -艾迪  听我说
- Mack, let me go. - Addy, just listen to me.

568
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,560
听我说  好吗
Just listen to me, okay?

569
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,600
-麦克  -你没考虑清楚
- Mack. - You're not thinking clearly.

570
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,110
你弄疼我了
You're hurting me!

571
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,960
等下  艾迪

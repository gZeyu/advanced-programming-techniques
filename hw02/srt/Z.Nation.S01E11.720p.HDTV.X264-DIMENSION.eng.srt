1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,720
Previously on Z Nation.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,380
We're gonna meet up with the team.

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,170
We're gonna get Murphy to that lab.

4
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,340
And then we are going to cure this virus.

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,260
It's a lie, and it's gonna get us both killed.

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,990
Well then I'd rather die believing in a lie

7
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,500
than live believing in nothing.

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,580
Addy! Addy! Addy!

9
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,790
Stay with me, Addy!

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,340
- What happened?  - I know what the flashbacks are.

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,630
I killed my mom.

12
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,510
We don't leave each other behind.

13
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,780
I came back for you. I'll always come back for you.

14
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,670
Are you sure Citizen Z said we should be down here?

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,070
Yeah, that's what he said.

16
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,410
Hear that?

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,340
What do you think, huh?

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,120
Dead? Alive? Human? Zombie?

19
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:12,680
Dead.

20
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,390
Here, here, here, here, here.

21
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,310
Bingo.

23
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,850
Cinderella dressed in yella.

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,550
Went upstairs to kiss a fella.

25
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,580
She took a pill.

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,350
Lost her frills.

27
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,990
How many zombies

28
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,840
does she kill?

29
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,500
One, two, three, four.

30
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,850
You couldn't just give them mercy?

31
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,260
What fun would that be?

32
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,520
What was that?

33
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,220
I don't know.

34
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,120
Come on.

35
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,540
Shhhh.

36
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,490
Hold it right there.

37
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,540
Oh, it's the damn wonder twins.

38
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,210
Guys.

39
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:26,740
What?

40
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,340
The wonder...

41
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,200
Hey!

42
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,360
Oh my!

43
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,960
Never, I mean never, ever, in a million years,

44
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,060
truly did I think I'd see you guys again.

45
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,220
Citizen Z send you guys?

46
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah. He told us there was food and

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,710
somebody named Chester who could help us out.

48
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,310
Yeah, he told us that too. We're starting to have our doubts.

49
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,290
Okay, well he should be, you know what, right down there.

50
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,820
Let's hit it.

51
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,300
What happened to her?

52
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,230
She got caught on a piece of barbed wire.

53
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,100
Now it's all infected.

54
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,850
Hello!

55
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,360
Well I guess we found Chester.

56
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,950
Hello, Chester.

57
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,490
Somebody got up on the wrong side of the apocalypse.

58
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,740
What happened to you guys out there?

59
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,350
She's working out some stuff.

60
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,490
You know how things can catch up with you.

61
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,340
Chester?

62
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,130
You got them yet? You got my team?

63
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,720
Hello? Anyone?

64
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,240
Warren?

65
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,040
Addy, it's...

66
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,380
Hey, hey, hey! Up here!

67
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,230
It's your old pal, Citizen Z.

68
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,740
Oh, it's everyone.

69
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,100
Hi, everyone. Hi!

70
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,480
Addy, looking gorgeous as always.

71
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,910
Oh, hey uh, you must be Mack.

72
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,270
Kinda thought you'd be taller.

73
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,300
I thought you'd be old enough to shave.

74
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,440
Hey, Murphy. Squeeze in so I can see you.

75
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,750
Yeah, lookin' good, sir.

76
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,650
So guess what? I've got good news.

77
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,870
California's back.

78
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,220
They're alive and online, well most of them.

79
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,480
But they're getting ready for you,

80
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,740
and the dream is alive.

81
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,090
The mission is a go, thanks to yours truly.

82
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,290
That's good news, right?

83
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,300
Good news would be a package of Oreos

84
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,880
and a couple gallons of milk.

85
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,650
Oh, oh yeah, right. Sorry.

86
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,770
Down the same hall, next door on your left.

87
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,110
Should be everything that you need.

88
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,370
I can't tell you how good it is to see you all again.

89
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,240
Good to see us too, kid.

90
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,080
Hey, what was this place anyway?

91
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,020
CIA black site.

92
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,570
Oh, like waterboarding, Zero Dark Thirty, black site?

93
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,130
Yeah, I kinda thought it would be obvious

94
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,070
from what Chester told me.

95
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,650
So where is the old crackpot anyway?

96
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,660
Oh man. Bummer.

97
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,640
Whoa, Warren. Slow up here, will ya?

98
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,930
It's just a kid.

99
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,610
That is not a kid. It's zombie road kill.

101
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,520
Ten o'clock.

102
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,710
Another kid.

103
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,990
Not anymore.

104
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,880
Stop.

105
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,070
Warren, stop. It's just a boy. Stop.

106
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,520
Don't! You're hurting me! Don't!

107
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,100
Addy!

108
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:57,640
What?!

109
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,160
Fine!

110
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,250
Heads up, we got a live one.

111
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,020
Another sad kid in a weird flowered shirt.

112
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,560
I got this one.

113
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,870
You okay?

114
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,100
A little thirsty is all.

115
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,580
Of course.

116
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:41,920
Hold on.

117
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,080
Water.

118
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,330
Thanks.

119
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,630
Here you go, champ.

120
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,630
Thanks, ma'am.

121
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,980
You can call me Roberta.

122
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,330
What's your name?

123
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,410
I'm Sam.

124
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,650
Sam.

125
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,520
Does your mom know you're out here all by yourself?

126
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,540
I'm going to Salt Lake City to see my dad.

127
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,640
That's not a good idea.

128
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,640
Yes, it is.

129
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,130
I'm old enough now. I finally get to meet my dad.

130
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,950
It's too far. It's not safe.

131
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,130
It's not too far.

132
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,050
Brennan and Dax are already there.

133
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,830
Sam.

134
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,350
Salt Lake City's been overrun by zombies.

135
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,710
Yeah, right.

136
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,650
Uh, wait, wait, Sam.

137
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,100
You're right.

138
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,780
You are old enough to go see your dad.

139
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,260
But here's the thing.

140
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,450
We've run out of food.

141
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:45,940
Can you help us?

142
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,110
My friend Helen could help you get some food.

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,690
Cool.

144
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,620
Will you show us where they live?

145
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,730
Tell you what.

146
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,310
You take us there,

147
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,020
we will drive you to Salt Lake City.

148
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,570
Okay.

149
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,700
Murphy, move.

150
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,580
Hey there.

151
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,380
Hey man, I'm Mack.

153
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,110
Just up there.

155
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,200
Anybody home?

156
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,290
Doesn't look like it.

157
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,750
Mack, you want to check it out?

158
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,270
Yeah.

159
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,810
Get back in the truck!

160
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,040
You're not welcome here!

161
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,420
Hold on, hold on!

162
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,770
It's okay.

163
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,840
We're friendly. We just...

164
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,550
Stop! Stop! It's fine! Just listen to me for a second!

165
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,180
We have...

166
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,100
I thought you said they were friendly, Sam.

167
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,300
Stop! Don't shoot! Please!

168
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,750
We have your boy!

169
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,350
We have Sam!

170
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,490
Hold your fire!

171
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,160
Open the gate.

172
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,910
Ms. Helen, it's okay. They just need food.

173
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,880
They're nice.

174
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,130
It's good to see you, Sam.

175
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,540
Why don't you go inside and find your mother?

176
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,280
I'm sure she's anxious to see you.

177
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,860
Thank you for bringing him back.

178
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,870
Sometimes our kids get cabin fever

179
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,930
and decide to go exploring.

180
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,730
What's wrong with you?

181
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,000
It's infected.

182
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,000
Oh, that could be dangerous.

183
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,890
Yeah, it could.

184
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,560
We can help you.

185
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,950
You've arrived at the Sisters of Mercy.

186
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,960
Anytime now!

187
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,620
You don't have to stay!

188
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,260
Yes, he does.

189
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,590
We're a team.

190
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,170
You are?

191
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,170
Yes.

192
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,790
Well, team or not,

193
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,240
if you want to stay here, you'll have to split up.

194
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,320
Women and children only here.

195
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,790
You can go inside with your friend.

196
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,990
But your men will have to stay outside the wall.

197
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,010
We'll give you 24 hours.

198
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,970
You can rest, get some food, and then you'll leave us.

199
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,130
That's very fair of you.

200
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,570
And you are?

201
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,830
Helen. And you?

202
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:58,480
Lieutenant Roberta Warren. Missouri National Guard.

203
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,720
Addy.

204
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,290
Don't worry.

205
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,700
I got her.

206
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,290
Yeah, this blows.

207
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,590
Can you help her?

208
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,100
She has an infected leg. Take her to the infirmary.

209
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,250
You're pretty.

210
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,640
Hi.

211
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,710
Want to see my carrots?

212
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,520
Sure.

213
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,080
I planted them myself.

214
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,290
Here?

215
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,280
Yep.

216
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,470
It's beautiful here.

217
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,420
Come on.

218
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,170
Here you go.

219
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,000
Thanks.

220
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,040
Now look at this one, and look at all the flowers in it.

221
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,420
Here we grow our own vegetables.

222
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,960
We have chickens and cows out back.

223
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,940
Cows? You get milk?

224
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,890
Milk, butter, yogurt.

225
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,230
Most importantly for you, penicillin.

226
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,630
Amy makes it herself. She used to be a chemist.

227
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,070
Lina's in the kitchen,

228
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,770
she'll show you where you can wash up.

229
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,750
And I hope you'll join us for our mid-day meal.

230
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,070
Thank you.

231
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,150
Thank you.

232
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,060
No. It's back, front, clap,

233
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,630
right, then left.

234
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,600
Sorry, I haven't done this in forever.

235
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,220
My mom taught me a really long time ago.

236
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,600
Is she nice?

237
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,870
Yeah, yeah, she is.

238
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,330
Let's try again.

239
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,050
Whoever built this place

240
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,400
must've seen the Apocalypse coming.

241
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,990
It's perfect.

242
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,520
That was my husband.

243
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,130
His philosophy was that we become

244
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,750
absolutely self-sufficient and off the grid.

245
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,900
Your husband?

246
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,380
He's gone.

247
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,320
Like the others.

248
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,100
All these women?

249
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,350
Well Zina and Emmeline were my sister wives.

250
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,010
And when Ammon went, we had each other and this place.

251
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,950
These other women weren't so lucky 'til we found them.

252
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,870
Now they're safe.

253
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,450
They're free.

254
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,840
More strawberries?

255
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,070
No. I...

256
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,740
I think I'm gonna go look in on Cassandra

257
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,200
and see how she's doing.

258
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,140
- Thank you.  - Of course.

259
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,730
So these are the carrots you grew? They're delicious.

260
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,900
Feeling better? Thank you.

261
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,210
Starting to.

262
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,740
Remember what Sam told us about where he was going?

263
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,480
Salt Lake City to see his dad.

264
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,400
Amy has a son a little older than Sam.

265
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,700
He's not here.

266
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,540
You know why?

267
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,940
Went to Salt Lake City to see his dad?

268
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,920
The girls stay here, but all the boys leave when they turn 13.

269
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,590
That's what she said.

270
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,620
They seem so happy.

271
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,310
Yeah, maybe a little too happy.

272
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,140
Nice people always scare me.

273
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,250
Let's get you well, and let's get out of here.

274
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,320
All these women give me the creeps.

275
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,970
That blonde one keeps looking at me.

276
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,940
Oh man, don't get down on yourself like that.

277
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,610
You are a perfect hunk of man meat,

278
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,710
and don't you ever forget it.

279
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,930
Ha, ha. Don't quit your day job.

280
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,130
Is there really all women in there?

281
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,530
Yeah. Enjoy your imagination, kid.

282
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,280
That's probably all you're gonna get.

283
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,890
You know what I don't understand, Doc?

284
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,650
What the hell happened to all their men?

285
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,170
Well maybe we can ask her.

286
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,460
Angels from heaven.

287
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,860
Is that pie?

288
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,240
Blueberry. Ummm, I, I, I made it by myself.

289
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,380
Do you guys know where the...

290
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,910
the other one is? The one with the with the a

291
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,430
the hair and those eyes? He...

292
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,910
10K, Hold my calls, wake me up after the apocalypse

293
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,240
I'm gonna go give him a piece of this.

294
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,260
What?

295
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,730
Pie?

296
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,590
Beat it, kid.

297
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,360
Beat it!

298
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,940
You like that?

299
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,780
It's okay. Somebody hurt you?

300
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:48,220
Yeah? I know. I know.

301
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,980
Daddy.

302
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,250
You need me to take care of you.

303
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,040
Part of me wants you to stop.

304
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,920
But part of me really needs the pie.

305
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,160
Cannibals?

306
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,500
I'm so sorry that happened to you.

307
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,460
And I wish I could say I was surprised.

308
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,670
Man.

309
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,470
He can't help himself.

310
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,430
The animal instinct takes over.

311
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,020
Kill,

312
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,570
destroy,

313
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,220
rape.

314
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:16,170
Now this disease, this virus.

315
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,710
Testosterone is the most toxic chemical on Earth.

316
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,770
And you survived through it all. Now you're here.

317
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,780
I was really lucky.

318
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,460
I met Mack on the first night.

319
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,820
I think he was the lucky one.

320
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,840
What about this?

321
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,230
This is special.

322
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,680
Yeah, yeah. How'd you know?

323
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,460
Tell me.

324
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,990
I can't.

325
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,050
It's too much for you.

326
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,270
I can see that.

327
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,760
You can tell me. Just tell me.

328
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,750
It was my mom.

329
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,530
And my brother.

330
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,380
And I had to...

331
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,980
both of them.

332
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,410
Oh, my sweet, sweet, sweet girl.

333
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,410
Let it go. Just let it all go.

334
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,870
Can I tell you something?

335
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,990
You don't ever have to go through that again.

336
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,900
This place, our sisters,

337
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,030
we're protected from that.

338
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
We could use a woman like you.

339
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,820
Smart, resourceful, caring.

340
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,790
You're not like the others. You're special.

341
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,210
I can see that.

342
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,180
Hmmm, looks like we have a new sister.

343
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:35,680
What's going on?

344
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,740
I'm not sure.

345
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,040
This is Tessa.

346
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,490
Tessa, welcome.

347
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,740
You're home now.

348
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,130
You're safe.

349
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,470
It's okay.

350
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,470
No one can hurt you here.

351
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,960
This is why we exist.

352
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,910
We provide a place that is safe

353
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,470
from the violent destructive world of men.

354
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,700
And we bring the perpetrators to justice.

355
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,940
That is our purpose.

356
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,680
That is our purpose.

357
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,260
Bring him.

358
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,540
What is your name?

359
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,030
Bite me, Bitch.

360
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,420
Hmmm, Bitch.

361
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,190
I like that. It suits you.

362
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,050
Well it's time that you learn about justice, Bitch.

363
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,500
Take him away.

364
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,290
You should see this.

365
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,890
What's gonna happen to him?

366
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,440
Justice.

367
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,930
You harm a woman, you die. That's our rule.

368
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,370
Tessa?

369
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,570
Now, Tessa.

370
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,810
No!

371
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,260
No!

372
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,630
He was a bad man.

373
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,390
You all right?

374
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,040
Yeah.

375
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,720
Tessa said there are two sisters still out there.

376
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,980
We could use your help to free them.

377
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,410
Of course.

378
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,040
Addy.

379
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,920
You sure you're up to that?

380
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,820
Warren.

381
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,820
Any one of us could be those sisters.

382
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,580
I'm in.

383
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,950
Wonderful.

384
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,210
Yeah, you got me too.

385
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,300
You don't have to.

386
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,340
No, no, no.

387
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,550
I always got my sister's back.

388
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,910
We got to burn this joint, boys. Time to motor.

389
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,790
Whoa, Doc. Hold on, man. What Is it?

390
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,860
What'd you see?

391
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,720
Zombie.

392
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,540
Bear.

393
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,330
Someone's coming.

394
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,740
They wouldn't just leave us, would they?

395
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,470
No, Addy doesn't go anywhere without me.

396
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,130
Sorry, pal.

397
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,670
She just did.

398
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,850
Here they come.

399
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,250
You got a problem there, darlin'?

400
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,860
What do you think?

401
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,060
Kinda dangerous, ain't it?

402
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,840
Two pretty little gals like you,

403
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,460
travelin' all alone?

404
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,870
It's not safe out here.

405
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,290
I'll tell you what.

406
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,710
Why don't you tell me where you're headed,

407
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,490
and Sidecar here can have a look at that engine.

408
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,010
Hands up, gentlemen.

409
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,550
Your little game is over.

410
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:50,960
Wait, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

411
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,390
I'm not really with them. They just...

412
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,280
- I was stranded, and they helped me out. - Shut up!

413
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,580
Drop your guns.

414
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,710
That ain't happening, sweetheart.

415
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,940
Hold your fire! Hold your fire.

416
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,190
You see, huh?

417
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,900
I'm a reasonable man.

418
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,050
I'm sure we can come to some kind of an arrangement.

419
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,680
Why don't you just tell me what you want?

420
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,030
Let me ask.

421
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,430
These girls with you voluntarily?

422
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,300
Didn't think so.

423
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,810
Ladies.

424
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,920
Hey, hey, listen to me.

425
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,860
That saddlebag, it's full of oxycontin.

426
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,490
You can take it.

427
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,780
Not interested.

428
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,390
What kind of a raging bitch doesn't want to make a deal?

429
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,580
This one.

430
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,820
Hey, Addy. We could use your help over here.

431
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:53,110
It's time for some justice.

432
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,460
Shoot one.

433
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,650
A mortal wound, anywhere but the head.

434
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,980
The rest will take care of themselves.

435
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,970
Oh, not this one.

436
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,860
The other one.

437
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,140
Addy, wait.

438
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,690
I swear. I...it wasn't me. I... please. Please. I wasn't...

439
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,530
Is this really necessary?

440
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,180
Addy, don't do this.

441
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,600
You don't want to get in my way, sister.

442
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,980
Please, I...I swear. I swear. I wasn't gonna do anything.

443
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,140
He's lying.

444
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,270
Remember the cannibal remember when he kidnapped.

445
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,380
Remember.

446
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,380
Remember Tobias.

447
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,150
Remember when he kidnapped.

448
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,550
Oh, God! No! No! No!

449
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,360
Good girl.

450
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,070
It's time to go.

451
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,070
We got to get out of here.

452
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,760
I know. I saw the bear.

453
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,110
That's not the problem.

454
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,810
If a zombie bear isn't the problem, what is?

455
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,650
I need to see her.

456
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,690
She's in a weird place.

457
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,560
I've been there.

458
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,280
It's not gonna be easy to get her back.

459
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,220
Well it's fine, but I'm not leaving here without her.

460
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,460
You guys just get ready.

461
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,230
I'll do my best to get her out.

462
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,700
But you may have a choice to make.

463
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,950
I know what you did seemed hard.

464
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,040
I felt the same way

465
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,380
when I freed myself from my husband.

466
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,120
He said he was innocent, too.

467
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,540
You know we were both raised to

468
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,960
believe all the rules, that

469
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,650
they were good and true and

470
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,180
from God.

471
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,580
And after I almost died after my fifth child,

472
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,690
I started not to believe.

473
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,840
I didn't want anymore children.

474
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,210
I didn't want him.

475
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,090
And that didn't square with the rules.

476
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,730
So he beat me.

477
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,370
He broke my nose and my arms, ribs.

478
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,420
But that's not even the worst story

479
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,470
that you'll hear from the women in here.

480
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,220
We got to go now.

481
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,360
You seen Addy?

482
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,300
No.

483
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,340
We will find her on the way out.

484
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,530
I'll be fine.

485
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,690
Hope so.

486
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,050
I will.

487
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,440
You've been out there.

488
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,810
You know what it's like.

489
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,760
I just... don't know

490
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,550
what I'm supposed to do anymore.

491
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,010
I can't un-see any of it.

492
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,730
The people,

493
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,760
even the zombies.

494
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,800
It's too much

495
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,310
for anyone.

496
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,180
You need rest.

497
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,410
Peace.

498
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,080
Stay here.

499
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,750
Be a part of our family.

500
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,080
I can't leave Mack.

501
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,470
I can't.

502
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,420
I love him.

503
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,980
I know you do, sweetheart.

504
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:30,930
So it'll hurt all that much more when you have to watch him die.

505
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,220
And one day he will die.

506
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,620
And it will be you

507
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,030
that has to give him mercy.

508
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,610
Yeah.

509
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,560
How do I tell him?

510
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,290
What do I say?

511
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,280
I'll tell you what to say.

512
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:06,980
Okay.

513
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,200
Addy

514
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,360
Hey, can we go talk somewhere real quick?

515
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,870
Uh, yeah. Yeah, of course.

516
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,630
So what's it like in there?

517
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,790
Sounds a little weird, I mean a zombie...

518
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,940
Uh, no, no, no, no, no. Mack, it is...

519
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,720
It's so beautiful.

520
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,700
I wish you could see it.

521
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,470
Yeah, I wish I could too.

522
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:47,790
It's so different from out here.

523
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,810
I feel safe.

524
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,620
I haven't felt that in such a long time.

525
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,430
Good. That's good.

526
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,990
I'm glad. It's...

527
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,840
I'm sure it's gonna be hard to leave.

528
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,060
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

529
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,560
It's too much.

530
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,550
I can't do it anymore, Mack.

531
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,910
But Addy...

532
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,500
I can't stay with you here.

533
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,920
I need to rest.

534
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,780
I can't.

535
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,890
I can't do this without you.

536
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:46,610
No, no, no, no, no, no. Addy. Addy, come on. Come on.

537
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,880
I love you. I... I... Don't you...

538
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,050
Mack, I love you so much.

539
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:00,990
I cannot go back out there and watch you die.

540
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,140
I'm not gonna die.

541
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,190
Yes, you will.

542
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,630
We all will.

543
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,510
And this is how I want to remember you.

544
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:16,160
Mack, I cannot kill somebody I love ever again.

545
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,930
I'm not going back out there without you, Addy.

546
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,310
I'm not. I can't.

547
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,660
This is for the best.

548
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,000
Addy. Addy, wait. Wait a minute.

549
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,170
What about Murphy, huh?

550
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,280
And the mission?

551
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,840
You said, you said you would rather

552
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,090
die believing in something than live believing in nothing.

553
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
I have to go.

554
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:40,180
Look at me. Look at me.

555
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,460
I understand. I do. You're...

556
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,490
You're upset about your mom. Of course. Of course.

557
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:50,320
It's horrible. I mean it's, it's beyond horrible.

558
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,890
But you're gonna get through this.

559
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,800
That's not who you are.

560
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:01,410
You're a good person. You're, you're, you're strong.

561
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,500
You're strong. You don't need Helen

562
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,110
and some stupid cult.

563
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,960
I'm sorry.

564
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,060
Addy, Addy, Addy. You can't do this.

565
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,590
- Mack. - You can't leave me. This is crazy.

566
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,680
- Mack. - Addy, wait.

567
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,520
- Mack, let me go. - Addy, just listen to me.

568
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,560
Just listen to me, okay?

569
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,600
- Mack. - You're not thinking clearly.

570
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,110
You're hurting me!

571
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,960
Wait. Addy.

572
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,400
Addy!

573
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,360
Wait!

574
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,340
Addy!

575
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,130
Addy!

576
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,180
Addy!

577
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:44,860
Addy!

578
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,790
Hey. Addy!

579
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:52,910
Addy!

580
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:55,860
Addy!

581
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,240
Addy!

582
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,950
Please talk to us!

583
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,040
Come on, Addy!

584
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,910
Maybe I could help?

585
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,050
I think we've had enough of your help.

586
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,410
Addy?

587
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,680
It's me.

588
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,130
Open the door.

589
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,110
Addy?

590
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,750
Don't touch me.

591
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,260
Where's Murphy? We need the tent.

592
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,650
Uh, he's still in it with that girl.

593
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,340
She's still in there?

594
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,450
Party's over, everyone. Time to go.

595
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,210
Where'd you get a cigarette?

596
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,890
Whatever daddy needs,

597
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,630
daddy gets.

598
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,670
Yeah, well time to go now, sweetheart.

599
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,660
Come on. Up and at 'em.

600
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,860
Thanks, man.

601
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,620
Thought she'd never leave.

602
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,010
Surprise.

603
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,870
Go ahead. Tell them.

604
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,360
Tell them what you told me.

605
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,740
I've made up my mind.

606
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,190
I'm gonna stay here

607
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,480
with Helen.

608
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,710
No. Addy.

609
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,560
Trouble at the gate. We need you.

610
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,750
You stay here. You'll be safe.

611
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,770
Addy, I know this place feels safe.

612
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,030
It feels good.

613
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:53,380
Well that's how I felt when I met Tobias.

614
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,680
But it wasn't real.

615
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,280
You and me,

616
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,240
we've been through so much together.

617
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,150
Addison Carver.

618
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,000
Listen to me.

619
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,930
Enough now.

620
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,280
You got sucked into this thing,

621
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,760
and you did something.

622
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,320
And we all do things.

623
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:19,380
But it is time for us to go. Now.

624
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,280
All of us.

625
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,110
You don't have to worry.

626
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,110
I'm home now.

627
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,180
No.

628
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,080
How'd she get outside?

629
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:46,950
Where is she?!

630
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,240
The tall one?

631
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,700
Your leader?

632
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,840
I'm here! What do you want?

633
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,200
You, sweetheart.

634
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,760
I want you.

635
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,710
You open that gate

636
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,730
and you come out here.

637
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:05,250
And we'll have a nice little conversation.

638
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,850
All polite like.

639
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:07,870
Shoot him.

640
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,980
I'm a real quick trigger.

641
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,830
You shoot me,

642
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,450
she's dead before I hit the ground.

643
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:17,990
Five.

644
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:18,850
Four.

645
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:19,750
Three.

646
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:20,630
Two.

647
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,860
One.

648
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,290
She's coming, right?

649
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,060
Yes, she's coming.

650
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,280
It's all right, Addy.

651
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,300
Come here, please.

652
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,200
Addy.

653
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,330
Please?

654
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,080
I will always love you, Mack.

655
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,470
We don't do this.

656
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,620
We don't leave each other.

657
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,960
Goodbye, Mack.

658
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:17,160
No.

659
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,060
You shot him?!

660
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,860
It's a warning. Get him out of here now.

661
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,490
Before it gets worse.

662
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,120
Get his gun.

663
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,000
Come on.

664
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:32,580
Addy!

665
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,010
- Come on, buddy. - Addy!

666
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,890
- What about Addy? - Come on.

667
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,090
She's not coming!

668
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,730
Let's go, Doc! Now!

669
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,020
Stop the truck.

670
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,770
- No. - Stop the truck!

671
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,190
Keep driving!

672
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,760
Mack, Mack, Mack.

673
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,140
I can't.

674
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,710
Okay.

675
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,000
I can't.

676
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:42,720
Get in!

677
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,010
Butterfly, butterfly, happy all day.

678
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,770
Butterfly, butterfly, fly fly away.

679
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,180
Three little butterflies looking at you.

680
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:14,590
One flew away and then there were two.

681
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,010
Two little butterflies soaking up the sun.

682
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:21,340
One flew away and then there was one.

683
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:24,930
One little butterfly stayed all along.

684
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:29,010

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Previously on Z Nation.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,630
Anybody else worried about Mr. Sunshine out there?

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,330
I know. He's looking worse.

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:14,790
What are you?

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,440
Why didn't it attack you?

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,910
You don't want to eat me. What do you want?

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,460
I am not one of the resurrected.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,960
I'm your messiah.

10
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,710
Do you think we'll ever see them again?

11
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,300
Mack and Addy?

12
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,150
My heart says yes.

13
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,170
But my mind?

14
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,860
My mind says no.

16
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,760
I was kinda hoping they'd make it with us to the promise land.

17
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,210
Now what?

18
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,860
Heads up, everybody.

19
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,660
I hate roadblocks.

20
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,540
Can't you just push that thing out of our way?

21
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,080
No thanks. I'd like to hold onto this truck.

22
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,940
Well this golf course has seen better days.

23
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,130
This is so sad.

24
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,180
I learned to play in prison.

25
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,420
Always wondered what it'd be like

26
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,740
to hang out with the real country club types.

27
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,460
Think that bridge is gonna hold this truck?

28
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,990
Better test it first.

29
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,200
Looks pretty solid.

30
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,850
Hello, Delta-Xray.

31
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:47,070
Citizen Z calling all cars, calling all cars.

32
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,840
Delta-Xray back at you.

33
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,580
Hello, good to hear from you again.

34
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,780
It's been days, and I worry.

35
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,970
Thanks, mom.

36
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,180
Any news on Mack or Addy?

37
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,770
No, nothing yet.

38
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,620
Maybe they're just off the grid and can't make contact.

39
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,050
Maybe.

40
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,200
How's Murphy?

41
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,730
Murphy is pissed.

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,040
Where the hell is that lab you keep talking about?

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,320
And have you found that witch doctor that almost killed me?

44
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,270
Doctor Merch?

45
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,560
I'm still working on that.

46
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,530
And you call yourself the NSA?

47
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,770
Quit looking at porn and find that quack.

48
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,110
We got business to settle.

49
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,520
Such a nice guy.

50
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,510
I got the one on the right.

51
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,980
Two thousand, four hundred fifty-five.

52
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,470
I'm out of ammo.

53
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,850
Me too.

54
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,710
Look. Some clubs.

55
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,490
Not the putter.

56
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,820
Remember keep your left arm straight.

57
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,410
Let's run for the clubhouse!

58
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,230
Murphy?

59
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,350
He's out there somewhere.

60
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,800
Safer than us.

61
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,120
We got company.

62
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,200
Hard to swing in here!

63
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,850
10K, your sling!

64
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,500
Yeah.

65
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,130
Too many.

66
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,370
This way!

67
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,920
Door won't hold much longer!

68
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,650
Better in here than out there!

69
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,680
Gunfire?

70
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,970
You can come out now.

71
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,980
That was not Murphy.

72
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,100
It wasn't a Z either.

73
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,740
All right, get ready.

74
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,460
It's okay.

75
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,110
It's all clear.

76
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,710
Nice timing.

77
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,190
Don't get too relaxed.

78
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,730
There's still more outside.

79
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,430
We got another guy outside too.

80
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,890
I don't believe it.

81
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,270
Kid out of nowhere.

82
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,920
Final holes of the Open Championship

83
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,100
at historic Saint Andrews, home of golf.

84
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,890
He's gonna hit a knock-down seven.

85
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,250
Oh, he got all of that!

86
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,740
Sorry!

87
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,700
What?

88
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,400
Little risky, don't you think?

89
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,040
No. The Zs love me.

90
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Who the hell are you?

91
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,560
Brett Zimmerman.

92
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,000
This is Henry and Janice.

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,020
Roberta Warren.

94
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,840
This is Doc, 10K, Cassandra, and

95
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,640
the fool with the jacket golfing with the zombies, that's Murphy.

96
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,350
You're just jealous cuz they like me more than you.

98
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,010
Even though it's really not the season,

99
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,500
it was the night before Sunday and all through the dome,

100
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,030
not a creature was stirring

101
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,040
in spite of this poem.

102
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,840
So on Blingo, on Hotbot, go Yahoo and Kayak.

103
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,750
Search Google and Info and also NextBio.

104
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,530
Find Marilyn Merch.

105
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,030
Where have you gone?

106
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,170
Did you make it to California?

107
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,750
Or do you walk among the dead?

108
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,490
Thirsty?

109
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,090
I have been since Portsmouth.

110
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,410
Princeton? Massachusetts?

111
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,750
Christ.

112
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,720
I'm an alum.

113
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,670
Another ex-con.

114
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,180
Not you?

115
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,790
I taught junior high english before everything went to hell.

116
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:43,260
But Henry was in San Carlos, drug smuggling I think.

117
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,130
Hmmm, my kinda guy.

118
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,570
Your evaluation?

119
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,450
I never saw anything like it. The Zs seemed afraid of him.

120
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,400
But we saw what we saw.

121
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,340
Talent like that could come in handy.

122
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,890
Yeah, and let's not be stingy with that. There you go.

123
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,790
Got any ID?

124
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,340
Mmmm. Oh yeah, this is not that White Lightning crap.

125
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,700
Have a taste, 10 cent.

126
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,460
Miss Warren...

127
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,530
Roberta.

128
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,360
Roberta, would you like to propose a toast?

129
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,160
Sure.

130
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,290
To absent friends.

131
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,890
To absent friends.

132
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,010
Mr. Murphy.

133
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,730
You seem to have a special way with them.

134
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,790
Brother, you don't know the half of it.

135
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,230
Come on, Murphy.

136
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,950
No one wants to hear your war stories.

137
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,190
They asked.

138
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,520
I'd like to hear it.

139
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,220
Those look like zombie bites.

140
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,020
Eight of 'em.

141
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,890
And I lived to tell the tale.

142
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:05,870
How is that possible?

143
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,600
Well I was given an experimental vaccine,

144
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,740
and now the Zs think I'm one of them.

145
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,410
Is there more of this vaccine?

146
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,980
You're looking at it. Only known survivor.

147
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,930
But if we can get to this lab in California,

148
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,800
they can make more vaccine using the antibodies in my blood.

149
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,610
And the human race survives.

150
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,010
Our friend tends to exaggerate.

151
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:29,670
Come on.

152
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,030
We all saw him walk through zombies.

153
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,830
What can I say? I'm a natural.

154
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,940
Try unnatural.

155
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,720
Somebody had a cocktail.

156
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,180
Henry? Don't forget about our friend Doc outside.

157
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,140
So his lab in California, that's a long ways.

158
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,280
We started in New York.

159
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,400
New York?

160
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,130
You came from New York?

161
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,170
Wasn't easy.

162
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,020
That is an understatement.

163
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,780
Well we were headed west.

164
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,470
Maybe we can help get you the rest of the way.

165
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,430
We could use the help.

166
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,620
Let me propose another toast.

167
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,650
To California.

168
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,430
Yeah.

169
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,130
To California.

170
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,300
To California.

171
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,320
Steady your aim?

172
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,940
Oh, well maybe just a sip.

173
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,950
Hey, tell my buddy 10K it's his turn to take watch.

174
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,400
That last sip,

175
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,020
I must be tired than I thought.

176
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,370
What's happening?

177
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,710
Oh shit.

178
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,280
Where am I?

179
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,270
I'm awake.

180
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,880
Okay, everybody hold on.

181
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,200
Not a great option right now.

182
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,120
Where's Murphy?

183
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,580
Murphy!

184
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,750
Okay.

185
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,320
Anyone see anything sharp?

186
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,090
Well there's all these golf tees on the floor.

187
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,460
Too short.

188
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,970
Well I got something under here. It's in my... 10K, get it.

189
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,810
You got it? Ummm.

190
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,640
Oh, no that's not sharp enough.

191
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,950
Okay, uh.

192
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,530
Uh, oh look.

193
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,680
There's something on top of the bar.

194
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,130
Any time!

195
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,070
Okay.

196
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,570
Ready? On three.

197
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,950
One!

198
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,760
Two!

199
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,610
Three!

200
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:07,760
Okay.

201
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,060
Now...

202
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,960
How do we get out of these?

203
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,820
Can we bust that rail?

204
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,940
Well if we can't, it ain't gonna be for lack of tryin'.

205
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,420
If you say anything golf-related,

206
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,910
I'll poke you with it.

207
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,720
Where are you taking me?

208
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,540
Just sit back and appreciate your improved circumstances.

209
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,180
I'm sorry. How is this an improvement?

210
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,590
We have food, water, fuel.

211
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,500
You and your friends had no food, no water,

212
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,890
and were running on fumes.

213
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,790
And no ammo.

214
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,180
Should be thankful we freed you from those losers.

215
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,170
Well maybe losing the feelings in my hands

216
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,770
is making me a little cranky.

217
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,410
I mean are these really necessary?

218
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:07,530
Hey. Look.

219
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,570
I get it.

220
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,130
You heard me talking about my deal

221
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,420
and decided to horn in.

222
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,570
Figured there might be something in it for you

223
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,770
if you get me to California.

224
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,950
But guys, unless the sun decided to rise in the west

225
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,240
we're headed the wrong way. California's behind us.

226
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,450
We're not going to California.

227
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,000
What the hell do you want?

228
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,700
Why don't you just relax, enjoy the scenery?

229
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,930
I already seen it.

230
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,980
Then just try shutting up.

231
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,430
Not my nature.

232
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,040
Then evolve.

233
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,740
You'll find out what we want soon enough.

234
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,360
What'd you do to the others?

235
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,340
You know they won't just let you take me.

236
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,590
They're a lot more dangerous than they look.

237
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,920
You don't have to worry about them anymore.

238
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,600
What'd you do?

239
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,680
You kill them?

240
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,830
We left them for the Zs.

241
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,170
Darwin will take care of the rest.

242
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,850
What happened to us?

243
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,160
I believe we got roofied.

244
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,920
Drugged with rohypnol.

245
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,450
Where's Murphy?

246
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,380
The others are gone too.

247
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,250
You don't think...

248
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,010
Murphy wouldn't do that.

249
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,630
Drug us to escape?

250
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,650
How could we let this happen?

251
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,300
He was our responsibility.

252
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,650
At least they left our ride.

253
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,940
The battery's dead.

254
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,050
Well assuming we find some way to get moving,

255
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:37,930
what next, boss?

256
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,100
Go after Murphy and get his ass to California

257
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,570
or die tryin'.

258
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,610
Hey, do we even know what direction he went in?

259
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,420
Too many questions, Doc. Too many questions.

260
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,540
It's got a battery. I don't know how good.

261
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,160
Look at this.

262
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,170
Yes.

263
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,530
How did you know that?

264
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,150
Saw the antenna on the back.

266
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,660
I'm here.

267
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,800
I'm here.

268
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,570
We lost Murphy.

269
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,980
Holy crap.

270
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,070
That has the potential for great, permanent tragedy.

271
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,480
We think he may have been kidnapped by three civilians,

272
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,300
motive unknown.

273
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,580
But they are aware of Murphy's status.

274
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,700
Is he still alive? Do you know if Murphy is still alive?

275
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,440
As far as we know.

276
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,860
Well he disappeared this morning, probably on I-70

277
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,970
going east or west in a brown utility truck.

278
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,070
Okay, ummm.

279
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,880
I see one vehicle on I-70 going east

280
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,160
through your location about two hours ago.

281
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,270
Okay, uh...

282
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,040
That...that's got to be them.

283
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,620
Hello? Hello?

284
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,300
Damn apocalypse.

285
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,830
Damn apocalypse.

286
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,960
Hey! Where we can see you.

287
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,770
I got a bashful bladder.

288
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,680
Don't mistake me for somebody who cares!

289
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,210
Well, hello there.

290
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,340
Citizen Z, are you as good as you think you are?

291
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,860
Mr. Murphy!

292
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,260
Get over here.

293
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,930
Just shaking the dew off the lily!

294
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,990
There you are, Murphy.

295
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,680
Classy as ever.

296
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,480
Warren was right. You've been kidnapped.

297
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,300
So you were what before the apocalypse?

298
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,310
I worked security.

299
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,650
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was getting that vibe.

300
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:14,670
Oh, so what? Military, Special Ops, Navy Seal?

301
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,230
Shut up!

302
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,770
Well here we go again, another fork in the road.

303
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,470
Hard to tell which way they went.

304
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,340
Citizen Z, this is Delta-Xray. Copy.

305
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,150
Hello?

306
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,310
I'd say flip a coin, but who's got coins?

308
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,310
Hey, check that out.

311
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,410
Well maybe it's a message from our guy.

312
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,740
Come on. Come on. It means go right!

313
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,110
Go right!

314
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,950
Yeah. He's saying they went that way.

316
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,620
Yeah. Let's roll.

317
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,780
Yes!

319
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,490
So General, wanna tell me what the hell we're doing?

320
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,220
Six miles from here, up and over that peak,

321
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:48,630
is the Mesa Pharmaceutical Storage and Transfer Facility.

322
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,230
Stunning news.

323
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,700
And after that, can we please oh please go to Disneyland?

324
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,260
Mesa is the Fort Knox of the Zombie Apocalypse.

325
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,030
It's filled with unused pharmaceuticals,

326
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,390
mostly oxycontin Mr. Murphy,

327
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,010
you know the value of drugs in this world.

328
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,130
You can trade them for anything. They're money.

329
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,180
So you want to liberate some oxycontin from Mesa.

330
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,620
Be my guest.

331
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,000
It's full of Zs.

332
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,090
Dozens.

333
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,220
Some of them are hopped up on speed.

334
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,250
So Mr. Murphy,

335
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,980
you do your walk through zombies trick,

336
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,580
open the gates for us, and when we ride out

337
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,480
you're a free man.

338
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,640
Well why didn't you just say so earlier? I love oxycontin.

339
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,710
Why do we have to go on foot?

340
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,150
Meth zombies are extremely responsive to sound.

341
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,220
So we can only sneak up if we're walking.

342
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,630
And I want this road blocked

343
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,900
so some other vehicle doesn't drive in and set off the Zs.

344
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,460
Henry.

345
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,800
Give me a hand with the truck.

346
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,840
I don't want it tampered with while we're gone.

347
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,670
A new low.

348
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,280
Did you say something?

349
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,280
What?

350
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,900
Nothing.

351
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,120
Science project?

352
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,080
Insurance policy.

353
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,470
We have to leave this truck here for a while.

354
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,540
I want it to be here when we get back.

355
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,420
You just can't trust anybody these days.

356
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,250
Copy that.

357
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,950
It's Zero Hour.

358
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,410
I see you're wearing a wedding ring.

359
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,030
Your husband?

360
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,440
Among the lost.

361
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,400
The Zs got him last time we tried this.

362
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,800
You guys tried robbing this oxy before?

363
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,430
A month ago.

364
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,510
He and Zimmerman cooked up the whole idea.

365
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,290
What was his name?

366
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,940
Jason.

367
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,480
How long were you guys married?

368
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,310
Five years.

369
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,470
He was a cop.

370
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,090
Knock off the questions, Murphy.

371
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,040
This isn't Match.com.

372
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,250
Hold up a minute.

373
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,330
I'm gonna scout up ahead. Henry!

374
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,290
Keep an eye out.

375
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,600
We'll be expecting Zs soon.

376
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,390
That must be tough.

377
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:52,660
Your husband dead while a wannabe like Zimmerman lives.

378
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,580
Jason knew the risks.

379
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,010
Still, it worked out pretty well for Zimmerman.

380
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,830
What are you saying?

381
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,820
Nothing.

382
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,970
Just your husband gets to walk among the dead

383
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,830
and Zimmerman gets you.

384
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,250
Shut up.

385
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,540
Sorry.

386
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,880
I'm just a chatty Kathy.

387
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,580
I didn't mean anything.

388
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,910
You hear that?

389
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,450
That sounded like a gunshot.

390
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,570
Sure did.

391
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,480
Let's be careful.

392
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,390
Hey, hey! Give me that!

393
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,950
Let go.

394
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,750
What the hell is going on here? Who fired that shot?

395
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,100
He went for her gun and it went off.

396
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,140
Is that true?

397
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,580
No.

398
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,540
It was an accident. I was reloading and it just went off.

399
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,140
I was just trying to be helpful, and this idiot tackles me.

400
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,570
All right, all of you.

401
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,820
Knock off the bullshit and pull yourselves together.

402
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,500
The Mesa plant is just ahead.

403
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,650
We need to get going before it gets dark.

404
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,710
Looks like they left their truck.

405
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,710
And we're gonna do the same.

406
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,100
Something wrong?

407
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,140
Always.

408
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,280
Keep moving.

409
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,040
Two thousand, five hundred fifty-two.

410
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,300
Thanks for the warning.

411
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,010
You're welcome.

412
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,720
They know we're coming now.

413
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,160
Let's go.

414
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,560
Come on Operation Bitemark.

415
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,940
Give me a wave.

416
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,720
Send up a flare. Shoot me a text.

417
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:32,530
Crop circles. Anything to let me know you're still alive.

418
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,630
Results for Marilyn Merch.

419
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,170
Okay, okay, we can do something useful.

420
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,620
So Dr. Merch, where were you when that was captured?

421
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,550
Three months ago?

422
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,320
Colorado?

423
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,960
What's in Colorado?

424
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,560
Well what are we gonna do when we find him?

425
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,100
Hey, check this out.

426
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,450
You think he left it on purpose?

427
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,350
He must have.

428
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,230
He definitely didn't go willingly.

429
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,670
We better step it up.

430
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,460
I knew she was gonna say that.

431
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,920
Damn it.

432
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,160
Stop. Everyone.

433
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,440
About time.

434
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,420
Don't worry.

435
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,670
Our target is just over this ridge.

436
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,680
And your troubles will soon be over.

437
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,750
I don't like the way he said that.

438
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,000
You want something?

439
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,100
Henry, check the perimeter.

440
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,650
I don't want any surprises.

441
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,360
You.

442
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,850
Over here with me.

443
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,820
Why does everybody think they can boss me around?

444
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,080
They look even faster than last time.

445
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,170
You want me to walk through those?

446
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,560
They're like the Usain Bolts of zombies.

447
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,950
What are they on? Meth?

448
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,310
Actually ritalin. They love the stuff.

449
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:49,420
Great. Just what the world needs, ADHD zombies.

450
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,420
We tried a frontal assault and it failed,

451
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,000
got Janice's husband killed.

452
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,560
But you should be able to waltz right through all the Zs.

453
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,250
Oh yeah. You make it sound so easy.

454
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,600
I never said it was easy.

455
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,850
Just possible.

456
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,540
Look here, soldier of misfortune.

457
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,170
You may not care if I get killed,

458
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,500
but I'll bet the rest of humanity does.

459
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,050
There's no way I'm doing this.

460
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,690
I don't care about you or the rest of humanity.

461
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,380
Son of a bitch.

462
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,610
You bit me.

463
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,110
I ought to shoot you right now.

464
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,990
But you won't.

465
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,610
God.

466
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,920
I see him.

467
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,410
Jason!

468
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,870
It's Jason.

469
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,000
You knew he might be here.

470
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,950
I'm trying not to think about it.

471
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,070
But now it's happening, and all I can think is

472
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,260
you're the one that got him killed.

473
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,340
Why don't you think about how I saved your life?

474
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,120
What's it gonna be?

475
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,150
Let's do this.

476
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,320
I've got some place to be.

477
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,910
What is it?

478
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,460
Looks like some kind of warehouse.

479
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,330
Damn. Those are fast Zs.

480
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,760
You think that's where they're at?

481
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,230
Must be.

482
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,770
Yeah, some kind of manufacturing plant.

483
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,370
Mesa Pharmaceuticals.

484
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,600
Oh, the Zs are all over this place.

485
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,380
What's so funny?

486
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,820
See for yourself.

487
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,540
What is it?

488
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,130
What are you looking at?

489
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:05,780
Apparently,

490
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,590
the Zs got into the Pharmaceuticals.

491
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,740
Some of them are on speed,

492
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,260
but it looks like more than a few of them got into the viagra.

493
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,500
I had no idea that was even possible.

494
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,830
Kid, it's official.

495
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:23,180
You have now seen it all.

497
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,670
It's all clear.

498
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:33,800
Good. Murphy, this is your moment.

499
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,670
Zimmerman, looks like these Zs are happy to see you.

500
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,020
Shut up.

501
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,700
Here's the plan.

502
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:45,300
Head for the first door past the corner. It'll be unlocked.

503
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,640
Go inside and immediately turn to your right.

504
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,200
You'll see a power panel inside a cage. Open it.

505
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,040
Turn on the main generator.

506
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,950
Door, right, cage, generator. Anything else?

507
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:55,970
Once the lights are on,

508
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,830
proceed directly across the room in front of you,

509
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,410
taking the right hand door into the storage area.

510
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,940
All right. Should I be writing this down?

511
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,170
It'll all be obvious once you see it.

512
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:04,840
All right.

513
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,700
Okay, anything else?

514
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,830
Could I get you a chai latte? While I'm in there?

515
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,430
Get serious. Your life depends on it.

516
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,260
Once you're inside the staging area, you'll see an office

517
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:18,110
up a flight of stairs. That is inventory control.

518
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:21,080
Go inside, look for an alarm bell. Set it off.

519
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,330
That'll draw the Zs away from the gate so we can get inside.

520
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:26,230
Then bring me the keys to the van. They'll be...

521
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,330
Jason!

522
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,160
Jason's gone.

523
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,570
That must be hard,

524
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,820
seeing him like this

525
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,960
and living with the man responsible.

526
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,930
Not just yet.

527
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,370
Ready when you are, General.

528
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,830
What are you waiting for? Go!

529
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,840
It's only a matter of time until I know everything,

530
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,460
so you might as well just tell me now.

531
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,860
There are no secrets, not from me.

532
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,040
Okay, Doctor Merch.

533
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,410
Why all the mystery?

534
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,690
You're the whiz kid genetic recombiner,

535
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,310
like a shot out of Harvard.

536
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:32,660
Your gene splicing methods made miracles possible.

537
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,370
Then two years before the apocalypse,

538
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,390
you disappear.

539
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,720
Vanish.

540
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,810
Fall down a well.

541
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,810
Until three years after the shit goes down,

542
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:44,320
you resurface at the

543
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,390
Portsmouth emergency infection lab,

544
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,520
injecting prisoners with experimental vaccines.

545
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,660
Now what do we have here?

546
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,980
Unauthorized request.

547
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,390
Requested identification not available at this time.

548
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,960
Apparently they don't know who they're dealing with.

549
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:15,000
What in the hell is Murphy doing down there?

550
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,970
The Zs must think he's one of them.

551
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,330
That must be why Zimmerman and the others kidnapped him,

552
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,890
so they can get to the drugs.

553
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,320
Now I like drugs as much as the next guy,

554
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,610
but there ain't enough dope in the world that's gonna make

555
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:30,190
me want to be out there walkin' around with them viagra Zs.

556
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,530
Let's go.

557
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,040
To the right. To the right.

558
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,240
And cage.

559
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,260
Slow ones.

560
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,530
Never thought I'd be happy to see you guys.

561
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,170
Okay.

562
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,170
Main power. Main power.

563
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,250
Main power. Main...

564
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,160
Well thank you. I believe I will try that one.

565
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,530
Okay.

566
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,230
Step two.

567
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,950
Now that's the ticket.

568
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,290
NSA.Org.

569
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,850
Come in.

570
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,460
Come in, Northern Light.

571
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,690
Come in, Northern Light.

572
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:15,380
This is Murphy for Citizen Z.

573
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,290
Where are you,

574
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,470
you useless bastard.

575
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,560
Come in, Northern Light.

576
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,740
You're alive.

577
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,950
Yeah, no thanks to you.

578
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,980
Look. I don't have time to chit chat.

579
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,750
I'm in the middle of a situation here.

580
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,570
Have you found Doctor Merch?

581
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:35,820
And what's going on with this lab in California?

582
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,530
I still don't have a location for Merch.

583
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,960
Last contact I have on record,

584
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,670
she was en route to California by way of

585
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:42,320
Fort Collins, Colorado.

586
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,190
The trail goes dark after that.

587
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,250
Why there?

588
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,530
I'm not clear.

589
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,650
Her transport landed at a military base,

590
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,120
maybe to refuel, maybe to pick up more passengers.

591
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,070
I don't know.

592
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:54,480
There's nothing conclusive, but I am still digging.

593
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,340
Just find her.

594
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,230
Look at all this.

595
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,290
Beautiful, man. You did it.

596
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,100
Find the oxy.

597
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,290
Get it into the van.

598
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,700
Murphy! Get down here! The job's not done yet!

599
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,710
And bring the keys to the van!

600
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,640
Duty calls.

601
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,240
I'm comin'.

602
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,320
Get over here and help. Things will go faster.

603
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,830
I am not your stock boy.

604
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,330
I don't have time for this.

605
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,280
Drop it!

606
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,350
Not happening, Warren. You need to turn around

607
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,830
and get out of here before I kill your big ticket.

608
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,380
Then how will you get out of here?

609
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,510
We can drive.

610
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,150
Don't know what you folks will do.

611
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,190
Well,

612
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,700
now that that's over, we're right back where we started.

613
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,650
What's the game, Warren? You are on a losing end.

614
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,810
Actually this is totally different.

615
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,140
You're weak, Zimmerman.

616
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,580
You're a weak little man.

617
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,370
Should we stop them?

618
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,130
Only if he points that gun at Murphy.

619
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,550
You were gonna kill me and the others.

620
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:39,010
Pathetic.

621
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,770
It's the apocalypse.

622
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,800
The apocalypse is better off without you.

623
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:46,580
Murphy, what are you doing?

624
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,350
Me?

625
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,260
Nothing.

626
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,740
Murphy.

627
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,230
What?

628
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,610
Mercy granted.

629
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,610
I'm not sure that was necessary.

630
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,050
Go!

645
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,790
{\an8}{\pos(185.6,49.901)}.

646
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,790
{\an8}{\pos(228.267,57.0297)}.

647
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:28,790
{\an8}{\pos(150.4,193.188)}.

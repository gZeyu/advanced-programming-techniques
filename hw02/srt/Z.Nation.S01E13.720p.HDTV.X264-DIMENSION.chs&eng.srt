1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,850
《僵尸国度》前情提要
Previously on Z Nation.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,080
他们看上去可不像志愿者啊
They don't look like volunteers to me.

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,960
成千上万的人不明原因的死去
Millions of people are dying for no reason.

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,870
这些人的死会帮助我们找到疫苗
These men are gonna die to help us find a vaccine.

5
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,190
不  不  不  不  不要啊
No, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no!

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,890
这些都是僵尸咬的
Those are zombie bites.

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:15,680
八个僵尸
Eight of them.

8
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,090
如果我们能把他送到加利福尼亚的实验室
If we can get him to the lab in California,

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,590
他们就能用他的血造出更多抗体
they can use his blood and make more of the vaccine.

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,820
他们不会攻击我因为他们爱我敬我
They will not attack me because they love and fear me.

11
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,900
我才是你们的救世主
I'm your messiah.

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,740
天呐[耶稣]
Jesus.

13
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,250
不是  只是摩菲而已
No, just Murphy.

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,180
[纽约市  疫情爆发前四年]

15
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,060
孩子多大了
How old?

16
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,530
五个月
Five months.

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,730
一个完整的人生正等待着他呢
He has his whole life ahead of him.

18
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,880
希望在此之前他能小睡一会儿
Well hopefully he's got a nap ahead of him.

19
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,530
这对他而言的确重要
They're important.

20
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,290
是啊  真希望他能明白这一点
Yeah, I wish he understood that.

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,020
他只不过不希望错过任何事而已
He doesn't want to miss anything.

22
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,140
祝你拥有完美的一天
Have a great day.

23
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,480
你也是  亲爱的  还有这个小家伙
You too, my dear. And you.

24
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,180
好好生活  年轻人  让我们都为你感到骄傲吧
Have a good life, young man. Make us all proud of you.

25
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,660
你就是那医生吗
You're the doctor?

26
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,640
没错
That's right.

27
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,050
太好了  我是强尼
Cool. I'm Johnny.

28
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,060
大概有十个街区远  你要打的过去吗
It's about ten blocks away. You want to cab it?

29
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,120
今天是美好的一天
It's a beautiful day.

30
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,660
我们走走路吧
Let's take a walk.

31
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,920
上周我在那儿遇到位老哥  桑迪飓风来临时
Had a buddy down there last week when Sandy hit.

32
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,130
他不得不付给出租车司机两千美金逃出镇子
Had to pay a cabbie two grand to get a ride out of town.

33
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,550
他说当时一切都是疯狂  无法无天的
He said it was bananas, lawless.

34
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,580
其实用不着太多手段就能把人逼成野蛮人
Doesn't take much to get people acting like savages.

35
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,440
只要把他们的食物拿走即可
Just take their food away.

36
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,710
没错  老兄
That's it, brotha.

37
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,800
这是个人吃人的世界
Man eat man.

38
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,960
这就是比尔了
That's Bill.

39
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,910
病的连个坛子都踢不倒了
Just can't kick the crock.

40
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,870
邋遢的不像样子
Shit's nasty.

41
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,320
谢了哈
Sweet.

42
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,580
我要问你几个问题  比尔
I'm going to ask you a few questions, Bill.

43
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,180
你上顿饭何时吃的
When was your last meal?

44
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,780
记不清了
I dunno.

45
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,780
大概一礼拜前吧
A week maybe.

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,990
有没有觉得自己对光的敏感度迅速提升了
Have you noticed an increased sensitivity to light?

47
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,940
嗯哼
Uh huh.

48
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,950
手脚麻木没感觉
Numbness in your extremities?

49
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,620
你觉得冷吗
Are you cold?

50
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,730
冷的发抖
Freezing.

51
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,720
你会帮助我吗
Are you gonna help me?

52
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,720
事实上
Actually

53
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,890
是你要来帮助我
you're going to help me.

54
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,420
{\an8}落基山脉西侧某处  疫情爆发第三年

55
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,020
不确定我们还能在一起撑多久
Not sure how much longer we can hold it together.

56
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,570
再有150英里就到了
It's only another 150 miles.

57
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,660
我们有人倒下了  卡桑德拉
We have a man down, Cassandra.

58
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,020
她看上去可不怎么好
She's not looking good.

59
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,380
还有那"包裹"也是
And then there's the package.

60
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,010
额  "包裹"怎么样了
Uh, what about the package?

61
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,140
不太清楚  但是摩菲的行为怪异
Don't know exactly, but Murphy's acting weird.

62
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,340
比以往要怪异的多
More than usual.

63
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,070
新的目的地在哪
Where's this new destination?

64
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,030
在科罗拉多州科林斯堡
It's Fort Collins, Colorado.

65
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,390
加州那边出什么事了
What happened to California?

66
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,390
研究室那边又没影了
Lab's dark again.

67
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,690
也许是好事  你们被重新部署了
Maybe for good. You've been redeployed.

68
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,150
谁下的指令
By whose orders?

69
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,700
我一开始收到了一段电传打字电报信号
Well I started picking up a teletype signal

70
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,240
在民防波段上收到的
on the old civil defense frequency.

71
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,940
我原以为是黑客干的
At first I thought it was a hacker,

72
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,610
后来发现是莫奇医生发的
but turns out it's Doctor Merch.

73
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,070
是的  就是那个给摩菲注射的莫奇医生
Yeah, that Doctor Merch. The one who injected Murphy.

74
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,120
所以现在把摩菲送到科林斯堡
So delivery Murphy to Fort Collins.

75
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,420
莫奇医生会和她的团队一起在那里等你们
Doctor Merch will be there with her team to meet you.

76
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,130
所以不用再去加州了呗
No more California?

77
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,240
科罗拉多就是新的加利福尼亚
Colorado is the new California.

78
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,070
收到
Copy.

79
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,030
感觉好点了吗
Feel better now?

80
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,440
好点了
Yeah, a little bit.

81
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,280
不行  不行  不行
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

82
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,560
你试着放松点
Try to relax.

83
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,260
我们还剩多少汽油
How much gas do we have left?

84
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,990
我不知道  可能还剩半箱吧
I don't know, half a tank or so.

85
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,860
还能再撑150英里吗
Make it 150 miles?

86
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,800
如果都是下坡路的话  没问题
Well if it's mostly downhill.

87
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,200
我们的子弹也所剩无几了
We're real low on ammo too.

88
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,990
{\an8}梅撒制药股份有限公司

89
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,720
什么事
Yeah?

90
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,170
我们找到一个接收人
We found a taker.

91
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,130
接收什么
For what?

92
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,140
接收你
For you.

93
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,550
那还去不去加州了
What about California?

94
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,390
我们接到新的命令  现在要去一间
New orders. We are headed to

95
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,550
位于柯林斯堡的实验室
a lab in Fort Collins.

96
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,230
柯林斯堡  那里有什么
Fort Collins? What the hell is in Fort Collins?

97
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,130
莫奇医生在那里等你
Dr. Merch is there waiting for you.

98
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,250
莫奇医生  我跟那个婊子可有的聊了
Doctor Merch? Yeah, I got a bone to pick with that bitch.

99
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,330
正是因为这个婊子  你才能活到现在
That bitch is the reason you're still alive.

100
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,440
请给活着下个定义
Define alive.

101
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,650
摩菲老兄
Well, Murphy.

102
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,630
我猜我会想你这个混蛋的
I think I'm gonna miss your sorry ass.

103
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,180
你的好意我心领了
I appreciate the sentiment.

104
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,690
我们一起跋山涉水  老兄
We logged some miles together, brother.

105
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,940
阿门
Amen.

106
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,690
我都开始觉得咱们像一家人了
Starting to feel like a damn family.

107
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,930
你明白我的意思吧
You know what I'm sayin'?

108
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,050
我不太确定之前有没有跟别人讲过
Uh, I...I don't know if I've actually ever said this to anybody before.

109
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,390
不过我...
But I...

110
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,720
我快要把你当成
I almost consider you

111
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,670
朋友了
a friend.

112
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,270
好吧  尽管我一点也不羡慕你
Yeah, I don't envy you though, man.

113
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,880
等我们把你安全送达目的地  世事难料
I mean, hell, once we deliver you, all bets are off.

114
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,180
专家们就会在你身上戳很多很多针
They're gonna have more needles stuck in you than

115
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,560
比老奶奶针线球上的针都多
the damn tomato in grandma's sewing basket.

116
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,370
-不  他们只会抽出我的...  -相信我
- No, they're...they're just gonna take out my... - Oh, trust me,

117
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,750
他们肯定会用某种管子或者刺针
they're gonna have some kind of tube or prod

118
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,760
插进你身上每个孔里  不然我就跟你姓
rammed in every spare orifice, or my name ain't Sally.

119
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,970
你知道吗  我之前插过一次尿管
You know this one time I had a catheter.

120
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,500
老兄  你最好希望他们别往那里下手
Dude, you better hope they don't go that route.

121
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,160
多克
Doc.

122
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,970
怎么了
What?

123
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,070
还有多远
How much further?

124
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,260
我不清楚  大概还有65英里吧
Uh, I don't know, 65 miles or so.

125
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,090
总之
Anyway,

126
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,820
我会想你的  老兄
I'm gonna miss you, dude.

127
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,310
是哦  好的
Yeah, right.

128
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,780
你呢  小万万
How about you, kid?

129
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,910
你有什么打算
What do you got planned?

130
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,170
我不知道
Uh, I don't know.

131
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,700
我还要再杀6998个僵尸才能凑够一万
Still got 6,998 to go.

132
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,280
我可能会选择休息一段时间
Might take a break for a while though,

133
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,610
然后北上  向寒冷地带进发
head up north somewhere cold.

134
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,230
僵尸在寒冷的地方会没那么活跃
The Zs don't fare too well in the cold.

135
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,590
我自己在寒冷的地方过得也不太好
Yeah, I don't fare too well in the cold myself.

136
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:31,920
罗伯塔
Roberta?

137
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,200
我没想好呢
Uh, I don't know.

138
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,040
也许向着太阳西坠的方向走
Maybe follow the sun west.

139
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,570
我以前没去过加州
I've never been to California.

140
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,930
你有什么打算  多克
How 'bout you, Doc?

141
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,630
我可能会买一艘小船
Maybe I'll buy a boat

142
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,100
然后环游世界
and sail around the world.

143
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,700
给自己找一座与世隔绝甚至未曾开化的小岛
Find me an island where there's not even a Z in their alphabet.

144
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,670
应该就是这里了
This must be it.

145
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,800
市民Z让我们找一座有卷闸门的金属小屋
Citizen Z said look for a metal shed with a roll up door.

146
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,710
比如我们眼前这个吗
Like this one?

147
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,300
这群僵尸在看什么
What are they all looking at?

148
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,700
我们的入口
Our entrance.

149
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,370
你觉得我们找对地方了吗
You think we're in the right place?

150
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,810
这地方看上去不大
Looks small.

151
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,780
让我看看你的双手
Let me see your hands.

152
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,320
什么
What?

153
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,840
我的手  为什么
My hands, why?

154
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,290
又要检查个人卫生了吗
Is this a hygiene thing again?

155
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,090
让我看看你的双手就好
Just let me see them.

156
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,780
你到底在做什么
What the hell are you doing?

157
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,190
他们要找的是一群
They're looking for a group of civilians

158
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,400
押送囚犯的普通人
transporting a prisoner.

159
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,490
我不想有人误以为你是僵尸
I don't want anyone mistaking you as a zombie.

160
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,520
胡扯
Bullshit.

161
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,900
我救过你们那么多次  你还是不信任我
You don't trust me. After all the times I've saved your ass.

162
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,750
这与是否信任你无关
Trust has got nothing to do with it.

163
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,360
我们已经护送你这么远了  我不想你被误伤
I don't want anyone piking you after we got you this far.

164
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,100
还是快些搞定这一切吧
Let's just get this over with.

165
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,570
摩菲
Murphy!

166
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,370
我们还有多少弹药
How much ammo do we got?

167
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,260
两发
Two bullets.

168
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,760
我有...
I got...

169

170
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,460
一发
One?

171
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,390
我早说过了
I told ya.

172
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,790
摩菲

173
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,100
怎么了
What?!

174
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,680
你需要我的帮助了吗
Oh, you want my help?!

175
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,570
当然
Sure,

176
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,470
有何不可呢
why not.

177
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,690
别急
Hold your pants on.

178
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,320
跟着我
Follow me.

179
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,410
你怎么知道这样行得通
How do you know?

180
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,390
我不知道行不行得通
I don't.

181
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,600
别
Don't!

182
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,340
别动武器
Don't do it.

183
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,460
好了  快走
All right, quick.

184
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,430
大家搂紧我
Group hug.

185
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,340
什么
What?

186
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,500
照做就是了
Just do it!

187
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
你是想活还是想死
You want to live or not?

188
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,660
也许有一天你该学会信任我
Maybe someday you'll learn to trust me.

189
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,760
伙计  但愿没人看到我们这个样子
Man, I hope nobody sees us.

190
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,410
你知道  大灾变之前
You know before the apocalypse,

191
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,460
大群的姑娘们  对我做同样的事呢
I had the same effect on the ladies.

192
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,070
看来这地方已经瘫痪了
Sure doesn't look operational.

193
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,130
外面那些僵尸
All those zombies up there

194
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,210
肯定是想要这里的什么东西
must've wanted something down here.

195
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,280
是啊  但想要什么呢
Yeah, but what?

196
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,810
它们想要的东西一直没变过
Same thing they always want.

197
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,320
大脑
Brains.

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,030
不是

是别的什么
Something different.

200
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,580
这里有什么东西像磁铁一样吸引着它们
Something inside is attracting them like a magnet.

201
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,090
我能感觉到

00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,560
让我想起了我的五十岁生日
Uh, reminds me of my 50th.

204

生日快乐  柯什么博士

205
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,040
先到先吃
Dibs on the last rose.

206
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,540
干嘛啦  人家忍不住嘛
What? I can't help it.

207
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,220
那该死的疫苗让我渴望糖分
Damn vaccine makes me crave sugar.

208
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,000
如果你开始渴望大脑了  一定要告诉我
Well if you start craving brains, let me know.

209
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,620

不用忍受太久了  孩子
It won't be long now, my child.

213
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,080
放心

214
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,430
你要去一个更好的地方了

225
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,260
该死

226
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,430
没关系  孩子

236

今天实验室出事了

239
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,480

240

241

他们拿动物做实验并不惊奇

259
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,990
但是他们在做什么实验呢

260
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,200
看看这些录像上面的日期

是人类被感染的前一年

他们怎么会在人类被感染之前

263
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,850
就知道要研发疫苗

我们再从头来理一遍
Let's start again from the beginning.

270
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,670
莫奇医生  我刚刚才跟你说过

273
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,320
下班之后我脱掉了防护服
I took the suit off after my shift.

274
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,610

And then what?

277
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,240
我把制服扔进焚化炉
Tossed it in the incinerator

278
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,010
然后就直接去消毒了

279
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:56,900
等等  倒回去一下
Let's back up a second.

- How many times are we gonna - When you took off your suit,

281

282
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,770
我根据规定来脱的

283

285
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,830
然后解开防护服的拉链
And unzipped my suit.

286
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,130
脱掉防护服
Removed it.

287
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,660
接着摘掉手套
And gloves.

288
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,970
然后呢
And then what?

289
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,690
把东西都丢进焚化炉
Tossed it in the incinerator.

290
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,660
-然后直接去...  -去消毒了
- And went straight to... - To decontamination.

291
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,140
当你处理你的样本时
Did you notice anything different on this day

292
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,660
有没有发现什么异常
when handling your samples?

293
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,250
我一直按照平常的程序操作
I did as I've always done.

294
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,350
我把样本就放回了原处
I left the samples exactly where I found them.

295
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,150
你有没有和实验室里的任何东西发生接触
Did you come in contact with anything in the lab,

296
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,360
任何尖锐到可能刺破你...
anything sharp that could've punctured your...

297
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,110
我跟你说过十遍了
I told you this ten times!

298
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,890
但是肯定出了什么问题
Well something happened.

299
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,670
这是毋庸置疑的
There's no denying it.

300
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,230
当时肯定出事了
Something happened.

301
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,560
消毒警报响了  那就是所谓的出事
The decontamination alarm went off. That's what happened.

302
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,130
没错
That's right.

303
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,520
不  不对
No, but it's wrong.

304
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,090
我们要调查的
That's what needs to be investigated,

305
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,290
正是警报为什么响了
why the alarm went off.

306
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,550
这是我们要搞清楚的问题
That's what we're trying to find out.

307
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:44,530
是什么样的污染让病菌警报响了
What form of contamination set off the pathogen alarm.

308
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,390
不对  这是个假警报
No. Cause this is a false alarm.

309
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,120
感应器出了问题
The sensor made an error

310
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,130
因为我...  我没有碰过任何东西
because I... I didn't touch anything.

311
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,520
我没有弄破自己的防护服
I didn't puncture my suit.

312
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,000
我绝对没有违规摘下什么护具
I didn't remove any items out of order.

313
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,160
我都是按规定来的
I followed protocol.

314
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,580
我被感染了吗
Am I gonna be sick?

315
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,390
我猜这位道尔老兄下场不太好
Well I'm guessing it didn't end too well for old Doyle here.

316
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,100
谁同意赶紧离开这个地方
Okay, who's for getting out of here right now?

317
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,230
赞成的举手
Show of hands.

318
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,090
很好
Okay.

319
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,740
那就回到外面的末日世界去
It's back out to the apocalypse it is.

320
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,610
任何人哪也不准去
Nobody's going anywhere.

321
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,500
现在不是搞什么狗屁民主的时候
This is not a goddamn democracy.

322
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,210
我们来是找莫奇医生的
We came here to find Doctor Merch,

323
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,760
所以下一步我们就是要找她
and that is exactly what we are going to do.

324
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,180
他说得对
He's right.

325
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,900
如果她在这  我们不能丢下她不管
If she's down here, we just can't leave her.

326
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,110
她仍然是我们得到解药的唯一机会
She is still our only chance at a vaccine.

327
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,670
那好吧
You're right.

328
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,510
我刚才只是想
I just thought we might want to,

329
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,720
怎么说呢
I dunno,

330
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,090
活命
live.

331
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,420
别做梦了  赶紧出发吧
Yeah, well quit your dreaming and let's go.

332
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,820
{\an8}哈萨克斯坦  塞米巴拉金斯克
疫情爆发前两年

333
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,660
{\an8}废弃生化武器实验室

334
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,270
政府放弃这些设施的时候
When the government abandoned this facility,

335
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,650
光把插销一拔就走人了
they just pulled plug and walked away.

336
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,760
那俄国人就一点没有
And the Russians did nothing

337
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,520
对生化武器进行什么保护吗
to secure the bio-weapons they left behind?

338
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,240
现在这里是哈萨克斯坦了
This is Kazakhstan now.

339
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,140
干啥啥没钱  连警察都雇不起了
There is no money for anything, not even pay policemen.

340
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,930
那些被用来测试的动物怎样了
What happened to all the test animals they were using here?

341
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,190
谁知道
Who knows?

342
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,950
也许杀了  也许放了
Maybe destroyed. Maybe set free.

343
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,580
这里见证了许多悲伤的故事
These walls have many sad stories to tell.

344
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:24,090
这些傻瓜是来偷铜和钛的
These fools, they come here to steal copper and titanium.

345
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,750
他已经死了
He's already dead.

346
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,630
我昨天看他还活着呢
Hmmm, he was alive when I found him yesterday.

347
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,590
你怎么不救他
Why didn't you help him?

348
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,180
这么多灌多了伏特加就来偷东西的白痴
I can't be responsible for every vodka-soaked idiot

349
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,070
我可照顾不过来
who comes in here to steal.

350
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,940
再说了  他已经救不过来了
Besides, he was already too far gone.

351
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,190
他死了就对我没用了
He's of no use to me dead.

352
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,210
但你还是要付我钱  朋友
But you'll still pay me, my friend.

353
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,970
帮我把他翻过来
Help me turn him over.

354
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,390
你干什么
What are you doing?!

355
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:05,980
搞科研
Science.

356
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,530
这里是僵尸大灾变  您需要转接哪位
Zombie apocalypse, how may I direct your call?

357
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,570
咬痕研究所吗
Operation Bite Mark?

358
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,750
活着的都在呢  我是多克
Uh, yeah, what's left of us. This is Doc speaking.

359
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,540
很好  你们还在一起吗
Excellent. Are you all still together?

360
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,680
都在都在  很高兴听到你的声音
Correctomundo. Nice to hear your voice.

361
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,420
说吧  前方还有什么鬼
So what fresh hell awaits us?

362
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,650
根据被我黑进去的研究所手册的说法
According to the operations manual I've hacked into,

363
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,690
你们都需要进行消毒
you're going to need to go through decontamination.

364
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,800
真是太好了
Well that sounds great to me

365
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,350
因为我老久都没好好洗个澡了  大概从
cuz I ain't had a decent shower since, let's see,

366
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,550
纽约之后就没洗过
New York.

367
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,270
严格来讲不算是洗澡
Well it's not exactly a shower.

368
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,510
但最最重要的是这一点
But here's the most important thing.

369
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,500
你们回到外界之前  千万务必
It is imperative that you decontaminate again

370
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,570
要再消毒一次
before going back to the surface.

371
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:00,220
因为这个实验室的检疫隔离等级是
This lab is equipped with Defcon One level

372
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,760
一级戒备
quarantine assurance.

373
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,240
一级戒备
Defcon One?

374
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,120
那不是个跟核大战有关的词吗
Well isn't that some kind of nuclear term?

375
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,350
一旦检疫隔离系统被突破
In the event of the breach of the quarantine system,

376
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,000
该实验室将受到战术核武器打击
the lab is targeted to be incinerated

377
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,870
以确保完全摧毁
by a tactical nuclear weapon.

378
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,580
我真是一点都不吃惊啊
What am I not surprised?

379
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,600
另外关于这个消毒
And there's one other thing

380
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:17,470
还有一点你们得知道一下
about the decontamination process you need to know.

381
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,630
是吗  哪一点
Yeah, what's that?

382
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,560
非得全裸吗
Naked?

383
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,080
这是他原话
That's what he said.

384
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,570
全裸
Naked.

385
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,530
而且我们还得把衣服什么的
And then we got to put all our clothes and stuff

386
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,590
全都放进这个溜槽里
in this chute here to get decontaminated with some

387
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,280
拿液氮消毒
liquid nitrogen.

388
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,050
那我们等什么呢
So what are we waiting for?

389
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,900
等你们转过脸去
For y'all to turn around.

390
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,500
不准偷看姐
And no peeking.

391
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,390
眼睛朝前看  小万万
Eyes up front, young man.

392
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,420
对不起  不好意思
Sorry. Sorry.

393
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,150
卡桑德拉  你还好吧
Cassandra, you okay?

394
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,710
我感觉我快要晕倒了
I feel like I'm gonna pass out.

395
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,250
你再撑一下  多克  接下来做什么
You hang in there. Doc, what now?

396
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,250
哦  接下来戴上这个
Oh, we got to put these on.

397
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,200
然后...  然后就要
And...and then you got to

398
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,040
按下那个写着消毒字样的按键
hit that button marked decontamination

399
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,730
按键就在你面前  一万
in front of you, 10K.

400
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,220
摩菲
Murphy.

401
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,920
你的伤疤
Your scars.

402
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,500
看起来好像扩散了
It looks like it's spreading.

403
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,140
我正想找莫奇医生算算这笔账呢
That's what I wanted to talk to Doctor Merch about.

404
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,850
戴好你的护目镜  别盯着我看
Well put your goggles on and quit staring.

405
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,830
我又不是什么大象人
I'm not the goddamn elephant man.

406
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,620
我是人类
I'm a human being.

407
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,900
算是吧
Sort of.

408
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,160
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

409
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,490
按吧
Just do it.

410
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,650
不好  我的小弟弟好像被灼伤了
Man, I think I fried my gonads.

411
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,300
我应该给它涂点防晒霜的
I shoulda used sunscreen on my junk.

412
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,260
你没事吧
You're okay.

413
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,120
我觉得我不能继续走了
I don't think I can go much further.

414
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,150
我来照顾她
I've got her.

415
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,160
实在不行的话我抱着她走
I'll carry her if I have to.

416
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,710
好吧  行
Okay. Sure.

417
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,200
看见什么了吗
Can you see anything?

418
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,370
等会  里面太黑了
Hold on, little too dark.

419
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,060
{\an8}注意

420
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,710
里面有一些应急灯样的东西在闪
There's some kind of emergency lights flashing.

421
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,270
兄弟  这儿写着隔离呢
Dude, it says quarantine.

422
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,530
我们就不能信他们一回吗
Can't we just believe them?

423
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,710
你怎么回事  傻了吗
What are you, high?

424
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,580
我们已经被感染了  你忘了吗
We're infected already, remember?

425
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,440
这地方到底是干什么用的
What is this place?

426
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,250
这里不是医院  这简直就是个魔窟
This isn't a hospital. It's a goddamn hall of horrors.

427
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,460
嘿  快看
Hey, look.

428
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,570
我的神呐
Oh my God.

429
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,870
我希望上帝不知道这些事
I hope God doesn't know about this.

430
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,110
因为他要是知道的话...
Cuz if he does...

431
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,630
我们应该给她施以仁慈
We should give her mercy.

432
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,640
不行  要是打开这扇门
No. If we open this door,

433
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,000
苍蝇就会飞出来吃我们的
them flies are gonna be feeding on us.

434
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,240
到这儿来
Over here.

435
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,110
这里面的不见了  门是开着的
This one's gone. The door's open.

436
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,590
它是什么呢
What was it?

437
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,630
你应该问
Better question is

438
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,040
它去哪里了
where'd it go?

439
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,820
管它是什么玩意儿  它还在这儿
Well whatever it is, it's still here.

440
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,430
我靠不是吧...
Shut the...

441
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,040
还有一个
There's another one.

442
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,300
摩菲  快跟他们吐槽  就...  你擅长的那个
Murphy. Go talk to them. Do...do that thing you do.

443
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,700
伙计们
Guys.

444
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,250
它们不是普通的僵尸
These aren't regular zombies.

445
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,250
好像是一种变异僵尸
They're some kind of mutant thing.

446
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,380
我觉得它们貌似不喜欢我呀
I don't think they like me!

447
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,310
去找莫奇吧
Let's go find Merch.

448
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,160
找到莫奇之后他会做什么呢
What's he gonna do when he catches up to Merch?

449
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,310
我不知道  幸好我不是莫奇
I dunno, but I'm glad I'm not her.

450
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,830
做好一切准备  走吧
Be ready for anything. Let's go.

451
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,910
{\an8}海地  太子港  疫情爆发前一年

452
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,270
这就是我之前跟你说的那位病人
This is the patient I was telling you about.

453
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,270
他这种状态持续多久了
How long has he been like this?

454
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,470
地震之后开始  大概...
Since the earthquake. Almost...

455
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,820
到目前为止七年了
seven years now.

456
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,770
他被埋在废墟底下二十一天之后存活下来
He was buried under rubble for 21 days and survived,

457
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,360
但被救出来后就一直是这种状态
but has been in this state since his rescue.

458
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,130
他对外界有任何反应吗
Is he responsive at all?

459
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,020
有一种非常奇怪的反应
In a strange way.

460
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,990
请坐起来  好吗
Can you sit up, please?

461
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,900
他能对命令做出反应
He responds to commands

462
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,900
但是对周围环境似乎完全没有意识
but seems to be completely unaware of his surroundings

463
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,630
而且没有任何自主意志
and has no will of his own.

464
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,360
他说过话吗
Has he ever spoken?

465
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,490
没有
No.

466
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,120
有员工戏称他为僵尸
The staff has nicknamed him "The zombie."

467
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,190
真的吗
Really?

468
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,830
太迷人了
Fascinating.

469
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,410
您不介意我离开一会吧
If you'll excuse me a minute.

470
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,230
当然
Of course.

471
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,990
可以把胳膊放下了
You can lower your arm.

472
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,350
转过来看着我
Turn toward me.

473
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,850
躺回去
Lie back down.

474
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,610
我坚持不住了
I can't do it.

475
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,210
停
Stop.

476
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,370
我能带你一起走
I can carry you.

477
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,680
你会没事的
You're gonna be okay.

478
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,980
大家都会被我拖累死的
I'm gonna get us all killed.

479
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,920
求你了
Please,

480
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,480
汤米
Tommy.

481
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,260
好吧
Okay.

482
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,690
别告诉其他人我的名字  可以吗
Just don't tell anybody my name, all right?

483
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,070
我不会说的
I won't.

484
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,150
她已经...
Is she...?

485
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,690
她还活着
She's still alive.

486
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,070
发生了什么
What happened?

487
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,410
你在这里休息一下
You can stay here and get some rest.

488
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,870
我们会回来接你的
And we'll come back for you.

489
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,020
听着
Look.

490
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,760
自纽约起  我一直留着这宝贝
I've been saving this special since New York.

491
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,980
我要你拿着它
I want you to have it.

492
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,960
只是以防万一
Just in case.

493
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,830
谢谢你  沃伦
Thank you, Warren.

494
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,340
你懂的
You got it.

495
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,450
你坚持住  亲爱的
You hang in there, darlin'.

496
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,780
我们会找到抗生素
We're gonna find you some antibiotics,

497
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,180
很快就能把你治好
and we're gonna get you straightened out in no time.

498
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,380
谢谢你  汤米
Thank you, Tommy.

499
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,890
伙计们
Guys,

500
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,060
快过来
come on.

501
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,280
我好像发现了什么
I think I found something.

502
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:24,890
她能挺过去吗
Is she gonna make it?

503
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,510
你可能得跟她道别了
You might want to say your goodbyes.

504
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:04,710
我们走吧
Let's go.

505
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:08,940
快看看这个
Check this out.

506
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,060
血迹一直延续到这里
This trail of gore leads to here.

507
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,030
生物封存室
Biocontainment.

508
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,480
这鬼地方还能再吓人点吗
Could this place get any creepier?

509
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,280
是啊
Yes.

510
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,680
天啊
Oh my God.

511
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,330
它还活着呢
It's alive.

512
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,010
这就是莫奇医生吗
Is that Doctor Merch?

513
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,530
不是
No.

514
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,970
是另一个人
Somebody else.

515
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,440
就是录像里的那个技术员
It's the lab tech in the video.

516
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,650
他想让我们看点东西
He wants us to watch something.

517
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,730
你为什么要这么做
Why are you doing this to me?

518
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,980
这是为你好  布伦登
It's for your own good, Brendon.

519
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,610
你已经对病毒有反应了
You've started to react to the virus.

520
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,250
别给我注射你给猴子们打的鬼东西
Don't give me that shit you've been giving the monkeys.

521
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,670
我见识过它的副作用
I've seen the side effects.

522
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,330
我们不能冒险  病毒已经传染给人类了
We can't take the chance the virus has jumped to humans.

523
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,090
你会是疫苗的首例人体试验者
You'll be the first human trial of the vaccine.

524
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,460
我们不能再等了
We can't wait any longer.

525
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,870
我会怎样
What's gonna happen to me?

526
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,170
我们也不知道
We don't know.

527
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,320
按住他
Hold him down.

528
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,800
按住他
Hold him down!

529
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,260
按住了
Hold him still.

530
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,610
把摄影机关掉
And turn off that camera.

531
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,960
一定是疫苗起作用了
The vaccine must have worked.

532
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,550
没有使他变成僵尸
Kept him from turning zombie.

533
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,630
但也没能让他解脱
But it won't let him die.

534
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,870
莫奇把你变成这样的吗
Did Merch do this to you?

535
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,910
他想要说点什么
He's trying to say something.

536
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,900
杀了我
Kill me.

537
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,060
杀了我
Kill me.

538
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,380
杀了我
Kill me.

539
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,100
杀了我
Kill me.

540
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,440
我们快离开这鬼地方
We're getting the hell out of here.

541
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:38,760
这里还有其他人
You've got company.

542
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,300
好像是莫奇医生和两名士兵朝你们这来了
Looks like Doctor Merch and two soldiers headed your way.

543
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,710
他们马上就到
They should be there any second.

544
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,430
当心
Heads up.

545
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,020
莫奇医生
Doctor Merch.

546
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,820
我们又见面了
We meet again.

547
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,130
莫奇医生没有活下来
Doctor Merch didn't make it.

548
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,440
我是她的上司  库尔茨医生
I'm her boss, Doctor Kurtz.

549
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,800
我是来此协助您拯救全人类的
I'm here to help you save mankind.

550
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,540
库尔茨医生
Doctor Kurtz.

551
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,340
库尔茨医生  查找库尔茨医生
Doctor Kurtz. Paging Doctor Kurtz.

552
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,750
瞧瞧这简历  太牛了
Wow. Look at that resume?

553
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,570
团队领导人  艾滋病毒疫苗专利持有人
Team leader, patent holder, HIV vaccine.

554
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,070
埃博拉病毒二代疫苗专利持有人

555
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,220
因彻底根除SARS病毒而诺贝尔奖
Nobel Prize. Credited with eradication of SARS.

556
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,370
这就是传说中的"别人家的孩子"啊
Wow. Somebody made their mama proud.

557
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,230
这不是库尔茨医生呀
That's not Doctor Kurtz.

558
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,270
那这人到底是谁
Who the hell is this?

559
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,810
我们花了很大力气去找你  摩菲先生
We've gone to a great deal of effort to find you, Mr. Murphy.

560
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,160
我和小伙伴来了一趟公路旅行而已
I've been on a little road trip.

561
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,510
你的旅程到此结束  你安全了
Well your journey ends here. You're safe now.

562
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,340
你的朋友会因勇气与全力相助
And your friends are to be commended for their

563
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,400
得以表彰
bravery and commitment.

564
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:01,470
整个国家乃至全人类都欠你们一份恩情
Your country, all mankind, owes you a great deal.

565
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,300
你们会把他怎么样
What's going to happen to him?

566
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,900
我们会把他带到加利福尼亚州的实验室
Well we'll take him the rest of the way to the lab in California

567
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,860
我们会测定他的基因序列
where we'll sequence his genes

568
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,480
克隆他血液里的抗体
and clone the antibodies in his blood.

569
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,050
但愿
Then with any luck,

570
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,950

571
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,770
库里安医生
Doctor... Kurian?

说起这个
Speaking of which,

578
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,620
给那位苟延残喘的怪物"施以仁慈"吧
someone should really give that poor creature mercy.

579
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,270

千万...别信他
Don't...trust...him.

586
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,550
我仁慈地结束你的生命
I give you mercy.

587
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,190
我不会跟你走
I'm not going.

摩菲
Murphy.

589
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,840
我们此行的目的就在于此
This is why we came this far.

590
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,740
我凭什么相信你说的每一句话

以防万一
Just a precaution.

594
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,180
大家稍安勿躁
Now just hold on a minute.

595
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,680
没必要动手  他只是紧张而已
Ain't no reason to jump bad. He's just nervous.

596
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,670
是吧  摩菲

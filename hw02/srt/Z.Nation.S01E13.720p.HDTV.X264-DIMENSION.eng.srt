1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,850
Previously on Z Nation.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,080
They don't look like volunteers to me.

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,960
Millions of people are dying for no reason.

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,870
These men are gonna die to help us find a vaccine.

5
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,190
No, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no!

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,890
Those are zombie bites.

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:15,680
Eight of them.

8
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,090
If we can get him to the lab in California,

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,590
they can use his blood and make more of the vaccine.

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,820
They will not attack me because they love and fear me.

11
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,900
I'm your messiah.

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,740
Jesus.

13
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,250
No, just Murphy.

15
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,060
How old?

16
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,530
Five months.

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,730
He has his whole life ahead of him.

18
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,880
Well hopefully he's got a nap ahead of him.

19
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,530
They're important.

20
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,290
Yeah, I wish he understood that.

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,020
He doesn't want to miss anything.

22
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,140
Have a great day.

23
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,480
You too, my dear. And you.

24
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,180
Have a good life, young man. Make us all proud of you.

25
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,660
You're the doctor?

26
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,640
That's right.

27
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,050
Cool. I'm Johnny.

28
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,060
It's about ten blocks away. You want to cab it?

29
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,120
It's a beautiful day.

30
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,660
Let's take a walk.

31
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,920
Had a buddy down there last week when Sandy hit.

32
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,130
Had to pay a cabbie two grand to get a ride out of town.

33
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,550
He said it was bananas, lawless.

34
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,580
Doesn't take much to get people acting like savages.

35
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,440
Just take their food away.

36
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,710
That's it, brotha.

37
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,800
Man eat man.

38
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,960
That's Bill.

39
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,910
Just can't kick the crock.

40
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,870
Shit's nasty.

41
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,320
Sweet.

42
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,580
I'm going to ask you a few questions, Bill.

43
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,180
When was your last meal?

44
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,780
I dunno.

45
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,780
A week maybe.

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,990
Have you noticed an increased sensitivity to light?

47
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,940
Uh huh.

48
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,950
Numbness in your extremities?

49
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,620
Are you cold?

50
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,730
Freezing.

51
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,720
Are you gonna help me?

52
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,720
Actually

53
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,890
you're going to help me.

55
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,020
Not sure how much longer we can hold it together.

56
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,570
It's only another 150 miles.

57
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,660
We have a man down, Cassandra.

58
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,020
She's not looking good.

59
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,380
And then there's the package.

60
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,010
Uh, what about the package?

61
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,140
Don't know exactly, but Murphy's acting weird.

62
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,340
More than usual.

63
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,070
Where's this new destination?

64
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,030
It's Fort Collins, Colorado.

65
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,390
What happened to California?

66
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,390
Lab's dark again.

67
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,690
Maybe for good. You've been redeployed.

68
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,150
By whose orders?

69
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,700
Well I started picking up a teletype signal

70
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,240
on the old civil defense frequency.

71
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,940
At first I thought it was a hacker,

72
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,610
but turns out it's Doctor Merch.

73
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,070
Yeah, that Doctor Merch. The one who injected Murphy.

74
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,120
So delivery Murphy to Fort Collins.

75
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,420
Doctor Merch will be there with her team to meet you.

76
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,130
No more California?

77
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,240
Colorado is the new California.

78
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,070
Copy.

79
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,030
Feel better now?

80
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,440
Yeah, a little bit.

81
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,280
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

82
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,560
Try to relax.

83
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,260
How much gas do we have left?

84
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,990
I don't know, half a tank or so.

85
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,860
Make it 150 miles?

86
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,800
Well if it's mostly downhill.

87
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,200
We're real low on ammo too.

89
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,720
Yeah?

90
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,170
We found a taker.

91
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,130
For what?

92
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,140
For you.

93
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,550
What about California?

94
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,390
New orders. We are headed to

95
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,550
a lab in Fort Collins.

96
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,230
Fort Collins? What the hell is in Fort Collins?

97
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,130
Dr. Merch is there waiting for you.

98
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,250
Doctor Merch? Yeah, I got a bone to pick with that bitch.

99
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,330
That bitch is the reason you're still alive.

100
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,440
Define alive.

101
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,650
Well, Murphy.

102
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,630
I think I'm gonna miss your sorry ass.

103
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,180
I appreciate the sentiment.

104
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,690
We logged some miles together, brother.

105
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,940
Amen.

106
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,690
Starting to feel like a damn family.

107
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,930
You know what I'm sayin'?

108
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,050
Uh, I...I don't know if I've actually ever said this to anybody before.

109
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,390
But I...

110
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,720
I almost consider you

111
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,670
a friend.

112
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,270
Yeah, I don't envy you though, man.

113
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,880
I mean, hell, once we deliver you, all bets are off.

114
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,180
They're gonna have more needles stuck in you than

115
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,560
the damn tomato in grandma's sewing basket.

116
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,370
- No, they're...they're just gonna take out my... - Oh, trust me,

117
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,750
they're gonna have some kind of tube or prod

118
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,760
rammed in every spare orifice, or my name ain't Sally.

119
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,970
You know this one time I had a catheter.

120
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,500
Dude, you better hope they don't go that route.

121
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,160
Doc.

122
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,970
What?

123
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,070
How much further?

124
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,260
Uh, I don't know, 65 miles or so.

125
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,090
Anyway,

126
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,820
I'm gonna miss you, dude.

127
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,310
Yeah, right.

128
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,780
How about you, kid?

129
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,910
What do you got planned?

130
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,170
Uh, I don't know.

131
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,700
Still got 6,998 to go.

132
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,280
Might take a break for a while though,

133
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,610
head up north somewhere cold.

134
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,230
The Zs don't fare too well in the cold.

135
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,590
Yeah, I don't fare too well in the cold myself.

136
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:31,920
Roberta?

137
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,200
Uh, I don't know.

138
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,040
Maybe follow the sun west.

139
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,570
I've never been to California.

140
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,930
How 'bout you, Doc?

141
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,630
Maybe I'll buy a boat

142
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,100
and sail around the world.

143
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,700
Find me an island where there's not even a Z in their alphabet.

144
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,670
This must be it.

145
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,800
Citizen Z said look for a metal shed with a roll up door.

146
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,710
Like this one?

147
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,300
What are they all looking at?

148
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,700
Our entrance.

149
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,370
You think we're in the right place?

150
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,810
Looks small.

151
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,780
Let me see your hands.

152
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,320
What?

153
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,840
My hands, why?

154
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,290
Is this a hygiene thing again?

155
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,090
Just let me see them.

156
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,780
What the hell are you doing?

157
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,190
They're looking for a group of civilians

158
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,400
transporting a prisoner.

159
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,490
I don't want anyone mistaking you as a zombie.

160
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,520
Bullshit.

161
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,900
You don't trust me. After all the times I've saved your ass.

162
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,750
Trust has got nothing to do with it.

163
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,360
I don't want anyone piking you after we got you this far.

164
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,100
Let's just get this over with.

165
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,570
Murphy!

166
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,370
How much ammo do we got?

167
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,260
Two bullets.

168
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,760
I got...

169
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,630
one.

170
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,460
One?

171
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,390
I told ya.

172
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,790
Murphy!

173
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,100
What?!

174
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,680
Oh, you want my help?!

175
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,570
Sure,

176
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,470
why not.

177
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,690
Hold your pants on.

178
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,320
Follow me.

179
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,410
How do you know?

180
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,390
I don't.

181
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,600
Don't!

182
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,340
Don't do it.

183
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,460
All right, quick.

184
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,430
Group hug.

185
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,340
What?

186
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,500
Just do it!

187
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
You want to live or not?

188
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,660
Maybe someday you'll learn to trust me.

189
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,760
Man, I hope nobody sees us.

190
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,410
You know before the apocalypse,

191
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,460
I had the same effect on the ladies.

192
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,070
Sure doesn't look operational.

193
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,130
All those zombies up there

194
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,210
must've wanted something down here.

195
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,280
Yeah, but what?

196
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,810
Same thing they always want.

197
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,320
Brains.

198
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,030
No.

199
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,330
Something different.

200
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,580
Something inside is attracting them like a magnet.

201
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,090
I can feel it.

202
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,640
Happy damn birthday.

203
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,560
Uh, reminds me of my 50th.

204
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,710
Happy birthday Doctor Kur...

205
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,040
Dibs on the last rose.

206
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,540
What? I can't help it.

207
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,220
Damn vaccine makes me crave sugar.

208
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,000
Well if you start craving brains, let me know.

209
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,620
Puppies and kittens.

211
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,800
I'll take it from here.

212
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,810
It won't be long now, my child.

213
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,080
Rest.

214
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,430
You are going to a much better place.

215
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,570
Murphy.

216
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,210
Considering the situation...

217
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,180
How did you...?

218
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,760
Pilates.

219
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,960
Here they come.

220
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,160
Come on, let's take cover.

221
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,740
Three thousand and two.

222
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,010
Well I hope that was a zombie.

223
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,410
Incoming at eleven o'clock.

224
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,580
That's all you, kid. I'm out.

225
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,260
Damn.

226
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,430
It's okay, kid.

227
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,060
Remember that time in Missouri at the Piggly Wiggly?

228
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,030
Frozen food section?

229
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,540
Guys? Zombies.

230
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,090
Three thousand and three.

231
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,550
What is that?

232
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,000
It sounds like a phone.

233
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,750
Over here.

234
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,320
There must be 20 text messages here.

235
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,800
Looks like he was texting his wife or somebody

236
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,070
when it went down.

237
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,010
Something happened at the lab today.

238
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,940
Can't talk now. I'll call you later.

239
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,480
Won't be home till late, not telling us why.

240
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,960
Putting us under quarantine.

241
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,000
Will update when I know anything.

242
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,550
Starting to get scared, something very wrong.

243
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,940
Something infecting us. We might not get out of here.

244
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,530
Tell the kids I love them.

245
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,540
What?

246
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,750
This is a new message here from Citizen Z.

247
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,590
Operation Bite Mark. If you get this message,

248
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,800
please respond.

249
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,850
Hacked and searching lab mainframe.

250
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,820
Discovered files you should be aware of.

251
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,360
Really weird stuff.

252
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,830
Find working computer. Search HZN1 test results

253
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,880
backslash backslash code name level nine.

254
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,790
Password, red death.

255
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,090
What was the passcode?

256
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,290
Red death.

257
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,040
Catchy.

258
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,550
Not surprising they were doing animal testing.

259
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,990
Yeah, but what were they testing?

260
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,200
Look at the date on these videos.

261
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,900
It's the year before anybody was infected.

262
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,820
How did they know to be working on a vaccine

263
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,850
before anybody was infected.

264
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,120
What's this?

265
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,350
That's her.

266
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,120
That's Doctor Merch.

267
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,340
That's the bitch that did this to me.

268
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,410
Okay, okay.

269
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,720
Let's start again from the beginning.

270
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,670
Doctor Merch, I just got through telling you.

271
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,150
- Tell me again. - We're just trying to help you.

272
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,210
Don't believe her!

273
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,320
I took the suit off after my shift.

274
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,610
At what time?

275
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,510
15, like I said.

276
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,770
And then what?

277
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,240
Tossed it in the incinerator

278
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,010
and went straight to decontamination.

279
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:56,900
Let's back up a second.

280
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,180
- How many times are we gonna - When you took off your suit,

281
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,370
in what order did you remove your items?

282
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,770
I followed protocol.

283
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,010
Which is?

284
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,610
Boots.

285
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,830
And unzipped my suit.

286
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,130
Removed it.

287
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,660
And gloves.

288
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,970
And then what?

289
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,690
Tossed it in the incinerator.

290
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,660
- And went straight to... - To decontamination.

291
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,140
Did you notice anything different on this day

292
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,660
when handling your samples?

293
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,250
I did as I've always done.

294
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,350
I left the samples exactly where I found them.

295
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,150
Did you come in contact with anything in the lab,

296
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,360
anything sharp that could've punctured your...

297
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,110
I told you this ten times!

298
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,890
Well something happened.

299
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,670
There's no denying it.

300
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,230
Something happened.

301
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,560
The decontamination alarm went off. That's what happened.

302
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,130
That's right.

303
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,520
No, but it's wrong.

304
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,090
That's what needs to be investigated,

305
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,290
why the alarm went off.

306
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,550
That's what we're trying to find out.

307
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:44,530
What form of contamination set off the pathogen alarm.

308
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,390
No. Cause this is a false alarm.

309
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,120
The sensor made an error

310
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,130
because I... I didn't touch anything.

311
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,520
I didn't puncture my suit.

312
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,000
I didn't remove any items out of order.

313
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,160
I followed protocol.

314
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,580
Am I gonna be sick?

315
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,390
Well I'm guessing it didn't end too well for old Doyle here.

316
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,100
Okay, who's for getting out of here right now?

317
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,230
Show of hands.

318
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,090
Okay.

319
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,740
It's back out to the apocalypse it is.

320
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,610
Nobody's going anywhere.

321
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,500
This is not a goddamn democracy.

322
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,210
We came here to find Doctor Merch,

323
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,760
and that is exactly what we are going to do.

324
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,180
He's right.

325
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,900
If she's down here, we just can't leave her.

326
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,110
She is still our only chance at a vaccine.

327
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,670
You're right.

328
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,510
I just thought we might want to,

329
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,720
I dunno,

330
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,090
live.

331
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,420
Yeah, well quit your dreaming and let's go.

334
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,270
When the government abandoned this facility,

335
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,650
they just pulled plug and walked away.

336
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,760
And the Russians did nothing

337
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,520
to secure the bio-weapons they left behind?

338
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,240
This is Kazakhstan now.

339
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,140
There is no money for anything, not even pay policemen.

340
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,930
What happened to all the test animals they were using here?

341
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,190
Who knows?

342
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,950
Maybe destroyed. Maybe set free.

343
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,580
These walls have many sad stories to tell.

344
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:24,090
These fools, they come here to steal copper and titanium.

345
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,750
He's already dead.

346
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,630
Hmmm, he was alive when I found him yesterday.

347
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,590
Why didn't you help him?

348
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,180
I can't be responsible for every vodka-soaked idiot

349
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,070
who comes in here to steal.

350
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,940
Besides, he was already too far gone.

351
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,190
He's of no use to me dead.

352
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,210
But you'll still pay me, my friend.

353
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,970
Help me turn him over.

354
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,390
What are you doing?!

355
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:05,980
Science.

356
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,530
Zombie apocalypse, how may I direct your call?

357
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,570
Operation Bite Mark?

358
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,750
Uh, yeah, what's left of us. This is Doc speaking.

359
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,540
Excellent. Are you all still together?

360
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,680
Correctomundo. Nice to hear your voice.

361
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,420
So what fresh hell awaits us?

362
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,650
According to the operations manual I've hacked into,

363
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,690
you're going to need to go through decontamination.

364
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,800
Well that sounds great to me

365
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,350
cuz I ain't had a decent shower since, let's see,

366
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,550
New York.

367
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,270
Well it's not exactly a shower.

368
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,510
But here's the most important thing.

369
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,500
It is imperative that you decontaminate again

370
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,570
before going back to the surface.

371
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:00,220
This lab is equipped with Defcon One level

372
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,760
quarantine assurance.

373
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,240
Defcon One?

374
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,120
Well isn't that some kind of nuclear term?

375
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,350
In the event of the breach of the quarantine system,

376
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,000
the lab is targeted to be incinerated

377
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,870
by a tactical nuclear weapon.

378
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,580
What am I not surprised?

379
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,600
And there's one other thing

380
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:17,470
about the decontamination process you need to know.

381
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,630
Yeah, what's that?

382
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,560
Naked?

383
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,080
That's what he said.

384
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,570
Naked.

385
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,530
And then we got to put all our clothes and stuff

386
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,590
in this chute here to get decontaminated with some

387
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,280
liquid nitrogen.

388
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,050
So what are we waiting for?

389
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,900
For y'all to turn around.

390
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,500
And no peeking.

391
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,390
Eyes up front, young man.

392
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,420
Sorry. Sorry.

393
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,150
Cassandra, you okay?

394
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,710
I feel like I'm gonna pass out.

395
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,250
You hang in there. Doc, what now?

396
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,250
Oh, we got to put these on.

397
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,200
And...and then you got to

398
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,040
hit that button marked decontamination

399
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,730
in front of you, 10K.

400
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,220
Murphy.

401
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,920
Your scars.

402
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,500
It looks like it's spreading.

403
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,140
That's what I wanted to talk to Doctor Merch about.

404
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,850
Well put your goggles on and quit staring.

405
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,830
I'm not the goddamn elephant man.

406
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,620
I'm a human being.

407
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,900
Sort of.

408
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,160
Are you ready?

409
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,490
Just do it.

410
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,650
Man, I think I fried my gonads.

411
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,300
I shoulda used sunscreen on my junk.

412
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,260
You're okay.

413
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,120
I don't think I can go much further.

414
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,150
I've got her.

415
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,160
I'll carry her if I have to.

416
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,710
Okay. Sure.

417
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,200
Can you see anything?

418
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,370
Hold on, little too dark.

420
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,710
There's some kind of emergency lights flashing.

421
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,270
Dude, it says quarantine.

422
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,530
Can't we just believe them?

423
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,710
What are you, high?

424
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,580
We're infected already, remember?

425
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,440
What is this place?

426
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,250
This isn't a hospital. It's a goddamn hall of horrors.

427
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,460
Hey, look.

428
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,570
Oh my God.

429
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,870
I hope God doesn't know about this.

430
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,110
Cuz if he does...

431
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,630
We should give her mercy.

432
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,640
No. If we open this door,

433
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,000
them flies are gonna be feeding on us.

434
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,240
Over here.

435
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,110
This one's gone. The door's open.

436
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,590
What was it?

437
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,630
Better question is

438
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,040
where'd it go?

439
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,820
Well whatever it is, it's still here.

440
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,430
Shut the...

441
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,040
There's another one.

442
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,300
Murphy. Go talk to them. Do...do that thing you do.

443
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,700
Guys.

444
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,250
These aren't regular zombies.

445
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,250
They're some kind of mutant thing.

446
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,380
I don't think they like me!

447
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,310
Let's go find Merch.

448
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,160
What's he gonna do when he catches up to Merch?

449
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,310
I dunno, but I'm glad I'm not her.

450
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,830
Be ready for anything. Let's go.

452
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,270
This is the patient I was telling you about.

453
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,270
How long has he been like this?

454
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,470
Since the earthquake. Almost...

455
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,820
seven years now.

456
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,770
He was buried under rubble for 21 days and survived,

457
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,360
but has been in this state since his rescue.

458
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,130
Is he responsive at all?

459
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,020
In a strange way.

460
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,990
Can you sit up, please?

461
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,900
He responds to commands

462
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,900
but seems to be completely unaware of his surroundings

463
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,630
and has no will of his own.

464
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,360
Has he ever spoken?

465
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,490
No.

466
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,120
The staff has nicknamed him "The zombie."

467
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,190
Really?

468
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,830
Fascinating.

469
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,410
If you'll excuse me a minute.

470
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,230
Of course.

471
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,990
You can lower your arm.

472
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,350
Turn toward me.

473
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,850
Lie back down.

474
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,610
I can't do it.

475
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,210
Stop.

476
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,370
I can carry you.

477
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,680
You're gonna be okay.

478
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,980
I'm gonna get us all killed.

479
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,920
Please,

480
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,480
Tommy.

481
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,260
Okay.

482
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,690
Just don't tell anybody my name, all right?

483
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,070
I won't.

484
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,150
Is she...?

485
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,690
She's still alive.

486
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,070
What happened?

487
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,410
You can stay here and get some rest.

488
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,870
And we'll come back for you.

489
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,020
Look.

490
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,760
I've been saving this special since New York.

491
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,980
I want you to have it.

492
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,960
Just in case.

493
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,830
Thank you, Warren.

494
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,340
You got it.

495
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,450
You hang in there, darlin'.

496
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,780
We're gonna find you some antibiotics,

497
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,180
and we're gonna get you straightened out in no time.

498
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,380
Thank you, Tommy.

499
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,890
Guys,

500
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,060
come on.

501
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,280
I think I found something.

502
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:24,890
Is she gonna make it?

503
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,510
You might want to say your goodbyes.

504
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:04,710
Let's go.

505
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:08,940
Check this out.

506
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,060
This trail of gore leads to here.

507
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,030
Biocontainment.

508
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,480
Could this place get any creepier?

509
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,280
Yes.

510
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,680
Oh my God.

511
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,330
It's alive.

512
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,010
Is that Doctor Merch?

513
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,530
No.

514
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,970
Somebody else.

515
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,440
It's the lab tech in the video.

516
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,650
He wants us to watch something.

517
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,730
Why are you doing this to me?

518
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,980
It's for your own good, Brendon.

519
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,610
You've started to react to the virus.

520
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,250
Don't give me that shit you've been giving the monkeys.

521
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,670
I've seen the side effects.

522
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,330
We can't take the chance the virus has jumped to humans.

523
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,090
You'll be the first human trial of the vaccine.

524
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,460
We can't wait any longer.

525
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,870
What's gonna happen to me?

526
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,170
We don't know.

527
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,320
Hold him down.

528
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,800
Hold him down!

529
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,260
Hold him still.

530
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,610
And turn off that camera.

531
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,960
The vaccine must have worked.

532
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,550
Kept him from turning zombie.

533
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,630
But it won't let him die.

534
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,870
Did Merch do this to you?

535
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,910
He's trying to say something.

536
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,900
Kill me.

537
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,060
Kill me.

538
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,380
Kill me.

539
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,100
Kill me.

540
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,440
We're getting the hell out of here.

541
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:38,760
You've got company.

542
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,300
Looks like Doctor Merch and two soldiers headed your way.

543
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,710
They should be there any second.

544
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,430
Heads up.

545
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,020
Doctor Merch.

546
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,820
We meet again.

547
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,130
Doctor Merch didn't make it.

548
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,440
I'm her boss, Doctor Kurtz.

549
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,800
I'm here to help you save mankind.

550
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,540
Doctor Kurtz.

551
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,340
Doctor Kurtz. Paging Doctor Kurtz.

552
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,750
Wow. Look at that resume?

553
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,570
Team leader, patent holder, HIV vaccine.

554
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,070
Patent holder, Ebola 2.0 vaccine.

555
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,220
Nobel Prize. Credited with eradication of SARS.

556
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,370
Wow. Somebody made their mama proud.

557
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,230
That's not Doctor Kurtz.

558
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,270
Who the hell is this?

559
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,810
We've gone to a great deal of effort to find you, Mr. Murphy.

560
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,160
I've been on a little road trip.

561
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,510
Well your journey ends here. You're safe now.

562
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,340
And your friends are to be commended for their

563
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,400
bravery and commitment.

564
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:01,470
Your country, all mankind, owes you a great deal.

565
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,300
What's going to happen to him?

566
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,900
Well we'll take him the rest of the way to the lab in California

567
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,860
where we'll sequence his genes

568
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,480
and clone the antibodies in his blood.

569
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,050
Then with any luck,

570
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,950
we'll be able to recreate the vaccine that's keeping him alive.

571
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,770
Doctor... Kurian?

572
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,850
Who are you Doctor Kurian?

573
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,830
Redacted my ass.

574
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,870
What if I don't want to be your guinea pig?

575
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,440
Well then you'll eventually wind up just like Brendon Doyle,

576
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,540
Patient Zero over there.

577
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,200
Speaking of which,

578
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,620
someone should really give that poor creature mercy.

579
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,270
I'll do it.

580
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,530
I'm sorry.

581
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,990
I'm sorry about all of it.

582
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,580
Don't

583
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,590
trust

584
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,190
him.

585
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,520
Don't...trust...him.

586
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,550
I give you mercy.

587
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,190
I'm not going.

588
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,140
Murphy.

589
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,840
This is why we came this far.

590
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,740
Explain to me again why I should believe anything you say.

591
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,630
Let's start with you have no choice.

592
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:50,640
What are you doing?

593
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,750
Just a precaution.

594
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,180
Now just hold on a minute.

595
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,680
Ain't no reason to jump bad. He's just nervous.

596
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,670
Right, Murphy?

597
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,390
He's actually very civic minded.

598
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:09,740
No!

599
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:12,660
Wanted by Interpol for selling bio weapon technology

600
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,070
to North Korea, Iran, Iraq.

601
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:19,180
Under investigation for the development of battlefield hypnotics.

602
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,680
This guy didn't create the vaccine.

603
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,430
Oh my God, I've lead them into a trap.

604
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,490
Delta-Xray-Delta! Do you copy?

605
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,090
Delta-Xray-Delta! Come in!

606
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:33,580
Oh my God! Oh my God! Delta-Xray-Delta! Do you copy?

607
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,410
- Delta-Xray-Delta! - Really, this is so unnecessary.

608
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:37,430
No one's going to harm you, Mr. Murphy.

609
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,880
- Delta-Xray-Delta! - Quite the opposite.

610
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:39,950
Do you copy?

611
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,090
Kill the doctor.

613
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,020
You have to kill the doctor.

614
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,420
Just a zombie.

615
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,630
Give it mercy so it won't attract more.

616
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,510
Zombies can't open doors, can they?

617
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,790
Don't shoot.

618
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,240
She's a zombie.

619
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,180
Mercy her.

620
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,090
I'm not dead.

621
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,970
Kill him.

622
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,740
Murphy, wait!

623
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:57,770
Doc!

624
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,630
Doc.

625
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,430
Doc.

626
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,880
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look at me.

627
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,210
Look at me.

628
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:19,560
Murphy!

629
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,080
Murphy!

630
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,070
You.

631
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,250
You set me up, you bastard.

632
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,940
- You set us all up! - No! No, I didn't.

633
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,900
I had no idea this was gonna happen. I swear.

634
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,580
- You have to believe me. - No, I don't!

635
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:36,270
I don't have to believe anything anyone says ever again!

636
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,720
Especially you!

637
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,850
You have got to listen to me.

638
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,000
You're infected with the virus.

639
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,800
If you attempt to exit the lab

640
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,440
without going through decontamination,

641
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,790
you're gonna set off the fail safe.

642
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,720
And why should I care?

643
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,790
Damn it, Murphy! Listen!

644
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,130
I lost everything!

645
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,010
Including myself!

646
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:50,780
Murphy.

647
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,500
A tactical nuclear weapon will be launched from NORAD

648
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,880
to incinerate the lab.

649
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,920
If you go up, you will kill everyone there,

650
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,610
including Warren, Doc, and the others.

651
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,160
Do you read me?

652
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,980
Murphy, do you read me?

653
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,070
Murphy!

654
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,330
Murphy! I did not set you up. Do you copy?

655
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:20,550
Murphy!

656
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,590
Fail safe activated.

657
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,560
Fail safe activated.

658
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,930
Seven minutes to detonation.

659
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,190
Come on, Doc.

660
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:47,960
Doc.

661
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,300
Get up, Doc.

662
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,070
Come on, Doc.

663
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,480
Six minutes to detonation.

664
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,440
Wake up, Doc.

665
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,450
Come on Doc.

666
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:30,920
Get out of here!

667
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,210
- Get out of here! - Wake up, Doc.

668
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,370
- Now! - Wake up, Doc.

669
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,320
Get out of here now!

670
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,100
Five minutes to detonation.

671
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,360
Come on.

672
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,070
What the hell is happening?

673
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,700
Holy crap.

674
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,360
They must be third strike weapons on a dead man switch.

675
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,800
What is wrong with us?

676
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,420
Four minutes to detonation.

677
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,770
Where are you headed?

678
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,010
Get the door.

679
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,530
Three minutes to detonation.

680
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,040
Look.

681
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,060
What is it?

682
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:12,500
Is that all that's left of Murphy?

683
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,650
It's his skin.

684
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,750
He shed his skin.

685
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,350
Keep it.

686
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,280
Make some awesome boots out of that.

687
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,230
Where's Murphy?

688
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,540
Where's the van?

689

1
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,880
The Cape of Good Hope.On Africa's southerly tip.
好望角 位于非洲南端

2
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,430
Here two great seas meet,
两大洋在这里汇合

3
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,960
one,the warm Indian Ocean,
一个是温暖的印度洋

4
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,820
the other the chilly Atlantic.
另一个是寒冷的大西洋

5
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,180
And as they mingle,so they create a billowing cloak
在两大洋汇合之下,风起云涌

6
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,340
that drapes the summit of Table Mountain.
桌山之巅雪雾缥缈

7
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,600
Spectacular though this is,
景色如斯壮丽

8
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,665
the mountain's cloudy covering is only a hint of the profound influence
其实暗示着...

9
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:28,910
that these two very different oceans have on the fortunes of life here.
两大洋对区内生态的深远影响

10
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,040
And not just here at the Cape
不只限于好望角

11
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,000
but across the length and breadth of Southern Africa.
而是整个非洲南部

12
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:55,190
好望角

13
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,050
解说人:大卫・艾登堡

12
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,270
Two thousand miles north from the Cape,
好望角以北2000英里之外

13
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:09,450
beneath this sandy beach,new life is stirring.
在这沙滩下,新生命蠢蠢欲动

14
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,006
Hundreds of baby green turtles emerge like a torrent,
数以百计的小小绿海龟

15
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:31,250
from the safety of their nest.
从安全的龟巢涌出

16
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,000
Each one,just seven centimetres long,
每一只身长不过7厘米

19
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,850
但现在疾走100米冲下沙滩 must make a hundred－metre sprint down the beach.

17
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,960
From the moment they hatch,
从孵化一刻开始

18
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,640
they're driven by an instinctive urge to run to the sea.
它们便受本能驱使,向海洋奔去

19
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:30,950
Few creatures start life with the odds for success so heavily stacked against them.
很少生物一出世便遇上如此大敌

20
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,380
Yellow billed kites.
黄嘴鸢

21
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,490
Pied crows.
非洲白颈鸦

22
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,150
But so many of these hatchlings appear together,
但由于大量小龟同时涌现

23
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,730
that predators can't catch them all.
掠食者一时应接不暇

24
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,810
Last out,this baby might seem doomed.
最后离巢的小龟似乎难逃一死

25
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,490
But struggling out late could just give her a chance.
但押后现身又可能反而有生机

26
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,600
The crows seem insatiable.
非洲白颈鸦似乎怎么吃也不饱

27
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,340
Even those that reach the sea aren't safe.
就连游进海里的小龟也不能幸免

28
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,720
This female has to make a dash for it.
这只雌龟要急急逃命

29
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,660
She's still in danger and not just from above.
危机仍在,而且不只来自天空

30
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,390
A Ghost crab may be smaller than the hatchling,
鬼蟹体形虽然小于小龟

31
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,820
but it has the strength to drag her into its lair.
但有力把它拖入蟹窝

32
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,310
Not this time.
今次落空了

33
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,670
At last, the sea.
终于到了大海

34
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,810
She has to catch a breath if she's not to drown,
它必须吸口气,才不至淹死

35
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,450
but the pounding waves make it desperately difficult.
但在海浪冲击下,很难做到

36
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,050
Beyond the surf,calmer water,
在碎浪带之外,海面较为平静

37
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:50,070
but even here the hatchling is not out of danger.
但就算在这里,小龟仍未脱离险境

38
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,320
She dives.
它向下潜

39
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,630
Just in time.
及时逃过大难

40
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,550
Only one hatchling in a thousand will survive to adulthood,
每千只小龟只有一只可以长成

41
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:41,490
but if she does,she may live for 80 years.
成功的话,可以活到80岁

42
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,200
For now,the ocean is there to be explored.
现时,整个海洋任它闯荡

43
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,040
As the hatchling disappears into the deep blue,
小龟消失在深海之中

44
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:10,070
she swims into the waters of one of the planet's most powerful currents:
它游进了地球一大洋流:

45
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,870
the Agulhas.
阿加勒斯海流

46
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,020
The Agulhas sweeps south towards the Cape,
阿加勒斯海流向南流往好望角

47
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,840
transporting a hundred billion gallons of warm water every day.
每天输送1000亿加仑暖水

48
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,130
These tropical seas are so warm,
热带海洋温度甚高

49
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,230
they evaporate on an enormous scale.
大量的海水蒸发

50
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,000
Water vapour rises until at altitude it cools
水蒸气上升,然后在高空冷却

51
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,600
and condenses into clouds.
凝成云层

52
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,990
As the clouds drift inland,,
云层飘向内陆

53
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,310
they bring rain to one of the least explored corners of our planet.
为一个荒僻角落带来雨水

54
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,510
The mountains of Mozambique.
莫桑比克山脉

55
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,700
This the wettest place in Southern Africa.
这是非洲南部雨水最多的地区

56
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:55,710
Decades of civil war have kept travellers away from this little known land.
数十年内战,令外人难以踏足

57
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,320
It was satellite mapping
全靠人造卫星测绘

58
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,170
that revealed the full extent of the forest that grows here,
揭露这大片森林的全貌

59
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,530
so now it's known to outsiders as the "Google" rainforest.
所以外界把这里称为Google雨林

60
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,010
It could also be called the butterfly forest.
这里也可以称为蝴蝶林

61
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:27,370
After the rains,butterflies have emerged together in huge numbers.
在雨后,大批蝴蝶聚集

62
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,442
As soon as their wings dry out,
翅膀干了之后,

63
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:31,220
they will take to the air.
便振翅高飞

64
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,640
Their goal,to find a mate.
它们志在求偶

65
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,740
But how?
但怎进行呢?

66
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,460
There may be thousands close by but the foliage is so thick,
附近可能有成千上万的同类

67
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,330
it's difficult for them to find each other.
但树木浓密,不容易遇上

68
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,720
They have a remarkable solution.
它们有个别开生面的解决办法

69
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,800
They follow rivers upstream and travel to higher ground.
它们沿河流而上,往高处飞去

70
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:19,260
The journey can take hours of determined flying.
可能要坚定不移地飞行多个小时

71
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,690
Eventually,they emerge into the only open space there is.
终于它们到达唯一的空旷地方

72
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,750
The treeless peak of Mount Mabu.
没有树木的麻布山顶峰

73
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,990
Up here,free from the confines of the forest,
在山顶,它们不再受制于雨林

74
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,820
they hold a butterfly ball.
便举行蝴蝶舞会

75
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,230
Now the butterflies have all the space they need for their aerobatic courtship.
这里有空间施展杂耍式的追求大法

76
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,580
The male's strategy is simple:
雄蝶的策略很简单:

77
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,660
fly higher and faster than the competition
只要比对手飞得更高、更快

78
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,350
and just maybe you'll win a virgin female.
便有机会夺得美蝶归

79
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:45,770
This spectacular gathering unseen by outsiders until now,
外界首次有缘目睹这种美丽聚会

80
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,920
happens for just half an hour each morning
每年只有短短数星期时间

81
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,110
and for just a few weeks in the year.
在早上出现半个小时

82
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:07,250
Once mated,the females descend back to the rainforest to lay their eggs.
雌蝶交配后,便飞回雨林生蛋

83
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,394
A forest that only exists,
而雨林之所以存在

84
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:16,580
because of moisture rising from the warm Agulhas current,
皆因数百英里外的印度洋

85
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,440
hundreds of miles away in the Indian Ocean.
有个温暖的阿加勒斯海流带来湿气

86
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:53,800
The rainwater now flows southwards from Mozambique's highest peaks,
雨水从莫桑比克山巅向南流动

87
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,150
to the lowlands of the Eastern Cape.
到达好望角东部的低地

88
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,315
And where the land flattens,
土地渐渐平坦,

89
00:14:02,315 --> 00:14:03,420
rivers slow,
河水速度减慢

90
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,290
creating a vast swamp 50 miles across.
形成一个宽50英里的大沼泽

91
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,170
This is Gorongosa.
这里是戈龙戈萨

92
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,140
Here all kinds of creatures come to catch fish.
各种动物都跑来捕鱼

93
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,830
Whiskered catfish work as a team.
长须鲶鱼分工合作

94
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,182
They take a gulp of air at the surface and then belch it out underwater,
它们在水面吸气,在水底喷出

95
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:50,760
to create a net of bubbles.
形成一团气泡

96
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,470
And that traps little fish.
把小鱼困住

97
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,550
There are fish for everyone.
这里鱼量丰富,谁也不愁吃

98
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,920
And each species has its own technique for catching them.
每种动物各有一套捕鱼大法

99
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,070
It's all very well having a big beak but you've still got to know how to use it.
有个大喙是好事,但也要善用

100
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,640
This young pelican has a lot to learn,
年轻的鹈鹕尚要好好学习

101
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,370
and not long to do so.
而且时间无多

102
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,240
Maybe,like the catfish,teamwork is the answer.
或者要学鲶鱼一样分工合作

103
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,520
It's certainly working for the flock
鹈鹕群似乎大有收获

104
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,460
and this pelican seems to be getting the hang of it.
年轻鹈鹕似乎开始掌握到窍门

105
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,620
But surely,he can't swallow that catfish?
但它只怕吞不下这尾鲶鱼吧?

106
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,690
Trying to was a mistake.
它太冒进,犯了大错

107
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,820
The rainwater,briefly held in Gorongosa's swamp,
在戈龙戈萨沼泽短暂停留的雨水

108
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,470
has now been enriched with silt and sand.
带着肥沃的淤泥和沙土离开

110
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,720
这些堆满沉积物的河[Sandian] All down this coast, sediment－laden rivers,

109
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,400
the Zambezi,the Limpopo,the Save
赞比西河、林波波河、萨韦河

110
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,840
drain back to the sea,
缓缓流回大海

111
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,170
and there they meet the Agulhas current.
与阿加勒斯海流汇合

112
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,340
And what happens to all that sand?
大量的沙土跑往哪里呢?

113
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,770
Over the millennia,the Agulhas has worked it
经过阿加勒斯海流冲刷了千百年

114
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,240
into a complex underwater landscape.
形成错综复杂的海底环境

115
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,710
This vast sand sculpture is the Bazaruto Archipelago,
这片大沙土名为巴扎鲁托群岛

116
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,840
the oldest of its kind in the world.
历史最悠久

117
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:33,570
It may look like paradise but living here is not easy.
看来似天堂,其实不易居

118
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,866
For a hundred thousand years,the Agulhas Current
阿加勒斯海流造成的沙暴

119
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:53,760
has battered these submerged dunes with underwater sandstorms.
在10万年来不停冲击这些水底沙丘

120
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,820
But where the water is deep enough to escape these storms,
但在不受沙暴冲击的深水处

121
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,930
nutrients carried from Africa's interior
凝聚了来自非洲内陆的养份

122
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,960
fuel an explosion of life.
万物欣欣向荣

123
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,150
A rare oceanic hunter rules here.
这里有位罕见的海洋猎者

124
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,890
Giant kingfish.
珍

125
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,240
As big as a man and weight for weight,
体形大如男子

126
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,940
one of the most powerful fish in the sea.
是最孔武有力的海鱼之一

127
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,610
Despite their size,they're extraordinarily agile when hunting.
虽然体形大,猎食时十分敏捷

128
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,560
Normally, kingfish are solitary,
珍通常孤单独行

129
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,730
but for just a few weeks each year,
但每年有三数星期

130
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,180
they gather at places like Bazaruto
便在巴扎鲁托这类地方聚集

131
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,460
and prepare for an extraordinary journey.
准备踏上不寻常的旅途

132
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,970
One that will take them far inland.
行程会深入内陆

133
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,490
The Mtentu River.
丹图河

134
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:08,220
The king of kingfish leads them upstream.
珍之王带领鱼群往上游

135
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,940
As they travel further into freshwater,
它们游进淡水的水域

136
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:19,930
they seem to change from aggressive hunters into dedicated pilgrims.
似乎不再是猎者,而是虔诚朝圣者

137
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,060
Now,many miles from their natural home,
它们远离自然栖息地

138
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,610
and in response to an unknown cue,
在某种未明朗的呼召下

139
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,610
they stop and begin to circle.
它们停下来、并开始旋转

140
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,850
Other marine fish that migrate upriver
其他迁徙至上游水域的海鱼

141
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,870
usually do so in order to breed,
通常志在繁殖

142
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,350
but there's no evidence that these kingfish spawn up here.
但珍没有留下产卵的迹象

143
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,910
Neither do they hunt.
它们也不猎食

144
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,990
So,what are they doing?
那么,它们在做什么?

145
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,810
In truth,the purpose of this strange behaviour is still unknown.
事实上没人知道这奇异行为的目的

146
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:32,170
Within a few weeks,they will retrace their journey back to the ocean.
数星期之内,它们便折回大海

147
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,710
The lives of kingfish,
珍的生命

148
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:46,190
like those of turtles and butterflies and pelicans,
就像海龟、蝴蝶、鹈鹕一样

149
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,090
are influenced by the Agulhas Current.
受到阿加勒斯海流影响

150
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,420
But that influence can only reach so far,
但海流的影响力也有一定局限

151
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,120
and this is why.
原因就在这里

152
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,660
The Drakensberg Mountains.
德拉肯斯堡山脉

153
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:24,670
Here,local people say that the vultures soar so high,
本地人说这里的兀鹫可直冲云霄

154
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,380
they can see into the future.
看到未来

155
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,900
These sheer cliffs,rising to over 3,000 metres,
这些峭壁耸立在3000米之上

156
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,350
hold back the advancing rain clouds
挡住了雨云的去路

157
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,380
and as a result,the land beyond them is starved of water.
于是山脉以外的土地便缺水

158
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,310
This is the greatest expanse of sand in the world.
这是世上最大的沙漠

159
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:21,990
A seemingly endless desert that is the vast parched centre of Southern Africa.
一望无际的荒漠,在非洲南部中心

160
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,290
Thousands of miles to the west,
往西数千英里外

161
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:38,140
where this desert meets the Atlantic Ocean,
沙漠与大西洋接坏之处

162
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,450
another current prevails.
有另一股海流

163
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,430
But the Benguela Current,surging up the west side of Africa,
但这股在非洲西面的本格拉海流

164
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,070
has a very different character.
却有截然不同的特性

165
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,320
It's extremely cold,full of nutrients
它是一股寒流、养份丰足

166
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,920
and it's thronged with life.
水域内生机蓬勃

167
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,960
A great white shark.
大白鲨

168
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,810
They can raise their body temperature
它们可以把体温提高

169
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:21,480
to 10 degrees above that of the surrounding sea.
比周围的水温高出10度

172
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:30,730
但需要动用大量高级燃料 But doing so requires an enormous amount of high－grade fuel.

170
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:40,470
So,this is a great bonanza for them,the body of a dead whale.
所以鲸尸是受欢迎的大餐

171
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:53,070
The carcass will draw in every great white for miles around.
鲸尸把周围的大白鲨都引来

172
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:59,560
And here,off Cape Town,that means a lot of sharks.
而开普敦对外水域有很多鲨鱼

173
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,630
Instead of feeding in a frenzy,
它们不是疯狂抢食

174
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:16,180
these sharks have rather refined table manners.
这些鲨鱼十分讲究餐桌礼仪

178
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:30,920
它们肩并肩游过,互相较量体型 They swim side－by－side to get the measure of each other.

175
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,640
Then,each takes its turn.
然后大家轮流进食

176
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:46,610
This female is the biggest so she eats first.
这尾雌鲨体形最大,所以先吃

177
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,930
The next only feeds when she gives way.
等它让路,下一尾才开始进食

178
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,280
The waters of the Benguela are so rich,
由于本格拉海流的水域养份丰富

179
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:57,690
they support more great white sharks than any other seas on the planet.
大白鲨数量冠全球

180
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,800
And they are so cold,
而且海水冰冻

181
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:15,210
they attract some surprising creatures to these African shores.
一些难得的访客也被引来非洲海岸

182
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,230
Penguins.
企鹅

183
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,470
African Penguins.
非洲企鹅

184
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,180
This female is returning to relieve her partner.
这只雌企鹅回来接替配偶

185
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,110
Of course,there's no ice here
这里当然没有冰

186
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:44,150
but these rocks can be almost as slippery.
但岩石也几乎一样湿滑

187
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:23,120
But there are more serious obstacles than the slippery rocks awaiting them.
除了湿滑岩石,还有更大的障碍

188
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,970
It's his turn to feed
现在轮到雄企鹅觅食

189
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:39,450
so he leaves her to look after their eggs.
它把照顾鹅蛋的责任交给雌企鹅

190
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,860
Now,she must tackle a problem faced by no other kind of penguin.
雌企鹅面对的问题与其他企鹅不同

191
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:59,560
For the next 10 days,she must protect her eggs from the African sun.
未来10天它要替鹅蛋摭档非洲烈日

192
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:18,100
A dense coat of feathers that keeps her warm in cold seas now stifles her.
可抵挡冰洋的厚羽毛令它透不过气

193
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,830
On these exposed rocks,
在露天的岩石上

194
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:26,990
she must shade her eggs instead of keeping them warm.
它替鹅蛋挡开阳光,不需要保温

195
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,070
Everything here seems the wrong way round.
这里的情况似乎完全反常

196
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:53,340
For some,the soaring temperature is too much.
有一些企鹅熬不住高温

197
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,540
A neighbour deserts his nest.
有位邻居弃巢而去

198
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
His egg will not survive.
它的蛋肯定死路一条

199
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,530
He's not the only one to give up,
它不是唯一的逃兵

200
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,710
some years,not a single chick is reared.
有些年头,一只幼企鹅也孵不出来

201
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:43,260
Penguins are adapted to withstand temperatures of 40 degrees below zero
企鹅适应零下40度的低温

202
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,670
not 40 degrees above.
熬不住40度高温

203
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:05,620
Now,at the hottest part of the day,the very worst time,
就在最炎热、最艰难的时刻

204
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,820
her chicks are hatching.
雌企鹅的蛋开始孵化

205
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,610
Just when they need her most,
就在幼雏最需要它的时刻

206
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,900
she's reaching the limit of her endurance.
它到了容忍的极限

207
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,020
After 10 days of intensive fishing,
企鹅爸爸专心捕鱼十天

208
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:44,110
the chicks' father comes back to take his turn at the nest.
现在回来鹅巢当值

209
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,600
But will he be too late?
但会否来迟一步?

210
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:08,800
He greets his young for the very first time.
它第一次见到自己的子女

211
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,410
The coolness of the Benguela Current brought the penguins here
本格拉海流是寒流,所以引来企鹅

212
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:28,480
but that very coolness is a great disadvantage
但寒凉的特性也带来不利

213
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,340
because it generates little rain.
因为雨水少

214
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:42,040
It can,however,produce moisture in a different form.
不过海流以另一方式制造湿气

215
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:52,280
A thick blanket of fog rolls in from the sea
厚厚的雾从海洋卷入

216
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:56,100
and condenses on this thirsty land.
在这片缺水的土地上凝聚

217
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:09,050
And each year,the desert bursts into life with a dazzling display.
每一年,沙漠都会突然百花齐放

218
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:21,250
Water is so scarce that this show will not last long
由于缺水,花卉展览并不长久

219
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,440
so plants compete to attract their pollinators,with colour.
植物必须努力色诱动物来传播花粉

220
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:42,600
Here in Namaqualand,a 600-mile strip of coastal desert
纳马夸兰是长600英里的海岸沙漠

221
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,760
becomes carpeted with blooms.
这里繁花似锦

222
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,580
The morning sun opens a Namaqua Daisy
纳马雏菊迎着早晨的阳光开花

223
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:09,130
and reveals a male monkey beetle asleep inside.
原来有只雄性猴甲虫睡在花内

224
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:17,954
Nights here are so cold
由于晚上太冷

225
00:35:17,955 --> 00:35:22,410
that monkey beetles shelter within the closed up petals of the daisies.
猴甲虫躲在雏菊合上的花瓣内避寒

226
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,680
The habit brings benefits to both sides.
这个习惯对双方都有好处

227
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,730
The beetle is kept warm and the flower gets pollinated.
猴甲虫可保暖,花粉又可以传播

228
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:41,250
But now the beetle has urgent business.He must find a mate.
但现在它有件急务: 求偶

229
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,790
As he searches,he hops from bloom to bloom pollinating each in turn.
寻觅期间,它在花间跳跃传粉

230
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,770
At last,he spots a potential mate.
终于它找到对象

231
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,750
A golden princess.
金黄的公主

232
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,060
But here comes trouble.
但麻烦来了

233
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,240
A rival.
有对手

234
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,410
There's no time for introductions.
没有时间谈情说爱了

235
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:40,330
But he's been too slow.
但它动作太慢了

236
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:50,360
The rivals immediately begin to brawl.
情敌相遇,立即打斗起来

237
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:58,420
The female will only mate inside the daisy
雌猴甲虫只在雏菊内交配

238
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,040
so they wrestle for possession.
所以它们要抢夺有利阵地

239
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,852
They're so engrossed in fighting,
它们只顾打斗,

240
00:37:21,852 --> 00:37:23,870
they've pushed her off.
把雌性推了下去

241
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,610
The challenger is ejected.
挑战者被赶走

242
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,810
The winner wastes no time before getting back to business.
胜利者立即继续办正事

243
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,440
At last!
终于得偿所愿!

244
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:38,150
Now,there will be a new generation of monkey beetles
现在又有了新一代的猴甲虫

245
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,250
to pollinate these Namaqualand flowers.
为纳马旁蔺的花朵传播花粉

246
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,950
For most of the year,
年中大部分时间,

247
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,610
this land is desperately dry
土地都极度干旱

248
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:59,260
but just occasionally,brief,violent storms sweep in from the cold ocean.
但偶有短暂的暴风从冰冷海洋刮来

249
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,900
Springbok have been roaming this desert for many months,
跳羚在沙漠上游荡了数月

250
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:19,990
searching for one of these rare and highly localised downpours.
追寻难得、只在局部地区落下的雨

251
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:46,200
The grass is sprouting.
草正开始发芽

252
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,930
And that is worth celebrating.
实在值得庆祝!

253
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:08,065
If you're a springbok,
如果你是跳羚,

254
00:40:08,065 --> 00:40:09,970
that means pranking.
便会跳跃起来

255
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,260
We still don't know exactly why they do this.
我们仍未知道它们因何这样做

256
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:43,430
The simplest answer is that they're dancing for joy.
最简单的解释是: 它们跳舞作乐

257
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:07,820
Africa's most southerly tip.
非洲的最南端

258
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,250
This is where the two great ocean currents,
温暖的阿加勒斯海流

259
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:15,120
the warm Agulhas and the cold Benguela,
和寒冷的本格拉海流

260
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,130
crash into one another.
在此交汇

261
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:26,680
And this collision in itself draws in life in abundance.
吸引了大量生物聚集

262
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:45,390
A super pod of hunting dolphins 5,000 strong.
由5000只海豚组成的大猎队

263
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,410
And shadowing them,
而跟在后面的...

264
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,270
Africa's biggest predator.
是非洲最巨大的掠食者[Sandian]

265
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,980
A Bryde's whale.
布氏鲸

266
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:17,010
This female is 15 metres long

267
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,640
and weighs more than a whole family of elephants.
比整个大象家族更要重

268
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:37,930
The dolphins are in pursuit of sardines,millions of them!
海豚在追踪数以百万计的沙丁鱼

269
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:43,230
But these cold water fish are heading towards
这些冷水鱼正游向...

270
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:46,070
an impenetrable barrier of warm water
难以越过的暖水区

271
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:50,180
that they will not cross,the Agulhas Current.
是它们不会越涡的阿加勒斯海流

272
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,010
They're trapped.
它们被困了

273
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,490
And that gives the whale her chance.
于是鲸鱼的机会来了

274
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,600
But the sardines are so speedy
但沙丁鱼身手敏捷

275
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:29,230
that the whale only catches a few with each pass.
鲸鱼每次只能捕捉三数尾鱼

276
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,620
More and more hunters arrive.
越来越多猎者到场

277
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:52,680
The whale needs the other hunters to push the fish upwards,
鲸鱼需要其他猎者帮忙

278
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,260
forcing them against the surface.
把沙丁鱼迫近水面

279
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,670
Now,they have nowhere to escape.
现在它们再也无路可逃

280
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:28,310
With each lumbering turn,she loses precious time,
鲸鱼转身缓慢,损失宝贵时间

281
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:31,300
time that favours the more nimble.
这样对敏捷的对手比较有利

282
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,550
The Bryde's whale probably knows
布氏鲸可能知道

283
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:55,760
that this opportunity will last less than five minutes
这个机会只持续不足5分钟

284
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:59,870
and with the last few lunges,
它再猛扑数次,

285
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:01,790
she finally cashes in.
终于可以开怀大嚼

286
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:59,080
The forces that triggered this great event have also shaped the fortunes
除了在这个战场引发这壮观场面外

287
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,460
of life far beyond this particular battleground.
海流的动力也影响了远处的生物

288
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:09,380
Without these currents,Southern Africa would be a desert.
没这些海流,非洲南部便变成荒漠

289
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,495
But combined,the very different powers of the Agulhas and the Benguela
但阿加勒斯和本格拉两大海流发功

290
00:47:19,496 --> 00:47:24,540
have transformed the Cape into a land where life can flourish.
把好望角变成生机蓬勃的好地方

are a haven for green turtles.
是绿海龟的天堂

293
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:02,370
Every year,a million turtles hatch on these beaches,
海滩上每年都有上百万只小海龟孵化

294
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:07,590
but the chances of any one of them surviving is tiny.
但它们的个体生存率却极低

295
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,390
The Africa team came here to try and capture the dramatic
摄制组的任务是前来拍摄

296
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:23,540
first few minutes in the lives of these baby turtles.
小海龟们出生时那戏剧性的一幕

297
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,870
It was to be both a technical,
那不仅是对摄影技术

298
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:29,140
and surprisingly emotional challenge.
也是对情感的一次挑战

299
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,350
It's only when you get down on the eye level of the baby turtle
只有当你站在小海龟的视角

300
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,180
that you realise what an enormous journey it's got to make
你才能意识到  爬出沙滩

301
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,510
down over the beach,and it really is quite epic.
是场如此浩大的史诗般旅程

302
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:52,560
That's fine.Oh,yeah,that's lovely.
好的  真可爱

303
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:56,160
It's using all these complicated,heavy bits of equipment
借助这些复杂且沉重的设备

304
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,830
which hopefully will enable us to get into the world of

a turtle which is just a few inches long.
只有几英汲さ男『９

306
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:14,670
As they break out of all the soft sand,they hit the hard sand
它们先爬过软沙滩  后爬上硬沙滩

307
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:16,610
and that's where the real sprint takes place.
然后它们开始全力冲刺

308
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,130
They must be desperate to hit that water,
它们一定迫不及待地希望进入海中

309
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,990
because you can see the sea's just over the horizon.
因为你可以看到大海就在地平线处

310
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,400
We're following them all the way down
我们一直跟随着它们

311
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:26,710
and you do kind of get involved with them and cheering them on.
情不自禁地为它们加油打气

312
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,310
OK,slow down a bit.Slow down.
慢一点  放慢速度

313
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:37,810
And suddenly all these crows come flocking in
突然  乌鸦成群结队地飞来

314
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:39,460
and start picking them off
开始将它们一个个叼走

315
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:42,470
and you just think,that's just so unfair.
你会觉得太不公平

316
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,160
Lots more coming in.Just loads coming in now.
乌鸦越来越多  铺天盖地地飞落下来

317
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,400
I do,God,I feel for them.
天呐  我很难过

318
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,870
You know it's really quite upsetting
那太令人苦恼了

319
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:54,830
and particularly when you're looking through the camera
特别是当你全身心将镜头

320
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:58,080
and I'm just filling frame with a turtle running down the beach,
聚焦着一只奋力爬出海滩的小海龟

321
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,290
then suddenly from nowhere,
突然不知从哪儿

322
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:01,800
a beak comes in and whoosh,that's it.
伸出一只鸟嘴  完了

323
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:05,270
That turtle's no more.
小海龟没了

324
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:14,170
The turtles that escape the perils of the beach
小海龟们逃脱了海滩上的危机

325
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:17,530
still have to face pounding surf.
接踵而来是海浪的重击

326
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:26,470
But,at last,they're in their element.
但最终它们如鱼得水般获救

327
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,910
More than can be said for the crew.
对摄制组而言就没那么幸运了

331
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:36,410
－它们游得比你快  对吧  －是的 － They're faster than you, aren't they?  － Yep.

328
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,750
It's a bit embarrassing.
有点难堪

329
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:42,110
Beaten by something that's less than a day old.
被出生未够一天的小东西打败了

330
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,630
When you see hatchlings get off the beach and going in the white water,
当你看着小海龟离开沙滩  游入泛白的海水

335
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:50,230
休・米勒 摄影师

331
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:50,230
you'd think they'd just get obliterated.
你会以为它们被海水吞没了

332
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,140
They just punch through the water; they do get flung around
它们努力划水  不停被水流冲击

333
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,550
but then they just right themselves,
但它们很快调整了姿态

334
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:00,560
keep on swimming and they're ahead of you,
继续游  并且游在你前面

335
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,570
coming out the back of the wave
最后出现在海浪的背面

336
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:04,700
and it's amazing.
那太神奇了

337
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:08,270
You're seeing all these baby turtles getting picked off,
小海龟被海浪冲得失去了方向

338
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:11,220
left,right and centre,but they just keep going.
左右晃动  但它们从未停止前行

339
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,590
They are just so resilient.
它们迅速就恢复了活力

340
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:23,610
And that made what happened next so distressing.
但接下来发生的事着实令人悲痛

341
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,160
A particularly high spring tide flooded the beach.
一波超高的海浪涌上沙滩

342
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,120
Any baby turtles still in their nests
尚被埋在巢穴深处的小海龟

343
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,130
would be lucky to survive.
能否幸存就得看运气了

349
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:39,400
－瞧  水中冒着泡泡  －是的 － See it bubbling out as well. － Yeah.

344
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,880
It means that basically anything below that line's going to be gone.
那意味着水位线下的所有东西都将被海水带走

345
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,624
Let's hope and pray it's not,
让我们祈祷不会...

346
00:51:46,624 --> 00:51:46,850
but...
但是...

347
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:50,900
As you say,we don't know,let's wait and see.
正如你所说的  让我们拭目以待吧

348
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,410
All across the world,turtles are in decline.
全球海龟数量正在减少

349
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:06,050
Their eggs are stolen,
龟蛋被偷

350
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:08,670
the adults are hunted for their flesh
捕捉成年龟作肉食

351
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:11,180
and they drown in fishing nets.
它们自己则常常陷落渔网

352
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:16,070
But here in the Comoros,they have friends.
但在科摩罗  幸有救星在

353
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:19,280
It's amazing here in Itsamia.
伊兹米亚真是个伟大的地方

354
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,840
It's just a really heartening story of
此处上演着温暖人心的故事

355
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,720
how the local people are doing everything they can
当地人都竭尽全力

356
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,670
to protect sort of what they think of as their turtles.
用自己的方式来保护海龟

357
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:33,190
And some of the baby turtles have survived the flood tide.
使有些小海龟在涨潮中幸免于难

363
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,770
我已经在巢里

364
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:37,990
找到了两只小海龟

365
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,780
如果我们保住了巢

366
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,810
就帮它们离开

367
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,780
这里是我的村子

368
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,840
我得保护这些小海龟

369
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,770
和成年龟

370
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:58,760
那是为了我们所有人

358
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,230
The whole village comes to help the hatchlings.
所有村民都会帮助这些刚孵化的小家伙们

359
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:08,390
But the most important effort is to protect the adults
但最重要的是保护成年海龟

360
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:11,610
from outsiders who would hunt them for their meat.
不被外人猎杀取肉

361
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:18,270
They've taken it upon themselves to really police the beaches around here
他们主动承担保护沙滩的责任

362
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:21,390
and make sure that poaching is kept to a minimum.
将非法偷猎行为减到最低程度

363
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:27,670
The selfless protection these people provide means
那些人提供的无私保护

364
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:29,940
that this is one of the few places in the world
使得这里的海龟数量成为

365
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,670
where turtle numbers are actually increasing.
全球少有出现增长的地区之一

366
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:38,900
And remarkably,here in Itsamia,
最棒的是  在伊兹米亚

367
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:43,080
the population has in fact doubled in the last decade.
海龟数量在过去10年中翻了一番

368
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,430
As the shoot was coming to the end,
在拍摄即将结束时

369
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:54,010
cameraman Kevin Flay noticed that
摄影师凯文・弗莱注意到

370
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:59,310
some of the turtles that made it through the surf faced one last danger.
成功越过海浪的小海龟 面临最后一道考验

371
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:01,870
I'm getting shots of a kite which is flying down
我拍到一只鸢飞下来

372
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:04,200
and taking turtles off the water surface.
从海面上将小龟叼走

373
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:07,700
That was a part of the story we had to tell.
那情景我们必须呈现

374
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:16,050
The aim is for us to be underwater,looking straight up as this happens,
当拍摄鸢飞来抓小海龟时 镜头需由水底往上瞄准

375
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:20,170
and that's actually really quite hard.
其实还挺有难度的

376
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:25,470
OK. Three, two, one...
好  3  2  1

377
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,400
Undeterred,the crew got into position.
摄制人员各就各位 迎难而上

378
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:38,250
There we go,the kite's up.
来了  鸢起飞

379
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:53,340
You can't see where you're going
我看不见前进方向

380
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,160
because my head's glued to this viewfinder,
因为我的头和取景器连在一起

381
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:58,170
so I'm banging into rocks and things like that.

Something came in then.

because we got our lovely underwater shot of a kite

and sustain this conservation work.

then it's got a chance of success.

This baby turtle won't touch land again

To survive here,life is stretched to its very limits.

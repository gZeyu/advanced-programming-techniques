你得把我们从这鬼地方弄出去  你听到我说的了吗
You get us the hell out of here! You hear me?!

75
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,050
这道门撑不住的
This gate won't hold them.

76
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,410
你尽可能拖住他们

77

然后你就撤回研究所  明白了吗

成千上万的人不明原因的死去

这些人的死会帮助我们找到疫苗

说的好听  你自己怎么不来试试
Yeah, well why don't you take it then, huh?

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,160
现今没有多少祖母能活这么大岁数了
Not many grandmothers left these days.

146
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,870
尤其是像娜娜这样高寿的
Especially as old as Nana was.

147
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,620
她到底多大岁数了
How old was she anyway?

148
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,900
六十三岁
Sixty-three.

149
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,030

六十四岁
Sixty-four.

151
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,360
我还没死呢
And I'm not dead yet.

152
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,110
不过  我觉得是时候可以去见上帝了
But I think it's time.

153
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,840
你们都出去吧
You can all go now.

154
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,050
你把她的东西拿来了吗
Do you have her special?

155
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,810
剩下的就交给我吧
I'll take it from here.

156
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,070
准备好了吗  娜娜
Ready, Nana?

157
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,060
废话  我当然准备好了
Hell yes I'm ready.

158
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,110
我已经在这糟糕的世界上活得够久了
I've had enough of this stinkin' world.

159
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,270
索非亚·克里斯蒂娜·格里斯沃尔德
Sofia Christina Griswold.

160
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,870
借助这件圣礼
With this eight sacrament

161
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,830
我将给予你的灵魂永恒的宁静
I commit your soul to eternal peace.

162
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,210
我仁慈地结束你的生命
I give you...mercy.

163
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,930
*那条美丽的河*
*The beautiful beautiful river*

164
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,870
*我们与圣人相聚河边
*Gather with the saints at the river*

165
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,890
河水从上帝的宝座下流过
*That flows by the throne of God*

166
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,190
加内特呼叫沃伦
This is Garnett to Warren.

167
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,750
加内特呼叫沃伦  完毕

168

169
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,970
我在水边了  请求后援
I'm at the water's edge, could use a little backup.

170
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,470
给我两分钟时间
Two minutes.

171
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,230
这是什么
What is it?

172
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,740
我猜这是个求救信号
I guess a distress signal?

173
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,450
你打算怎么处理它
How do you want to handle it?

174
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,210
我关注他们有一段时间了
Been watching them for a while.

175
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,180
目前我看只有两个男人
As far as I can tell it's just two males.

176
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,320
先看看他们什么来路吧
Let's see what they want.

177
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,920
若情况不妙  再打发他们回去
Can always turn them back around.

178
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,210
奶奶的送终会怎么样了
How did Nana's Eighth go?

179
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,650
不错  都是些好人
Very good. Good people.

180
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,740
谢谢帮忙  我只是...
Thanks for doing it. I just...

181
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,740
下不了手了...做过太多次...
can't anymore. Too many...

182
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,370
没事  她准备好上路了
It's okay. She was ready to go.

183
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,120
大家不都一样吗
Hmmm. Aren't we all.

184
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,860
他们来了
Here they come.

185
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,330
这样吧  我过去招呼他们
All right. I'll handle the meet and greet.

186
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,960
你在这里掩护我
You cover me from here.

187
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,710
要是感觉不对头  你直接趴下
Any problems, you hit the ground.

188
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,550
剩下的就交给我来解决
I'll take care of the rest.

189
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,520
就到这吧  先生们
That's far enough, gentlemen.

190
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,710
上报身份  来自何方  所为何事
Identify yourselves and state your business

191
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,000
狙击手小分队已经将你们包围
Team of snipers has you covered

192
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,320
所以别耍什么花样
so no sudden moves.

193
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,550
马克·哈蒙德中尉  来自三角洲部队
Lieutenant Mark Hammond. Delta Force.

194
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,140
我是说  如果三角洲部队还存在的话
Or least I was when there was still a Delta Force.

195
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,090
我效力于临时政府  在执行任务
I'm on a mission from what's left of the government,

196
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,090
需要你们的援助
and I need your help.

197
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,140
什么任务  哪个政府
What mission? For what government?

198
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,610
坦白说  我也不知道
Look, to be honest I don't know

199
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,980
给我下达命令的人是否还在世
if anybody that gave me the order is still alive.

200
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,240
但我确定的是  我必须把此人
I do know it's imperative that I get this person

201
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,000
送到加利福尼亚的医学实验室
to a medical lab in California.

202
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,170
而且要活的
Alive.

203
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,570
意思是我暂时不能开枪了
Well I guess I won't shoot him Yet.

204
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,480
他是谁
Who is he?

205
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,870
什么神医吗
Some kind of doctor?

206
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,830
不能这么说
Not exactly.

207
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,880
他叫摩菲
His name is Murphy.

208
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,970
这个人也许是人类获救的最后希望
And he may just be the last best chance to save humanity.

209
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,800
亲爱的  你好  是我
Hello, baby, it's me.

210
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,070
现在有空陪我聊几句吗
You got time to talk?

211
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,080
拜托  我的小心肝
Come on, sweetie.

212
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,220
对你我当然有时间了  你知道的
I always have time for you. You know that.

213
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,080
我只是想知道
I just wanted to know

214
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,040
这个圣诞节你回不回来
if you're gonna make it home for Christmas

215
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,370
你答应过我回来的
like you promised?

216
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,170
黛西  我还不能确定
Daisy, I just don't know.

217
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,800
这里的工作太忙了
Things are pretty busy up here.

218
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,260
你和你的高度机密们
You and all your top secrets.

219
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,400
就不能给我让出点时间来吗
Can't they give you some time off?

220
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,910
你不来  大家会失望的
Everybody's gonna be so disappointed.

221
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,840
我知道
I know.

222
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,650
我答应你  我很快回家
But I'll get home soon, I promise.

223
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,150
牛仔怎么样了
How's Cowboy?

224
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,160
他很好
He's fine.

225
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,430
他把你的另一双鞋也咬烂了
He chewed up another pair of your shoes.

226
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,820
有时候我觉得他比我还要想念你
Sometimes I think he misses you more than I do.

227
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,360
虽然听起来不太可能
If that's possible.

228
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,630
你看到新闻上关于华盛顿的报导了吗
Hey, did you see that stuff on the news about Washington?

229
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,250
太疯狂了  对吧
That's crazy, huh?

230
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:27,980
北极光阵地

北极光阵地

威尔森山  北极光阵地收到

实验室已经沦陷

236
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,140
马克已经撤离原有位置

请汇报三角洲X光小队的位置

241
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,090

威尔森山
Mount Wilson.

246
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,400
我们只需要一些供给必需品
All we need are some basic supplies

247
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,990
然后再把我们送到塔潘齐桥
and transportation south as far as the Tappan Zee bridge.

248
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,960
在那边我们会与新队伍会和
We're meeting a new team there, and they can take us

249
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,090
然后他们会带我们去加利福尼亚
the rest of the way to California.

250
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,420
加利福尼亚  路途相当遥远啊
California sure is a hell of a long way.

251
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,630
塔潘齐桥也够远的
The Tappan Zee bridge is a long way.

252
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,490
要不是我束手无策
I wouldn't ask, but it's imperative

253
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,780
也不会跑来求你们帮忙
and I am out of options.

254
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,620
你是怎么找到这里来的
How'd you find out about this place?

255
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,980
在来的路上经过一个监狱
An ex-cop and some others taking shelter in a prison

256
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,200
听里面一个退职警员和几个人说的
twenty clicks up the road said

257
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,900
国民警卫队建立了庇护所
there was some National Guard

258
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,020
建立了一个营地  他们也许能帮到我们
that set up a camp, might be able to help us out.

259
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,310
是前国家警卫队
"Ex" National Guard.

260
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,990
是的  我曾在佐治亚国家警卫队服役过
Yeah, I was with Georgia National Guard.

261
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,990
沃伦就是从密苏里逃出来的
Warren here was evacuated out of Missouri.

262
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,290
但据我所知  我们是这片地区仅剩的幸存者
But as far as I know, we're the only ones left of our unit.

263
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,210
听着  我知道现在指挥系统已完全失效
Look. I know there's no more chain of command,

264
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,250
警卫队  政府都已不复存在
no more Guard, no more government.

265
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,140
只剩下我们这几个人还在执行命令
Just a few of us out there following orders

266
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,210
因为这就是我们的职责
cuz that's what we do.

267
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,530
到现在为止  我已经失去了八个最亲密的战友
I lost eight of the best men I ever served with getting this far.

268
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,650
我收到的命令是把这个人带到加州的实验室
My orders are to take this man to a lab in California,

269
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,170
这就是我所要做的
and that's what I intend to do.

270
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,480
现在
Now.

271
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,850
你们到底要不要帮我
Are you people going to help me or not?

272
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,760
这人他妈的有什么重要
Why is he so goddamn important?

273
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,660
他带有的信息
He has information vital to

274
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,610
对制造抵抗僵尸病毒的疫苗至关重要
the development of a vaccine for the zombie virus.

275
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,380
我能说的就只有这些了
And that's all I can tell you.

276
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,800
您们还想要知道什么
How much more do you need to know?

277
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,560
我和沃伦可以用卡车送你到塔潘齐那边去
Warren and I can take the pickup truck, bring you to the Tappan Zee.

278
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,110
但那之后你就得自己走了
But you'd be on your own after that.

279
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,430
我要求的就只有这么多
That's all I'm asking.

280
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,830
如果不停地赶路
Well if we keep it moving,

281
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,650
今天天黑之前我们就可以回来了
we can get there and back before nightfall.

282
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,690
我可不敢承担失去卡车的风险
I'm not sure we risk the truck.

283
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:57,970
也不敢失去你们俩
Or you two.

284
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,280
也许我说得还不够清楚
Maybe I haven't been clear.

285
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,250
这件事比你们的卡车重要得多
This is more important than your trucks.

286
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,890
也比任何人的生命都要重要得多
Or anyone's life.

287
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,150
包括我自己的生命
Including my own.

288
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,630
我不想动武逼你们
I don't want to have to insist.

289
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,010
我在两天前就应该已经到集合地点的
I was supposed to meet my rendezvous two days ago.

290
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,970
这件事一定要完成
This needs to happen.

291
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:21,750
立刻
Now.

292
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:30,880
听着
Listen.

293
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,040
如果他们想要偷卡车
If they're trying to steal the truck,

294
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,340
做你该做的
do what you got to do.

295
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,240
当然
Always.

296
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,320
保持无线电联络
Stay in radio contact.

297
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,410
如果明天早晨之前还得不到你的消息
We don't hear from you by tomorrow morning,

298
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,740
我们会来找你的
we'll come lookin'.

299
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,620
日落之前他们就能回来了
You'll have them back by sundown.

300
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
如果你只想要充足的弹药供给
Well if availability of ammo is all you care about

301
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,670
选这种22号来复枪就没错了
then the 22 is the way to go.

302
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,760
但是  如果你真想让人眼前一亮
But... You really want to make an impression,

303
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,980
就试试这把手枪吧
check out this smoke wagon.

304
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,760
用这个来结果僵尸是最合适的
You really make a z's day with this.

305
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,680
22号来复枪的确能杀死僵尸
Now the 22, that'll kill a z,

306
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,100
但是你得开两三枪
but it's gonna be about two or three shots

307
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,370
才能把它彻底放倒
before the thing's down and dead.

308
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,320
而这个小家伙
This baby?

309
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,070
一枪就能干翻一辆车
You stop a car with this.

310
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,460
我想要点更安静点的东西
I was thinking something more silent.

311
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,970
比如棍棒
Like a club.

312
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,180
或者锐器什么的
And sharp.

313
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,490
有  有
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

314
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,120
我喜欢你的想法  安静又高效  对吧
Yeah, I like how you think. Silent but effective. Huh?

315
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:28,980
很好
Okay.

316
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,310
瞧瞧这个
Check this out.

317
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,130
我自己做的
Made it myself.

318
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,770
我叫它僵尸重击
I call it "The Z Whacker."

319
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,340
从一根铝棒开始
You start with an aluminum bat

320
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,640
亲手改装它
then customize it for the task at hand.

321
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,910
真轻
Wow. It's light.

322
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,800
证实  这些尖钉是我亲手用啤酒瓶磨出来的
Yeah, the spikes are hand cast from beer cans.

323
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,210
它足够长  能够击碎僵尸的大脑
So they're long enough that they kill the brain

324
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,390
还能顺利地抽出来
but you can still pull it out.

325
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:52,420
因为没有什么比武器卡在僵尸的脑子里更糟糕了
Cuz nothing is worse than getting your pike stuck into a z's skull.

326
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,970
那样的话你就必须得把僵尸拖到地上
Cuz then you got to drag them down to the ground.

327
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,170
用脚踩住它们的胸膛
You got to put your foot on their chest.

328
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,200
还要使劲把武器抽出来
Then you got to yank the thing out.

329
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,440
完成之前你早就没命了
And by then you're dead.

330
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,330
你懂我的意思吧
You know what I mean?

331
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,020
这种事的确很烦人
Sure do hate that.

332
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,720
我们以物易物怎么样
How about a straight across trade?

333
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,330
一打阿司匹林
A dozen of these aspirin

334
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,560
换一打223号枪用的弹药
for a dozen of these reloaded .223's.

335
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,240
阿司匹林又不能杀僵尸
You can't kill a zombie with aspirin.

336
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,270
那发烧也不能用子弹降温啊
Well you can't kill a fever with a bullet

337
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,050
而且他们都不生产阿司匹林了
and they ain't making any more aspirin.

338
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,890
改成一打奥施康定[止痛药]就成交
Make it a dozen oxycontin and you got a deal.

339
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,130
那我得先吃一打奥施康定
I'd have to take a dozen oxycontin

340
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,450
才能来做这个交易
before I'd make that deal.

341
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,850
冰毒怎么样
How 'bout some meth?

342
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,120
你想要冰毒吗
Huh? You want some crystal?

343
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,680
我自己做的
Yeah, I baked it myself.

344
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,260
跟你之前做的粉色冰块一样吗
That same pink ice you made before?

345
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,990
不要  那东西让我脑袋疼得差点炸了
No, that stuff gave me an axe to the skull headache.

346
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,830
别啊  这不是有阿司匹林吗
No, that's what the aspirin's for.

347
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,110
你那里还剩几剂吗啡
How many ampules of morphine you got left in there?

348
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,050
你后面
Behind you.

349
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,900
不错  你没事吧  差一点啊
Nice. You all right? That was a little close.

350
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,130
是啊  这个  这个速度很快
Yeah, that... that was a fast one.

351
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:43,990
够野蛮
Brutal.

352
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,100
就是说嘛
Told ya.

353
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,480
那不是红毛汉森吗
Hey, isn't that Red Hanson?

354
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,220
僵尸咬了红毛
Z's got Red?

355
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,930
见鬼  他是我们最好的顾客之一
Damn, he was one of our best customers

356
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,250
比子弹还坚强的人
tough as bullets.

357
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,350
我在想他兄弟们知不知道
I wonder if his brothers know.

358
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,410
我觉得他们知道  因为他们来了
Yeah, I think so cuz here they come.

359
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,070
打烊了
Closing time.

360
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,190
看那个大块头的行动方式
The way that big one moved

361
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,660
肯定是几小时前才刚变异
he must have turned just a few hours ago.

362
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,410
四个兄弟  近期变异
Four brothers, recently turned,

363
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,520
在萨特农场旁的米勒路上发现
found on Miller's Road by Sutter's Farm.

364
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,710
慈悲为怀  疫情爆发第三年五月十三日
Given mercy, May 13, 3 A.Z.

365
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,530
该走了
Time to go.

366
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,560
这边有一个
I got something over here.

367
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,620
看来是冲上来的浮尸
Looks like a floater washed up.

368
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,740
这边又有一个
I got another one over here.

369
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,730
这个看上去也死透了
This one looks dead and down too.

370
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,260
唐纳
Donner.

371
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,960
看
Look.

372
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,090
这得有几百个
Must be hundreds of them.

373
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,710
蓝天营  我是机动一号
Camp Blue Sky, this is mobile one.

374
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,660
蓝天  我是机动一号  完毕
Blue Sky, this is mobile one. Over.

375
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,010
各位  我需要你们的回应
Hey guys, I need you to get back to us.

376
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,090
现在是下午八点的信号检查时间
It's time for our 8 p.m. signal check.

377
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,670
你们还在浪费什么时间
What are you wasting time for?

378
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,910
你们自己说他们会没事的
You said yourself they'd be fine.

379
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,460
肯定发生了什么事
Look, there must be something wrong.

380
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,850
如果待会还是没有回应  那我们得回去
If we don't hear from them soon, we're gonna have to go back.

381
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,800
我不认为我会让你们这么做
I don't think I can let you do that.

382
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,390
如果我的人有事
If something is wrong with my people

383
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,050
我才不管你的什么狗屁任务
I don't give a damn about your mission.

384
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,780
亦或是你
Or you.

385
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,480
我们回去
We're going back.

386
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,240
听着
Look.

387
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,360
我很欣赏你们对朋友的忠诚  真的
I appreciate your loyalty to those folks. I do.

388
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,170
但你们不像我一样了解这个男人
But you don't know what I know about this man.

389
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,550
我们为什么要相信你的话
Why should we believe a word you say?

390
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,220
下车
Get out of the car.

391
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,390
给他们看
Show them.

392
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,140
让他们看看为什么你这么重要
Show them why you're so damn important.

393
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,510
别碰我
Get your hands off me.

394
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,300
让他们看看为什么牺牲了那么多好人
Show them why so many good men died

395
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,310
就为让你走到这里
getting you this far.

396
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,150
让他们看看
Show them!

397
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,630
发生什么事了
What happened?

398
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,330
这些都是僵尸咬的
Those are Zombie bites.

399
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,150
八个僵尸
Eight of them.

400
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,960
为什么他还活着
Why is he still alive?

401
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,290
而且还不是僵尸
And not a zombie?

402
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,110
被咬之前  他刚打了唯一一支
He was given the only dose of an experimental vaccine

403
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,530
试验阶段的疫苗
right before he was bitten.

404
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,650
那些半死不活的杂种咬掉了我这里的两根肋骨
Those undead bastards got two of my ribs right there.

405
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,570
闭嘴
Shut up.

406
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,820
至少你还活着
At least you're still alive.

407
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,550
这话我可没法跟我的人说
More than I can say for my men.

408
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,330
在你们面前的是唯一已知的被僵尸咬伤之后
You're looking at the only human known to have survived

409
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,930
还能活下来的人
being bitten by a Zombie.

410
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,010
他的血液里有ZN1病毒的抗体
His blood carries the antibodies for the ZN1 virus.

411
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,440
如果我们能把他送到加利福尼亚的实验室
If we can get him to the lab in California

412
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,460
他们就能用他的血造出更多抗体
they can use his blood and make more of the vaccine.

413
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,420
求救求救  呼叫蓝天营
Mayday. Mayday. Calling Camp Blue Sky.

414
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,130
我是多克  和汤姆森和卡弗一起
This is Doc. With Thompson and Carver.

415
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,480
你那边情况如何  完毕
What is your situation? Over.

416
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,410
嗨多克  怎么了
Hey, Doc. What's going on? What's going on?

417
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,390
加内特吗  谢天谢地你们还活着
Garnett? Thank God you're alive.

418
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,920
我们以为所有人都死了
We thought everyone was dead.

419
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,690
我不在蓝天营  发生什么事了
I'm not at Camp Blue Sky. What's happening?

420
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,260
电量不足了
Batteries... dying.

421
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,040
等等  在说一遍
Wait. Say. Again.

422
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,540
蓝天营被僵尸肆虐了
Blue Sky has been overrun.

423
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,460
整个营地被大火吞噬了
The whole place is...on fire.

424
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,530
有生还者吗
Survivors?

425
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,760
之前有猛烈的枪声  但现在停了
Well there was a ton of gunfire a while ago, but nothing since.

426
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,170
来吧  我们走
Come on. Let's go.

427
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,110
那有一辆逃生巴士
Oh... There's the escape bus.

428
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,920
他们救出了孩子  太好了
Oh, they got the kids out. Okay.

429
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,140
快点
Come on.

430
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,850
上车
Get in!

431
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,100
快点走
Go! Go! Go!

432
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,480
有幸存者吗
How many more?

433
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,130
没有
Nobody.

434
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:02,880
没有嘛
Nobody?

435
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
没有  我确定
Nobody! I'm sure!

436
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,320
唐娜  马里昂呢
Donna? Marion?

437
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,310
死了  无人幸存
No...there was no one.

438
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,960
都没办法对其"施以仁慈"
Not even time to show any of them mercy.

439
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,780
无人幸存  只有僵尸
There's nobody back there but z's.

440
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,560
对不起大家  我们尽力了
Sorry guys. We tried.

441
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,640
不能为他们做什么  只求上帝怜悯
Nothing left for them now but God's mercy.

442
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,010
该走了  快点
It's time to go then. Come on.

443
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,830
我不知道为什么要带上他们
I don't know what we brought them along for.

444
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,120
因为他们也是人
Uh...because they're human beings

445
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,700
他们有权活着
and they deserve to live.

446
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,180
离集结地还有多远
Hey... how much further to this rendezvous?

447
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,520
不远了
Just a few more clicks.

448
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,690
我希望有十倍的
Got some vehicles and a team of killers waiting.

449
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,120
汽车和杀手在那等着
Wish I had ten times that.

450
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,320
前面应该向左走
Should be up ahead on the left.

451
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,990
旧中学的地下室里有民防设施
An old high school with a civil defense shelter in the basement.

452
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,290
应该还剩下些补给品
Supposedly there's still some rations left there.

453
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,880
你最后一次联系他们是何时
When was the last time you made contact with them?

454
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,680
大概一个月前
About a month ago.

455
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,190
一个月前吗
A month ago?

456
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,750
那相当于两年末世一般[圣经启示录]
That's like two years Apocalypse time.

457
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,750
{\an8}纽约沉睡谷咬痕研究所集合点

458
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,090
回到车上
Get back in the truck.

459
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,390
是他们吗
Is it them?

460
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,570
哈蒙德
Hammond?

461
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,510
是他们吗
Is it them?

462
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,330
是的
Yeah.

463
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,180
我要小便
I got to pee.

464
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,610
别走远
Don't go far.

465
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:47,770
别担心
Don't worry.

466
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,390
这人真是...
This guy.

467
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,180
我的后援全军覆没了
My reinforcements are dead.

468
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,410
我们要快速寻找幸存者和供给
We need to make a quick search for survivors and any supplies.

469
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,400
你
You!

470
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,720
拉上拉链  跟紧我
Zip it up and stay close to me.

471
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,760
僵尸都去哪了
Hey, where'd all the z's go?

472
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,750
走了  就像蝗虫一般
Movin' on, like locust.

473
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,220
是的  但他们会回来
Yeah, but they'll be back.

474
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,280
加内特和沃伦  你们查看大楼
Garnett and Warren, you clear the building.

475
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,110
你们三个检查车辆
And you three check the vehicles.

476
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,510
他们看似毫无反击之力
Looks like they never had a chance.

477
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,550
你听见没
You hear that?

478
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,950
什么
Hear what?

479
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,730
那里
There.

480
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,100
听起来像是个...  婴儿
Sounds like a...baby.

481
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,580
糟糕
Oh shoot.

482
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,090
在这里
There it is.

483
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,850
没关系的宝贝
Hey, it's okay sweetie.

484
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,460
我们带你离开着
We're gonna get you out of there.

485
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,400
司机怎么样
How's that driver?

486
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,040
死了  变异了吗
Dead. Turned?

487
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,430
她好像朝脑袋开了一枪
Looks like she took a blow to the skull.

488
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,360
爆头而死
Brain dead on impact.

489
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,770
来吧
There you go.

490
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:07,770
嗨  麦克
Hey, Mack.

491
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,860
好的  我懂
Yeah, I know.

492
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,140
是活生生的宝宝
Whoa. It's a real live baby.

493
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,110
几年来我都没见过一个
I haven't seen one of these in years.

494
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,260
他还哭个不停
And he won't stop crying.

495
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,360
我该拿他怎么办
Here. What do I do?

496
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,520
-放着我来  -好
-Maybe don't. -Okay.

497
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,700
得像拿着点燃的手榴弹那样抱他  给我吧
Hold him like he's a live grenade. Just give him to me.

498
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,700
我对孩子没经验
Me and babies, not so much.

499
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,970
她带着个孩子在这里干嘛
What was she doing out here with a baby anyway?

500
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,940
不清楚  看来他们是来防空洞避难
I dunno. Looks like they were headed to this shelter.

501
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,450
跑昏头了
They got overrun.

502
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,850
我们带着孩子要怎么行动
What the hell are we gonna do with a baby?

503
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,020
不知道  这几年来我一直事到临头才做打算
Beats me. I stopped planning two minutes ahead years ago.

504
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,460
小心
Heads up.

505
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,960
他们争先恐后个什么劲
What are they after?

506
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,660
还不就是那个  上吧
Only one thing. Come on.

507
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,540
你还好吗
You all right?

508
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,100
小心  她可能已经死了
Careful. She might be dead.

509
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,380
她没死
Well she ain't dead.

510
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,470
没事了  没事了  我们是好人
Hey. It's okay. Hey. It's okay. We're good people.

511
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,590
我们刚才救了你
We just saved you.

512
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,740
行了  别伤着他
Okay, don't hurt him.

513
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,560
抱歉  我不知道自己在哪里
Sorry. I didn't know where I was.

514
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,040
我肯定是睡着了
I must have fallen asleep.

515
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,320
睡着了
Asleep?

516
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,960
你在这个笼子里待了多久
How long you in this cage for?

517
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,560
两天
Two days.

518
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,170
来个人快让这孩子闭嘴
Somebody better shut that kid up

519
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,870
否则要招来一群僵尸了
before he attracts z's like flies.

520
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,570
他是个孩子  哭闹很正常  好吗  
It's a baby. He makes noise, okay?

521
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,460
闭嘴  你  尽量哄哄他
Shut up. And you, do what you can.

522
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,910
关于僵尸的事他说的没错
He's right about the z's.

523
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:22,970
给
Here.

524
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,960
为什么会有人把你关在笼子里不管你死活
Why would somebody lock you in a cage and leave you to die?

525
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,790
你做过什么了
What did you do?

526
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,190
我什么也没做过
I didn't do anything.

527
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,980
我把自己锁在笼子里是为了自保
I locked myself in the cage for protection.

528
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,140
你有钥匙吗
You have the keys?

529
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,650
找不着了
I lost them.

530
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,300
你为什么穿成这样
Why are you dressed like that?

531
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,430
我用不着为自己辩白
I don't have to justify myself.

532
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,580
你一定要
Maybe you do!

533
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,140
我们本该在车队那里见人的
We were supposed to meet the men in those vehicles.

534
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,510
发生什么了
What happened here?

535
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,710
那伙人是一个礼拜前出现的
Those men showed up about a week ago.

536
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,070
他们遣走了学校里的人  并扎了营
They cleared out the school and set up some kind of camp.

537
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,840
有消息说这里储存了食物
But word got out that there was food.

538
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,210
防空洞里有很多
Lots of it from the bomb shelter.

539
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,060
但食物没能维持太久  人太多了
Yeah, it didn't take long. There was too many people.

540
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,860
士兵射杀了一些当地人
The soldiers shot some of the locals,

541
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,570
尸体招来了那群僵尸
and that brought the z's.

542
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,770
剩下的你也猜到了
You can guess the rest.

543
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,260
还在这里和她废什么话
What are we wasting time talking to her for?

544
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,360
把孩子给她  我们走吧
Give her the baby, and let's go.

545
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,580
你不能把孩子交给这姑娘就走
You can't give this girl a baby and leave.

546
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,330
那他们也不能跟我们走
Well they can't come with us.

547
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,110
听着
Listen.

548
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,370
我绝不会抛下孩子和她一走了之的
No way am I leaving the baby and her behind.

549
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,830
绝不可能
It's not gonna happen.

550
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,840
孩子而已
It's just a baby.

551
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,850
又不是要看他长大成为社会栋梁
It's not like he's gonna grow up and be a fine young man someday.

552
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:33,800
你们  都给我闭嘴
You know what, shut up!

553
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,840
我们会把他们带到下一个安全点
We'll take them to the next safe outpost.

554
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,520
天  我最恨僵持不下
God, I hate moral dilemmas.

555
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,670
接下来做什么  队长
Yeah what's next chief?

556
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,100
你还想给他开设一个学院基金吗
You wanna start a college fund for him?

557
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,270
伙计们  两百码开外
Puppies and kittens. 200 yards away.

558
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,890
有僵尸
Zombies.

559
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,160
行了  大伙  该行动了
All right, everybody. Time to go.

560
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,190
你们四个  我要你们拿来一切能找到的食物和武器
You four, i want you to grab all the food and weapons you can find.

561
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,290
锁到卡车里  钥匙还在里面
Load them in that truck. The keys are still inside.

562
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,570
我们还没谈过怎么分配任务
Hey! We haven't talked about this.

563
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,490
我们大可以稍后再谈
We can talk about it later.

564
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,510
现在我说什么你就照办
Right now you do what I tell you.

565
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,000
加内特

566
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,160
我们回来之前你跟孩子还有摩菲一块儿待着
You stay with the baby and Murphy until we get back.

567

沃伦

568
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,180
你跟我去看看是否能先解决那几个倒霉鬼
You and I are gonna see if we can start up that deuce and a half.

569
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,490
五分钟后全体回来集合
Everybody meets back here in five.

570
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,430
动起来
Go!

571
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:26,290
行动
Go.

572
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,170
好了
All right.

573
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,280
你现在想怎么处理
How you want to handle this?

574
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,470
我们通常会带上家伙去干掉它们
We usually like taking it to 'em.

575
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,810
长官
Sir.

576
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,720
好吧  就这么办
All right. Let's do this.

577
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,600
悄悄的
Silent.

578
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,260
先生  注意孩子
Hey, mister! Baby.

579
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,120
孩子终于闭嘴了
The kid finally shut up.

580
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,830
你躲开
Get away from there.

581
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,710
躲开
Get away from there.

582
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,020
你干嘛这样
What the hell did you do that for?

583
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,990
摩菲
Murphy.

584
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,180
过来
Get over here.

585
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,120
快点
Go.

586
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,290
你还好吗
You okay?

587

我挺好的
Yeah, I'm great.

588
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:48,540
孩子呢
Baby?

589
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,850
他很虚弱  但还撑着呢
He's weak, but he's hanging in there.

590
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,610
给
Here.

591
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,360
谢谢
Thanks.

592
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,650
天啊
Oh God.

593
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:21,610
杀了他
Kill it.

594
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,050
我不行
I can't.

595
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,210
我做不到
I can't do it.

596
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:27,820
你做得到
Yes, you can.

597
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,670
不  你来
No. You do it.

598
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:31,030
不  我可不想  你必须干掉他
No, I don't want to do it. You got to kill it.

599
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,490
你们在等什么
What's the holdup?

600
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,390
孩子呢
Where's the baby?

601
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,440
尸变了
Turned.

602
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,140
好意外  好意外
Surprise. Surprise.

603
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,060
放开他
Let him go.

604
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,810
否则我让你也变成僵尸
Or I will send you to walk among the dead.

605
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,530
上车吧
Let's get in the trucks.

606
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,190
我们得走了
We're moving out.

607
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,590
那个小孩怎么办
What about the... the baby thing?

608
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,950
我们不能就这么走了
We can't leave it like that.

609
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:24,650
是啊  她说得对
Yeah, she's right.

610
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,760
虽然他已经尸变了
Even if it is turned.

611
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,560
要杀他真让人难过
It sounds so sad.

612
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,900
一点也不难过  他是僵尸
It's not sad. It's a zombie.

613
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,540
阿门  兄弟  快离开这吧
Amen brother. Let's go.

614
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,180
我们不能就这么走了
We can't leave it like that.

615
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:34,600
我来动手
I'll do it.

616
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,850
还是我来吧
I'll do it.

617
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,590
我要你恢复状态
I need you to pull it together.

618
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,950
两分钟
Two minutes.

619
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,380
准备好动身
Be ready to go.

620
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,050
过来  宝宝

621
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,800
过来  小宝宝
Here baby-baby.

622
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,580
到爸爸这来
Come to papa.

623
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,840
如果我们要抛下他们
If we wanted to ditch these two

624
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,150
上车逃跑
take the truck and run

625
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,290
现在正是时候
now would be the time.

626
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,000
我就那么一说
Just sayin'.

627
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,370
我看到你的小贱屁股了
Oh I see your little bitch-ass.

628
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,930
知道吗  如果那时丢下孩子走了
You know, non of these would happen

629
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,980
这一切就都不会发生了
if you'd just left that damn baby.

630
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,880
我可没让哈蒙德把自己送给孩子吃掉
I didn't tell Hammond to go get eaten by a baby.

631
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,450
现在别再想那些了
Never mind that now.

632
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:00,850
我们得制定个计划
We need a plan.

633
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:03,630
我的计划就是  我要开着这辆卡车
My plan is I'm taking this truck

634
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,700
忘记什么疫苗啊  实验室啊
and I am forgetting about vaccines and labs

635
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,970
还有所有你们这些人
and all of you.

636
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,970
我从一开始就不想掺合这件事
I wanted off this train from day one,

637
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,050
现在我的机会来了
and now's my chance.

638
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,900
等等  等等  你不能就这么一走了之
Wait-wait-wait. You can't just go.

639
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,890
去加州的事怎么办  疫苗怎么办
What about California? What about the vaccine?

640
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:20,010
万一是真的呢  万一是个机会呢
What if it's real? What if there's a chance?

641
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:20,950
如果是你  会怎么样
And what if it's you?

Addy.

643
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,780

How do we know this isn't all just bullshit?

644
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,720
所有人都没有任何头绪
How does anybody know anything anymore?

645
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,610
三角洲X光小队
Delta-Xray-Delta.

646
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:29,410

What the hell is that?

647

00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,900
就像在玩《虐杀丧尸》
Season tickets to the Zompocalypse.

707
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,370
我要告诉你们
And I got to tell you people,

708
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,470
尽管我们这一战有所损失
we've been getting our asses kicked.

709
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,880
但是  从今天开始事情将有所改观
Well today's the day that all that changes.

710
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:30,310
是的  我将不再袖手旁观
That's right. I'm not just watching anymore.

711
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:33,370
是时候给僵尸们致命一击了
It's time to kick some zombie ass.

712
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,820
你们现在收听到的是由宽频  低频
This is Citizen Z broadcasting

713
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,310
甚高频  超高频  天网直播的市民Z广播
live via broadband, low band, vhf, uhf, skynet.

714
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:40,130
如果你们接收到了信号  你们就能找到我
If you can get a signal, then you can find me

715
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,210
感谢我们的国家安全局合作伙伴
thanks to our friends at the NSA.

716
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:46,820
现在我需要收到你们任何人的回应
Now all I need is somebody, anybody, everybody to get back to me

717
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,010
就像开始任务时那样  只要你们还活着
cuz that's how it starts. If you're still alive,

718
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,010
你们可能就是某些...
you're probably some kind of...

719
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,710
可能天生就是某些捣蛋鬼
some kind of genetically predisposed badass.

720
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,650
我们现在需要的
And all we got to do is

721
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:56,770
就是团结在一起绝不给僵尸们机会
get organized and the zombies don't stand a chance.

722
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,840
现在我在据你们三千英里的家乡
Now here's a little something for all of you out there

723
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,990
为你们送上祝福
with 3,000 miles of bad road between you and home.

724
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,260
希望你们能听到
I hope you can hear it.

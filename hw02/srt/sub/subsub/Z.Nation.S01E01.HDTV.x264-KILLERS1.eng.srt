{\an8}{\pos(150.4,193.188)}.

19
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,430
This is a worldwide alert.

20
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,680
Standby for important information

21
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,630
Quarantine.

22
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,330
The president is dead.

23
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,160
This is an extinction scale event.

24
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,290
Do not panic.

25
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,560
Three years after the first infection,

26
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,830
national governments have fallen.

27
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,230
There is no cure.

31
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,230
Go!

32
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,240
Go!

33
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,390
Cease fire! Save your ammo, Valdez.

34
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,450
Save your ammo.

36
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,090
Delta-Xray-Delta. This is Camp Northern Light.

37
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:04,950
Come in.

38
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,370
Delta-Xray-Delta. This is Camp Northern Light.

39
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,040
Come in.

40
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,450
Why haven't they evacuated?

41
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,120
The extraction team is still in route.

42
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,770
Their initial landing site was overrunning.

43
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,330
And I can't get anyone from Delta-Xray on the radio.

44
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,370
Well keep trying.

45
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,930
Here are the new destination coordinates.

46
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,350
Two more minutes and they're on their own.

47
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,370
We evac as soon as the plane's loaded.

48
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,310
Keep everything hot.

49
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,860
Who knows

50
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,940
We might be back someday.

51
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,600
Two minutes. Move it people!

52
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,410
Come on, Hernandez! Out of there! Let's go!

53
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,980
Delta-Xray-Delta.

54
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,930
Come in.

55
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,770
This is Delta-Xray-Delta! Who the hell are you?

56
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,130
This is Simon Cruller, sir.

57
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,900
I'm a Sys Op working for the NSA.

58
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,960
Camp Northern Light.

59
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,760
I have new orders for you from Cent Com.

60
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,320
Little busy right now.

61
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,010
Yes, sir.

62
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,560
We're about to bug out ourselves so I'll get right to it.

63
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,230
I have GPS coordinates for your new destination.

64
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,920
It's the CDC Mass Infection Lab

65
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,090
on Mount Wilson.

66
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,580
You're to escort Doctor Merch and any other survivors

67
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,130
to this location. It's Priority Level One!

68
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,540
Hey! Hey! Are you sure?!

69
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,180
These coordinates are in California!

70
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,380
That's a roger, sir.

71
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,160
Where's my chopper?

72
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,170
I'm showing that it's still inbound sir.

73
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,660
But don't you worry, Delta-Xray. I'm not going anywhere.

74
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,130
You get us the hell out of here! You hear me?!

75
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,050
This gate won't hold them.

76
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,410
You keep them off as long as you can.

77
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,390
Then you fall back to the lab. Okay?

78
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,840
I'll evacuate the others. You can do this.

79
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,560
We don't have time for this.

80
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,370
We can't stop yet!

81
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,780
This is our last chance to test the new strains.

82
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,540
No!

83
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,030
They don't look like volunteers to me.

84
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,780
Millions of people are dying for no reason.

85
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,000
These men are gonna die to help us find a vaccine.

86
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,830
If it works, one of them may outlive us all.

87
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,450
Yeah, well why don't you take it then, huh?

88
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,220
Don't worry.

89
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,240
If it doesn't work out, I'll make sure you don't come back.

90
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,470
Fantastic.

91
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,450
In accordance with the Emergency Executive Order section seven,

92
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,330
you are hereby notified that you have been selected

93
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,350
for exposure to an experimental substance.

94
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,000
We got rights.

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,150
We're still human you know.

96
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,720
Should the test fail, all efforts will be made

97
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,830
to contact your next of kin.

98
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,060
Signed, President Lindsay Barton.

99
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,010
I thought that bitch was dead!

100
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,430
Not when she signed this order.

101
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,510
No! No! No!

102
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,460
Now! Do it now!

103
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,450
No! No!

104
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,250
Five minutes!

105
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,600
And we're out of here!

106
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,830
The evac better get here soon.

107
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,530
I give you mercy.

108
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,150
Time to go.

109
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,340
He's right.

110
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,710
Outta time. No more testing today.

111
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,500
No! No! No! No!

112
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,320
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

113
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,570
It's Valdez.

114
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,670
Air Cav - Whiskey Bravo Six,

115
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,520
this is Northern Light.

116
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,040
I have eyes on your approach.

117
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,300
You're right on top of them man. Awesome flying.

118
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,590
Delta Xray is bringing out survivors now.

119
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,770
Good luck, Whisky Bravo.

120
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,770
We're out the door ourselves.

121
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,170
Catch you in the next life, sir.

122
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,530
Northern Light signing off.

123
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,280
You're coming with me.

124
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,770
Wait! Where are you going?

125
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,700
Don't leave me to the zombies man.

126
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,500
Don't leave me! Don't let me turn, you bastard!

127
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,230
Pike me!

128
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,690
Pike me or I will hunt you down and eat your brains!

129
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,390
He was our last hope at finding a vaccine.

130
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,900
Now you are.

131
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:06,700
Come on.

132
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,210
Hey doc!

133
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,080
If I'm not back in two minutes,

134
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,610
you tell them to leave without me.

135
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,200
No!

136
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,460
Yes! Go ahead! Go!

137
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,210
Go!

140
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,870
*The beautiful, beautiful river*

141
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,960
*Gather with the saints at the river*

142
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,110
*That flows by the throne of God*

143
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,440
To Nana Griswold.

144
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,060
A true survivor.

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,160
Not many grandmothers left these days.

146
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,870
Especially as old as Nana was.

147
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,620
How old was she anyway?

148
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,900
Sixty-three.

149
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,030
Wow. That's old.

150
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,310
Sixty-four.

151
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,360
And I'm not dead yet.

152
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,110
But I think it's time.

153
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,840
You can all go now.

154
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,050
Do you have her special?

155
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,810
I'll take it from here.

156
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,070
Ready, Nana?

157
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,060
Hell yes I'm ready.

158
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,110
I've had enough of this stinkin' world.

159
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,270
Sofia Christina Griswold.

160
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,870
With this eight sacrament

161
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,830
I commit your soul to eternal peace.

162
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,210
I give you...mercy.

163
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,930
*The beautiful beautiful river*

164
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,870
*Gather with the saints at the river*

165
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,890
*That flows by the throne of God*

166
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,190
This is Garnett to Warren.

167
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,750
Garnett to Warren, over

168
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,350
Go for Warren. What's up Charlie?

169
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,970
I'm at the water's edge, could use a little backup.

170
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,470
Two minutes.

171
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,230
What is it?

172
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,740
I guess a distress signal?

173
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,450
How do you want to handle it?

174
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,210
Been watching them for a while.

175
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,180
As far as I can tell it's just two males.

176
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,320
Let's see what they want.

177
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,920
Can always turn them back around.

178
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,210
How did Nana's Eighth go?

179
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,650
Very good. Good people.

180
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,740
Thanks for doing it. I just...

181
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,740
can't anymore. Too many...

182
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,370
It's okay. She was ready to go.

183
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,120
Hmmm. Aren't we all.

184
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,860
Here they come.

185
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,330
All right. I'll handle the meet and greet.

186
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,960
You cover me from here.

187
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,710
Any problems, you hit the ground.

188
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,550
I'll take care of the rest.

189
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,520
That's far enough, gentlemen.

190
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,710
Identify yourselves and state your business

191
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,000
Team of snipers has you covered

192
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,320
so no sudden moves.

193
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,550
Lieutenant Mark Hammond. Delta Force.

194
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,140
Or least I was when there was still a Delta Force.

195
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,090
I'm on a mission from what's left of the government,

196
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,090
and I need your help.

197
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,140
What mission? For what government?

198
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,610
Look, to be honest I don't know

199
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,980
if anybody that gave me the order is still alive.

200
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,240
I do know it's imperative that I get this person

201
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,000
to a medical lab in California.

202
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,170
Alive.

203
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,570
Well I guess I won't shoot him Yet.

204
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,480
Who is he?

205
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,870
Some kind of doctor?

206
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,830
Not exactly.

207
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,880
His name is Murphy.

208
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,970
And he may just be the last best chance to save humanity.

209
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,800
Hello, baby, it's me.

210
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,070
You got time to talk?

211
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,080
Come on, sweetie.

212
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,220
I always have time for you. You know that.

213
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,080
I just wanted to know

214
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,040
if you're gonna make it home for Christmas

215
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,370
like you promised?

216
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,170
Daisy, I just don't know.

217
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,800
Things are pretty busy up here.

218
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,260
You and all your top secrets.

219
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,400
Can't they give you some time off?

220
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,910
Everybody's gonna be so disappointed.

221
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,840
I know.

222
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,650
But I'll get home soon, I promise.

223
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,150
How's Cowboy?

224
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,160
He's fine.

225
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,430
He chewed up another pair of your shoes.

226
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,820
Sometimes I think he misses you more than I do.

227
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,360
If that's possible.

228
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,630
Hey, did you see that stuff on the news about Washington?

229
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,250
That's crazy, huh?

230
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:27,980
Northern Light.

231
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,440
This is CDC Mount Wilson.

232
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,010
Northern Light.

233
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,990
This is CDC Mount Wilson. Over.

234
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,280
Mount Wilson, this is Northern Light. Over.

235
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,600
The lab has been overrun.

236
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,140
Operation Bite Mark abandoning location.

237
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,620
What is the status of Delta-Xray-Delta? Over.

238
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,870
Delta-Xray location currently unknown.

239
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,270
We lost contact three weeks ago. Over.

240
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,330
I need the status of Delta-Xray-Delta.

241
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,090
We need to...

242
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,470
new coordinates...

243
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,620
Mount Wilson. We did not copy. Repeat.

244
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,620
We did not copy. Over.

245
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,650
Mount Wilson.

246
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,400
All we need are some basic supplies

247
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,990
and transportation south as far as the Tappan Zee bridge.

248
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,960
We're meeting a new team there, and they can take us

249
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,090
the rest of the way to California.

250
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,420
California sure is a hell of a long way.

251
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,630
The Tappan Zee bridge is a long way.

252
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,490
I wouldn't ask, but it's imperative

253
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,780
and I am out of options.

254
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,620
How'd you find out about this place?

255
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,980
An ex-cop and some others taking shelter in a prison

256
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,200
twenty clicks up the road said

257
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,900
there was some National Guard

258
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,020
that set up a camp, might be able to help us out.

259
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,310
"Ex" National Guard.

260
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,990
Yeah, I was with Georgia National Guard.

261
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,990
Warren here was evacuated out of Missouri.

262
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,290
But as far as I know, we're the only ones left of our unit.

263
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,210
Look. I know there's no more chain of command,

264
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,250
no more Guard, no more government.

265
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,140
Just a few of us out there following orders

266
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,210
cuz that's what we do.

267
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,530
I lost eight of the best men I ever served with getting this far.

268
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,650
My orders are to take this man to a lab in California,

269
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,170
and that's what I intend to do.

270
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,480
Now.

271
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,850
Are you people going to help me or not?

272
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,760
Why is he so goddamn important?

273
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,660
He has information vital to

274
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,610
the development of a vaccine for the zombie virus.

275
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,380
And that's all I can tell you.

276
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,800
How much more do you need to know?

277
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,560
Warren and I can take the pickup truck, bring you to the Tappan Zee.

278
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,110
But you'd be on your own after that.

279
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,430
That's all I'm asking.

280
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,830
Well if we keep it moving,

281
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,650
we can get there and back before nightfall.

282
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,690
I'm not sure we risk the truck.

283
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:57,970
Or you two.

284
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,280
Maybe I haven't been clear.

285
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,250
This is more important than your trucks.

286
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,890
Or anyone's life.

287
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,150
Including my own.

288
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,630
I don't want to have to insist.

289
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,010
I was supposed to meet my rendezvous two days ago.

290
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,970
This needs to happen.

291
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:21,750
Now.

292
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:30,880
Listen.

293
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,040
If they're trying to steal the truck,

294
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,340
do what you got to do.

295
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,240
Always.

296
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,320
Stay in radio contact.

297
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,410
We don't hear from you by tomorrow morning,

298
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,740
we'll come lookin'.

299
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,620
You'll have them back by sundown.

300
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
Well if availability of ammo is all you care about

301
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,670
then the 22 is the way to go.

302
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,760
But... You really want to make an impression,

303
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,980
check out this smoke wagon.

304
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,760
You really make a z's day with this.

305
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,680
Now the 22, that'll kill a z,

306
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,100
but it's gonna be about two or three shots

307
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,370
before the thing's down and dead.

308
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,320
This baby?

309
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,070
You stop a car with this.

310
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,460
I was thinking something more silent.

311
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,970
Like a club.

312
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,180
And sharp.

313
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,490
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

314
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,120
Yeah, I like how you think. Silent but effective. Huh?

315
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:28,980
Okay.

316
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,310
Check this out.

317
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,130
Made it myself.

318
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,770
I call it "The Z Whacker."

319
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,340
You start with an aluminum bat

320
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,640
then customize it for the task at hand.

321
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,910
Wow. It's light.

322
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,800
Yeah, the spikes are hand cast from beer cans.

323
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,210
So they're long enough that they kill the brain

324
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,390
but you can still pull it out.

325
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:52,420
Cuz nothing is worse than getting your pike stuck into a z's skull.

326
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,970
Cuz then you got to drag them down to the ground.

327
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,170
You got to put your foot on their chest.

328
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,200
Then you got to yank the thing out.

329
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,440
And by then you're dead.

330
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,330
You know what I mean?

331
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,020
Sure do hate that.

332
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,720
How about a straight across trade?

333
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,330
A dozen of these aspirin

334
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,560
for a dozen of these reloaded .223's.

335
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,240
You can't kill a zombie with aspirin.

336
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,270
Well you can't kill a fever with a bullet

337
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,050
and they ain't making any more aspirin.

338
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,890
Make it a dozen oxycontin and you got a deal.

339
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,130
I'd have to take a dozen oxycontin

340
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,450
before I'd make that deal.

341
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,850
How 'bout some meth?

342
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,120
Huh? You want some crystal?

343
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,680
Yeah, I baked it myself.

344
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,260
That same pink ice you made before?

345
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,990
No, that stuff gave me an axe to the skull headache.

346
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,830
No, that's what the aspirin's for.

347
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,110
How many ampules of morphine you got left in there?

348
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,050
Behind you.

349
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,900
Nice. You all right? That was a little close.

350
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,130
Yeah, that... that was a fast one.

351
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:43,990
Brutal.

352
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,100
Told ya.

353
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,480
Hey, isn't that Red Hanson?

354
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,220
Z's got Red?

355
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,930
Damn, he was one of our best customers

356
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,250
tough as bullets.

357
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,350
I wonder if his brothers know.

358
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,410
Yeah, I think so cuz here they come.

359
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,070
Closing time.

360
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,190
The way that big one moved

361
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,660
he must have turned just a few hours ago.

362
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,410
Four brothers, recently turned,

363
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,520
found on Miller's Road by Sutter's Farm.

364
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,710
Given mercy, May 13, 3 A.Z.

365
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,530
Time to go.

366
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,560
I got something over here.

367
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,620
Looks like a floater washed up.

368
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,740
I got another one over here.

369
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,730
This one looks dead and down too.

370
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,260
Donner.

371
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,960
Look.

372
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,090
Must be hundreds of them.

373
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,710
Camp Blue Sky, this is mobile one.

374
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,660
Blue Sky, this is mobile one. Over.

375
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,010
Hey guys, I need you to get back to us.

376
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,090
It's time for our 8 p.m. signal check.

377
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,670
What are you wasting time for?

378
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,910
You said yourself they'd be fine.

379
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,460
Look, there must be something wrong.

380
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,850
If we don't hear from them soon, we're gonna have to go back.

381
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,800
I don't think I can let you do that.

382
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,390
If something is wrong with my people

383
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,050
I don't give a damn about your mission.

384
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,780
Or you.

385
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,480
We're going back.

386
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,240
Look.

387
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,360
I appreciate your loyalty to those folks. I do.

388
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,170
But you don't know what I know about this man.

389
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,550
Why should we believe a word you say?

390
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,220
Get out of the car.

391
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,390
Show them.

392
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,140
Show them why you're so damn important.

393
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,510
Get your hands off me.

394
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,300
Show them why so many good men died

395
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,310
getting you this far.

396
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,150
Show them!

397
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,630
What happened?

398
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,330
Those are Zombie bites.

399
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,150
Eight of them.

400
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,960
Why is he still alive?

401
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,290
And not a zombie?

402
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,110
He was given the only dose of an experimental vaccine

403
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,530
right before he was bitten.

404
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,650
Those undead bastards got two of my ribs right there.

405
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,570
Shut up.

406
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,820
At least you're still alive.

407
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,550
More than I can say for my men.

408
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,330
You're looking at the only human known to have survived

409
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,930
being bitten by a Zombie.

410
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,010
His blood carries the antibodies for the ZN1 virus.

411
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,440
If we can get him to the lab in California

412
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,460
they can use his blood and make more of the vaccine.

413
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,420
Mayday. Mayday. Calling Camp Blue Sky.

414
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,130
This is Doc. With Thompson and Carver.

415
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,480
What is your situation? Over.

416
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,410
Hey, Doc. What's going on? What's going on?

417
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,390
Garnett? Thank God you're alive.

418
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,920
We thought everyone was dead.

419
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,690
I'm not at Camp Blue Sky. What's happening?

420
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,260
Batteries... dying.

421
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,040
Wait. Say. Again.

422
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,540
Blue Sky has been overrun.

423
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,460
The whole place is...on fire.

424
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,530
Survivors?

425
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,760
Well there was a ton of gunfire a while ago, but nothing since.

426
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,170
Come on. Let's go.

427
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,110
Oh... There's the escape bus.

428
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,920
Oh, they got the kids out. Okay.

429
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,140
Come on.

430
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,850
Get in!

431
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,100
Go! Go! Go!

432
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,480
How many more?

433
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,130
Nobody.

434
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:02,880
Nobody?

435
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
Nobody! I'm sure!

436
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,320
Donna? Marion?

437
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,310
No...there was no one.

438
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,960
Not even time to show any of them mercy.

439
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,780
There's nobody back there but z's.

440
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,560
Sorry guys. We tried.

441
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,640
Nothing left for them now but God's mercy.

442
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,010
It's time to go then. Come on.

443
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,830
I don't know what we brought them along for.

444
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,120
Uh...because they're human beings

445
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,700
and they deserve to live.

446
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,180
Hey... how much further to this rendezvous?

447
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,520
Just a few more clicks.

448
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,690
Got some vehicles and a team of killers waiting.

449
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,120
Wish I had ten times that.

450
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,320
Should be up ahead on the left.

451
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,990
An old high school with a civil defense shelter in the basement.

452
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,290
Supposedly there's still some rations left there.

453
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,880
When was the last time you made contact with them?

454
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,680
About a month ago.

455
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,190
A month ago?

456
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,750
That's like two years Apocalypse time.

458
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,090
Get back in the truck.

459
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,390
Is it them?

460
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,570
Hammond?

461
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,510
Is it them?

462
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,330
Yeah.

463
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,180
I got to pee.

464
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,610
Don't go far.

465
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:47,770
Don't worry.

466
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,390
This guy.

467
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,180
My reinforcements are dead.

468
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,410
We need to make a quick search for survivors and any supplies.

469
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,400
You!

470
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,720
Zip it up and stay close to me.

471
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,760
Hey, where'd all the z's go?

472
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,750
Movin' on, like locust.

473
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,220
Yeah, but they'll be back.

474
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,280
Garnett and Warren, you clear the building.

475
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,110
And you three check the vehicles.

476
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,510
Looks like they never had a chance.

477
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,550
You hear that?

478
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,950
Hear what?

479
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,730
There.

480
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,100
Sounds like a...baby.

481
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,580
Oh shoot.

482
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,090
There it is.

483
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,850
Hey, it's okay sweetie.

484
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,460
We're gonna get you out of there.

485
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,400
How's that driver?

486
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,040
Dead. Turned?

487
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,430
Looks like she took a blow to the skull.

488
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,360
Brain dead on impact.

489
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,770
There you go.

490
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:07,770
Hey, Mack.

491
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,860
Yeah, I know.

492
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,140
Whoa. It's a real live baby.

493
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,110
I haven't seen one of these in years.

494
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,260
And he won't stop crying.

495
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,360
Here. What do I do?

496
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,520
-Maybe don't. -Okay.

497
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,700
Hold him like he's a live grenade. Just give him to me.

498
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,700
Me and babies, not so much.

499
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,970
What was she doing out here with a baby anyway?

500
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,940
I dunno. Looks like they were headed to this shelter.

501
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,450
They got overrun.

502
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,850
What the hell are we gonna do with a baby?

503
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,020
Beats me. I stopped planning two minutes ahead years ago.

504
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,460
Heads up.

505
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,960
What are they after?

506
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,660
Only one thing. Come on.

507
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,540
You all right?

508
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,100
Careful. She might be dead.

509
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,380
Well she ain't dead.

510
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,470
Hey. It's okay. Hey. It's okay. We're good people.

511
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,590
We just saved you.

512
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,740
Okay, don't hurt him.

513
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,560
Sorry. I didn't know where I was.

514
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,040
I must have fallen asleep.

515
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,320
Asleep?

516
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,960
How long you in this cage for?

517
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,560
Two days.

518
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,170
Somebody better shut that kid up

519
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,870
before he attracts z's like flies.

520
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,570
It's a baby. He makes noise, okay?

521
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,460
Shut up. And you, do what you can.

522
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,910
He's right about the z's.

523
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:22,970
Here.

524
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,960
Why would somebody lock you in a cage and leave you to die?

525
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,790
What did you do?

526
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,190
I didn't do anything.

527
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,980
I locked myself in the cage for protection.

528
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,140
You have the keys?

529
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,650
I lost them.

530
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,300
Why are you dressed like that?

531
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,430
I don't have to justify myself.

532
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,580
Maybe you do!

533
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,140
We were supposed to meet the men in those vehicles.

534
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,510
What happened here?

535
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,710
Those men showed up about a week ago.

536
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,070
They cleared out the school and set up some kind of camp.

537
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,840
But word got out that there was food.

538
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,210
Lots of it from the bomb shelter.

539
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,060
Yeah, it didn't take long. There was too many people.

540
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,860
The soldiers shot some of the locals,

541
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,570
and that brought the z's.

542
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,770
You can guess the rest.

543
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,260
What are we wasting time talking to her for?

544
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,360
Give her the baby, and let's go.

545
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,580
You can't give this girl a baby and leave.

546
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,330
Well they can't come with us.

547
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,110
Listen.

548
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,370
No way am I leaving the baby and her behind.

549
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,830
It's not gonna happen.

550
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,840
It's just a baby.

551
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,850
It's not like he's gonna grow up and be a fine young man someday.

552
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:33,800
You know what, shut up!

553
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,840
We'll take them to the next safe outpost.

554
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,520
God, I hate moral dilemmas.

555
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,670
Yeah what's next chief?

556
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,100
You wanna start a college fund for him?

557
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,270
Puppies and kittens. 200 yards away.

558
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,890
Zombies.

559
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,160
All right, everybody. Time to go.

560
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,190
You four, i want you to grab all the food and weapons you can find.

561
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,290
Load them in that truck. The keys are still inside.

562
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,570
Hey! We haven't talked about this.

563
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,490
We can talk about it later.

564
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,510
Right now you do what I tell you.

565
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,000
Garnett!

566
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,160
You stay with the baby and Murphy until we get back.

567
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,990
Warren.

568
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,180
You and I are gonna see if we can start up that deuce and a half.

569
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,490
Everybody meets back here in five.

570
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,430
Go!

571
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:26,290
Go.

572
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,170
All right.

573
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,280
How you want to handle this?

574
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,470
We usually like taking it to 'em.

575
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,810
Sir.

576
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,720
All right. Let's do this.

577
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,600
Silent.

578
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,260
Hey, mister! Baby.

579
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,120
The kid finally shut up.

580
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,830
Get away from there.

581
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,710
Get away from there.

582
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,020
What the hell did you do that for?

583
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,990
Murphy.

584
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,180
Get over here.

585
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,120
Go.

586
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,290
You okay?

587
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,470
Yeah, I'm great.

588
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:48,540
Baby?

589
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,850
He's weak, but he's hanging in there.

590
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,610
Here.

591
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,360
Thanks.

592
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,650
Oh God.

593
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:21,610
Kill it.

594
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,050
I can't.

595
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,210
I can't do it.

596
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:27,820
Yes, you can.

597
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,670
No. You do it.

598
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:31,030
No, I don't want to do it. You got to kill it.

599
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,490
What's the holdup?

600
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,390
Where's the baby?

601
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,440
Turned.

602
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,140
Surprise. Surprise.

603
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,060
Let him go.

604
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,810
Or I will send you to walk among the dead.

605
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,530
Let's get in the trucks.

606
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,190
We're moving out.

607
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,590
What about the... the baby thing?

608
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,950
We can't leave it like that.

609
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:24,650
Yeah, she's right.

610
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,760
Even if it is turned.

611
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,560
It sounds so sad.

612
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,900
It's not sad. It's a zombie.

613
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,540
Amen brother. Let's go.

614
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,180
We can't leave it like that.

615
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:34,600
I'll do it.

616
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,850
I'll do it.

617
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,590
I need you to pull it together.

618
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,950
Two minutes.

619
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,380
Be ready to go.

620
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,050
Here baby.

621
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,800
Here baby-baby.

622
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,580
Come to papa.

623
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,840
If we wanted to ditch these two

624
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,150
take the truck and run

625
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,290
now would be the time.

626
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,000
Just sayin'.

627
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,370
Oh I see your little bitch-ass.

628
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,930
You know, non of these would happen

629
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,980
if you'd just left that damn baby.

630
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,880
I didn't tell Hammond to go get eaten by a baby.

631
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,450
Never mind that now.

632
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:00,850
We need a plan.

633
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:03,630
My plan is I'm taking this truck

634
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,700
and I am forgetting about vaccines and labs

635
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,970
and all of you.

636
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,970
I wanted off this train from day one,

637
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,050
and now's my chance.

638
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,900
Wait-wait-wait. You can't just go.

639
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,890
What about California? What about the vaccine?

640
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:20,010
What if it's real? What if there's a chance?

641
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:20,950
And what if it's you?

642
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:21,850
Addy.

643
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,780
How do we know this isn't all just bullshit?

644
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,720
How does anybody know anything anymore?

645
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,610
Delta-Xray-Delta.

646
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:29,410
What the hell is that?

647
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,690
Delta-Xray-Delta. Come in.

648
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,470
Delta-Xray-Delta. This is Northern Light.

649
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,820
Operation Bitmark. Do you copy?

650
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,780
Delta-Xray-Delta.

651
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,880
It's Hammond's radio.

652
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,340
Delta-Xray-Delta. This is Northern Light.

653
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,210
Hello?

654
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,300
I copy you Delta-Xray!

655
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,180
This is...this is Northern Light.

656
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,690
Who am I speaking to?

657
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,570
Addison Carver.

658
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,520
Okay. I need to speak to Lieutenant Hammond.

659
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,280
Hammond's dead.

660
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,250
I'm...I'm...I'm sorry.

661
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,930
I...I didn't copy that, Delta-Xray.

662
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,780
Did you say that Hammond is dead?

663
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,560
Yes.

664
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,910
Is the package safe?

665
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,140
Package? What...what package?

666
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,040
Who is this?

667
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,820
Listen. I need to speak to whoever's in charge.

668
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,800
Who is it?

669
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,580
They won't say.

670
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,210
They want to know who's in charge.

671
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,160
You are.

672
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:30,010
This is Sergeant Garnett of the National Guard. Who is this?

673
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,500
Sergeant Garnett.

674
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,800
Lieutenant Hammond was transporting a civilian

675
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,560
named Murphy to California.

676
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,580
Is he alive?

677
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,940
Yes. He's still alive.

678
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,390
Good. Good.

679
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:45,120
Are...are you aware of Operation Bitemark?

680
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,800
Do you mean the lab in California?

681
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,660
Yes! Yes! Listen to me!

682
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,330
It is imperative that you get Murphy to California.

683
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,360
I repeat.

684
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,520
It is imperative that you get Murphy alive to California.

685
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,590
Do you copy?

686
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,520
But we don't know...

687
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,920
Who are you?

688
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:02,850
Garnett?

689
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,970
Garnett, do you copy?

690
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,670
Garnett!

691
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,020
It's dead.

692
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,430
Damn it!

693
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,040
So?

694
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,000
So...

695
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,960
It looks like we're taking Mr. Congeniality here to California.

696
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,410
Says who?

697
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,330
Says me.

698
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,290
Hey there.

699
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,520
You're that sharp shooter that saved my ass, aren't you?

700
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,060
Oh man.

701
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,410
I want to thank you.

702
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,960
Do you need a ride?

703
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,960
I know you're out there. I can see you.

704
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:13,030
Running. Hiding. Killing. Surviving.

705
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,880
I've seen it all.

706
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,900
Season tickets to the Zompocalypse.

707
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,370
And I got to tell you people,

708
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,470
we've been getting our asses kicked.

709
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,880
Well today's the day that all that changes.

710
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:30,310
That's right. I'm not just watching anymore.

711
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:33,370
It's time to kick some zombie ass.

712
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,820
This is Citizen Z broadcasting

713
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,310
live via broadband, low band, vhf, uhf, skynet.

714
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:40,130
If you can get a signal, then you can find me

715
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,210
thanks to our friends at the NSA.

716
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:46,820
Now all I need is somebody, anybody, everybody to get back to me

717
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,010
cuz that's how it starts. If you're still alive,

718
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,010
you're probably some kind of...

719
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,710
some kind of genetically predisposed badass.

720
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,650
And all we got to do is

721
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:56,770
get organized and the zombies don't stand a chance.

722
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,840
Now here's a little something for all of you out there

723
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,990
with 3,000 miles of bad road between you and home.

724
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,260
I hope you can hear it.

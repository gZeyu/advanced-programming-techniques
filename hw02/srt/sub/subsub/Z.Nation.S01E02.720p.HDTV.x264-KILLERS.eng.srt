11
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,020
This is Citizen Z here at forward listening post Northern Light.

12
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,060
Northern Light to Mount Wilson.

13
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,310
Anyone from the Mount Wilson CDC.

14
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,590
I have important information regarding Delta-Xray-Delta

15
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,560
and Operation Bite Mark.

16
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,460
Come on, California. Hang in there

17
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,430
Your package is on the way.

18
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,810
All you got to do is be there to sign for it.

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,140
This is Mount Wilson. This is Doctor Hastings at Mount Wilson.

20
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,430
Yes! Mount Wilson, you have Northern Light.

21
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,570
We've been attacked by a swarm of level four infected.

22
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,330
Our defenses have been breached.

23
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,350
Our escape has been blocked by a high voltage fence.

24
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,210
Can you access the power grid from your location?

25
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,270
Negative. There are too many Zs between us

26
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:58,860
and the breakers.

27
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,650
All right. I might be able to do something from my end.

28
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,870
If I can access anything on your lab network

29
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,240
powered by the same generator

30
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,770
I might be able to overload it,

31
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,160
knock out power to the fence.

32
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,750
I don't know the password.

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,450
Not to worry.

34
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,920
We're the NSA. All of it.

35
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,030
Please hurry.

36
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,670
All right. All right. I'm... I'm already in.

37
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,900
Uhhh, Mount Wilson.

38
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,550
We are ready to execute overload.

39
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,350
But I'm showing your mainframe and gene sequencer

40
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,990
on the same network.

41
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,450
That means any vaccine files that you have on that mainframe

42
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,920
are likely to be destroyed.

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,160
Please advise me.

44
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,730
Mount Wilson, I'm ready to execute overload. Please advise.

45
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,680
If I do this, I'm going to fry your work.

46
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,970
Do you have a backup?

47
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,460
- Mount Wilson?  - There's too many!

48
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,090
You've got to get us

49
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,110
out of here now!

50
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,510
Damn it!

51
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,910
That's it! Go! Go! Go!

52
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,700
Come on, Mount Wilson. Hang in there.

55
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,660
Whatever you do, don't stop.

56
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,250
Haha, ya think.

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,460
Go around!

58
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,720
Too late!

59
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,120
Nice driving.

60
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,090
Oh no. No-no. No!

61
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:40,810
What?

62
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,710
Oh, we're out of gas.

63
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,010
Well that was fun.

64
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,920
Ha-ha. Out of gas.

65
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,840
Running on fumes.

66
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,570
All right. So it looks like you got a flat.

67
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,140
Heads up.

68
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,090
We got company.

69
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,650
That's right.

70
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,280
Keep rolling and we all live to see another day.

71
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,200
All right. Let's do this quick.

72
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:44,980
All right.

73
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,240
Doesn't look flat, but it won't... turn.

74
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,720
We ran over some fun stuff.

75
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,100
Okay. Well help me get it off and let's see what's going on.

76
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,750
Well that explains the pull to the left.

77
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,370
What are you waiting for?

78
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,180
Kill it! Kill it!

79
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,070
All right, you. Time to go home.

80
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,380
Even after all this,

81
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,400
it's still beautiful.

82
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,100
Take a good look.

83
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,830
Might not be back for a while.

84
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,390
So long New York.

85
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,890
See ya in the next life.

00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,560
Mount Wilson, this is Northern Light.

96
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,400
Mount Wilson, this is Northern Light.

97
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,630
Come in.

98
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,000
Mount Wilson, this is Citizen Z.

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,080
Making sure you're all still in business.

100
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,200
Delta-Xray-Delta.

101
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,210
Delta-Xray-Delta.

102
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,790
Do you copy?

103
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,800
Does anybody copy?

104
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,380
Does anybody copy?

105
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,710
Operation Bite Mark. Operation Bite Mark.

106
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,930
This is Citizen Z from Camp Northern Light

107
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,620
broadcasting live on all known frequencies.

108
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,290
Even a few nobody knows about.

109
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,820
If you have any way at all to communicate, any way at all.

110
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,210
If you've got short wave, long wave, dark wave,

111
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,760
broadband, xband, two cups and a string, smoke signals.

112
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,760
Anything. Just get back to me.

113
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,550
I've got a satellite. I'll see it.

114
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,140
Anyone from Operation Bite Mark.

115
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,380
This is Citizen Z from Camp Northern Light.

116
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,010
I have an update for you on the California situation.

117
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,710
We need to discuss some operational realities.

118
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,510
Mount Wilson, do you copy?

119
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,040
Delta-Xray-Delta, do you copy?

120
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,600
I can't believe I lost everybody.

121
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,460
Is that a dog sled?

122
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,450
Is that people?!

123
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,080
I... I think it's people!

124
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,520
Oh thank god! Somebody's here!

125
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,500
Finally.

126
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,480
Snacks! They're gonna want snacks!

127
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,320
They're... they'll be hungry.

128
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,660
Got to clean up the bathroom.

129
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,560
People!

130
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,480
Wait. People or...

132
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,320
All these cars...

133
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,510
And not a drop of gas.

134
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,980
Just when you thought you saw the worst of it, huh?

135
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,730
They didn't stand a chance.

136
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,270
Black Friday sale?

137
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,080
You find any gas?

138
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,540
No. This area's been picked clean.

139
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,620
What?

140
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,930
You on vacation?

141
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,560
Somebody has to keep record.

142
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,830
You know we're probably the last generations of humans on earth.

143
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:20,210
To us it's the apocalypse. To her it's the memories.

144
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,900
Would it hurt the antibodies if I kicked him in the nuts?

145
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,740
So what's your name, kid?

146
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Ten Thousand.

147
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,000
That is not a name. It's a number.

148
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,010
It's my name. Made it up myself.

149
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,820
Well I suppose you'd have to.

150
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,660
Does it mean anything?

151
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,810
How many zombies I'm going to kill.

152
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,730
Well that's a whole lot of zombies.

153
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,060
Already on 1,055.

154
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,250
Damn!

155
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,620
So what happens when you get to 10,000

156
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,850
Change my name.

157
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,740
To what? Twenty thousand?

158
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,440
Jeff.

159
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,110
I like the name Jeff.

160
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,540
Ah, shut up.

161
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,140
Where did everybody go?

162
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,140
I haven't seen a survivor except for those two bikers.

163
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,700
Black Summer. Everybody starved to death.

164
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,640
I was in Philly for Black Summer.

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,950
It was bad. I lost thirty pounds.

166
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,530
Thought I was dead.

167
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,050
How did you survive?

168
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,670
Did what I had to do.

169
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,960
Hold on. It's not a Z.

170
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,910
Peace. No bites here.

171
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,250
100 percent alive.

172
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,900
What happened to your friend?

173
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,920
Turns out he had other friends of low morals.

174
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,060
Took my ride.

175
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,570
Horse thieves should be shot.

176
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,420
You should choose better friends.

177
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,730
Good advice.

178
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,630
What can we do for you?

179
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,080
One peaceful group of humans to a lone traveler?

180
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,200
Could use a lift.

181
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,560
Sure don't want to spend the night out here alone.

182
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,950
Sorry. We ain't running a taxi service.

183
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,240
Which way are you headed?

184
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,920
Any direction but back.

185
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,460
Word is there's a horde on the move

186
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,940
south on the New York side.

187
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,370
I see you're scrounging for gas.

188
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,180
You know like we used to say, ass, gas or grass.

189
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,080
Nobody rides for free.

190
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,860
I know where you could fill up.

191
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,920
Now would be the time to share that information.

192
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,990
Place called Jersey Devil Refinery, maybe five miles off,

193
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,180
just off the turnpike.

194
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,790
How do you know there's gas there?

195
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,950
Got overrun day number one.

196
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,520
All the tanks are still full,

197
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,220
just rusting away.

198
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,260
All right, take us to this refinery.

199
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,890
And if there's gas there like you say,

200
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,970
you can ride with us to the next outpost.

201
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,310
You won't be sorry.

202
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,230
You got that right.

203
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,220
Let's get out of here.

204
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,400
New guy's gonna ride with me and Warren.

205
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,860
Everybody else load up in the truck.

206
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,520
So are we just gonna pick up every sketchy loser

207
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,190
at every place we stop?

208
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,020
Well we brought you along, didn't we?

209
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,150
Besides, nobody consulted me.

210
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,010
We're not really going to California with this guy, are we?

211
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,300
You know the Apocalypse is a lot like rehab, kid.

212
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,880
Just take it one day at a time,

213
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,170
and then do the next indicated thing.

214
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,540
In this case, that means get more gas.

215
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,300
After that, who knows?

216
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,310
We're doomed.

217
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,890
Well there you have it.

218
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,440
We're officially on E.

219
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,980
How much further?

220
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,250
Spittin' distance.

222
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,990
That's not a refinery.

223
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,840
That's a zombie factory.

224
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,890
Frackin' zombies.

225
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,400
They seem to want something in there real bad.

226
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,680
It's that sound.

227
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,960
Like bees to honey.

228
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,520
Or Zs to shit.

229
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,990
Hey, you know about this?

230
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,500
Hey, all the easy gas is gone.

231
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,980
So what's the brilliant plan?

232
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,770
Die, get eaten, go home early?

233
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,100
What's that smell?

234
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,790
The undead and gasoline.

235
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,840
Both highly flammable.

236
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,060
So no firearms of any kind.

237
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,220
So how do you want to handle this?

238
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,380
Well first we got to shut off whatever's making that noise.

239
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,800
Okay, it's probably some kind of pump.

240
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
But where?

241
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,760
Follow the zombies.

242
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,970
They all seem to be headed for the top of that catalog.

243
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,990
We'll get up there and check it out.

244
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,650
Then we got to have a sound that draws the Zs away from the pump

245
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,990
so we can get to the gas.

246
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,050
Sorry, I left my guitar back at Camp Blue Sky.

247
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,400
Car horns?

248
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,410
No, they'll all just head this way.

249
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,560
And so will every other dead head within earshot.

250
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,620
I have something.

251
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,350
Zs like high-pitched sounds.

252
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,910
The more musical the better.

253
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,400
Wow, learn something everyday.

254
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,260
That's great.

255
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,210
You're our decoy.

256
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,100
I'll go with her.

257
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
I don't need his help.

258
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,880
No, you need cover. Take him.

259
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,280
And start the music when you get to the top of that catwalk.

260
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,880
You two, get to the top of the other side

261
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,800
and see if you can kill that noise. Got it.

262
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,850
Where'd that kid go?

263
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,960
He was here a minute ago.

264
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,930
Oh and his name is Ten Thousand.

265
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,230
Well he better be back by the time we're ready to go.

266
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,210
Hey, if we get that tanker started

267
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,760
and we could fill it up from the main tank,

268
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,080
that much gas would get us to California.

269
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,520
I like the way you think.

270
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,520
So what should I be doing

271
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,590
while you all are getting incinerated to death?

272
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,630
All right, why don't you take Mr. Congeniality here

273
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,280
and the Suburban and get back to a safe distance,

274
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,480
just in case.

275
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,890
What if... you know... zombies?

276
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,660
If this all ends in tears,

277
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,240
you got to get him to California.

278
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,180
Sure.

279
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,000
No problem.

280
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,760
Wait one second, buddy. Wait one second. I got you.

281
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,860
There you go.

282
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,910
All right, let's warm you up.

283
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,560
Oh yeah, it's cold outside, isn't it?

284
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,180
Yeah. Good boy. Good boy.

285
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,080
You're crazy.

286
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,970
Sunshine! Hold up!

287
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,720
Hey! Slow down!

288
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,190
You're gonna get us both killed.

289
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,700
Actually just one of us.

290
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,080
I know what you're trying to do.

291
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,340
It is not gonna work.

292
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,980
You don't know anything about me.

293
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,310
I know Tobias

294
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,910
and the rest of the family is never gonna let you leave Sunshine.

295
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,660
Well I'm never going back.

296
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,230
And my name isn't Sunshine.

297
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,260
That girl died a long time ago.

298
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,600
You don't understand.

299
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,710
I can't go back without you.

300
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,990
That's no way to treat family.

301
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,250
Addy.

302
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,600
Look, I just don't trust Murphy.

303
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,140
It's all wrong with that dick.

304
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,830
He's more than just a little crazy.

305
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,100
This whole mission is insane.

306
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,930
Warren and Garnett don't think so.

307
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,440
Hammond died trying to protect him,

308
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,560
and so did a lot of other people.

309
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,880
You want to do the same?

310
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,500
No.

311
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,290
What if it's true?

312
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,510
What if Murphy's who they say he is

313
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,660
and there's a chance for a vaccine?

314
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,300
You don't get a do-over on the end of the world, Addy.

315
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,560
- It's too late. - If we have the slightest chance

316
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,540
of waking up in the world I remember...

317
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,930
Where dead things stay dead...

318
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,460
That's a chance I'm gonna take.

319
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,160
Cuz that's hope, Mack.

320
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,060
You know how long it's been since I've felt something like that?

321
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,420
It's not hope. It's a lie.

322
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,030
And it's gonna get us both killed.

323
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,020
Well then I'd rather die believing in a lie

324
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,940
than live believing in nothing.

325
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,180
Damn, you're sexy when you get all philosophical.

326
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,390
Keep cranking.

327
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,560
Cranking enough to light up a small city.

328
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,820
Here.

329
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,860
Try it.

330
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,020
Okay, hurry up. It's almost running out of gas.

331
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,880
Not for long.

332
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,270
Get ready to go as soon as they kill that noise.

333
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,980
Come on.

334
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,390
That was cool.

335
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,100
Yeah. This bad boy's the problem all right.

336
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,970
Nothing zombies like more than fire and noise.

337
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:50,700
Yeah, except brains.

338
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,990
How do we turn it off?

339
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,220
Well the stop button doesn't work.

340
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,610
Must operate on pressure.

341
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,480
Like some kind of relief valve or something.

342
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,350
Maybe we can jam it up.

343
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,100
Well what about the pressure or whatever it's venting?

344
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,110
Yeah, we don't hang around to find out.

345
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,050
Get the gas and get out of dodge.

346
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,840
We just need something to jam it up with like a pole or something.

347
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,640
No! I love this thing.

348
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,210
Figure it out!

349
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,420
Hey, what happened to all the

350
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,460
zombies that have been coming up here? Huh?

351
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,710
Okay.

352
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,370
They did it.

353
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,650
All right. Get ready.

354
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:53,960
Okay.

355
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:54,980
We should go.

356
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,870
Yeah.

357
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,680
Watch out!

358
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,170
That was handy.

359
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,400
Now we know what happened to the zombies.

360
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,350
Okay, it's really time to go.

361
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,880
Wonder how it's going?

362
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,680
Haven't heard anything blow up.

363
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,780
Yet.

364
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,720
Eights.

365
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,740
Go fish.

366
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,350
Do it.

367
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:21,070
Okay. Okay. Now it's really time to go.

368
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,000
Here, boy!

369
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,970
Where did you go, fellow.

370
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:37,570
Hey, boy.

371
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,500
Where are you?

372
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,480
Come here, doggy.

373
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,120
Come on.

374
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,930
There you are.

375
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,380
How are you, boy? Do you want some water?

376
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,710
Are you thirsty? Yeah.

377
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,720
Come here. Let's get some water.

378
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,790
Yeah.

379
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,130
Are you thirsty?

380
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,670
Are you a thirsty boy?

381
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,490
There we go.

382
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,330
Yeah, that's right. Drink up, buddy.

383
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,230
Drink up.

384
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:31,990
Dog!

385
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,950
Dog, come back!

386
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,260
Dog!

387
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,880
Nice job. What was up there?

388
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,330
Some kind of a pressure valve thing.

389
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,930
But that tank is full of zombie goo, like to the top.

390
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,430
Beautiful. It ain't gonna hold, guys.

391
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,960
Start the music!

392
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:53,910
Let's dance.

393
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,930
I'll be damned.

394
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,520
I got the hose.

395
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,490
Here. Give me that.

396
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,500
You ready?

397
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,280
Firing up.

398
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,730
First time I've ever seen anybody cheat at go fish.

399
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,990
It's a gift.

400
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,800
What the hell is taking so long?

401
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,610
Full service just ain't what it used to be.

402
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,630
Relax.

403
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,570
Garnett and Warren know what they're doing.

404
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,830
Too many Zs around here. It's freaking me out.

405
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,530
I got a phobia

406
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,330
you know ever since I got bit.

407
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,960
I've been meaning to ask you about that. So these bites...

408
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,750
Wait. What kind of doctor are you anyway?

409
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,640
Not really a doctor, more of an amateur pharmacologist.

410
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,570
What about you?

411
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,780
How'd you get to be the savior of the human race?

412
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,070
You really wanna know?

413
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,220
Truth is for a guy who's been wrongly convicted,

414
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,960
I'm actually very civic-minded.

415
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,470
I volunteered.

416
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,490
You got the wrong guy. I didn't do nothin'.

417
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,310
Look, I'm being denied my due process, man!

418
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,510
Come on. Let me go.

419
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,080
I'm innocent, man.

420
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,400
Let me go.

421
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,960
It wasn't easy, but somebody had to do it.

422
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,700
Man, they would have to beat me senseless,

423
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,100
strap me down, before I'd ever let anybody inject me

424
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,450
with a live zombie virus.

425
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,500
Yeah, well it wasn't about me.

426
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,090
You know you do what you got to do.

427
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,630
For the kids...

428
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,820
So you... you got the vaccine

429
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,350
and then you got bitten?

430
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,480
Eight times.

431
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,860
Good God.

432
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:31,890
If you say so.

433
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,760
That must have been horrible.

434
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,890
Must have been.

435
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,310
Luckily I blacked out, so I don't remember any of it.

436
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:43,490
Somehow Hammond rescued me.

437
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,660
Better late than never, I guess.

438
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,100
And been on the run ever since.

439
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,720
Now Hammond's dead, too.

440
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,440
Yep. Good times.

441
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,070
We got some nosey neighbors.

442
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,710
Call the others!

443
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,590
You're attracting them!

444
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,340
Get us out of here!

445
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,320
Shut up!

446
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,360
This is great.

447
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,870
Your friends tank up,

448
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,310
and we take it from them.

449
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,670
There is no we .

450
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,470
I'm not going back.

451
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,690
Not alive.

452
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,660
Why do you keep fighting this?

453
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,450
You know he's never gonna let you go.

454
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,540
I will do whatever I have to do.

455
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,400
You'll do what?!

456
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,840
Tell your new friends who I am?

457
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:35,410
What happens when I tell them what you are?!

458
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,960
No! God!

459
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,660
Good grief, dude.

460
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,590
Murphy, all right.

461
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,190
Murphy. Murphy.

462
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,210
Look at me.

463
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,550
In my eyes.

464
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,200
You're safe in here man.

465
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,800
They can't get you.

466
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,710
Now just try to breathe through it, man.

467
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,280
Breathe.

468
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,260
Right there. Right there.

469
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,790
All right, that's enough. Look, there's only two of them.

470
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,700
Look man, I'm gonna go out there.

471
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,140
I'm gonna draw them away

472
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,720
and I'm gonna mercy them.

473
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,590
Now you just... just chill out.

474
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,780
Why is nothing ever easy?

475
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,650
Okay, follow me boys!

476
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:24,770
Come on!

477
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,840
Fresh meat.

478
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,860
Oh, nice guy.

479
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,440
Did you feel that?

480
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,920
Listen.

481
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,060
Get in the truck!

482
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,780
Come on!

483
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,350
Hey, boy!

484
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,060
Damn it.

485
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,860
Hey, stupid!

486
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,060
You don't want him.

487
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,930
He's all chewed up already.

488
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,260
Come on, friend. Come on.

489
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,170
Raise your chin for your ol' pal Doc.

490
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,890
Hang in there, Murphy! They can't get you!

491
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,920
One thousand fifty eight.

492
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,920
Get them off!

493
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,130
Get them off!

494
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,180
One thousand fifty nine.

495
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:59,920
One thousand sixty! Nice shot, kid!

496
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:01,930
Murphy!

497
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,000
Hey, Roberta.

498
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,810
I can't get this damn hose off.

499
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,730
We got to get going.

500
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,760
Get off! Get off!

501
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,870
Get off!

502
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,830
Is that Murphy?

503
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,150
Unfortunately, yes.

504
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,740
Get out of here. Get out of here! Go!

505
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,420
Come on!

506
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,220
Wait a minute. What are you gonna do?

507
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,860
I got to save Murphy. Come on. Get out of here.

508
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,030
Get out of my way, Travis.

509
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,210
I don't want to have to kill you.

510
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,260
That's not gonna be a problem.

511
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,250
It's time to go home, Sunshine.

512
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,540
You forget.

513
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,110
I'm used to it.

514
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:14,820
Coward!

515
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,630
Shit!

516
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:45,970
No!

517
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,410
No!

518
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,810
No!

519
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,710
Get off of him you bastard!

520
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:11,920
Stop!

521
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,310
You're not gonna kill the only living thing

522
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,730
I've seen in a year!

523
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:34,890
Got to get out of here.

524
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:35,870
No! There's too many! I can't!

525
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,140
- Come on! - You don't understand!

526
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,070
I can't. I can't.

527
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:38,810
I can't.

528
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,990
Yes! It is not the time!

529
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,780
No! No! I can't!

530
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,680
This is gonna explode!

531
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,260
You don't understand! I can't!

532
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,230
This works easier in the movies.

533
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,800
One thousand sixty two.

534
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,920
Come on.

535
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,320
I'm alive?

536
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,130
You're... you're still alive. No way.

537
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,850
You're still alive.

538
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,850
I'm still alive.

539
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,360
Yeah! Yeah, take that Cujo!

540
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,060
That's what I'm talkin' about!

541
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,680
We did it, pup. Me and you, we did it.

542
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,650
We're alive.

543
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,700
We're alive.

544
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,450
It's just you and me, pup. Just you and me.

545
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,520
Okay. I've got beef patty and sloppy joe.

546
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,810
You look like a beef eater to me.

547
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,320
Okay. Here we go.

548
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,610
This is actually one of the best first dates I've ever had.

549
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,130
Here we go. Oh yeah, doesn't that look good?

550
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,750
Whoa. Slow down, dude.

551
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,680
I only have ten year supply.

552
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,540
Dude?

553
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,040
That's not a very good name, is it?

554
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,350
Nah, we can do better than that, can't we? What about "the dude"?

555
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,160
I really like that movie.

556
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,300
No? Yeah, we can come up with something better than that.

557
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,190
Yes. Good boy.

558
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,470
What is that?

559
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,040
Looks like somebody's been playing with matches.

560
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,670
What is that? Is that a refinery?

561
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,540
So did we get the gas?

562
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,980
Great. Who screwed that up?

563
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:57,820
Sorry.

564
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,090
So where's your friend?

565
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:06,720
He didn't make it. And he wasn't my friend.

566
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,860
Hello?

567
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:26,130
Hello. It's me, Citizen Z from Northern Light.

568
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,320
To whom am I speaking?

569
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,330
Sergeant Charlie Garnett.

570
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,300
Excellent.

571
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,600
Good talking to you again sir.

572
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,670
How's it going?

573
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,740
It's going.

574
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,970
Excellent. And the package?

575
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,270
Still alive.

576
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,030
Please tell us where to drop him off.

577
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,890
California.

578
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,840
California? Wait. No.

579
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,800
Hold on. That's not gonna happen.

580
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,470
We need to go some place closer.

581
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,430
Closer?

582
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,670
Sorry Sergeant, but there is no... closer.

583
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,540
Can I speak to someone in charge?

584
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,950
Yeah, copy that. I'm sure they'd like to talk to you too.

585
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,840
But that may be a little problematic.

586
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,140
What do you mean problematic?

587
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,590
More puppies and kittens.

588
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,040
Why can't I speak to somebody at the lab?

589
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:06,850
Well, sir.

590
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,960
What's going on?!

591
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,280
We've lost contact.

592
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,630
Are they even still alive?

593
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,690
I'm working on confirming that, sir.

594
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,920
I've got a screen full of incoming Zs headed your way.

595
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,440
You'd better get moving, Sergeant.

596
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,120
I'll find you. But for now, go west till you hit the ocean.

597
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,110
Hello?

598
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,980
Sergeant Garnett?

599
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,470
Sergeant?

600
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,470
I know.

601
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,490
I know. But they're the only chance we got.

602
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,760
I need some music.

603
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,480
That's a good boy.

604
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:00,880
Look.

605
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,070
Awesome.

606
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,280
Never thought I would see this thing again.

607
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,230
Wait! Here comes the kid!

608
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,110
Found these.

609
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,000
Kid.

610
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,660
You're a god.

611
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:17,870
Yeah well hurry up.

612
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,750
Excuse me, ma'am.

613
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,530
You have a finger in your hair.
